  There is definitely some fuckery about Aenor.

I thought it was obvious foreshadowing that she came from the Black who was too good with memory charms and erased herself from everyone's memory. Which would explain why she is sticking to the Blacks, she is technically one of them.

  From what I understood, Black family members are tasked to do shit by themselves

That part really ruined the story for me. The lethifolds had a death toll roughly a ten times the Blitz (30000 compared to over a quarter of million IIRC) and yet the actual bad part is that the Aurors are suspicious afterwards. I mean, I get giving no quarter to enemies, but that was three times Hiroshima right in the centre of London, not your enemies manor.
