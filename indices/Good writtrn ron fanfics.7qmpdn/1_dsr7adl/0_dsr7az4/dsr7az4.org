  Third installment of the Son of the Archer series. Ron has survived his first year at Hogwarts. But it's never that simple is it? After all, he still has his family he was raised with, and the family he was born to in his life. Add in one of the most egotistical muggle men to grace technology and famous magical author and watch things get out of hand.
