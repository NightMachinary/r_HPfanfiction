Yup, nothing against that (and I LOVE [[https://youtu.be/-xlbvRy2-Kg][this movie]] from my 1980s', also notice the music), but loosing whole community would make a real strain on the Statue of Secrecy. It is hard to explain a vanishing of whole village by a gas leak. Given we have never heard about the calamity like that, gradual storage of missing persons is more probable.
