I still like the idea of pulling a Hamelin piper. That story has something really creepy to it especially that it's based on some real accounts when something happened and a bunch of children disappeared. Hypnotizing rats to throw themselves in a lake and children to walk into a cave kind of also seem to follow the theme.
