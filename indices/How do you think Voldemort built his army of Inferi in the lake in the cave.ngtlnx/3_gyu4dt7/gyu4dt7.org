I'd say it's probably a combination of the bodies of some of those "disappeared" and a bunch of Muggles that, to everyone else's knowledge, just went missing some time in the 70s. It's an easy way to collect "raw materials" - just find some Muggle that's alone, Imperius them to come with you (so you don't have to carry the body), then AK them at the lakeside and turn them into an Inferius. Heck, Tom probably used it as a way to /relax/.
