I always liked the idea that the inferi were there partly as guards, but lately just to put them somewhere. I am not sure Voldemort seriously expected someone go go after his Horcruxes, after all, even if somehow someone found out about them, how would they find that particular cave?

I think that canonical Voldemort used inferi openly during the last war, and maybe he just needed somewhere secure to store them between uses. Perhaps cold water helps preserve them or the lake was specially enchanted.

I think it is implied, and according to the wiki explicitly stated in some of the extra stuff, that he accumulated the body from the various magical and muggle attacks, rather than a single mass murder event.
