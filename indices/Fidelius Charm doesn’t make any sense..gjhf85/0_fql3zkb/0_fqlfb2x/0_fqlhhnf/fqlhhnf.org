That's true, but the other side would have that same revelation: if you were Voldemort looking into the identity of the Potter secret keeper, would you believe Sirius was it? Or would you go look for an associate of the Potters that went into hiding or isn't around anymore?

Maybe I'm just putting too much strategic thinking where there shouldn't be, on any sides: James isn't Moody, he is just a young man right out of school, who of course would pick his best friend---and he does. Voldemort might correctly deduces that or learn of it through spies, and Sirius notices that problem and secretly picks someone else. Then the story itself punishes him for being prudent by making the new secret keeper just happen to be a traitor, because the story needs its inciting incident to happen /somehow/. Plus sweet sweet Drama.
