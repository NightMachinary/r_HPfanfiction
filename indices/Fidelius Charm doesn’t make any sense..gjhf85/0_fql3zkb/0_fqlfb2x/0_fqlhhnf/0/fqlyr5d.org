You know what makes the most sense? Having Lily be the secret keeper. It's not like she was going anywhere and I trust her more than James to not tell anyone. James would tell his friends immediately. If it was me, I would have done the charm and started a food garden. Then I would have stocked up on toiletries because they don't spoil. Then I would have gotten materials to sew, and knit incase of any torn clothing. And of course, things for entertainment. This way the secret isn't leaving the house. I wonder if a baby can be the secret keeper?
