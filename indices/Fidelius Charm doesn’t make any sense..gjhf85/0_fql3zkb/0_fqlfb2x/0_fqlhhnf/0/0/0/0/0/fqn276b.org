Yep, which I attribute to Jo just slipping up and not thinking about the necessary logic in order to get the plot moving, so my headcanon is that one cannot be one's own secret keeper for a Fidelius. The whole point is that you are hiding a secret under a spell, so making something that only /you/ know the secret to under the Fidelius is like having an inside joke with yourself...
