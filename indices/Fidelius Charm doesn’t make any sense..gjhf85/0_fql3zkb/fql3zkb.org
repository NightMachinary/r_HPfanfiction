That's interesting, I never really thought about it, but the best way to break a Fidelius isn't to torture the secret keeper for the information, it's to just kill them and then go after the much wider pool of less badass people that had access to the place. They would presumably break much more easily than the person specifically chosen for this.

Which means nobody should have believed for a second that Sirius was the Potter's secret keeper: what kind of idiot would make someone actively fighting in the war and at risk of dying at any moment their secret keeper. It would make much more sense for it to be some nobody hidden very far away, or at least someone that stayed out of the way---and it was!
