1) Have Sirius buy a house

2) Have James or Lily as the Secret Keeper of that house

3) Have the Potters live in that house

If the only problem was that they actually owned the house that was part of the Secret, then the solution is to just use someone else's house. It would have been way more secure and there's no reason not to do it.
