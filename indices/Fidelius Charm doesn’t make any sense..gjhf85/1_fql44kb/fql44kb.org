I think it makes perfect sense - it only doesn't make sense if you think the Fidelius needs to be some infallible defence.

The fact that killing the secret keeper turns everyone who has been told the secret into secret keepers means that the Fidelius charm has weaknesses/vulnerabilities. But that, to me, is /good/ worldbuilding. The Fidelius Charm /should/ have weaknesses, and there are probably more ways around it that we don't know about.
