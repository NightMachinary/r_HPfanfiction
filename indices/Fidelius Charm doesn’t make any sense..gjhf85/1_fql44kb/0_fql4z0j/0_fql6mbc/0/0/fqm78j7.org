Dumbledore knew Sirius for a whole long while. Lily and James tell him they trust that he'll keep the secret, and he thinks "yeah, that's a good choice." then Sirius betrays them. Dumbledore knew Sirius. He knew he'd never betray his friends, but somehow he did.

Two possibilities therefore exist:

One, Voldemort got to Sirius. Either he turned in secret, which is unlikely given his everything, or he was somehow turned so completely that the secret was forfeit, which is even worse.

Two, the Fidelius is unsafe, and Voldemort found a way to pierce it. Unlikely, since Sirius confessed on the scene to killing them.

What this means is that the Fidelius is generally unsafe. Somehow, its enchanent can be overcome, and Voldemort knows how. Dumbledore cannot beat Voldemort, that much is certain, and he is unsure if his occlumency is strong enough to keep him out of his mind. What this means is that the likeliest possibility is that Voldemort, given the chance, might do the same thing to him which he did to Sirius, and corrupt his mind completely, or somehow tear the secret from his mind like he might've done to Sirius.

Only when it was revealed that the Fidelius isn't as fragile as he thought, when Sirius is cleared in his eyes, does he risk it again. Before that, all he knew was that somehow, Voldemort found a way to break the charm or the secret keeper.
