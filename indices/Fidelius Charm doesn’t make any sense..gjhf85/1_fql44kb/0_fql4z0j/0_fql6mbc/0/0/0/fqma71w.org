This brings up a interesting question. Why wasn't Dumbledore aware Sirius wasn't the secret keeper? Both Dumbledore and Hagrid didn't seem worried when black wanted to take Harry or to borrow his bike. I'm curious why the Potters didn't mention that Sirius is a distraction at the very least. To me the Potters should have mentioned it so if the worse happened Sirius should be able to raise Harry.
