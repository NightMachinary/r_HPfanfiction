We also don't know how the Order was structured in the first war. It could have been isolated cells that knew very little of what the other Order members were tasked with, so the various "branches" weren't in communication for safety reasons.

When Dumbledore reforms the Order, he seems to more or less bring everyone into the fold, even if from Harry's perspective he's kept out of the loop (because he's a child).
