Makes sense. I just thought both Sirius and Hagrid was there almost within the hour. I think Snape went with Voldemort.(at least in the movies) he could have told Dumbledore and Sirius might have had a way to know something happened. If Peter was there as he had Voldemorts wand I think it would make sense someone was with Harry as Peter didn't finish the job or was to scared to.
