Thanks.

Your situation doesn't make sense for two reasons, though:

First, even if Sirius gave the secret to one of Voldemort's spies, that spy would be unable to tell, because Sirius is still the secret keeper. So Voldemort could not have gone himself.

Second, the secret has to be given away through free will. You cannot be tortured into giving it up, coercion doesn't work. In these situations, even the secret keeper becomes unable to reveal it. You have to give it away intentionally, with full knowledge that you are doing it and to whom.
