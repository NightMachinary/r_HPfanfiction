Yeah man, it's almost like it's impossible for Dumbledore to be the secret keeper of his house like how he was with Grimmauld or something!

It only failed the first time because they gave the secret to a fucking Death Eater. Yeah, he wasn't known as one, but your argument flies out the window when you remember he only failed to protect Harry and Fam because they gave it to a traitor instead of a steadfast non-traitor.

Downvotes for being right. Sorry that using half a brain will make you realize almost everything was forced for plot reasons, instead of actual thought. Morons.
