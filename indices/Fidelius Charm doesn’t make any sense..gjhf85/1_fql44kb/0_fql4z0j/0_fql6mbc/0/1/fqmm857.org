  Dumbledore to be the secret keeper of his house like how he was with Grimmauld or something!

Dumbledore would have to trust /someone/. Dumbledore can't raise Harry himself, he's too busy. Same with McGonagall. Hagrid /shouldn't/ raise Harry. And who else is there to trust?

Remember, Sirius Black was thought to be a Death Eater. If you couldn't trust James' best friend, then who? Why should Dumbledore trust anyone available with the task?
