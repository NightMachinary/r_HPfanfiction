I think this makes sense, if we consider that Dumbledore probably wasn't a personal friend of Lily or James, but knew them in more of a managerial type way. He likely knew they Durlsey's wouldn't be great, but thought maybe they would come around but not tell him about magic. Then when they didn't, he would tell himself that Harry was safer there still.

I don't excuse his actions, but he most likely had extremely outdated views on childrearing, given that he was born in 1881.
