So it depends on the wording of the secret being kept? 'James and Lily Potter live at...' stops being relevant once James and Lily are dead, so the fidelius fails.

Wouldn't that make 'The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix is at #12...' fail once the Order stops using Grimmauld after Dumbledore's death?
