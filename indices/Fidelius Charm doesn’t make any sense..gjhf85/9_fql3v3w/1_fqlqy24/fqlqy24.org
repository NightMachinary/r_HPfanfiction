Wasn't the house abandoned, and only Harry could see it because he was in the Fidelius (from when he was a baby), and he had to tell Ron and Hermione the house was there when they visited in DH? Or is that from fanon too?

Anyway, the actual monument was a statue, in Godric's Hollow but in public. And people scribbled notes for Harry....somewhere. The cemetery??? I don't remember.
