Well, you kind of need to know someone else who knows the secret, right?

Like, suppose Sirius is the Secret Keeper but he never actually tells anyone else the Secret except, say, a random muggle he met on holiday in Iceland. Now, killing Sirius doesn't get Voldemort anywhere unless Sirius reveals that Mrs Figg knows the location.

In other words, we might imagine an AU fic where Voldemort breaks down Sirius' door but Sirius commits suicide immediately and the Potters therefore don't get killed. But since no-one knows who the Secret Keeper is the Potters are kind of /too/ well protected.

Of course, this wouldn't happen in practice because that would be very lonely and therefore would tempt the Potters to leave safety. It would also be completely impractical for the purposes of the Order since they need people to be able to get to their HQ. But it does explain Sirius' reasoning and the logic still holds true even if Sirius told more people and some of them were guessable. Voldemort is still faced with the problem that he's got to (a) find someone who /really does/ know the Secret and (b) get it out of them before they, too, die and cause him to start over.

So, yes, this is another flaw in the strength of the Fidelius Charm's protection, but it isn't as big a flaw as it might seem at face value. After all, the big problem with Number 12 was that one of the Secret Keepers was (thought to be) a Death Eater, right? Not that there were heaps of Secret Keepers /per se/.
