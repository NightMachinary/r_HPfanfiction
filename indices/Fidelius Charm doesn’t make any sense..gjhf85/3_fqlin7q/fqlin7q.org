The willing component also seems to go down in importance as it goes along in the series - in Deathly Hallows, when Hermione explains how she thinks they all became Secret Keepers after Dumbledore died, she also says that she took Yaxley in - but she didn't do that willingly, he grabbed on to her when she disapparated. In the same way, a piece of paper with the secret on it can seemingly be used as a blanket reveal - even if the secret keeper didn't mean to reveal it to person X.

So I think 'willingly' has to be reduced down to 'not coerced with mind-spells' - like the imperius or legilimancy seem to be off limits, but anything else can be twisted around to be 'willing'.

To me, a more logical situation with the death of the secret keeper is the degradation of the spell - but that's just how I understand/view it.

In any case, it's pretty clear that JKR set down the rules she needed for PoA, then let the Fidelius hang around in the background, and revised it for what she wanted to happen in the last few books. So the weird disconnect comes from those changes, because it was revised later.
