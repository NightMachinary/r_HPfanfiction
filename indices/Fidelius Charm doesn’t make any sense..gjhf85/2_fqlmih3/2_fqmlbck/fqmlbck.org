There's a potential explanation for this. It could be that you can't be Secret Keeper of the Secret you own. So the Secret here would be that the Potters are hiding at their home. The Potters are the subject of the Secret and the location is their own property.

Then there's Shell Cottage, but that could maybe be explained away with the home being owned by Aunt Muriel rather than Bill and Fleur, so Bill is able to be the Secret Keeper. Or maybe Bill excluded himself so he would still be findable in the location but nobody else could be? Or the Fidelius Charm was improved in the years.
