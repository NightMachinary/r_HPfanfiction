The theory of Bill being able to be Secret Keeper because he didn't own the house holds some merit, but your second theory doesn't seem to. If someone is looking to get to Harry through a Weasley, Bill is the person in the house people will be looking for, so excluding him from the protection isn't helpful. If someone is trying to take out Fleur, all they have to do is find Bill and destroy the house at dinnertime or something similar. Also, the charm protects the secret of the house, not the people. Grimaud Place was hidden even when no one but Kreacher was in it during Sirius' time in Azkaban, and each person that went through the house didn't have to be added to the protection, merely told the secret.
