Ok fair enough, but I'm still not sure how Bill could hide Shell Cottage while leaving himself out. And I guess I don't remember everything canon perfectly (too many headcanons), but the location is definitely hidden, not just the idea. It's not like people could see/find Grimmauld Place just because they weren't looking for the headquarters of the Order of the Pheonix. Clearly JKR wasn't as meticulous about this bit if lore as she was about certain other thing, but it really does seem to hide the whole place, not just the idea of what or where said place is.
