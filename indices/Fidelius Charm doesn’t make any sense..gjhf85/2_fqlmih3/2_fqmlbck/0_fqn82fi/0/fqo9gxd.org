  Grimaud Place was hidden even when no one but Kreacher was in it during Sirius' time in Azkaban

There was no Fidelius on Grimmauld while Sirius was in Azkaban.

All the other stuff was just based on Flitwick's words that Voldemort could place his nose against the Potters window and still not see them. Dunno if it the rest of the text supports such an idea, but there's a little bit that suggests it's the /idea/ that is hidden, not the location itself.

*/The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London./*

This is the Secret in the book. Idk, might be nothing. Probably nothing.
