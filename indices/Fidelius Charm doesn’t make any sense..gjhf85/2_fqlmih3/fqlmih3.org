Obviously it exists as the plot device that JKR needed. However what got me is Why in the world wouldn't you want the Secret Keeper to be one of the people that the Fidelius Charm is protecting? Eg. Make Lily the secret keeper.

The biggest vulnerability of the charm is that it requires you to trust another person who isn't being protected by the charm. Which means mechanics of the charm always risks you being betrayed because you have to rely on someone else.
