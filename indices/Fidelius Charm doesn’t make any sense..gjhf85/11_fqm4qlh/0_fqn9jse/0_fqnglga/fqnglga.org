Sure. Though the story is a Harry/Daphne/Hermione. Spoiler alert for those who want to read the story. And remember it's a weakness that the fic author decided to create.

It seems in this story the Obliviators were sent out over the years roughly 5 times after a plane crash involving magic. Harry realizes that the code they use refers to the Fidelius charm as the magic contributing/causing the crash. He then decides to run a couple of tests with Bill Weasleys help setting the charm. It seems by trial and error Harry sees that the charm is actually the shape of a cylinder around the item/building being protected.

He also finds out that the charm weakens/disappears the further away from the ground you go. So at ground level he finds the edge of the fidelius charm and then climbs up in altitude keeping touch with the charm's boundary. When he can no longer feel the boundary (roughly 1200 feet) he moves "forward" and he can now see what the charm had been protecting.

So he now has a way of finding Fidelius protected deatheater facilities so he can attack them.
