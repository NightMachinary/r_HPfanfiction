There's a fanfic that comes up with "another" vulnerability of the Fidelius charm that I thought was interesting.

He finds out about it after looking at some cryptic paperwork from the Obliviators. Due to this he figures out a flaw in the Fidelius charm. As it's name suggests it's a variation of a time travel story. It's recently been completed ~95K words and is called Dapne's Letter from the Future by TomHRichardson
