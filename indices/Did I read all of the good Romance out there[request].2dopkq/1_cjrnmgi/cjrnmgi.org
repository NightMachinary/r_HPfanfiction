I can only really offer recommendations on HHr, and I notice you've read a lot of the ones I would recommend. I don't know if you've heard of [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction][Portkey]], the biggest HHr archive, so here's a couple from there:

- More of [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/profile/16292][Lorien829]]'s fics, I would recommend Shadow Walks and Eighth

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8392][Harry Potter and the Balm of Time]]. Time-travelling story that is primarily Action/Adventure but also has Romance.

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6048][Harry Potter and the Fifth Element]]. A *long* fic that takes a while to get going but is pretty rewarding to finish.

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6109][Unsung Hero]], also one of the top rated fics on FF.net. AU and Twin-Who-Lived.

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/8073][Coming Back Late]], unfortunately incomplete, but one of the best mostly canon-compatible HHr fics there are. Also found on FF.net but the Portkey one has more chapters.

I'll refrain from more portkey, you can always browse the Top stories list, but the site isn't very well organised.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/769110/chem-prof][Chem Prof]]'s stories on FF.net. He's a great writer but sometimes the romance comes off as if a father wrote it; it's a little too ideal. Still would recommend Notebooks and Letters and possibly the Soul Searching/End Game series.

- I'm sure you've heard of robst on FF.net. He gets a lot of flak on this sub, which I feel is pretty deserved. You could try some of his stories though...

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]]. The sub loves this story and it's one of the best in HHr, though I personally found it to be a little too clich√©d and the story dragged on. Check it out though.

- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/][Lori's]] Paradigm of Uncertainty is one of the cornerstone stories of HHr which I found to be worth a read but unexceptional. Written pre-HBP.

Another website that contains good HHr is livejournal, but it has almost exclusively one-shots and it's hard to find fics on the site. [[https://botherandbother.livejournal.com/910.html][Here]]'s a recommendations page that you may or may not want to look at. I would suggest [[https://chipping.livejournal.com/18415.html][Remember to Floss]], [[https://harryhermione.livejournal.com/1868118.html][One Half of a Happy Ending]], and [[https://corleones.livejournal.com/26629.html][This Veil Across My Heart]] for a taste of LJ's style. [[http://www.livejournal.com/tools/memories.bml?keyword=Harry+Potter+Fic&user=misplacedmoony&sortby=des][This]] is a rec list for general romance fics on LJ.
