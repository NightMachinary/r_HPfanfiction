True there would probably have to be limits if i had to pick preferred limits I would probably go with these three:

The First Limit would be that harry must at first Cosplay the Characters to unlock there powers with him having to wear less and less of the cosplay to use the power the more he uses it till it is a permanent part of him.

Second would a mental bleed over from the character that goes away the more time harry copys that characters powers.like say he cosplays Wolverine he gets a copy wolverines of all his powers including wolverines attitude, skills and instincts(and accent) everything but wolverines actual memory's. and then have the mental bleed over go away over time just like the need to wear the Cosplay does.

Third would be that the less accurate the Cosplay the More of harry stamina it Drains when he first unlocks them. and the More magic the First use of a Character powers costs to unlock. So it would cost Harry more Magic and Stamina to Copy mystiques power than it would Wolverines.
