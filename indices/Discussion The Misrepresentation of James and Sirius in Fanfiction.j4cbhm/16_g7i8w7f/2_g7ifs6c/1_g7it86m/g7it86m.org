I agree that Peter is far too underrated, but that's exactly my point. He outsmarted Sirius at every turn, and was much more effective than people gave him credit for. He was able to appear trustworthy to the Potters and to Sirius, he was able to spy for a year without getting caught, he was able to think quickly on his feet to come up with an impeccable plan after Voldy died, he was able to then elude Sirius for a year and then finally escape narrowly once more, and resurrect Voldemort.

I'm not saying James and Sirius weren't powerful wizards, I'm saying they weren't the phenomenal, brilliant wizards they're made out to be; as for the "thrice defied him" thing, JKR confirmed that one of those times was simply by refusing to join Voldy, which is great and all but doesn't indicate survival in combat.
