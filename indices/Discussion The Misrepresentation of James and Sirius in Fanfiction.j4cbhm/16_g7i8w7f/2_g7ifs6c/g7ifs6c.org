i mean its not like James and Sirius were there to instruct Peter on how to become an animagus, and even then Peter is far too underrated by the fandom, he's a far above average wizard, capable of tricking numerous oblivator squads shortly after Voldemorts death to fake his death and frame his friend.

Its pretty clear from what we know that both James and Sirius were good wizards after graduating from hogwarts, James for instance defying Voldemort three times, heavily indicated that it was surival in combat.
