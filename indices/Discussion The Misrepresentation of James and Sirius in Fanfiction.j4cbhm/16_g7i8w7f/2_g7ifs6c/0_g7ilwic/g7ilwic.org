Yeah the main sentiment here seems to be that Peter did what they did and Peter was /said to be/ bad. What is said isn't what we obviously see with our own two eyes. It's like the phrase actions speak louder than words. Maybe Peter had everybody fooled as an untalented person, as we clearly see him doing extremely complex magic. Would you trust people's testimonies or what you see somebody do with their own eyes? Besides, what is most obvious here is that Peter was said to be bad at /duelling/ - something we never see him do - and transfiguration; the animagus transformation turned out to be mostly potions...

It seems rather obvious to me he was lacking in a few respects but wasn't an overall idiot.
