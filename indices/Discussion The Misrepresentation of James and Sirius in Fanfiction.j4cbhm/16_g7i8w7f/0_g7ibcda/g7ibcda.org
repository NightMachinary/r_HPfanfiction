There are any number of reasons they weren't in the Slug Club. It's entirely possible they simply didn't want to be in the Slug Club, or that Slughorn didn't want them because of their personalities rather than their talents. I can't see Sirius being interested in fancy parties, and inviting known troublemakers and bullies makes for a bad party I would imagine. James and Sirius just aren't around in the story much to say one way or another, and certainly not enough to make as much of an impression as Remus, Snape, or Lily.
