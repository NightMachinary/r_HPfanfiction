Doylist explanation: Rowling has already focused on James for five books prior to HBP, and suddenly remembered Harry had a mother that did more than die for him, so she had to develop her at least the tiniest bit before she did the big reveal in Deathly Hallows. This allowed her to create less of a shock towards why Snape loves her so much, in due accordance with the potions connection as well. Rowling wanted the limelight to shine away from James for a bit.

Watsonian: Maybe Slughorn just didn't like James due to something he had down prior to that. Alternatively, as is with popular theory, old Sluggy had a rivalry with his father. Fleamont Potter being a potioneer that was in the age range as Slughorn, they might have been very competitive, with bad blood. A tamer version of Snape's hatred of Harry.
