I don't know about their brilliance to be honest. They weren't even in the Slug Club, /Lily/ was; every achievement they had (the map, becoming animagi) was shared by Peter, who is supposedly thick-headed and comparable to Neville, and the only people who say they were ~brilliant~ are people looking at them through rose-tinted glasses.

Remus (who can cast a patronus, and who is seen multiple times arguing his case well in front of others), Lily (Slug Club member, Slughorn's favorite, can cast a patronus, /achieved unassisted flight at the age of NINE/), and Severus (can cast a patronus, invents his own spells, rewrites the 6th year textbook in his fifth year, possibly the world's greatest occlumens) are demonstrably bright and talented. James and Sirius, not so much. I'd even go as far as saying Sirius is alarmingly stupid in many of his decisions before and after Azkaban, and while we do see them bragging about how they don't need to study, we don't actually see their test scores.
