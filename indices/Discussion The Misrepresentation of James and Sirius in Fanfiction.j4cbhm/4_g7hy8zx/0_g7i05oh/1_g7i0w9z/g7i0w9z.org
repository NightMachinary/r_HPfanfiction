I would say the fact that Lucius picks out one person who beat Draco implies that he at least did very well. Perhaps not second overall, but among the best.

If he were a good-but-not-great student like Harry, there would probably be more than one muggleborn beating him, or Lucius may have said something like "You should not be content with being in the middle of the pack".
