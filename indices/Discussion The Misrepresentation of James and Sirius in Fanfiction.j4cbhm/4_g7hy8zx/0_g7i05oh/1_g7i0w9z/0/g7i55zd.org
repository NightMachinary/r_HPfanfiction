As I recall, what Lucius said that being a thief might be all that Draco could amount to, if his grades don't pick up.

Draco whined that it wasn't his fault his grades weren't the best in the class because the teachers all had favorites and Hermione was used as an example.

This implies that it's more than just Hermione who's getting better marks than him.

That said, we do see Draco in N.E.W.T level Potions, for which he would have needed an Outstanding had Snape still been the teacher, so he is definitely skilled there, as Snape's favoritism would not have been a factor on the O.W.L exam.

Edit: After Hermione Granger, Draco implies there are other students ahead of him. From what we see in canon, I suspect Ernie MacMillan was one of them, as /Order of the Phoenix/ notes that he considers studying for /seven/ hours to be not enough time.
