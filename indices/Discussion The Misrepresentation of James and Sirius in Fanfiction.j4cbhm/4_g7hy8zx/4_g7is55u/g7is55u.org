Definitely. I come from a wealthy family (not British, but the culture is very similar, and I went to boarding school in England), and there is a very heavy emphasis on academics. At school, my friends and I appeared cool on the surface, but there was /a lot/ of pressure to perform well and parents spent loads of money making sure their children had access to the best tutors and resources.
