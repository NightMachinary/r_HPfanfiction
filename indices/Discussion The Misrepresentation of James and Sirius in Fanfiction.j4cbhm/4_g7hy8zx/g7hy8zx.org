I wonder about this a fair bit, and I think a lot of people are missing a crucial aspect of James and Sirius - they're both from well monied, old families.

If you've spent time around these types of families IRL, their children can be cheeky, or bratty, or bullies, or laddish, or popular - but their families tend to pay a lot of money on tutoring. Tutoring, and a high social value on education as a source of power and social status, which they pass on to kids usually.

Which is interesting, because then you get what seem like jock types (to use the Americanism) who score effortlessly well in academics. Sirius going to live with James eventually, and leaving home during school, would have helped support him staying top of his year effortlessly if they still got tutoring at James' place, or even had access to interesting resources that kept their attention and helped keep them motivated and mischievous.

I always think of this, because JKR very intentionally made some parallels between James and Draco. Draco was second to hermione in the year, and he wasn't known to be studious or nerdy. He probably had access to a library, tutors maybe, and general access to things like sports, trips, and other things that would incidentally educate and keep him interested in magic. So yeah - when I see what you describe in fanfics it makes me realise that JKR made very interesting characters but some parts of them were made subtle; she doesn't batter you over the head with these background facts.
