The ironic thing is that only James is the jock out of both of them; Sirius never even played Quidditch in canon but was the broodier of the two. I hate myself for doing this but breaking it down to the most basic literary tropes, James is the charming, funny friend and Sirius is his broody, dark-but-secretly-humorous-with-a-heart-of-gold best friend. People often wonder how these two are such good friends. Anyway, that's my very simplified take on it.
