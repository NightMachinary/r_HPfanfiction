I have so very many thoughts on Sirius as he's my favourite character but I often say that fanon Sirius is basically how canon James was supposed to be...also reduced to a stereotype. The fact that +Klaus Hargreeves+ Sirius's traits are conflated with James's annoys me to no end. And even then, fanon Sirius isn't even entirely James.
