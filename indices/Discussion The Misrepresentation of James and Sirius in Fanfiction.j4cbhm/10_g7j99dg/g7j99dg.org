I guess laziness is an easier flaw than characterising them as arrogant bullies... main characters are typically likeable and it's easy to like the playful slacker (or the tortured escaped prisoner), but James and Sirius are /mean/... Draco, but competent and popular. Not everyone is a stickler for canon compliance.

I'm also pretty sure a big part of the problem is that we basically live on scraps of information about pretty much everything in those days (other than Snape's relationship with Lilly). And some of it's fairly contradictory. Like, we know that all purebloods are related but we also know that James and Sirius are very distantly related (if at all) and that they didn't know each other before Hogwarts. (Which gets even weirder when we remember that the Blacks tend to look like each other and how familiar Draco and Ron are with who's who. The Marauders were only at school twenty years earlier... that's not a lot of time for that kind of cultural shift.)

Of course, people can just get wrapped up in fanfiction and/or fanon. For my part, I can't think for the life of me where playboy Sirius comes from but it's a trope that's everywhere. I don't even remember why he's usually seen to be straight either (disclaimer: I do not ship Wolfstar... I mean that I literally can't think of any indications about Sirius' sexuality in any direction). If I was to do a Marauder's at school fanfic, it'd rely pretty much entirely on my headcanons... maybe with the occasional reference to HP Wiki... which are informed by some of the fanfics I've read.

That being said, the one that always gets me is the idea that Frank and Alice were friends with (or even substantially similar in age) Lily and James at school. Very common fanfic trope.
