There is the same problem with Peter. In the few fics I have read (not a big fan of the "Maraudeur era", he is often depicted as a complete idiot, more of a follower of the Maraudeurs than a true friend.

But this is not the case at all. In canon, he was chosen as Lily and James Secret Keeper, which makes him their "2nd best choice" after Sirius. Before this, he spied the Order for Voldemort a whole year befer ever being suspected. When Sirius cornered him, he managed to escape while framing him for his crimes. He managed to find Voldemort in Albania, brought him back in Britain and played a vital role in his return. Even as a student, he managed to Master a very difficult branch of Magic while in 5th year, that he did it with help doesn't change the fact that it is very impressive.

Peter is good, maybe not as good as Sirius, James or Snape (who are all extremely talented), but he is still an extremely dangerous wizard who should be able to look down on 80% of Magical Britain.
