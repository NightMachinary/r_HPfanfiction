I think that neither the book nor the movie take pains to showcase Peter's intelligence, but I think it can still be reasonably understood from the text even so. I think that the thing with most fanfiction is that authors are often young or inexperienced enough that they don't take the time to consider what can be reasonably understood but isn't made explicit repeatedly in text.
