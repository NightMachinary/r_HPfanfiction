I even find myself guilty of this, since our source material is so widely known. I assume that readers just know certain things without fleshing them out and that's just bad writing. You can't assume your readers know about spew, for example, because that was only in the books. You can't assume your reader's frame of reference and even though you don't have to rewrite the books every time you write fanfiction, it's better to reiterate the details that are important to your story than to assume that the reader just knows them.
