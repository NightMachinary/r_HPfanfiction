Ron? Yeah, he was an ass, but a lot of his good qualities and scenes are unfortunately book-only. Others were changed to make him look worse ("Your parents are dead. You have no family.") or stupider (instead of Ron, Hermione explaining what a mudblood is, while in the book she had no idea). It happens again and again in the movies.
