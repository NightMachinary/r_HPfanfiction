I think you're right that it does carry a different tone. "Harry's and Hermione's parents are out of the way" is less direct and cold than straight up "Your parents are dead and you're alone in the world, best-friend-of-seven-years." But I think that the book line carries a tone of complete thoughtlessness versus the movie line carrying a tone of lashing out, and I'm not so sure that's better.

Book Ron wasn't an idiot, but he was thoughtless. Movie Ron was pretty much an idiot, but he wasn't mean (except when it came to Hermione). The best Movie Ron can muster at Harry when he's angry is 'piss off' in Goblet of Fire. It leaves that DH scene in the movie with the implication that Ron is being changed by the amulet, whereas the DH scene in the book is left with the implication that the amulet just exacerbates what's already there. I'd personally find it easier to accept that my normally kind friend became cruel when wearing a cursed object, than to accept that my normally thoughtless friend revealed they half forgot a seminal tragedy in my life and thought it was chill to act like I had no skin in the game because of it. One can be blamed on the object entirely, and one can't be.
