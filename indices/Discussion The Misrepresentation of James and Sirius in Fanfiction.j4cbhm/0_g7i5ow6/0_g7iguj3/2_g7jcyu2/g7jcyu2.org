I think people mix up 'cowardly' and 'sniveling' with 'stupid.' As far as we see, Peter is never stupid. He betrays his friends and frames Sirius under Dumbledore's nose with no one the wiser, he avoids detection for twelve years, and then he almost singlehandedly brings Voldemort back to power when he decides that Voldemort is his best option for protection.

He's a weak-willed coward who would prefer to live as a family pet for twelve years than possibly risk his treachery being discovered, he would prefer to sign the death-warrant of his oldest and dearest friends than to risk death himself, and he would prefer to bring a genocidal maniac back to power than risk maybe having no protection if he's ever found again after being discovered. All of these things are cowardly, sniveling, weak-willed things to do, but none of them are stupid. His goal is to stay alive at all costs, and he serves that goal with intelligence and focus.
