I headcanon him as having a child with Marlene and Voldemort basically threatens his family and forces him to join as a spy or his family will die. Eventually his daughter is taken from him as collateral. In a way, I wrote a story about him as being the antithesis to James.

I don't really think the was a "true believer" from how he behaves around Voldemort and such, and there's only one thing I can think of that would make someone go to the ends of the earth for someone he hates and fears-- knowledge about something he loves.
