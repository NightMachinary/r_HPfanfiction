Eh, when you actually look at the graveyard scene in GoF it paints a different picture. He had no problem immediately casting the Killing Curse (which we're told requires intense hatred and intent-to-murder) on command against a random teenager. That kind of proficiency with that kind of magic doesn't just happen out of nowhere for anything even approaching a decent human being.

Also consider that the very first thing he does on getting the silver hand is test out how powerful it is. While fear and survival may have been /part/ of his motivation in joining Voldemort, there was clearly also some desire for power or similar.

It's because of this that I find highly plausible the frequent fanfic depiction that at Hogwarts he tended to encourage the Marauders' crueler sides.
