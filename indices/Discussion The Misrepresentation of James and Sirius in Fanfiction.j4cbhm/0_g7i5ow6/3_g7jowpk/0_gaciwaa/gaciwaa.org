Not to be a nitpicker or anything but did we ever get confirmation that Peter went to the Europe part of Albania? Because AFAIK Albania was a reference to Scotland, From wikipedia:\\
Albania (Scotland)

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba][Alba]], a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goidelic_languages][Gaelic]] name for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland][Scotland]], may be related to the Greek name of Britain [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albion][Albion]], Latinized as /Albania/ during the High Medieval period, and later passed into Middle English as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_(disambiguation][Albany]]). Some recent scholarship has however connected it with one of the early names of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland][Ireland]], "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodla][Fodla]]", which is taken to mean (land of the) "going down" (of the Sun), in contrast to Alba which means (land of the) "rising" (of the Sun). This is consistent with one of the ancient emblems of Scotland consisting of a rising sun crossing the horizon, a symbol laden with much significance.
