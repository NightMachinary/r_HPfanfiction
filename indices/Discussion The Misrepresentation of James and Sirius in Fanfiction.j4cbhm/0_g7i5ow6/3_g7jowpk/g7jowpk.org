  In canon, he was chosen as Lily and James Secret Keeper, which makes him their "2nd best choice" after Sirius
#+end_quote

i do agree peter is smart, but he was chosen because Sirius figured Voldemort would never assume it could be peter

#+begin_quote
  “Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,” Black hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. “I thought it was the perfect plan . . . a bluff. . . . Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they'd use a weak, talentless thing like you. . . . It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.”

  Before this, he spied the Order for Voldemort a whole year befer ever being suspected
#+end_quote

this is the impressive bit, especially keeping it quiet from Dumbledore.

  "Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi," said Dumbledore, smiling. *"An extraordinary achievement -- not least, keeping it quiet from me.*
#+end_quote

being a rat who could spy on order meetings probably helped.

not only that, but peter's record as a DE is insane

in just 2 months wormtail:

- gets voldemorts wand, somehow
- travels through europe
- finds voldemort - even though according to Fudge in PoA, the aurors are still searching for Voldemort.
- brews the potion to turn voldemort into a baby
- gets a cauldron and ingredients in a country he doesnt speak the language
- kills a unicorn, as voldemort says unicorn blood is an ingredient
- subdues bertha jorkins
- carries voldemort with him throughout europe as a baby (!!! how did he do this)
- subdues moody with barty - who has been imperiused for years.
- brews the polyjuice
- brews the resurrection potion
- cuts off his own hand

and after all this shit

voldemort just goes "yes i think i will send you to make drinks for snape."

  "I am not your servant!" he squeaked, avoiding Snape's eye.

  "Really? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me. "

  "To assist, yes--but not to make you drinks and--and clean your house!"

  Peter is good, maybe not as good as Sirius, James or Snape (who are all extremely talented), but he is still an extremely dangerous wizard who should be able to look down on 80% of Magical Britain.
