My head cannon is that Peter is pretty good at Potions. There is no indication that the other Marauders are brilliant at it, and a specific, probably complicated potion is needed for the Animagus transformation. I always liked the idea that Peter was the one to brew it, and he was a really good potioneer, but he was clearly overshadowed by Snape and Lily. Giving him a bigger inferiority complex, since the area he excels at doesn't bring him much recognition since he unfortunately shares a class with two extraordinary potion makers. What sparked this idea was the "potion" he makes to give Voldemort back his body, that was probably not easy, and Voldemort couldn't really help.
