Totally agree. McGonagall in PoA describes him as hero-worshipping James and Sirius - that time me doesn't ring as an equal friend. I can see their egos enjoying having someone who isn't as brilliant and charismatic as them, and him being a follower, but that doesn't mean they don't consider him a friend.

My head canon is that James and Sirius are the besties, Peter follows but is genuinely funny and provides comic relief, and Remus they kind of look after a bit and definitely don't listen to when he tries to rein the mischief - but that doesn't mean any of them aren't considered proper friends. Considering they have some big secrets between them, they're going to have that bond anyway even if they bring different things to the table.
