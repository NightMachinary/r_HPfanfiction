I think most of the bad characterizations the Marauders get come from people who, like Canon Snape, were never able to see that they grew up from their school days or that they had redeemable qualities (they weren't universally hated). And they let Snape's bias color their fics. So they get a lot of negative traits and often villainized by writers.
