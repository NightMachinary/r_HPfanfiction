In GoF, while he is half breaking the Imperius Curse and losing his mind, Crouch Sr thinks he is in the past and mentions how proud he is of his son, who got 12 O's on his OWLs.

And while I can't remember where it is in the books, I'm pretty sure that Percy Weasley also got 12 O's, just like his brother Bill. How they managed this exploit without a Time Turner is never mentioned though.
