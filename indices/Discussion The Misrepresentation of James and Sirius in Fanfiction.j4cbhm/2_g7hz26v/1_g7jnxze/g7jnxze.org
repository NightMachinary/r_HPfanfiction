  ‘Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who cares about them?' he said happily to Harry. ‘Here -- swap --'

  HARRY JAMES POTTER HAS ACHIEVED:

  Astronomy A

  Care of Magical Creatures E

  Charms E

  Defence Against the Dark Arts O

  Divination P

  Herbology E

  History of Magic D

  Potions E

Flitwick might have the same criteria

  ‘I'm sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T. class. I see that you have an “Exceeds Expectations” in Charms, however -- why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?'

So Ron must have gotten
