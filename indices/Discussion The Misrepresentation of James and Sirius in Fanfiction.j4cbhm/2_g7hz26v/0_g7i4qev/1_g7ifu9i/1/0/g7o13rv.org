which is why i kinda dislike how the stories progress since instead of having Harry and co outmanuvering death eaters left and right, its basically set up to a choice where he essentailly commits suicide, all by the plot of Dumbledore.

Story basically have the biggest prodigy that worked hard af for over 50+ years be defeated by rules that are established at the climax of the story, not by legit skill by his opponents
