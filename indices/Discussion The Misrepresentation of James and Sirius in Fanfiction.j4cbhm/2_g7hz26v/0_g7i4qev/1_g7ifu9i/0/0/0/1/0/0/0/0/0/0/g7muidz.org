I would think it would be more magically draining to constantly cast large crowd control spells. There are also only so many wizards and witches you can imperious but you can make inferi out of dead muggles which allows the supply of cannon fodder to be insanely high. Just wait outside the wards and keep sending in waves. They will either exhaust themselves or run out of supplies. Maybe mix in some wizards under the imperious in the army so that they have to be careful what they kill. If inferi can be controlled to not kill them since I don't know if they can canonically.
