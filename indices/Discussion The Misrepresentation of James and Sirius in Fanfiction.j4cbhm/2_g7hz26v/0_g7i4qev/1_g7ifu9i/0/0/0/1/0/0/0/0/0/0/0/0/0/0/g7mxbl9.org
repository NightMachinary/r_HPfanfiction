That's a good point I didn't think about that. Just send more people that will force them to run out of supplies faster and leave inferi at all the other exits of hogwarts. No supplies getting in or out and the only way out is through Voldemort. We already know he can cast fiendfyre so he could just wait for them to get on the bridge and then burn them all.
