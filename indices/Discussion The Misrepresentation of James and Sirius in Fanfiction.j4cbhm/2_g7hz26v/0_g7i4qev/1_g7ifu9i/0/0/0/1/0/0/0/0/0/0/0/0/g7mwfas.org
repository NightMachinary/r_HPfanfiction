I mean then he could just delay the siege and wait outside the wards. Make another army of inferi to add on top of the one he had at the horcrux cave and then attack. It's not like he was really on a timer here. Voldemort just rushed it and look where that got him. The only issue I see with the imperious idea is that he is kinda just giving the other side more wizards as if they are subdued non-lethally they won't be fighting for Voldemort anymore
