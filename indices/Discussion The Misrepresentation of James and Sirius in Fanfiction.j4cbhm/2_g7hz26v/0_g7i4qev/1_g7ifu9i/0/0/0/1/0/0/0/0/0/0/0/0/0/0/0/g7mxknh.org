the problem is the tunnel to hogsmede but I am sure the death eaters will learn about that.

the thing is we know you cant use magic to create food but you can use it to extend the food you already have

the question is there a limit too that and is there spells to keep food fresher, because the siege could last for a decade or so

but what does that matter voldemort is immortal
