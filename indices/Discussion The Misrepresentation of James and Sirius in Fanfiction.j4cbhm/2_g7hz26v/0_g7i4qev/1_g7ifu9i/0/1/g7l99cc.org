Managing a Patronus at age 13 and chasing away hundreds of dementors.

Throwing of the imperius, one of them cast by the "most dangerous dark wizard of all time" at age 14.

Surviving a tournament that killed many older students in previous years.

Teaching a group of teens so they survived not one but two attacks from Voldemorts most dangerous followers before most of them reach maturity.
