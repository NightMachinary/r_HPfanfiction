"Yet in almost every single Marauders fanfic I've read, James and Sirius are always portrayed as lazy idiots who need Remus to get them through their exams."

This is exactly how writers portray Harry and Ron in relation to Hermione too, and in both instances it's so far from the truth and very annoying to read. James and Sirius are described as brilliant and talented even more frequently than Remus, and quite possibly going beyond Hermione's level as well, considering the Map and the complex magic behind it.
