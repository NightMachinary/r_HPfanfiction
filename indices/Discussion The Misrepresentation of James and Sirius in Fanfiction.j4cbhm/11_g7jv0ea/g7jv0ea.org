A really brilliant teenager can be lazy. Think the Weasley twins: both brilliant, both push magic far beyond the Hogwarts curriculum for their age, neither is known as an academic prodigy and both are troublemakers.

Simply put, such teenagers aren't challenged by the school's content, so they just skim through homework and lessons.
