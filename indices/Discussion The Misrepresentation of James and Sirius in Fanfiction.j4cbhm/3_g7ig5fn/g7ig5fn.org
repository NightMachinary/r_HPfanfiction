One of my biggest petpeeves in Marauder era fanfics is they always give Sirius and James /Terrable/ table manners, Sirius is a Black one of the sacered 28 raised by /Wallburgur Black/, do you honestly think that his table manners and posture would be /anything less than perfect!?/ Sirius' table manners would have been /beaten/ into him for as long as he could hold a fork, his idea of rebelling would have been eating dinner with a salad fork! Don't you /dare/ give him anything less than /absolute perfection/ with his manners.
