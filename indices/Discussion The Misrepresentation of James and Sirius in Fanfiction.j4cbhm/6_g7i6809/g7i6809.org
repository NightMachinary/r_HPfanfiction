Well said!

Personally, I think this might be because a lot of people who write marauders era really like Remus, and that's why he consciously or subconsciously gets powered up, which means everyone around him needs to be taken down a notch. This has led to a lot of really good, in depth portrayals of Remus, which are fascinating to read, but those stories rarely feature the James or Sirius we see in the books. Might also be closer to the film portrayals of them all, and same with Snape?
