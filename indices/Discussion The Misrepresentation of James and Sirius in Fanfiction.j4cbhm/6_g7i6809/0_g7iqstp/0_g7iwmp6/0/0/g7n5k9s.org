Ah well I've got quite niche taste nowadays, but thanks for asking :) I seem to grow pickier after every fic I read so I don't know how much stock you should put in my recommendations.

Like many people here and elsewhere I'm very fond of theDivineComedian, on ffn and ao3. Remus is, I think it's fair to say, a favourite of this author as well but his portrayal is very believable I find. The Age of Lies describes all of the marauders well. What's unusual about this author is the quality of the stories and the plots and the atmosphere they manage to create, and their take on canon dark creatures and potions.

I saw that Anthem for Doomed Youth was already recommended further up in this thread, and I would second that recommendation. LucyInTheSkye is the author of that, I think only on AO3. They have one more long story that's really good. I think here, the plot is decent and it's jam-packed with funny details, but the characters are what make their stuff excellent, the marauders really feel like real people you might have known in a previous life. Also it's a refreshing take on young people partying and dating and getting into trouble, comparing it to what I remember of my teens it hits a rare note of authenticity.

For a third author I would go with lyin, also on AO3. Glass of Water is really popular and has a great Lily, but my fave stuff from that author is a short series of fics from the first wizarding war when they're out of school. It's also a great use of Dirk Cresswell, I don't think I've seen him used much elsewhere.
