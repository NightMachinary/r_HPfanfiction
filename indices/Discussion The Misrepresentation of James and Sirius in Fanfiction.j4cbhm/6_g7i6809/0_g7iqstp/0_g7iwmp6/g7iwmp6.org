Yeah fair enough! Agree about Tonks and Teddy, maybe more on the fence about keeping in touch with Harry. I think it would've made sense for him to get in touch once Harry started Hogwarts, but I think it's in keeping with his character that he didn't.

I used to be mostly indifferent to him, but nowadays I quite like him with all of his flaws (less so when he's made into the smartest guy in the room). I am one of those people who prefer marauders era fanfiction over anything else, and there are a lot of ones that focus on Remus's character, presumably because he, with a bit of stage diection and the right lighting, makes for an excellent tragic hero. But he definitely loses his charm if you try to explain away his flaws, in particular his cowardice which is such a big point in the books.
