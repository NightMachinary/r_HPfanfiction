I couldn't agree more. I mean i had posted a similar post in the sub but it focused on Sirius and Ron and it was more about there overall character than their study talent but still the point is same, how badly the authors right them.

Sirius Black was an extremely talented wizard with a dark sense of humor not a idiot who acts without thinking. Yeah he did that a few times but it was desperation and while we don't know much about James anyone who had read the books can vouch that he was an extremely talented man who was arrogant but not lazy.
