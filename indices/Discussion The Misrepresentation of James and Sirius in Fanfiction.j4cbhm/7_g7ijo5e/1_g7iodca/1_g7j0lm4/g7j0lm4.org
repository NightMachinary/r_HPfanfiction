The Patronus Charm is definitely hard to cast. When Lupin is teaching it to Harry he describes it as "ridiculously advanced." It's specifically stated to be beyond N.E.W.T level magic, which means it's complexity is far beyond the scope of anything taught on the Hogwarts curriculum.

Additionally, Harry's Patronus isn't just impressive because it's corporeal, but because it's incredible powerful. At the end of Deathly Hallows, Harry is able to create a Patronus which dispels a group of Dementors that 6 other members of the D.A can barely hold back with their combined Patronus Charms.
