Well, perhaps, but just because it's not on the syllabus doesn't necessarily mean it's that objectively difficult, it might just not be thought of as relevant. Just like how in our world, not everyone is taught e.g. bear safety or how to kill lions and tigers, when you live somewhere where it's vanishingly unlikely you'd encounter one.

There's also the fact that Hogwarts had an ever-changing DADA staff, so this could also be a reason why most students didn't develop good practical DADA skills.

I never know how much stock I put in magical /power/ per se, because it's so fluid in how its presented and represented. Given that the Patronus comes from confidence and belief - hope, even - I guess I always took Harry being able to have a particularly strong one more as a thematic indicator of /who/ Harry is as a person more than /how strong, magically/ Harry is compared to other students.
