I think it's because JKR is very inconsistent with power levels. Just think of Patronus -- first it is said most adult wizards and witches have problems casting it and then Harry successfully teaches a bunch of teenagers how to cast a corporeal Patronus in a few months (if not weeks). In the end it's hard to decipher what's (and who're) supposed to be advanced and what's (who're) not.

And frankly, there's either too many ‘brilliant' characters or ‘brilliant' is an exaggeration and they're all just above average.

Marauders -- the map, became animagi at fifteen; Snape -- potion genius, said to know more about Dark Magic as first year than seventh years, created highly useful spells while student; Lily -- though I don't think being a part of Slug Club reflects someone's academic/magical achievements accurately, she's also often described as brilliant ; Twins -- created a huge variety of original products, not just jocks but also things useful in war, all while students; Bill, Percy, Barty Crouch Jnr -- all got 12 OWLs; Death Eaters in general seem to be able to match aurors who are basically wizarding special forces.

Additionally, in fanfiction authors tend to take those ‘brilliant' characters and make them good at absolutely everything. Plus add to them those we don't have much reliable information on but who are generally considered smart/powerful/talented by fandom -- Bella, Draco, Dolohov often described as Charm Master or something similar, then there's Theo Nott and Daphne in Slytherin fics or Regulus and Lucius if it's Marauders era. In the end we're left with a crowd of geniuses, to the point where you're sorry to the rest of the kids who goes in school with them.

I think the best way to go about it is to use ‘Neville route'. Neville was very good at herbology and not very good at everything else. So instead of making everyone prodigies why not say James and Sirius were very talented in Transfiguration and were average in Potions and sucked at Astronomy? Why not make Snape a genius when it comes to Potions, average in DADA and struggling in Transfiguration?
