I've read a time traveling fic where Harry (or was it Hermione?) questioned Snape about sectumsempra. And Lily was like â€˜oh, it was me who came up with it' and then proceed to act all offended that they would think so bad of her and Snape because /originally/ they created it to cut hard ingredients for potions.
