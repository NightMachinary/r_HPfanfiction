The author did say she considers refusing his offer one, but we don't know why exactly and under what circumstances he wanted them. And to be fair, Remus marrying Tonks required Voldemort to open up the topic himself, so marrying a muggleborn could be seen as defiance, especially as James was the last pure-blood in an influential family. It depends on how broad it is. It obviously isn't as silly as a sugar quill...but it also isn't like stepping toe to toe with him. Arresting a henchman is also considered one of the ways and thwarting him. They'd could've been spying as a close person in disguise as the Malfoys, for example, and he later knew about it. Nothing stellar and may seem irrelevant but could have greater consequences.
