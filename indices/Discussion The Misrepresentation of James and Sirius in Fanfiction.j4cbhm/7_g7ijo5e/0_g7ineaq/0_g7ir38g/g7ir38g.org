I completely agree that Lily is overhyped. People tend to write her like Hermione 2.0 only without any Hermione's flaws, I've seen her literally described as the Brightest Witch of Her Age. There's also a lot of fics where she's absolutely on par with Snape in potions, contributed to the spells in HBP book and on top of that all is a super talented duelist.
