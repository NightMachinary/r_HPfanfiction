Regarding to Lily my guess is that this is done as a way of fixing cannon explanation for Harry survival. The explanation given about the power of love is seen by many (myself included) as both lame and absurd (it would logically have happened much before), so the way many authors find to solve it is by making it so instead of a flimsy and vague accidental quick of magic it was a deliberate masterpiece achieved through sheer brilliance that not even Dumbledore knew for sure how to replicate. Problem is that to have her managing it basically just out of Hogwarts she would need to be a Naruto-style genius (mastering incredibly advanced techniques while still on diapers, having partial omniscience to the point of knowing extremely obscure and forgotten lore that no one else has any inking to, managing to defeat and kill opponents that by all rights should have been able to wipe the floor with them...), alternatively she can be made to be a savant at one specific area that lets her manage that feat while being average at the rest, but this generally offers far less potential to work with.
