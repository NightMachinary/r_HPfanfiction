  Lily, she's also often described as brilliant

Eh, she's overhyped for sure. The only people that really see describe her is one professor - Slughorn, only in regard to potions. If memory serves me right, Francis the Fish is movie canon, not books. The other one is Hagrid, who's the original hype man. We get zero achievements from her in her scholarly career other than apparently being Head Girl, with no motive to it. She obviously had a good standing in academics but that doesn't imply anything stellar like Hermione. Otherwise, she had control of her magic when young, albeit on a less powerful scale than Riddle.

Now contrast this knowledge to what has already been said about Sirius (who's also described as talented by Slughorn, his potions professor) and James. In fanfiction, she's often portrayed as this brilliant generalist who's published in research at eighteen, much like Dumbledore as she simultaneously guides Sirius and James when they try to cast a simple summoning charm. Her talent is blown out of proportion when likely she was on par with Tonks or Cedric Diggory or some other talented student who's better than most in their year, but nothing stellar. Think of Harry had he been dedicated to studying, something similar I feel.

In the same vein is Regulus Black. The bloke was obviously extremely intelligent to be able to figure out that the locket was a horcrux, that denotes intelligence that's mightily above average, and a hint of curiosity. However, why does this also immediately translate to 'would wipe the floor with anybody in a fight'? Or worse, 'he could give Voldemort a run for his money'. He could've just been well versed in history, dark magic and a bit of defense to get where he was at when he died.
