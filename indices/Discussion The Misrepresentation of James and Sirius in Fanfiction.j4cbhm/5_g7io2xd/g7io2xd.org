I agree; but I think it's probably due to a combination of 1) reverting to genre conventions; if Remus is the 'good' boy (Prefect, dramatic irony with the werewolf) and Sirius the 'bad', and James closer to Sirius, then James must trend the same way & that way must be opposite to everything Remus is, and 2) the canonical example of Fred and George who as adults are described as brilliant inventors but who weren't known for their academics.
