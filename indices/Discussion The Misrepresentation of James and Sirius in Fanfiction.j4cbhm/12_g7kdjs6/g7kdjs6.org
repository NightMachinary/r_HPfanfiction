There is a large chance they haven't read the books. The movies don't really cover this aspect. Or at least I don't remember them covering it. All I can't remember was they were great aurors and James was great at transfiguration and they were douche bags to Snape. Personally, i haven't read the books, so I always saw them as jocks, maybe not dumb jocks but still jocks. If u haven't read the books and only have the movies to go on it is entirely reasonable to assume they are any number of things because of the lack of covering the characters in them.
