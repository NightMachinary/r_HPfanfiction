I'm not usually a fan of deep political intrigue but I got sucked into Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law, which was posted here awhile back.

Then a friend suggested Five Days, which is Dramione and not really my ship, but I really loved the suspense and realism of their situation. It was really claustrophobic and there were some really gross descriptions of infection though.

Finally, I read Grumpy Old Wizards which involved senior citizen Hermione and Draco and Severus and was adorable.

If I comment on a fic, it's because I enjoyed it. If I don't, I just carry on and keep reading other stuff.

I do adore good Snamione though. But when it's bad, it's absolutely horrid.
