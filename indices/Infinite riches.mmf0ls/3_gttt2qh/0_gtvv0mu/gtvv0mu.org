the thing is that in the HP universe, I'm pretty sure it's canon that not only does every thing you do end up with the same ending, I.E no matter what you do there will be a galleon on that table, but if you do things that can't end up with that, time will straight erase you from existence (I'm pretty sure that's covered in PoA though it may just be a conversation of "you'll kill yourself" which I'm remembering wrong)
