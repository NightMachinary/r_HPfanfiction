This is a very confusing thought. If i take a galleon from a table at 8 o'clock, go back in time 1 hour, and pocket that galleon at 7 o'clock I would have two gallons.

However say I wanted to see what my past self would do so I hang around the table hiding untill 8 o'clock. Now at this point my past self should have picked the galleon up, and went back in time. BUT THE GALLEON ISN'T THERE!! So my past self decides not to go back in time creating two different versions of me, one is 1h older than the other and I (the one that did time travel) has to hide his entire life from his younger twin.

The second scenario is me tanking a galleon from a table, going back in time and leaving it on the table for my past self to find. He does and pickes up both galleons and goes back in time, but i'm now lacking a galleon. Meanwhile back in the from 7:00 to 8:00 there is an exponentially increasing pile of money from all the time traveling and OH MY GOD THIS IS THE REASON TIME IS LINEAR!!!

Conclusion. You can't use a time turner for anything else other than taking extra clases and saving your godfathers from soul sucking horrors.

THE END!
