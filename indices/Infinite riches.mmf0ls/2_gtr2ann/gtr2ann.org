The first thing that stands out to me is that it's the same amount of money being taken and added. Perhaps I should presume the money is in the past when you arrive meaning you double your vaults worth. I suppose it's feasible. Of course you got make sure to not meet yourself coming and going.

You also need to somehow deal with the goblins. Bankers always want to know where your money comes from. Then you have to deal with being poor bc future you took the money to the past. In the past the money accumulates but you have to take the money back in time to do that. Never leaving any money in the future.
