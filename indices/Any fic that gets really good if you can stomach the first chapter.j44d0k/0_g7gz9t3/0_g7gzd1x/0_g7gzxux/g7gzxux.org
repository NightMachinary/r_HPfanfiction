The Venom Peddler iirc was pretty good in the first couple chapters, then got very slow for several chapters so that I almost stopped reading, but then picked up so it was pretty good almost til the end. The ending (last few pages) was disappointing but fixable if the author ever revises the story. There were a lot of typos too, but those don't bother me too much.
