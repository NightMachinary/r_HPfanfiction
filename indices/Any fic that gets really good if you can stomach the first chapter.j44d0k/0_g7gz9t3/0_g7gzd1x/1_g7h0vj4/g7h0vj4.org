Also there is some wannabe pureblood-fic enforcer around here who downvotes any post mentioning HPMOR, but it has its own fandom so some people obviously like it. All I can say to that person if you're not into it, that's fine, just read something else and let others decide for themselves.

The author's note at the beginning says to hold out for 10 chapters or so (out of 120) before giving up. I'd say the writing settles down after maybe 20 chapters. There is lots of pure cringe in the first 10, and then occasional pockets of it through the rest of the book. There are structural rationalizations of this but I think the real reason is that the author wasn't that experienced at long fiction when he started, and got to be more skillful as the book progressed.

It is not for everyone. It has many deficiencies that are rightly called to task here. So it just depends on how big a deal those particular ones are for you.
