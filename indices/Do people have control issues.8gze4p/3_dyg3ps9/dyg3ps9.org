No, manipulative Dumbledore (not at the scale it happens in many fanfictions!) is more or less canon!

Dumbledore is not the kindly grandfather he passes himself of as! Sure he mellowed some with age and started forgiving stuff like murder (which makes him a very bad leader in war, since his troops die while the DEs they stunned are revived and able to continue the fight!), but over all:

He is a master manipulator and a politician! He could have been a Darklord, if his dumb brother (sorry, I don't like Abe Dumbledore at all!) hadn't started a fight (nobody is sure whose spell killed Adriana, but fact is: Her death derailed Dumbledore, but he didn't do a total 180 about face!)
