Manipulative Dumbledore: People noticed how ridiculous the Dursleys having Harry dumped on their doorstep was. Then we were told Dumbledore knew ahead of time it'd be a shit hole. Then we get to Hogwarts where, in the very first book, Ron speculates that Dumbledore intended for them to stop Voldemort all along. Deathly Hallows completes this by having Dumbledore, er, /predict/ how characters would react after he died (this is at least understandable without requiring ill intent).

Indy!Harry: People like wish fulfillment so they want him to take total control of his life so other things become possible in their stories ("Time to spend a summer running and using Occlumency to become stronger than Riddle!")
