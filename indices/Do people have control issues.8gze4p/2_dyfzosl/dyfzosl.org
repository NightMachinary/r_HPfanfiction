It happens when people don't understand that JKR used characters as plot devices. Dumbledore did and didn't do everything so the plot would happen. Trying to make sense of it in-character leads to manipulative/senile/evil Dumbledore, or to some convoluted headcanon that makes needs tons of fanon to explain why "Dumbledore couldn't have done anything (else)".
