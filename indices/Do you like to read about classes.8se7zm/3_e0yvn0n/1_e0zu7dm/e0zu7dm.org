Well I plan on going somewhat in-depth in classes. However the classes are going to be more of different types of reliefs. Like Comedic relief, building towards certain alliances between people, showing how harry grows into knowledge. This isn't HBP compliant. This is Dumbledore going into strict war-mode. All classes fifth year and up will be based upon whats needed to make the students protected and able to both fight and defend themselves in the war and fight. The classes will be covering what is needed for survival, both defensively and offensively, and on a normal every day life basis as well. There's no nonsense of 'but they're just children, let them throw dances, and go to hogsmeade and have sweets'.

The fic is going to have dark points so I thought some comedic relief from some classes at points would be good as well. Like the first Care of Magical Creatures class Hagrid is teaching about Phoenixes. Borrows Fawkes. Fawkes ends up at the Hufflepuff dinner table surrounded by students dressing him in fancy vests and robes and costumes as he struts along.

It's a Romance/Adventure, though maybe more Romance/Action or Romance/Horror. I'm not sure which applies yet.

you've given me food for thought thanks!
