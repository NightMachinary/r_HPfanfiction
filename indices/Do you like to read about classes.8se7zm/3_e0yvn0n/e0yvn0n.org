Ask yourself this before you include ANYTHING in a story: is this scene necessary?

Will having classes shown advance your plot, help to develop the world you are setting up? Or is it just padding to fill up space and time before you get to other things?

I don't know the answer, but you should ask yourself this question before you include anything in a fic. Does a romance fic really need intricate details of 3rd year transfiguration?
