Very much... provided it doesn't sound like nonsense. There's broadly two preferable ways to handle classes:

-Do like canon did and imply there's real depth to the subject which is mostly hinted at. Mostly restrict to seeing the characters in the action-y bits. Reading, theory lectures and such mostly summarized and mentioned.

-Go in depth on the subject, but you actually need to make it sound reasonable and cohesive. This is difficult and requires real forethought in terms of how it meshes with the broader world you intend to write (e.g. is it a system that is easily abusable and therefore broken? If so, having no one exploit it is completely stupid) and in the class progressing like in a real curriculum (e.g. being age appropriate and broken up into sensible, related chunks).
