I really like when people use the classes as a way of expanding the magical world or changing it - but only if it's important to the story.

While it's sometimes interesting to read a detailed article about the effects of draught of the living dead, I don't enjoy seeing half of the chapter dedicated to doing so unless the information will play a part in the fic later on.

However, this is your fic, so you should do whatever you feels right.
