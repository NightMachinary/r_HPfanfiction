I think that, as a large part of Harry Potter is a story about school life, that skipping writing about classes is a massive cop-out. That is a huge chunk of his school experience, and I don't agree with missing it out. I agree with the others who advise not to rehash canon. If you have specific ideas for magical theory, classes are the perfect place to introduce new ideas. They also can help to give the characters new tools, drop new information about people or places (Binns and the Chamber of Secrets, every Defence class ever, etc).

If you're more interested in social rather than magical aspects, notes can be passed in class, there are whispered conversations, romantic tension can be created when characters are unexpectedly working together, and more!
