If the concepts of the classes are explored more in depth then yes.

Like if all it says and on Tuesday we studied Futhark runes suwilho to fe. Then Friday hagall to kaun... NO.

Or if its just words that don't mean anything like The oscillating pinequills bequethe vehemency into stewed eye of newt, but only if counter clockwise serpentine strokes are iterrated every 18 seconds. Then no.

But if it goes into detail like Todays class we will grow our focus by transfiguring a pencil. YOu will start with just the lead then surround it by wood and finally top off the eraser. This allows you control and provided good opportunities to actually understand different materials. then sure.
