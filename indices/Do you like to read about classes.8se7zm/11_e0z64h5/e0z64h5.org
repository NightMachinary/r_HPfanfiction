On the whole, yes. Is your fic canon-compliant? If so, bringing up lesson content that was not mentioned in the books would be great. Being in-depth is fine. Unless its as complex as the arithmancy principles in The Legacy. That left me wondering what the hell was going on.

If the fic is not compliant, introducing different classes e.g. spell-crafting in Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived would help in world-building.
