Discussions with the teachers about anything and everything (good for world-building IMHO - the nature of dark-magic is a great topic (if your fanfiction has such magic and not just well magic and the intent behind it, because frankly you can kill with first year spells just as easily as with the Avada Kedavra, the later is just a little faster and in fights it ignores shields!)) and other kinds of magic (Britain has the animagus transformation, but who is to say that native American shamans don't have something similar but for multiple animals etc.) that aren't normally shown in Britain (how would you inspire kids in a world of magic? Talk about magic they haven't seen before IMHO!)
