For me it depends on how many classes, and how indepth we're talking.

No, I definitely don't want a story to be primarily classes. That said, I'm not at all adverse to having a fic expand and clarify magic. It's really important that it be reasonable and consistent.

Anyways, I'm a sucker for romance fics of certain pairings. Care to link yours?
