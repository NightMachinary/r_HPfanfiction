Its not up yet! I like to do a good outlining. I alreay have the main plot planned, and how it ends and begins, and the major things that need to happen and the most major scene in the fic written. Now I'm outlining the chapters one by one, and doing research into them.

But when it is up I'll gladly link you, not many people care for Snarry though.

As for classes this is Dumbledore in full on war-mode. All classes fifth year and Up are going to be teaching them the spells, potions, etc. needed to win the war. Both defensively and offensively. He's basically raising soldiers in a school. Not so he can use them as an army but merely because he wants to prepare them for what they most likely will face and doesn't want them to be ill-prepared and die. So it'll be quite serious but it's not going to be like uh let's say History-of-Magic in the canon world is haha. It's going to be a bit of an explanation, some discussion, demonstration and a practical. Depending on the subject etc. Potions is going to be more independent study after a few lessons.
