The summary focuses in the similarities to the cliche genre of "wrong Boy-Who-Lived" instead of the differences, is what I'm saying. It's also only true for the first couple chapters of the story, Harry spends the vast majority of the time away from his family (he also spends most of the story not being a dark wizard and instead only trying to excel in a different school, but at least that's marginally more interesting).

You're probably not looking at it from the perspective of someone that hasn't read it. I'm not a writer myself, but if I had to write a summary I'd focus on how this Harry's personality is different from the usual, and not his initial circumstances. Something like "Harry Potter decides against his parents and brother's wishes that Hogwarts is not the place for him. Follow Harry as he attempts to tell friend from deadly foe in Durmstrang Institute's ruthless environment, and above all find a real challenge." That fits the character limit, I think.
