I actually think it contains all the relevant information. We know Lily and James are alive, we know Harry has a brother, we know he is not the BWL and that he will be a dark wizard, and that the story is about how and why he became one. I think that tells us far more about the story than any summary concentrating on Durmstrang (or whatever else you think the relevant part is) ever could.
