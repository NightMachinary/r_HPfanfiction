/Bungle in the Jungle/ and sequel were good for their time, with many novel aspects that hadn't been seen elsewhere (spell chaining, a fresh take on the Animagus transformation, a far larger Harry Potter world, and many notable OCs), but I agree that like nearly all "Indy!Harry" tales from that era, they haven't aged well. Also, for all his interesting ideas, jbern was a decidedly less capable writer technically back when he wrote the stories.

I will say that I enjoyed them a lot more than I thought I would given the summary.
