[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] has

"Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. DARK and NOT for children. fem!bisexual!Harry, minor fem!Harry/Viktor, eventual fem!Harry/Luna, powerful!Harry, James and Lily are alive, twin is BWL, year 4, less cliched than it sounds"

Which makes it sound terrible, but it's by far one of my favorite works of fanfiction ever. I skipped it a bunch of times but ended up reading it for lack of anything else and am really glad I did.
