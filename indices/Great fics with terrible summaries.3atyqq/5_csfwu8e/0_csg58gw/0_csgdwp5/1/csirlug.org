I'm a huge fan of the story (and I rec it here so much that I probably annoy people), but it's definitely not without it's flaws.

The most glaring is how much I want to bash Harry's head in for /constantly/ doing the same old "sulk and hide things" or "evasive hiding emotions" thing through like 90% of the story.

Or how he never really grows out of the "no one can possibly understand what I'm going through" mentality.

And I can't forget the "I'm so rational but not really I make decisions that everyone else thinks are bat-shit insane" extended phase.

Lastly, dude Harry you're like 15. The "I'm damaged but don't need no parent" endless litany isn't fooling anyone. Harry manages to simultaneously be the most childish and most mature character I've ever read.

Also Lightning on the Wave really needed a hack and slash editor. That story suffered for not having someone to curtail needless introspection.
