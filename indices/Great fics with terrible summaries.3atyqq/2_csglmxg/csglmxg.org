One I like is "Spellcaster" by SGCbearcub.

The summary is intriguing, but doesn't tell you the characteristics of the story. Clearly, its about Hermione being strong and capable, but its also a Marriage Law Challenge that touches on Pureblood Culture/Politics, providing a more plausible reason why half-bloods were welcomed as Death Eaters.

It also solves two of the main problems with MLC fics: Hermione is 24 biological years old and her muggle course work in computers helps her understand the fabric of magic that compels people to obey this set of magical laws.
