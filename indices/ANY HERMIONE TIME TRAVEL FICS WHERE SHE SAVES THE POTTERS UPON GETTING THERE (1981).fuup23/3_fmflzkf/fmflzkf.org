[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13013582/1/In-the-Bleak-Midwinter][In the Bleak Midwinter]] isn't exactly what you're asking for, but it's awesome.

Hermione goes back in time to live with Tom Sr. and raise Tom Riddle Jr. to not be evil. Tom Sr. is delighted that his son is a wizard and decides to go all in on wizarding society to make sure Tom Jr. has nothing but the best, so with the help of a house elf, Tom fakes being a wizard and actively participates in the WW, while at the same time trying to revolutionize it with muggle knowledge.

One of my favorite fics. It's incomplete but the author is still updating it periodically.
