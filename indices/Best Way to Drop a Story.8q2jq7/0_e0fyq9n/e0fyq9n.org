Readers would hate it if you deleted it. Maybe someone had just started binge-reading it and then boom, overnight, it's gone! Incredibly distracting. No, you owe your readers to keep it up. And post a notice-chapter that it's on indefinite hiatus/probably abandoned so they don't spend months waiting for an update. If you were sure not to return, I'd say post a sort of “epilogue chapter” where you give the outline of what would have happened til the end, but if you think you may finish it a long time in the future you'd best not.
