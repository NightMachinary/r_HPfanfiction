Listen to this person OP! There are a ton of abandoned stories that I still read and I'm glad they're still up.

So yeah, don't delete. Maybe mark it as incomplete/abandoned (in tags or summary) so new readers know what they're getting into. If you're sure not to return, an epilogue chapter would be awesome. I think that some sort of brief "what would happen next and how it would have ended" summary is good even if might pick it back up in the future.
