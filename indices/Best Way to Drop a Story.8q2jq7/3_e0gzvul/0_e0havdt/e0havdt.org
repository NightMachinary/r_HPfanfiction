Things don't have to be posted publicly for you to be able to do that though.

The trouble with leaving something you know is poorly written posted up, is that it's likely to deter readers from looking at your newer work because they'll assume it's no better. Fanfiction readers have hundreds of thousands of fics to choose from and limited time to do it in. You have to at least try to give them a reason to choose yours. And (in my opinion, obviously) leaving poorly written material there on your profile isn't the way to do it.
