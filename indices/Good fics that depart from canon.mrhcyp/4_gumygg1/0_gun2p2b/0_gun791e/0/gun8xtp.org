While it's been a long time since I've read that story, I do seem to feel like they presented the impact of Ron's Legacy in a positive light. So maybe OP will enjoy the story. I wasn't necessarily trying to trash your recommendation.

I just got a decent chuckle from seeing the request to "Show Ron some Love" followed by "Ron's Dead". It caught me off guard. Lol
