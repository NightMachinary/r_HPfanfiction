These have tolerable to great SPaG - punctuation around dialogue is a pet peeve of mine, and iirc there's only one or two here that manage to screw it up. Two are crossovers - one with Star Trek Voyager, and one with Jurassic Park. The JP one is pretty cracky as is Grimdark in its own way. Grimdark also isn't nice to Ron, but iirc it's the only one to actively bash him.

And yes: Voldemort is part of the finale of the star trek one.

Apologies if you've already read these.
