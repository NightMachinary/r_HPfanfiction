Which Black? Sirius hated everything his family stood for, so he wouldn't act as their librarian. Death Eaters may have all been interested in Dark arts, but that doesn't mean they all had the opportunity or aptitude to learn them. Peter's specialty was sneakiness, not forcefulness.

If you're writing some fanfic that requires Peter to be good at some Dark art, it's certainly possible, but that's not the only interpretation, or even the most likely one.
