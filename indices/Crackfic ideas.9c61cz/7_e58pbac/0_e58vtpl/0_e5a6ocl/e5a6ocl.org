I can see that. Visits hagrid with harry, hagrid as his hagriddish self ends up giving neville some fresh chicken eggs for some reason (misunderstand that only the shells are needed when composting?)

Neville puts them in his bag and promptly forgets due to harry-related shennanigans. He also tends to try and keep his toad with him... in his bag.

Next thing you know, there's a random snake slithering around in there calling Neville "mommy" for some some reason and petrifying bugs. Not that neville knows what's it's saying.
