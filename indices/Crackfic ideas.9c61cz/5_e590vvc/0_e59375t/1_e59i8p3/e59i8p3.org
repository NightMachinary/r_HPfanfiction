I mean yes, but it doesn't actually go into the logistics of an 11-year-old being Headmaster. It just does that for shock value. Its an Omake.

I want a story where canon Harry, upon his entrance to Hogwarts, is haplessly thrust into the Headmasters office with naught but a pat on the head and a lollipop.

I want him to struggle through paperwork. I want him to try to improve the school but fail due to lack of funding. I want him to actually deal with Hogwarts' problems in a highly inefficient manner.
