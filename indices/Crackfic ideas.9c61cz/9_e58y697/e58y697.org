Harry Potter/ Baby's Day Out. Mcgonagall was right to doubt Hagrid at the start of the Philosopher's stone. On the way to a hidden location after an unsuccessful attack on the Potter family by the Dark Lord Voldemort, Hagrid accidentally drops poor baby in the middle of London! To make matters worse, some dastardly death eaters catch wind of this and attempt to capture the child. Things don't go well for these dark wizards.
