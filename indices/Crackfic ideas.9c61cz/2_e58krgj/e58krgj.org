The Triwizard Tournament is a street racing championship with magically enchanted cars (which still look like they are from Tokyo Drift) and the three tasks are exhibition events (drift around a dragon, amphibian vehicles, the maze is an obstacle course). There are quite a few regular races in between and since no one but Hermione believes Harry, he is stuck with a bunch of freed house elves as his crew.
