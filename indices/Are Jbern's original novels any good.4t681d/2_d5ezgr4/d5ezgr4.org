Not his novels, but [[http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-423][this review]] of a short story collection Bernheimer self-published comes down very harshly on the collection. Some of the problems highlighted are no doubt due to the self-published nature of the collection, but others (especially Bernheimer's bad handling of women characters) wouldn't be so easily fixed by an editor.
