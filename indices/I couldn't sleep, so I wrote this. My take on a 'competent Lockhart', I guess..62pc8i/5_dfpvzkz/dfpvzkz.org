I've always wanted canon Lockhart, just a wee bit smarter about it. Like instead of being completely incapable of spells (and making them up? Peskipiksi Pesternomi is hilarious..but why try something obviously that fake?), he just goes through them deliberately and slowly "to show the children how it is cast." When its the only way he can cast those more difficult spells.

I just want a charlatan who is incompetent at magic but extremely competent at faking it.
