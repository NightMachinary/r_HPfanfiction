I tried. Word of warning, it bogs down fast, and gets rediculous quickly. I wasn't able to get far, but the overall good quality of writing kept me around for far longer than the rest of the story warrented.

Some highlights:

-14yr old Ginny was so in love with Sirius that she felt guilty about having sex with Harry in Grimauld Place after the war was over

-17yr old Ginny modeled for playwizard and was embarrassed into silence about people seeing the picture when Luna showed it off

-Somehow Hermione had time to have sex with Remus while he was married to Tonks (presumably often based on context)

-Lavender is suddenly a 'Weak' werewolf who's lifeforce is tied to Young Remus?
