I'd be interested in any recs on this theme too.

You might like [Iacta Alea Est]([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11491209]]) by Eli Morgan on ao3. It's over 200,000 words long and the writing is good.

Luna, Hermione, Ginny, and Lavender are inadvertently dragged back in time to avert some of the disasters of the original time-line. They disagree on how to approach the situation and have to compromise and negotiate. It turns into a bit of a training montage and there's a great scene when they decide to get into shape and take up running (or, for some of them, jogging.)

Eventually I lost patience with the pace of the plot, but I enjoyed the set-up in the early chapters.
