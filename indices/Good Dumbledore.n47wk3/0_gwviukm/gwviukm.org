Those are the two fics that come to mind when I think of good Dumbledore haha. Since you've read The Accidental Animagus, maybe you've read linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) by the same writer? Much shorter but I enjoy competent Dumbledore who takes the Basilisk very seriously. It's also a great use of For Want of a Nail. Dumbledore plays a fairly minor role in linkffn(Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary) but definitely a positive one. Also, if you're up for a Dumbledore mentoring young Tom Riddle fic, there's linkffn(Last Chance by Laume).
