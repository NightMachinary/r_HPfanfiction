In my story "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", the trio are Curse-Breakers searching for Atlantis as they travel the globe - the Americas, the Caribbean, North Africa, Turkey.

In my story "Patron", Harry travels to France, Bulgaria and Jamaica. Other characters visit the Balkans, Turkey and Scandinavia.
