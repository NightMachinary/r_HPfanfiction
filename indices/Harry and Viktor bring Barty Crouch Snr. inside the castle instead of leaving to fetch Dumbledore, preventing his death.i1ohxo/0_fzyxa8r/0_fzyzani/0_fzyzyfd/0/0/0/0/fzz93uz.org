Everything could be justified by the fact that Rowling was not always consistent with her writing but if you want to make an imagination exercise out of it, here's my take on the situations: Harry was pretty panicked when he got attacked by the Basilisk, it was Fawkes's song that gave him courage; Harry pretty much lost his head when the Dementors attacked him, in fact so much so that even while hiding in the bushes he would have allowed his past self to be kissed only in the hopes that he'll see his father; again Harry was still quite scared, it was only in the end that he resolved that it was better to die fighting than hide behind a tombstone; the dragon was in a controlled environment and he had a plan.
