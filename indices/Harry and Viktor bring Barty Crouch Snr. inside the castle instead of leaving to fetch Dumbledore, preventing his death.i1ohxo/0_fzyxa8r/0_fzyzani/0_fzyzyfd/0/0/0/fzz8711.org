This is the same guy who didn't lose his head while fighting a gigantic ass snake at the tender age of 12 years old, and got cornered by an army of dementors (his biggest fear). The guy who kept his head while surrounded by Voldy and a shitload of death eaters. The guy who faced a dragon. All without panicking.

No, I don't buy that the inferi were too much for him to handle without panicking, it's just that his characterization (pretty much all characters' in Harry Potter) bends depending on the needs of the plot.
