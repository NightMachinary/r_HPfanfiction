Since The Great Manipulator was mentioned, and erroneously so, a clarification seems to be in order. We are a family account comprising of cousins and we do prefer Harmony. The mentioned story has Harry as an apprentice to Dumbledore unofficially, wrt manipulation. No pairing as yet intended. The "Cannons" comes from the fact that the other 3 are Arsenal (Barclays' Premier League/Football team) fans.
