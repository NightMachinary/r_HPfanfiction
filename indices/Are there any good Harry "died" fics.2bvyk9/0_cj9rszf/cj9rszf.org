[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late][Coming Back Late]] is one that I rather enjoyed. The basic plot is that instead of his spirit reurning to his body right away when Voldemort kills him, he comes back after everyone is sure he's dead, and decides to let them think he is for several years so he can live in peace.
