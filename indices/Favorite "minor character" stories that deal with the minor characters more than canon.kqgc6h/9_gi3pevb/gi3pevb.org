Can't recall the link but it's a Harry/Fleur story where she comes to Hogwarts to teach a Dueling Club. It's easy to see Fleur had a lot of potential than what was in canon and the story shows her as the badass she is. She is arrogant and all too aware of how good-looking she is, but it shows her other qualities too.
