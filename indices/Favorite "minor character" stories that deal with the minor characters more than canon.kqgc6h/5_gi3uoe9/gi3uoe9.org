Oh I have a lot:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19276393/chapters/45844324][Divination for Skeptics]]: The latest in magical advancements is an enchantment that reveals the bearer's romantic compatibility with another person. Effectively eliminating uncertainty from dating, the charm can tell you whether or not you've found The One with a precise, Hermione Granger-approved calculation of traits and preferences. It's a foolproof method of predicting relationship happiness. It's also, for Hermione, positively dreadful news. Dramione, post-war, soulmate AU. COMPLETE. (My note - even though it is Dramione there are a bunch of minor characters explored in here)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20681483][Sunshine and Tomatoes]]: Theodore Nott had every intention of ignoring the Marriage Law - the very idea the government could force him to get married was absurd - until Luna Lovegood smiled at him in the dingy office, tomatoes in her hair. (My note - I am a sucker for a Theo/Luna pairing and this one is sweet)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21109976/chapters/50231597][A Dress with Pockets]]: Pansy Parkinson needed a drink. And a shag. She didn't care in which order. Enter: Neville /fucking/ Longbottom and his rolled up sleeves. Set in LovesBitca8's Rights and Wrongs AU. (My note - this is explicit so click with care, but the Pansy characterization is great. Also if you like it the Dramione story for the AU that it takes place in is also worth a read)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21554839][A Strong Cup of Tea in a Warm Glass House]]: The greenhouse is shadowed and quiet, and she's alone, pressed into the very darkest corner she can find. She doesn't know he's there until he touches the back of her right hand with a fingertip. “Tea?” (my note - super quick, very sweet)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27417406/chapters/67015339][What Do A Lion And A Wolf Share]]: Two years after the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione Granger is called back from Australia by the Ministry for urgent news. Just when she feels like her blood doesn't define her in the wizarding world, Hermione is thrust into a new world based on blood status. Working with unlikely allies, can she navigate new societal challenges, better the wizarding world, make her friends all get along, and fix her parents? Dramione, enemies to lovers slow burn. (my note - this one is a self plug, but only because my Theo Nott is one of my favorite characters I have ever written. Theo Nott and Narcissa are both major players and get explored way more than in canon. Not finished, but I usually update every few days.)
