There's this one crossover fic I've been following for a while now, which is bringing in Cassius Warrington, An slytherin who is definitely very confused about what's going on from the moment he met the main character, to being selected as a triwizard champion, striking up a potential interhouse/intercontinental alliance due to the twins mischeif, along with general confusion as to what the heck this first year and his golden retriever is trying to pull. It is one of the few time travel fics I know of where the characters are generally clueless about the maguffins, and have to work to find and destroy them.
