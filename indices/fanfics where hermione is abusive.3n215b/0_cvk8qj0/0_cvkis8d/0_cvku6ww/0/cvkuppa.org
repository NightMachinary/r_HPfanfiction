Bashing in the sense that it portrays Harry as a bad, clueless friend. He remains blind to the issues and doesn't take the time to listen. At the end of the fic, Harry and Ginny see Ron off in the distance for the first time in years. They express bitterness over happy Ron looks with his new life, bitter that he is happy without them. Also, Ron knows that choosing Pansy means completely distancing himself from the Weasely's and Harry, but he does it without to much fuss. This is all written with a lot more subtlety than a typical bashing fic, mind you. But it still follows the path of "the unappreciated protagonist gets treated like crap, they deserves better, magical thing makes their situation better, the people who treated the protagonist like crap are shown to be the wankers they really are, the end".
