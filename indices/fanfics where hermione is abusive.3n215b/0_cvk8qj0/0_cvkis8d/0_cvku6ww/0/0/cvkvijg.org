  Bashing in the sense that it portrays Harry as a bad, clueless friend. He remains blind to the issues and doesn't take the time to listen.

Ron was pulling the same "I'm fine." automatic response that Harry used in canon and then refusing to talk about it. Harry left off in the same way he always wanted others to. The bitterness at the very end is also tinged with regret for what's lost, knowing that they failed.

I guess I don't feel this shows Harry in an unflattering way.

It was an okay one shot at least. And I totally would buy that behavior from Hermione.
