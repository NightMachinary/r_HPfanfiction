I buy the Hermione behavior, and I can see what you're saying about Harry. The ending wasn't about them feeling betrayed, but regret that they failed a friend/brother. I don't think it portrays Harry in a positive light though. In my opinion, canon!Harry would have been much more perceptive. EDIT: I think it was a decent oneshot, and novel in it's portrayal of Hermione, but it's still a fic where the author shoehorned a contrived magical mcguffin to drive the plot, especially at the end when we it's added that marrying a veela means you have to abandon your friends and only hang out with the veela's....sooo I guess veela marriage exerts some power over your social life because...hmm, I'm not sure why really
