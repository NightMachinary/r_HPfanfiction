/Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection/ is one of the best Luna-fics of all.

It's Luna's perspective of the events of /Order of the Phoenix./

Luna is delightfully odd, while also very sympathetic in this story. She gets occasional visions, but unlike most Seer-fics she's as confused by them as anyone else would be.

And Luna's compassion shines through here--she develops a strong friendship with Ginny and also with one of her dormmares, Christine, who is a frequent target of bullies herself.

This is one of the best of the best.
