  Runner-up for the DLP Q4 Part I competition, theme "foreign magical regions." Thank you for all your great comments and critique!Luna Lovegood went to China under the premise of following up on the sighting of an unknown half-bird looking for its other half. The real reason for her trip was because Neville Longbottom couldn't get Hannah Abbott pregnant.
