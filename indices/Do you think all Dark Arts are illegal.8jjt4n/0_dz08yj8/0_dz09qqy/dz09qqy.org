JKR actually does classify all magic that causes harm as dark magic, with even minor jinxes called "[[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Dark_charms][dark charms]]."

Sorry, but I find the trope that dark magic is addictive to be annoying because there's no canon evidence for it, and it only seems to serve to make characters who dabble in it out to be worse people. My headcanon is that there is a second, narrower definition of dark magic, which is magic that is /corrupting/. Things like the Unforgivable Curses requiring actual malice to cast or the magics Voldemort dealt in transforming his appearance even before his first death.
