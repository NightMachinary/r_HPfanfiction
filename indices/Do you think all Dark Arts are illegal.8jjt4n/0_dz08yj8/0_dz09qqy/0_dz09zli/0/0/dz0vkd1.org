That's the sense I get from it, too. The dark arts are the spells fuelled by rage and hate and vindictiveness, all things that are, in human psychology, terribly habit-forming. Not quite forever-will-it-dominate-your-destiny, but the more you indulge, the easier it gets to become a truly unpleasant person to be around.

And because such emotions are easy, especially under threat, they're the go-to shortcut to power. Impossible to make truly illegal, but Everyone Knows that dark arts users are all raging arseholes.
