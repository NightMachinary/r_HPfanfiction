I mean addictive in a sense like cheat codes in a game are addictive. Once you use them, the rush of power - this crazy drug called dopamin - you gain over the opponent is something you want more and more and more of. I cannot imagine how addictive an Imperio would be. It would probably far supersede the addictive power of a bit of a emotion-manipulating spell. I don't really have an example for a spell to be physiologically addictive, like an actual hard drug, but I didn't want to exclude the possibility.

I use this feeling of fleeting power as this threshold to what is and isn't "dark magic" in a legal sense. Its interesting that some form of dark magic is taught at all - or at least not restricted. Thanks for that link.
