I think that all spells classified as Dark Arts are illegal in Magical Britain.

What classifies as Dark Arts? I have no idea.

It can't be just "spells that cause harm", because otherwise much of the curriculum at Hogwarts would not be taught at all for being "Dark Arts". It has to be something deeper and precise than that. The next steap from the "cause harm" would be to say that they're spells that *only* cause harm - that have no other purpose. But then the Boogey-Bat Hex would be dark in nature, as well as the Tripping Hex. While the harm is not immense, their purpose is still nothing but to harm.

My personal headcanon in this matter is that "Dark Arts" are by their nature either psychologically or even physiologically addictive, while being designed only to cause harm, assert unquestionable dominance or pervert some rule of nature.
