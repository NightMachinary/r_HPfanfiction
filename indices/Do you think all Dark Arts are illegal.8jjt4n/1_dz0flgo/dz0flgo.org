They're not illegal in general. Borgin and Burkes is a legal business and is said to have a patronage numbering in the hundreds despite being known to deal (almost exclusively) in Dark objects. Outside of the Unforgivables (and experimental creature breeding, e.g. Basilisk), Dark magic doesn't appear to be unlawful at all. Attacking other wizards with it would definitely be illegal, but that would be because it's assault or attempted murder, I presume.
