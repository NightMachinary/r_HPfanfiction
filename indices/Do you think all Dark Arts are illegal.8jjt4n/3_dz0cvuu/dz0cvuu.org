It might be that Dark Arts classify spells that require malicious intent to cast. For example, /Wingardium Leviosa/ has the *possibility* of being used to maim or kill but can be used in other, "good" ways. Meanwhile, /Crucio/ has the sole intent of causing pain and requires the malicious intent to cast, thus is classified as Dark Arts.

Thus, Dark Arts could all be classified as illegal with varying punishments for the "degree" of darkness.
