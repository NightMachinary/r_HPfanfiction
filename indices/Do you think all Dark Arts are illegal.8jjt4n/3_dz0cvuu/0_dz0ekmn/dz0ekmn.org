I remember a fic that had the great idea that crucio was actually the corruption of a spell used in medical resuscitation. It would give a short burst of activity in all the nerves of the body in an attempt to kickstart the organism back into woking condition.

I think that the idea of all dark spells being the corrupted version of "normal" spells is a great one. You could also imagine spells that were first created to be "dark" in intent being modified for other use or as a counter to other dark spells. I think it was in /I'm Still Here/, by kathryn518, where the MC uses a controlled blood boiling curse to counter a blood freezing one (or the opposite, can't remember).

Anyway I like the "two side of the same coin" kind of argument, where it's all really about the intent.
