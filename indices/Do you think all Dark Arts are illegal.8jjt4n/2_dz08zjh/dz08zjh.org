Personally, I think the Confundus charm should be classified as a hex, but it's far too useful for the Light-aligned characters to be acknowledged as Dark magic. So, no. Definitely not. There are all sorts of nasty spells that Hogwarts students are casting that don't appear to be legally restricted in any way.
