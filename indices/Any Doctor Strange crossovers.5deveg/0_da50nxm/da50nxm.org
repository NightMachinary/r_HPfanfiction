linkffn(Child of the Storm) has Dr. Strange and the Scarlet Witch in somewhat minor roles. It's kind of a "everyone but the kitchen sink" kind of crossover fic. Dr. Strange was the doctor who delivered Harry and Scarlet Witch is his godmother. They don't show up until like halfway through the story.

It's mostly a HP/Avengers crossover with Dresden Files, Constantine, X-Men, Stargate, and some others thrown in as well. I really enjoyed the story. It's a very long read at over 800,000 words.
