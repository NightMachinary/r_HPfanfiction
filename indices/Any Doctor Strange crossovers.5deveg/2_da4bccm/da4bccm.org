I haven't seen one for the new movie yet, but I would definitely read one! I was actually thinking about Doctor Strange and Loki the other day, because I figure that their 'magic' has to have the same source within the MCU. Harry's magic would be mind-bogglingly strange to them since their magic is really just energy and power taken from other universes, whereas Harry's power comes from the magic within himself.

Plus there's so much potential for squibs to learn MCU magic and kick ass, which sounds like a good old fashion revenge fic to me :D
