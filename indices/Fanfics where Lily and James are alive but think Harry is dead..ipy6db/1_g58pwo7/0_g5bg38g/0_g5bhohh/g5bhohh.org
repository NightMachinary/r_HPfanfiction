I have two more, but I'm a little wary to recommend them.

The first is, "A Shattered Prophesy." You may have read this one as well, because it is actually the story that inspired "The Darkness Within." Either way, I'm wary because it's a tragic story and I'm not sure if it's what you're looking for. Either way, I'll link it.

Second is called "Light Up the Sky." I haven't read it in a while, but I recall it being pretty good. Though I will warn you now it is NOT finished and will never be finished. It didn't end on a cliff hanger though, and the plot was pretty much tied up. Here you go.
