Thank you wholeheartedly for the recommendations!

I'm writing a story, I actually started now!

​

I'll give a summary of what I thought:

​

-Lily and James forget about Harry in favor of their other son, so Harry is neglected, at the age of 5 he runs away from home.

​

-But they don't do it on purpose, Peter before he runs away, passes by the Potter's house and casts a very strong "confundus" spell on Lily and James, (Sirius and Remus too) making them forget about Harry over time , and then they think that Harry's twin brother is actually the WBL!

​

-Harry appears for selection at Hogwarts

​

-Lily and James try to have Harry's trust again, but Harry doesn't take it easy, because he went through many things, had to learn to live alone in the alleys of London, until he was captured and sent to a homeless children's shelter . There he goes through abuse, so even trusting adults again will take some time, and also Lily and James try to understand what happened and why they did this to Harry!

​

It is! I was wondering if it looks interesting to you!

Bad news is that it won't be released in English (but with the Google translator it's easy to read)
