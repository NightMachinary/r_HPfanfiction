Yes! I absolutely love this trope as well. I've read a few really good ones. There's this one fic (which also happens to be my all-time favorite fic that I recommend at every opportunity) called, "The Darkness Within." It's pretty popular, so you may have already read it. There's two sequels as well.

I want to give you a summary, but I don't want to say too much. Just, please read it. It's the best story ever. You won't regret it. Do it. Now.
