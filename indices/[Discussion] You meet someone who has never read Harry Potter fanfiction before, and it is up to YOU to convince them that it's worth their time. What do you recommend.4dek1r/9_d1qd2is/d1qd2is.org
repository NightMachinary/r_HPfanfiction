I hate to say this (because my personal opinions are not far from the general consensus on this subreddit), but I might have to go with /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/---it has, if nothing else, a proven broad crossover appeal and enough coverage in external media to legitimize it as respectable reading. I can't count the number of friends not inclined to fandom who brought the story up to me in real life, to recommend it or trade theories or otherwise get my opinion. (And it's not like looking back after long years and thinking /I liked that?!/ isn't an essential rite of passage in the fanfic community.)

Otherwise? Probably /The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks/---it's a poignant, canon-compatible mystery that wraps up in under 40,000 words. Long enough to get sucked in; not long enough to drown in bloat.
