Hear that nonjon? You wrote the HP community's communist manifesto!

In all seriousness though, it'd have to be an author known for his or her fic inspiring dozens, if not hundreds, of similar fics all bearing an uncanny resemblance to the original but with serious flaws that blow everything apart a few chapters in. It's not really communism otherwise.

But whoever wrote my immortal first? Definitely the HP fanficcers' Hitler, if only because when you think badly written crazy manifestos, you gotta think Mein Kampf.
