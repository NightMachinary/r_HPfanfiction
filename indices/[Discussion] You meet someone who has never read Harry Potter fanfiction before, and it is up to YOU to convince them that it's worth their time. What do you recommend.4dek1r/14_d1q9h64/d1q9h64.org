No experience in fanfiction? I go with "The Summer of Change" or "Forever Knight" depending on the person. I feel these two stories had a huge impact on my enjoyment of Fanfiction early on (but so did other old stories from guys like Jbern and stuff). These are stories that just show how different yet the same things can be. The other story I would go with would be something like "The Lie I've Lived" or "The Other Boy Who Lived"
