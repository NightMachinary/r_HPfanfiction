I'm partial to linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday). It's canon compliant(a big plus for someone just starting in on fanfiction), humorous, decently written, and all around fun to read. It's actually what I do tend to point people at when introducing them to fanfic.

Honestly, there is almost no circumstance I can imagine that I would recommend a fic knowing nothing about the reader, and my recommendations would depend heavily on that.

Hermione fan? linkffn(The Arithmancer).

Liked Ender's Game? linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School)

Want more of the Weasely family, or to see canon from another viewpoint? linkffn(Untold Weasely tales)

Want to know how the story might have gone if Harry was a family member instead of a freak? linkffn(A Better Man by Valandar)

Want the Maurader's era? linkffn(The Teachers' Notebook)

Really hate Ron? linkffn(The Champion's Champion)

Want to go back to WWII to prevent Voldemort from ever happening? linkffn(Altered Destinies by Dobbyelflord)

What people like all comes down to like. Some people hate the sappy stuff, others love it. Some will enjoy crack, some won't. Some can tolerate poor spelling/grammar for a good story, others won't. So I make a point to try to get an idea of what someone likes before recommending something.
