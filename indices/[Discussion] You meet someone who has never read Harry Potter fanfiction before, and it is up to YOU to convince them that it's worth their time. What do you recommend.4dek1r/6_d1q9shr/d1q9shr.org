linkffn(Forging the Sword). I stumbled across the fic before I even knew fanfiction was a thing; it also happens to be a top-recommended fic in the community. It's merits are well documented even though it's incomplete.

Then I'd probably recommend a crackfic/humor or maybe a tear-jerker like Stages of Hope or a romance like Vox Corporis.
