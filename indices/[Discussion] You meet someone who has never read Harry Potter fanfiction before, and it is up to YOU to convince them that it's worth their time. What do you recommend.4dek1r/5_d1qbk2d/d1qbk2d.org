Choosing two make or break fics is tough. Definitely a fic that either picks up where the books left off, covers what they left out, or views canon from another character's perspective. Something like linkffn(The First Day), linkffn(Not From Others), linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince). I know that the only reason I got into fanfiction was because I just wanted MORE. So stories that are decently canon-compliant and just expanded on the series were what I started out with.\\
Or if they have issues with certain character deaths (like me!), something like linkffn(A Little More Time)
