I'm utterly gobsmacked that somebody else recommended "A Little More Time!". That was my first foray into fanfiction many years ago and I was going to put it down before I saw your comment. It built upon the world I already knew, managed to tie things up nicely while connecting it to canon and after reading many time travel AUs, dealt wonderfully with people being thrown forward in time. I actually prefer such fanfics that don't touch the main canon and but either pick up where it leaves off or explores other characters off screen for a first timer.
