I gave the same answer in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3rckk0/help_me_interest_my_coworker_in_fanfiction/][similar thread]] last year . . . but I've come to think it's best appreciated in the context of other trends in the fandom, i.e., the tendency to romanticize the post-war period as a time of peace and plenty, or the opposite tendency to ratchet the angst and woe up to 11. /Cauterize/ occupies a fairly uncommon middle ground, depicting characters deeply damaged by the war, but not utterly consumed by that damage; characters who are in need of healing and catharsis, but are able to confront that need and address it. Perhaps it has power just in the context of the epilogue and "all was well," but it is responding just as much to the other side of the coin.
