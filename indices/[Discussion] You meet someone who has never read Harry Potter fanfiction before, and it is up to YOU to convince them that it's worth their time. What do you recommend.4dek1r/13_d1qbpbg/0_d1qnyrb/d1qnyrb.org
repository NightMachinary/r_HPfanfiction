I would disagree. I mean Wasteland could work as it own story, it just uses Harry Potter to get an audience and to skip worldbulding. But when Wastelands of TIme would be my first fanfic, I would have stopped. For me it's not what I expect from a fanfic (thats also why i really cant read the Alexandra Quick series).
