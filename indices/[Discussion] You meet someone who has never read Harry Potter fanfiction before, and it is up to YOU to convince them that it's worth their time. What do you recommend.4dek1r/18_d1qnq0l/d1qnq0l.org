Linkffn(a cadmean victory) linkffn (the frozen phoenix) i would choose these because the first show how intense fanfiction can become while providing a fair level of writing. The second is one of the best fics i have read in a while with interesting twists. Both feature pairings that are not canon, arent drowning in cliches and tropes (they do exist however) and are fairly well written.

If I could substitute a series instead of two works, the psychic serpent will have to be my go to. linkffn(the psychic serpent)
