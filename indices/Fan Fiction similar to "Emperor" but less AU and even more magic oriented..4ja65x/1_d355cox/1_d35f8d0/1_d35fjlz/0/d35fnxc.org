Ill add it to my kindle and get to it at some point. I just generally prefer stories with Harry as the main character, although there are exceptions, and if its well done, its well done.

Example: I never thought I would ever like Fem Harry FF, and then I read one with a Fem Harry and actually enjoyed it as I found it very interesting the way the author worked it in (although to be fair it might not be true Fem Harry since its Male turned Female Harry).
