I have not, ill take a look. Its just too bad it will likely remain unfinished. I cant tell you the number of times I have loved a FF piece only to discover that despite saying complete or in progress, the author has been MIA for months or years. Makes me sad :(

As for the other two... I have read Forging the Sword but not Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived. I am still fairly new to the HP FF world. Ive been reading LoTR and Gaming FF mostly before now, and just recently got into HP, Eragon, and Twilight of all things... Fan Fiction worlds. Considering I grew up with HP especially, I am constantly looking back going where have I been to miss out on all this.
