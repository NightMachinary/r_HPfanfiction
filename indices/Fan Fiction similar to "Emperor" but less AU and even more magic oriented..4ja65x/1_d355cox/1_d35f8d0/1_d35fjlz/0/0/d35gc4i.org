Hm. Actually, have you read linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama)? It's looooong, and will likely remain unfinished, but it has Harry growing into his own and making an impact on the political scene.

Apart from that, I can recommend rereading (as I assume you've already read them) Harry Potter and the Boy who Lived or Forging the Sword.
