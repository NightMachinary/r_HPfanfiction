Ah, no worries. Even if I love that fic to death, I do agree that it has its flaws, the foremost of which is that you're right in that it doesn't really read like Harry Potter.

But you are right in that Sirius is the protagonist. Still, Harry is a prominent character and has his moments. It suffers a bit from the length - it's only 50k words, and as such, often glosses over some things that should really have been worked on.
