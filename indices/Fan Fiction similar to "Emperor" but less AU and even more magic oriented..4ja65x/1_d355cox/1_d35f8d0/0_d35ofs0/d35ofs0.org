*Tyrant* is unfortunately incomplete. It's really a Caesar/Octavian story set in the HP universe, with Sirius taking on the role of Caesar and Harry being Octavian.

The story just stopped at the point [[/spoiler][where Sirius won a major victory over the conservative faction and had declared himself dictator for life. As you know, Caesar didn't live long after reaching that stage.]]

If history is any guide, the outcome of this story will be far more tragic than the canon, with family members and former friends turning on each other, and most characters would die. [[/spoiler][If Remus indeed played the role of Anthony, he and Harry would institute a major massacre when they took power, and Harry would force Remus into suicide in the end.]]
