I know I know... I should probably clarify that I dont mean it didnt immerse me as a story, just that it didn't immerse me as a Harry Potter Fan Fiction story. It reads as almost its own book, not even needing the most of the original Harry Potter stories to exist, just needing some wizarding world background. Its for this very reason that I both love it as a book, and hate it as HP Fan Fiction at the same time.

And no I have not read Tyrant but did know about it. I had not read it yet because it was the understanding it was a Sirius focused story with Harry playing a minor role.
