Ahhh I LOVE your work! I'm definitely gonna try it again eventually, it encapsulates the descent into complete depression for harry really well! I made it about 20 chapters in, but my mental health is not great at the moment so had to give it a rest. But truly, thank you for uploading such an awesome fic. To think that the foundation of it was written when you were 12 I think the AN said is amazing!
