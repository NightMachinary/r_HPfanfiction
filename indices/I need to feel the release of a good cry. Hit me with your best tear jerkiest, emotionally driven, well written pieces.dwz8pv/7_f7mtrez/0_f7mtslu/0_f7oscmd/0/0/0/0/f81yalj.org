Yes! I wrote the original when I was 12- a good concept but horrible execution. I've learned a LOT from this! Antithesis was the realization that my work can influence and help people in real life. Antithesis is a really difficult story, but the moments of happiness and the messages I write can help people who need it. Readers like you are the reason I'm now looking into legitimate publication, and hopefully will have a book out someday! It is PERFECTLY ALRIGHT if you can't finish the story, it's really difficult on anyone's mental health! Take care of yourself first!
