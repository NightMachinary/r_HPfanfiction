That happens in New Blood by Artemisgirl linkffn(13051824) It's a long fic, and it's not a very big part of the story, but it is very well written. I absolutely love the story, it has incredible world building and a really interesting magic system and characterization. The chapters are pretty short, but it's still updated consistently every Tuesday and Friday.
