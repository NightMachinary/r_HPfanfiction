[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23468659][Hunting Shadows]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TangentiaLives/pseuds/TangentiaLives][TangentiaLives]] has Hermione to be quite a prodigious healer-in-training. She actually does quite a lot of healing for a trainee.

*Protector Hermione*

It is a minor crossover, but you can just treat the crossover characters as OC's.
