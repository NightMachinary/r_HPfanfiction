For awhile, I considered Dumbledore as some cruel god-type character that did everything selfishly. Then after rereading the books, I kind of realized the whole point in pointing out the flaws of Dumbledore was to show he was HUMAN. I think he was doing what he thought was good, and just made some bad decisions, which no leader has ever avoided.
