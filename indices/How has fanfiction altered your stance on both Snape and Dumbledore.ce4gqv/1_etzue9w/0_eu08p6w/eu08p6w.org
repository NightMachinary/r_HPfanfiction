My opinion of Snape will always be "A bad man who did the right thing ". I can understand why Harry wanted people to know which side he was truly with, or why he fought for Snape to have his own Headmaster portrait, but to give his name to one of his sons ? Being on the same side doesnt magically erase years of hate and abuse, (not to mention, calling his son Albus Severus is just asking for him to suffer ).
