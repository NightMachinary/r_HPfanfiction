Honestly, my opinion of Dumbledore hasn't changed much. I don't mind the bashing of him or when someone completely sidelines him to irrelevancy. I get somewhat annoyed when they make him this super evil being because I feel like he becomes an Umbridge that takes slower to deal with. It also feels a lot like a crutch when someone uses him this way so that the protags can have some sort of adversary before Voldemort comes into play.

All that to say, I like Canon Dumbledore.

Snape, in my mind, can't be fully redeemed. He's an asshole, plain and simple. He insulted children and went out of his way to torment and bully them to the point where he became Neville's greatest fear.

Yes he was bullied, humiliated, and isolated but that doesn't excuse his behavior. He knew better and didn't /DO/ better. There are very few times I see someone make me like Snape, if at all.
