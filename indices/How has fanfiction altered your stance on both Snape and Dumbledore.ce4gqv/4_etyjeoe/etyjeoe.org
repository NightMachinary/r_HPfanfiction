It hasn't changed my opinion of Dumbledore much. Though I very much enjoy Dumbledore Bashing fics purely for the entertainment, he's one of my favorite characters in Canon.

As far as Severus Snape is concerned, I didn't think of him much even though JKR "redeemed" his character in Deathly Hallows. However, this changed when I started reading Fanfiction. I definitely have more respect for him now as Fanon writers have changed my views.
