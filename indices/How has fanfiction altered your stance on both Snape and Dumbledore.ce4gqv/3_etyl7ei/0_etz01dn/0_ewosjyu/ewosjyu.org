  He's what I think he should have been in the books.

Yeah, that's the way I view Snape. People rant and rave about Book!Snape abuse, but I think Rowling was really seeing Movie!Snape in her cartoonish villain teacher. A strict teacher on the mean side, but not as bad as the books seem to make him to be. Which is why Harry could forgive him and name his son Severus. I see it as Harry is an unreliable narrator and embellished in his own mind the cruelty of Snape as a child. Looking back at it as an adult, Harry was more rational and realized it wasn't as bad as he thought it was. AKA child!Harry saw book!Snape, but when Harry grew up into an adult he realized he had been looking at Movie!Snape the entire time. That's the only headcanon that makes sense. Other than that, blame Rowling for writing one thing and then falling in love with Alan Rickman in her own mind.
