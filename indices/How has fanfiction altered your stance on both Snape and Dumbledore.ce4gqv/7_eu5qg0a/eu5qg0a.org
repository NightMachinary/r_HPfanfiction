I never thought much about Dumbledore when i read the books (the first time i was about 9). He seemed like a powerful Grandpa to me. But when i got older (I'm 18) my opinion of him changed for the worst mostly because of fanfiction. But i still think that he's neither good nor bad. He was a flawed man fighting for the Greater Good. But he certainly is quite annoying in most of the fanfics I've read (usually he's used as someone who tries to break up the main couple or something)

As for Snape, I've always had a weird fascination with him (even when i was 9). I sympathise with him because I really don't like children and the Golden Trio sure was annoying as hell. But he didn't have to be so cruel. So fanfiction hasn't changed anything for me except that now i sometimes like to fantasise about being his girlfriend (cause I'm gross like that, i know)
