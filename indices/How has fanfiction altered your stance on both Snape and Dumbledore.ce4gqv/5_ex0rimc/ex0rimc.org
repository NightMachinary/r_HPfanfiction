Sorta? Its not like it made me hate them when I used to love them or vice versa.

When I read HP growing up Dumbledore was pretty much infallible as I got older the whole ya he should have done more to help Harry could have done more was more of a sentiment for me. And seeing fics with him as a villain helped really show that. I still do really like him but i see him as more flawed. I definetly dont consider him anywhere near evil but I do think he would make a great villain and when I see him as a villain in fanfic I like him as a villain more than canon Voldemort was. Not so much his history or what he does but how he goes about things and his behavior. I dont think of him as a villain in canon though just a flawed man who did his best but made many mistakes.

Snape I was somewhat meh on by the end. I felt bad finding out he was bullied and I hated him for killing Dumbledore and then I was back to neutral ish for him maybe leaning towards liking him after his redemption. I read alot of sympathetic Snape fics. But I also read alot of Meta. And my view on canon Snape is he was kinda a dick. I dont consider his love for Lilly much of a redeeming feature when its not shown how much he grew as a character outside that obsession with her. Not having the clarification that he would have taken the high road even without his love for Lilly doesnt help. Neither does his abuse of his students and his pettiness with Lupin and Sirius. Even Draco showed signs of independent character growth and he wasnt even getting an active redemption arc.

The sympathetic Snape isnt how i necessarily see canon Snape. But Snape has certain personality quirks I like and like seeing that archetype as sympathetic. Fanon sympathetic Snape is kinda maybe Snape done differently or better in the way JK Rowling maybe wanted him to come across even if the execution wasnt botched. Or maybe its just a different character all together. But I do like that character and want to see stories with him sometimes. And sometimes i just want to see him be an asshole.
