To be fair, most of that's canon. Umbridge was the one to send the Dementors to Little Whinging to Kiss Harry, she was instated by Fudge (and thus had his support) to her position in Hogwarts, and of course Malfoy (perhaps under orders from Voldemort, perhaps not) supported Fudge to keep him in power as he was inept and easily manipulated. And although I can't remember much about this story's decrees, canon Umbridge made up a fair few ridiculous ones as well.
