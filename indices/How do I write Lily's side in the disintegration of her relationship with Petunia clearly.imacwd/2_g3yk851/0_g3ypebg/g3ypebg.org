Yeah. My relationship with my sister is one of the most beautiful yet fucked up things I have experienced. I'll be sure to keep this in mind when writing Lily and Petunia, as well as Sirius and Regulus. I'm actually SUPER excited to explore their relationship because it's similar to my family dynamic in some ways, though way more extreme, obviously. Also, I'm super obsessed with the Blacks- that is one /messed up/ family.
