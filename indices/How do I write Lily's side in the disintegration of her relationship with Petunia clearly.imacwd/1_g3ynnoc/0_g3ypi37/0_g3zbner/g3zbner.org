In what way is your story AU? Because that can be very important for that relationship as well.

I write a (mostly) canon-compliant story out of Lily's pov about her Hogwarts years and have Lily and Petunia dance around each other for a long time, but it turns more and more bitter with time.

At one point Petunia repeats a nasty rumor she heard in the neighborhood that could be about Snape and Lily gets angry in a fight to defend him (mostly because she is really frustrated that she always has to defend him at Hogwarts against her other friends and at home against her family), so much that she makes the silverware rattle on the table and Petunia just pulls away from the argument because she is afraid. So Lily just won that argument by intimating her sister and breaks something in Petunia and Lily just didn't notice at that moment.

So let there be moments when the reader can feel for Petunia, maybe even let her reach out to Lily in some way, that Lily didn't realize at that moment or is something Lily can't appreciate
