Don't make Lily just a victim, she can feel like it at times, but let there be moments when the reader is allowed to feel bad for Petunia...

Lily was the one that stayed friends with someone that had hurt Petunia and let that someone she didn't like look through her stuff, before she called Lily a freak. Lily was the one to break the trust first and there is a good chance that to Petunia her apologize just never seemed honest has long as she stayed friends with Snape. Maybe she never said this part out loud or Lily just didn't feel that it was fair for Petunia to force her to choose. Maybe it was a reason why Lily and Snape's friendship got worse, because Lily always had in the back of her head that she gave up her sister for this, whenever Snape and her fought or he did something she didn't like. But this made her bitter towards Petunia at the same time, like Petunia is in a way destroying both those relationships by making her choose.

Or you could make Lily as jealous of Petunia as the other way round. I mean there is a war going on in the magical world for her right to exist. Lily doesn't really has a place in either the muggle or magical world, while Petunia never had to doubt her place. And while Petunia says that their parents dot on Lily when she is home, Lily isn't around for most of the time and she spends her time in a world her parents don't understand and Lily is losing her connection to the muggle world at the same time. It can be small things that Lily feels left out. A song or movie or show that their father tried to describe but forgot the name about and Lily is just clueless and Petunia just hears a little bit of it and knows what he is talking about or that her mother needs something from the store and Lily offers to get it, but her mother still sends Petunisa, because she knows the right brand.... Things like that
