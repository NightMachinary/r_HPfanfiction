I mean, she can share traits with Hermione and not *be* Hermione. Hermione was also righteous and stubborn, but I imagine Lily as more carefree and a people person. We don't really know much about her, so I've had to rely on my imagination (and as I said, this is an AU, so she'll be different than canon Lily by the end), and I certainly don't imagine her as the original Hermione.

Hermione doesn't do well socially because she's uptight and corrects people, and kids don't typically like that. Also, she's nerdy. I imagine Lily as quite popular and carefree, but someone who stands up for what she believes in. I think she's quite trusting and naive, and is a "give people a chance" kind of person. Just because people have similarities doesn't mean that they are the exact same.
