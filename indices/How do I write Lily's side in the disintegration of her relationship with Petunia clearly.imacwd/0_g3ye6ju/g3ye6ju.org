Try not to make Lily a Mary Sue.

I don't have much experience as this but try make Lily both sad and angry about it. Sad that the bond she once shared with Petunia was fading and angry that she couldn't just accept Lily.

Im pretty sure you already know this but im going to say it anyway. Petunia will squash the jealousy she feels in favor for hatred
