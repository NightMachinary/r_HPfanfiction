Probably one of the few people on this sub reddit that really enjoys the majority of Pottermore. During the writing of the books, JK said many times that she had really created a lot more story, etc. for the characters than would ever make it into the book. In my opinion, she's had a lot of this planned out since the beginning. Obviously, there are plotholes, and sometimes the stories are '?' inducing, but I don't mind all the added canon info.

I don't have a preference when it comes to stories using canon or not in general, or whether they use the Pottermore canon either.

I /do/ tend to dislike anything that has to do with the USA. I'm not a fan of stories that go abroad or use OCs in general and 99% of HP (not Fantastic Beast FF, which I don't read) that uses American characters who go to Ilvermorny are just OCs and I can't stand it. I don't mind the occasional stranger from Beauxbatons or Durmstrang because they have some connection to the HP canon. No one from America would. So this is really just a FF preference than a Pottermore one, anyway.

The basic facts from Pottermore, I love. Like McGonnagal-centred fics, which elude to her background story. I think it's a great tool for FF writers to use if they so wish, and I don't particularly mind either way.

That's my two cents anyway!
