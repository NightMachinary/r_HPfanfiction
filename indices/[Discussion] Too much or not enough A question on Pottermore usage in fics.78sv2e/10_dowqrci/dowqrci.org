I /wish/ Rowling didn't publish some of this information, but unlike certain people here I'm not the type to ignore canon just because I don't like it all that much. I'll do my best to be Pottermore-consistent in my fics, though only a few Pottermore ideas strike me as worthy /premises/. All this being said, if the story's good, I won't refuse to read a Pottermore-ignoring (or even Cursed-Child-ignoring or Epilogue-ignoring) fic.
