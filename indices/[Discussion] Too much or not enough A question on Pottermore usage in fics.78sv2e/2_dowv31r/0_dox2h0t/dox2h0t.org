I think some of the stuff on Pottermore relating to some characters is useful. The entry on McGonagall is pretty interesting. She's half-blood and was married at one point and that's information that can be incorporated to enhance a story. I've also used the Pottermore Patronus info. But yeah, some of it can be distracting.
