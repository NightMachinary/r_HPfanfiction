I typically avoid using any Pottermore. A lot of it really comes off as fanservice, or even just bad fanfiction itself. So when you try and come up with a new wand for ever single character featured in the story and go to great lengths to match up personalities or whatever, it really just comes off as too gimmicky. Plus, I've already seen stories completely derail themselves trying to incorporate Pottermore stuff into their otherwise normal story, and that's not what I wish for my own fics.
