In my own writing, I'll certainly use Pottermore as a resource, but I reserve the right to reject what I don't feel fits my writing. In my own stories, I've created the school Harry teaches at and I pretty much ignore the MACUSA and Ilvermorny, mostly because I started writing before either of these were a thing and it would be way too much trouble to try and integrate them now.

I feel more bound by original canon than Pottermore, but even then I'll make changes. For example, I have Ginny's Patronus as a hummingbird rather than a horse because I'd pretty much forgot what it was! I'd say use it as a guide and inspiration, but don't feel bound to it or let it limit your creativity. It's your story--do what you want!
