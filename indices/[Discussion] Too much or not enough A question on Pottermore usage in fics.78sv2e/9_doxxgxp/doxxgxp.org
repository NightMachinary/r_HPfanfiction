I pick and choose stuff from Pottermore, in the same way that I pick and choose from other HP-related resources. I plan to include Bem, for example, as I want to make Hogwarts slightly bigger in my AU.

(Bem is the black guy who first appears in PoA with all the best lines in the film, then is clearly recognised for his intelligence because he is moved from Gryffindor to Ravenclaw in a later film.)
