I've never used Pottermore though I do use the wiki if I need background material. I may or may not be too old to write fanfiction but I'm pretty sure I am too old for Pottermore. But frankly I wish it didn't exist at all.

I started writing fanfiction because I thought Rowling had finished with Harry Potter and moved on. And lo and behold she hasn't. She keeps adding bits here and there and I'm sure plenty of it contradicts my own immovable headcanon. But by now I'd rather not know anymore.
