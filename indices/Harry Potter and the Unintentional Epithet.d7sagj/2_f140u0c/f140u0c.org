In the slash writing world, epithets are as common as knuts because authors try to avoid the ambiguous pronouns. Compare the gay version to the straight version of a sexytime scene between two partners: "She took off his shirt" to "He took off his shirt". The hetero pairing makes it obvious who's doing what actions, but with the slash pairing it's unclear.

  He took off his shirt.

#+begin_quote
  Harry took off his shirt.
#+end_quote

vs.

#+begin_quote
  Harry took off Draco's shirt.
#+end_quote

Authors think that it's clunky and slows the flow of a sentence to refer to someone's name every time they reference the character. Because they can't use pronouns (he/him/his) without it becoming ambiguous who's doing what action, they instead refer to hair color, eye color, Hogwarts house, or broomstick preference.

#+begin_quote
  The green-orbed Firebolt-owner took off the blonde Nimbus 2001-owner's shirt.

Now we're cooking!

In all seriousness, I have seen authors go well, well out of their way to avoid using people's names and pronouns, to the point that the writing becomes unreadable. You know they have come to this point when characters are referred to in relative, as opposed to /exact/ terms. "The greasy-haired potion master said" versus "The seductive taller wizard said".

Yes, there are reasonable times when you can use an epithet. But within reason, please.
