I recall this ambiguity being discussed once in a Swedish lesson in elementary school. We have a pronoun that English lacks which means "his/her own" ("hans" = his, "hennes" = her, "sin" = his/her own). This fixes some of the issues. Not saying Swedish is superior -- but it does have an advantage in this case.
