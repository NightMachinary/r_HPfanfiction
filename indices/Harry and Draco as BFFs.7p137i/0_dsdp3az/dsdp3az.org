I actually did a post on like this awhile ago. Here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7ot3jk/recommendation_old_scars_and_future_hearts/?st=JC6ME73K&sh=a823b2ea]]

However, I'll just quote myself.

  (I marked this as ongoing, but the author wrote that they have 1 chapter left to go till it is complete anyways.)

  I absolutely love the story. No slashes or romances, just pure chance of Draco and Harry becoming friends. (I have nothing against slashes or romances, I just want something that shows character growth.) The writing from what I can read is pretty good in my opinion as well. Not too difficult to interpret but not childish either.

  Anyways, this is a what-if story where Draco finds Sirius' diary and he starts to question pureblood life. Everything is cannon until the beginning of the summer before their 3rd Year.

  Summary:

  It was all because of that stupid diary Draco had found when he went his mother to visit 12 Grimmauld Place. If he hadn't started reading it then he wouldn't know about this Padfoot and he definitely wouldn't be questioning everything he had been taught since he was old enough to listen. He definitely wouldn't be standing outside of Harry Potter's house. That damn diary.
