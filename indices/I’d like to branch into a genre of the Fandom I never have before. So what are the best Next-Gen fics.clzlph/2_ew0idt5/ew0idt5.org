I usually don't like next-gen fics, but Hogwarts Houses Divided is probably my favourite HP fanfic of all times... it's just really good, with actual conflict and deepening of canon themes, and the eleven year old kids actually act like eleven year old kids. Mind you, it's Teddy Lupin and not Albus Potter, but that counts as next-gen in my eyes. linkffn(3979062)

Oooor... If you want Harry's kids at Hogwarts instead... well, I'm currently going through the [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/][James Potter series by G. Norman Lippert.]] It's not on FFN; it has its own page where you can get the five novels as ebooks... or you can get them as audiobooks through the [[http://livingaudio.co.uk/the-james-potter-series-podcast/][James Potter Series podcast]]. It's the audiobooks I'm currently going through... I try to go for a ten thousand step walk every day, and it helps to have a podcast or audiobook to listen to while I'm out walking.

Mind you, it's not a patch on Hogwarts Houses Divided. Much too Americanized for my tastes, the worldbuilding is a little inconsistent, and I don't think G. Norman Lippert has the faintest idea how Hogwarts classes actually work... But I do think it's good... at least good enough that I'm interested in finding out how it ends.
