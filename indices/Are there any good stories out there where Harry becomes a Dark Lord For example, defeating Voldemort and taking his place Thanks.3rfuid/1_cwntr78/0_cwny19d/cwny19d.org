Great, thanks a lot for the recommendations. Some of the "dark" Harry fics I've read just have him stand up for himself. I want one where he seeks power for its own sake and wins. I enjoyed Too Young To Die, and I'm in the middle of The Dark's Rise (which I've heard mixed reviews of- my take so far is that it's a pretty cool story but the awful grammar is a big turnoff, but I really liked the unique element where [[/spoiler][Harry steals the Philosopher's Stone]] and the fact that the author made him 3 years older so that was a feasible accomplishment.
