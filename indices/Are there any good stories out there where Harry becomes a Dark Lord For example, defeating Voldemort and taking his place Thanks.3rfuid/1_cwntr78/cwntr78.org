linkffn(11131988) (Birth of A Nightmare Man) and linkffn(10182397) (The Nightmare Man) are both pretty good.

The first one starts out like your normal recovery from Azkaban fic with a side of bashing but gets way different. The second starts out as full-blown pants-on-head crazy murderous psycho. "Birth" is a bit of a prequel to "The." I'd recommend reading what's written of "Brith" first imo. It's pretty fun so far but it's not finished yet. "The" is finished though.

Edit: Also a good thing about the first one: George is a main character.
