That's a broad question. Certainly some people like realistic characters, others... probably not. Plus, not everyone will agree on what makes a realistic character or who should be considered one. I find some people tend to struggle with enjoying characters who act what they consider to be irrational despite how very human that can be. In addition to those factors, there always tends to be some backlash on male characters who act too emotionally. Which may help explain some of the responses to OoTP Harry.

Personally, I find it depends on the story/genre. Sometimes fantastical, larger than life characters are part of the appeal. I certainly don't watch Star Wars, for example, for down to earth and realistic depictions of the human condition. That being said, I'm good either way, though I do tend to be drawn to characters who are both consistent and flawed.
