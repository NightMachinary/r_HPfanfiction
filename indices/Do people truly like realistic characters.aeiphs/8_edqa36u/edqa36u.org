Realistic. What is realistic? Do you have any idea how fucking weird our world is? There is a species of shrimp that cracks its claw so fast that it creates light. There is a sea slug as big as a small dog. There's a fungus that turns ants into zombies. There are people who wear fursuits of anthropomorphic animals because it turns them on. People have built cities on the slopes of volcanoes. The Voynich manuscript is one of the most famous works of writing because it's so fucking weird that we have no idea what the fuck it is.

I think people like /interesting/ characters. What makes a character interesting? Characters who are proactive, competent, characters who are odds with their situation (SI are decently popular because who hasn't wondered how they would do dropped into a dangerous fictional universe?).

Mary Sues are derided because they tend to accomplish everything without struggle, and aren't stories basically about struggle? Struggling to do something, to get somewhere, to get out of somewhere, to become someone. Brandon Sanderson blah blah journey before destination. It really is about the journey. Game of Thrones wouldn't be great if Daenerys had sat on the Iron Throne in Season 2. But we saw her struggle and grow and that's why I care what happens.

This post is meant a bit tongue-in-cheek of course, but the point stands.
