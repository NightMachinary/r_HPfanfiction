Pretty much.

Like in fifth year, everyone loves to make a big deal about how Harry ignored the mirror Sirius gave him for Christmas. But that was in the middle of his teenage angst "I must do everything myself" phase. Even though Sirius told Harry to use it whenever he needed him, he never actually told Harry what it /was/, so Harry chucked it into his trunk and resolved to never use it in order to not tempt Sirius into doing something stupid that would get him caught. (Going from memory here but I think that's the gist.)

We also have the benefit of hindsight and a third person narration to inform our thoughts on the matter.

On a tangentially related note since I brought up Sirius, I'm a complete sucker for stories that give him the happy ending he (IMO) richly deserves, because the majority of his life was shit and I think the story of the Marauders in general is utterly tragic.
