  The fact that Gary Stu/Mary Sue fics are so common and popular makes me think that a lot of people don't like realistic characters as much as they would like to think.

Even if Harry Potter isn't 'traditional' fantasy it still falls squarely in the realm of escapism, so by virtue of that alone I think readers do not first and foremost desire "realistic" characters and interactions.

The portrayal of Harry in OotP is only realistic if you already accept many concessions without further consideration (why isn't he traumatized, instead of just grumpy? PTSD? a lot of obvious framing of him as the 'hero' type, no matter his frustrations, etc). So I wouldn't agree with your analysis that this is done by JKR for realism and instead more for dramatic tension: I think OotP does a good job of straddling that line between making Harry human and still have him be the ceaseless hero, but I think in a "serious" novel a lot of this stuff wouldn't be as easily accepted.

Now in regards to Gary Stus I think people who write those stories are either very young or reject basic dramatic structure and are just looking for wish fulfillment. I don't see the problem so much in the character being "unrealistic", but instead in the lack of tension, the lack of any kind of heroes journey and the almost complete dismissal of (internal) conflict - at best all threats are external. Not that a "comically" perfect character isn't a huge problem for suspension of disbelief as well, it just opens a whole other can of worms in addition to that problem.
