Maybe... but I feel that's giving the work too much credit. I simply cannot see any ambition of JKR to write some kind of psychological thriller like that anywhere, particularly not in how blas√© she ended the series in regards to Harry's character. She just keeps unloading on the guy for the sake of plot and dramatic tension, without ever really paying tribute to those actions. Harry just keeps marching on (because he's so awesome).

Edit: just to be clear.. I can see where you're coming from and I might agree with you if OotP were the last book of the series. The wasted potential of that book with the (IMHO) broken promise of Harry coming into his own is one of my bigger problems with how the series continued.
