I like Mary Sues if they are done right - if they have a few flaws etc to make them comparatively believable. Like a fic with powerful! Harry who has to study and practise a lot to be badass, and who has flaws in his character like rashness or manipulativeness.

Percy Jackson is the best example of that kind of character.He is unrealistic when it comes down to it but he has flaws and, despite his power, is not the smartest character.

Tl; a character being OP'd or a Mary Sue is fun if they come by it slowly, or have a few flaws. The occasional fight lost, the occasional weakness, that sort of thing. Likewise a villainous Mary Sue is huge fun to read. Thanos is proof of that.
