What some readers like != what other readers like

I'm the first to admit that my story "No Longer Alone" has a rather "slice of life" tone. It focuses on characters and their interactions, not Harry on some grand quest for fame, fortune and knickers. The fic is mostly about friendship and family. And I get a lot of positive feedback on it. But also some people simply don't like that kind of narrative because they prefer more action-focused stories.
