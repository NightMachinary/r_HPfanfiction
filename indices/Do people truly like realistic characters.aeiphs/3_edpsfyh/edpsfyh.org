What matters most for me is that characters are unique, consistent and developed.

By unique I mean that once you get used to each character it should be possible to tell who's doing and saying what without actually having the name mentioned. I'll give you exceptions for things like Fred and George.

By consistent I mean that once character traits are set they remain constant or evolve in realistic ways over time. That's one of the problems I have with Black Luminary - Harry seems to lurch from one thing to another for no good reason.

By developed I mean that we've got to know stuff about the character; how they became the way they are and so on. There was a book club story a while back where we were told that one of the OCs was "dark" and the other wsa "nice" but they were just labels and never adequately explored.

As long as those criteria are fulfilled I'm not really that bothered if a character is realistic. A story like "Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts" by Clell65619 has characters that are way over the top but it's still a fun read.

I think you have to have either all characters being realistic or unrealistic though. Having one hugely overpowered character amongst a population of otherwise peopleis a recipe for a really dull story, for instance.
