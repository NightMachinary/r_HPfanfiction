I personally don't want realistic characters. Overly realistic characters are boring, too much realism always is. I want to read a fantasy story, which means I want the characters to be fantastical. The problem I have with the more Stu/Sue characters is that they are too far the other way, perfect flawless characters are also just boring.

What I want is /believable/ characters. Characters which have their own reasons for doing things, their own beliefs and choices. Even if those characters are absurd they don't detract from the story being told.
