I don't think people like realistic characters, but rather characters who are extraordinary, yet believable.

Canon Harry is a believable character, but still he possesses an almost superhuman resiliance. Not only does he cope extremely well with the abuse he suffered at the Dursleys, but he also manages to grow up a normal teenager despite facing at least one murder attempt every year. A more realistic approach would have led to a darker and angstier story, which wouldn't be the magical tale we know and love. Nonetheless, he is still believable. While most people wouldn't be able to cope with these experiences as well as he does, it's very probable that people exist who can.
