My opinion on realism, be it in stories, videos, movies, etc., is that realism is only as useful as it is enjoyable. It would be realistic to know what harry eats for breakfast every day and what all his homework assignments are and to follow him through all the days where Nothing Much Happens, but that's boring.

Of course, there are plenty of times where realism ads to the enjoyment, but it's not inherently a good thing.

In the case of Cedric's death for example, it would be realistic for Harry to be so traumatised he just breaks down and can't be The Chosen Oneâ„¢, but that makes the story less interesting.

I think the main reason people dislike moody Harry in book 5 and 6 is that it's boring. People don't like moody people in real life, so in that sense it's realistic that they don't like them in fiction either.
