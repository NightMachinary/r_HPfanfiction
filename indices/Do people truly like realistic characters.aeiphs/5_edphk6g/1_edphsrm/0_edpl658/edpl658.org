It had really good characterisations all across the board. Harry was believable. Hermione really fit into the "right hand" role, Ginny was an actual character and Tonks was a joy to read during her few appearances. Then comes HBP and shits all over those characterisations. And then idiot ball gets passed along like a joint.
