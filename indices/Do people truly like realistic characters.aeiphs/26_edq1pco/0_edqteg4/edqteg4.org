this is a good example of people using 'it's not realistic' to mean 'i wouldn't react that way' or 'i don't like it'. harry respects and loves dumbledore, and saw himself in snape even before he found out snape was opposing voldemort. it's entirely possible and realistic for harry to respect and honour these men
