People want /more/ realistic characters, not /perfectly/ realistic characters. This distinction is important, because in the situations that fantasy finds the characters in, the most realistic characters would fail, would cower, would flee in terror. In fantasy like this, the protagonist needs to be able to go beyond the bounds of normality. A Mary Sue then becomes a problem because they succeed at everything that matters, and there is no real conflict to be interesting. They are popular because the are self-inserts without the name, and badly written ones at that, allowing the reader and the writer to feel the experience of winning without having done much at all.
