Eh, he actually did manage to cast the torture curse, but remember how Bellatrix described it: "You need to really want to cause pain...to enjoy it...righteous anger won't hurt me for long." Harry might well have plenty of anger, but apparently that isn't the right mindset, and he /isn't/ sadistic. He doesn't get a thrill from causing pain for its own sake. He doesn't consider it an art form. He gets mad, definitely, he feels hatred, but that apparently goes no further than knocking the target off their feet. Proper torture requires something more twisted and cruel than just a desire for revenge.

Actually, it's ironic that he never casts the killing curse in canon. He could probably manage /that/ just fine.
