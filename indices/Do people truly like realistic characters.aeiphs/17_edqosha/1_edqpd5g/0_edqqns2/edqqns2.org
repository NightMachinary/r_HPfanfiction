exactly, I think the only person Harry could kill without raising a lot of red flags would be Voldemort himself. But torturing/stupefying (sorry, don't know if that's the exact spell's name in english) his enemies would not only be fine by me, but I think it would make Harry much more deep as a character. If ANY person had gone through everything Harry went, I think nobody would try to torture Bellatrix like Harry did, they would just straight throw the wand away and punch her. Hard. In the face. Several times hahahaha.

My whole point is: I'm ok with some gary/mary sue-ism, but in HP it's too over the top for me. The manicheism is something I've been finding almost unbearable since I've gotten older and started reading/writing more.
