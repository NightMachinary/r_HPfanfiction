My issue with OoTP is the exact opposite. Harry went thru a lot of shit that year and on GoF, and still he can't torture the woman who just killed the only "family" he had? The same woman who disabled his friend's parents? The same woman who loves his mortal enemy even more than Harry hates him? Come on! That's just bullshit. There's no way a person couldn't\\
That and his talk with Lupin in DH after Moody's death about using stronger spells on Death Eaters are true back breakers for me. I know it's because the book was initially made for children, and I'm not saying I don't love 'em. But the character development overall could've been better.
