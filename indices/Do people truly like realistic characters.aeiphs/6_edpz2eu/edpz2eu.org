Personally I wasn't really annoyed by Harry in OotP. I found the bit where everyone did their best to stomp on Harry, occasionally including his friends annoying.

Seriously, all it would have taken is a note from Dumbledore slipped to Harry by an Order member saying "Harry, Voldemort is building power and might be spying on you, so I've asked your friends not to write you. Also, you have a direct line to Voldemort in your head, so I can't be sure he won't try to use that to read your mind if we're in the same room. Sorry about that."

That took me about two minutes to write, and would have cut half the drama.
