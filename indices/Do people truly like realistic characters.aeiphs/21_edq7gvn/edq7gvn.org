In fanfic... Mary/Gary Stu are wish fulfillment, sometimes that is what people want to read. Sometimes they are bored of shallow characters and want to read someone deeper.

There is a difference between "realistic" characters, and characters that have depth. I think people get that confused, personally I find "realistic" characters to be boring most of the time...but adding depth to the character can bring it to life in a better/different way than making them a god does.

I like to do character sheets..and give my characters flaws...and then write myself a backstory for why they have those flaws. That then influences every sentence they speak and every decision they make. They come alive in my head and I almost don't "write" the story anymore so much as write down what the characters are doing in my head.

But that's just me... and I'm quite guilty of Gary-stu-ing my Harry. It's the other characters that really get the "depth" treatment.
