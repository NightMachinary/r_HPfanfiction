I've run into similar problems before. I have no problem putting Harry into situations where he's over his head and has someone help him out of it, and thats usually when I get people start flaming me in the comments saying they are "quitting the story since Harry is so /weak/" even though he had a couple other badass moments in the same story. Its like one of his plans not working out properly and he needs help is too much for some people.
