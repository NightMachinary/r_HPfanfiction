I like to think that I'm writing fairly realistic characterisations, and the reception has been mostly positive. The most flak I've gotten over it was that Harry needed Tonks to bail hin out of a spot of trouble instead of some "mission impossible" style of escape, even though he literally had a wand to his back. I mean, outside of against Voldemort, an Auror who was taught by Mad-Eye is bound to be the better fighter than a teenager without any form of formal education. But people don't want to read about the hero needing help, they want him to kick arse, no matter how much plot armour that would require. Even if it is his girlfriend who saves his bacon.
