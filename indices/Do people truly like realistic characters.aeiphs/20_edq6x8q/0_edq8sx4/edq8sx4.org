But there is a difference between a realistic world and realistic characters. A realistic world wouldn't work due to magic, but there is no reason why a character should suddenly act differently because he has magic when it comes to interpersonal relationships.

Just because Harry is the Chosen One, that does not mean he'd suddenly be Barney Stinson and seduce every girl in sight. But at the same time, a "realistic" Harry would not object if a girl pulled a "naked man" (as long as he finds her reasonably attractive). But he would definitely be surprised, not "flip the tables" and pin her to the next wall like you see Harry act in a lot of fics with a more mature take on sexuality (rating wise).
