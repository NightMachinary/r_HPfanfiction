The thing is, people have different tastes and opinions. One reader's Mary Sue is another reader's underpowered useless character.

Personally, I loathe characters with more issues than National Geographic. It breaks my Suspension of Disbelief if people who can't deal with their faults and function are portrayed as being officers, for example. If you can't control yourself and have to lash out everyone "disrespecting" you, or will jump at every challenge, no matter how suicidal, you don't get promoted in the Military, for example.

I want to read about heroes, not bundles of nerves who only succeed thanks to author fiat and have more complexes than a Woody Allen character.
