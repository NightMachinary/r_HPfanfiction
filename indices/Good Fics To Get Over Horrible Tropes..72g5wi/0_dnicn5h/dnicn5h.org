If you're reading "Partially Kissed Hero" by chance, please stop - it's not getting better, it's only getting downhill from wherever you are.

linkffn(Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure Part 1 By dunuelos) if you want a "bad!Dumbledore" taken over by a "good!Dumbledore". It feels rather good, especially after a bad!Dumbledore story, because comeuppance.

linkffn(A long journey home), the "Close Encouters" Chapter if you have read the story already. It's worth to read a second time.

linkffn(Barefoot by Zaxaramas) is a good!Dumbledore, that has a few flaws, but in general it's a fun and happy story.
