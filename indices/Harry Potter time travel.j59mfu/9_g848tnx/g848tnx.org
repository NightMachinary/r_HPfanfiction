The best time travel fic I've ever read is Resurrect the Living by fascinationex. Harry (in his late 30s) can't stop seeing dead people, so Ron and Hermione send him back in time for a cure. I think he's eventually forced to team up with Voldemort. It's such an interesting take and Harry is much darker due to circumstances but not unbelievable
