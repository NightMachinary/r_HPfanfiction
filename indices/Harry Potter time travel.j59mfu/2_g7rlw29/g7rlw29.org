linkao3(720072) has Harry return to 1991, but it /does not/ follow the pattern that has (understandably) bored you.

linkao3(Messing With Time by slythernim) has him return even earlier, and he quickly makes several large changes to the timeline. A story that's plenty of fun, and also rewards a careful reader for noticing the details.

linkffn(13185463) and linkffn(11922615) begin in October of Harry's fourth year.

Do you care that there's only the one time travel, at the beginning of the fanfic? Because if you don't, two more:

linkffn(12388283) is quite a ride.

linkffn(6517567) begins in the summer before fourth year. (Hermione is also time-travelling, not sure if that bothers you.) The repeated time-travel gives the author a lot of space to be very creative with the tasks, Hogwarts, and the Wizarding World in general.
