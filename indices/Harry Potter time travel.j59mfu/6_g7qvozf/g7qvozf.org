Give this one a try:

I've thoroughly enjoyed all of Sinyk's stories

This one is a spin on the HP Time Travel stories, it contains many of the tried and true time travel tropes but it also adds in some original ideas that make this one a fun read. Look for the fun and innovative use of paintball guns to deliver potions. :) Enjoy
