DrT is an author you're not going to find on FFN or AO3. The best link I have for their stories is on FicWad and you may need to create a free account to read there. The story Triwizard Redux, I think, is something you'll like.

[[https://ficwad.com/story/31291]] When would be the best point in time for an over-powered Harry to return to his past? Right before the First Task!

And then read everything else by DrT, because it's all amazing.
