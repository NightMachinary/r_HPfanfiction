Hello! I've been jonesing to read 'Soul Play' for years. About once a year I get that fanfiction itch and reread some of my old favorites. But 'Soul Play' hasn't been available for quiet a while. Do you still have it? I would be eternally grateful for a copy if you still do.

Thanks very much for your time :)
