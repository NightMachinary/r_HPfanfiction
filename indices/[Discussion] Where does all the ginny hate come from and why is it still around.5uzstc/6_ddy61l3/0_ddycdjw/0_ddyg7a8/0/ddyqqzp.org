Listen, Fleur probably has a lot of good reasons to be the way she was. But she was still short with and annoying for most of the Weasley family+ Hermione. She's honestly developed even less as a character than Ginny is, and I can't really fault Ginny for disliking her. Her being a Veela is probably the only reason people enjoy writing about her in fanfiction anyway.
