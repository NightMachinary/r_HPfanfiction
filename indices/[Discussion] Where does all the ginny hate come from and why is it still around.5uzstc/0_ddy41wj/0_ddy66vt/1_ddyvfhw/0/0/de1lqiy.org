I think that's why a lot of us don't like movie snape. Don't get me wrong, I completely agree he's incredible, but my whole childhood was based off the books. Something that big in your life you don't really want to see it changed. Spend a long time thinking Snape is a immature dickhead that I don't think even remotely deserves Lily, or Harry's gratitude. Really, in the books he saved Harry's life in first year, gave him the sword, then told him he had to die. It's kind of hard to see Rickmans snape that doesn't seem so bad, and you can empathise with him.
