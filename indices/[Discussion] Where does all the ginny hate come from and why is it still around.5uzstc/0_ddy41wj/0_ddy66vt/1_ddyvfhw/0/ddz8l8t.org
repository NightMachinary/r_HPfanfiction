Alan Rickman was simply incredible as Severus Snape. If book Snape is everybit asshole, Rickman just made fans to love the character. I thoroughly despise book Snape, but Alan Rickman's Snape? He gave the character so much depth! Can't hate/dislike even if I wanted. Infact, I started to read fanfictions watching Rickman.
