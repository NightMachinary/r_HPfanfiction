Agree with this. I thought there were interesting dynamics of their relationship that just were never explored, though some things were hinted at in Cursed Child.

The Harry/Ginny coupling is essentially Ginny pining after Harry and dating other guys to try to move on, but never being able to do so. It would have been much more interesting if the story was told from her perspective, as it follows a similar trajectory as Jim from the Office. Except we got to see his storyline and hers was implied and offscreen.

Once together, Rowling really did nothing with the relationship so naturally it wasn't too interesting. This is a shame since there were interesting areas to explore with them being together. For one, how does Ginny change the dynamic with the trio? Does Hermione get jealous that Harry goes to Ginny more for advice/support? What was the nature of Ginny's relationship with Michael and Dean? Were they really a means to an end, or did Ginny actually date them with the hope of finding happiness with them and away from Harry?

After the war, things could get even more interesting. Do they get back together right away? Is Ginny upset with Harry for leaving her? Does he minimize what she went through at Hogwarts? How does she accept him trying to lock her away during the battle, as her desire to fight is a fundamental part of her that in that moment, Harry tried to squash?

TL;DR I find they relationship between Harry and Ginny to be incredibly interesting, but it's a shame Rowling chose not to show that.
