Yeah I always thought the break up was a way to show how self-sacrificing and noble Harry was, but it didn't effectively show the best traits of Ginny. I get what Rowling was probably trying to do, showing Ginny as the stoic, battle-hardened "good girlfriend." Cho cries and ginny doesn't, so she is better (I actually don't think crying is a bad thing). But to me, the Ginny I prefer is the one that refuses to accept what Harry is doing (in part because it makes no sense) and refuses to be sidelined. Rowling should have had her basically understand that Harry had a role to play, but she would keep up the fight. And regardless of what he says or what he wants the world to think, they would not be broken up because she wouldn't let Tom control her life anymore. They will both fight and be there for each other when it's over.

Rowling went into such depth on so many characters and so many tiny details about her world. But when it came to Ginny, sometimes it feels like she didn't put much thought into her actions. I think she had an idea about what Ginny was like, but then wouldn't ask herself "would Ginny do this" during certain pivotal scenes.

As far as where the hate comes from, I guess it's from people who don't ship Harry/Ginny because they just don't like that Harry wound up with the popular pretty girl instead of the bookish girl more people identify with. And I can understand that, but it's not Ginny's fault.
