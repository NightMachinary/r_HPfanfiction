Yeah the thing that got me was the fact that Harry left Ginny in DH and she just accepted it. Where was her Weasley temper then? Rowling just kind of excused all Harry's shit away because it was unimportant to her, and so I feel like as a result I didn't click with their dynamic past a few funny pre-hookup scenes.\\
Ginny is a fun-ass character, don't get me wrong, but I prefer to read her in fanfic than in canon. As for where the hate comes from, I have no idea.
