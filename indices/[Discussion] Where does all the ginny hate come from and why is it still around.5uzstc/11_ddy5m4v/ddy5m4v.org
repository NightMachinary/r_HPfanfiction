Ginny Hate reason #1: Hermione is better... if you want to put Harry with another girl you have to get Ginny out of the way somehow (depending on when in cannon your fic Picks up)

Reason 1a: Other girl is better than Ginny, but isn't Hermione. Same reasons, different girl. It boils down to lazy writing when the only way to make another girl better is to tear down the cannon girlfriend instead of just choosing between two good options.

Reason #2: Love out of nowhere... this is what gives rise to the !potions!Ginny tropes. The potions subplot fits in so well to cannon that many think JKR actually intended for Ginny to dose him with love potion to get his attention, just like Molly did with Arthur. At the last moment, those people believe, someone told her how Rapey that sounds. (I'm one of those who believe this)

Reason #3: Weazy bashing, some people get on the train and end up having to hate everyone (except usually, Bill/Charlie, the Twins, and Arthur)

Reason #4: Some people point at Ginny and go "They look just like reincarnation of Lily and James, how cute!" Other people look at Ginny being compared favorably to Lily, and see Oedipus complex (creepy not cute).

The most normal reason to me, is that JKR sucked at writing Ginny and Harry's relationship. It came out of nowhere and we were just supposed to accept that she is his soul mate. It was authors wish fulfillment along with R/Hr and didn't develop naturally enough.

It doesn't help that the Movie cut even more of their relationship development, including the one scene that helped crystalize everything for me. When Ginny beat Cho to the snitch, she was metaphorically proving she was as good as Cho and therefore worthy of Harry. Thus why she jumps him in the common room and kisses him.

Personally though, I much prefer Harry letting Ginny down nicely for any reason but bashing. Ginny hatred is un-needed and overboard in almost every instance. Find better reasons to put him with someone else, it isn't the poor girls fault Harry just isn't attracted to her.

Note my flair, initially I was a Harry/Ginny fanboy and I still tend to put them together in a harem setting or threesome with either Luna or Hermione. I like her enough if is hard for me to say no to her even when I have decided that Hermione was always a much better choice for his life mate.

Much hatred of Ron comes from the place of Ron not deserving Hermione... I try not to hate on him too hard...and fail. But I usually make Harry the better boyfriend along with playing up Rons flaws... I don't hate Ron most of the time though...however it helps me understand why people hate on Ginny.
