There's a difference between representing any other girl as being better for Harry than Ginny, and actively bashing on her and making her out to be the spawn of Satan (which quite a few H/Hr stories do).

Hell, you don't even need to write Ginny into the story, and what's the problem with that, if you're focused on interaction between Harry and another character?
