  Hell, you don't even need to write Ginny into the story, and what's the problem with that, if you're focused on interaction between Harry and another character?

I feel like explaining romance to aliens who never interacted with humans before. Adversity is fun! Ever heard of Romio and Juliet? Forbidden love and all that jazz? Ginny, Ron and Dumbledore all can serve the role of those who want to keep our favorite couple apart wonderfully. Of course they have to be evil in those scenarios. Keep with the program.

This is not rocket science people.
