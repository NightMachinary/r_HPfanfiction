What do you want to hear? Anyone who wants to ship Harry with someone else has to get him away from Ginny somehow. Representing her as the perfect girlfriend for him (like done to death in H/G fics) is hardly going to be the way to go. That many of them have strong opinions about Ginny if they don't want him together with her should also be obvious.

I honestly can't fathom why people are dumbfounded by this.
