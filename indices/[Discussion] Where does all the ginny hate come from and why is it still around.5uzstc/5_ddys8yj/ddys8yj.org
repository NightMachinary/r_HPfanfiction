I agree with a lot of people that the relationship was not handled well.

J. K. Rowling wanted to get Harry and Ginny together, but she also, I believe, wanted the story to be about the Trio and didn't want to disrupt the Trio through the end. Thus, Ginny gets sidelined, especially in Books 5 and 6 where JKR herself tries to make her shine, and fails.

I agree with [[/u/UndeadBBQ][u/UndeadBBQ]] that "Harry's sudden roaring chest monster" is a problem. I actually think Book 6 was /worse/ than Book 5, and the way the romance felt shoehorned in is a big part of why. (And that goes double for the movie.)

Ditto for Ginny being underdeveloped. I contend the way to do it right would be to double Ginny's screen time in Books 5 and 6, dump the entire Dean subplot, and have her and Harry make the slow transition from acquaintances to friends to dating over that period. (Unfortunately, as written, Harry is angsting too much in Book 5 for this to work.)
