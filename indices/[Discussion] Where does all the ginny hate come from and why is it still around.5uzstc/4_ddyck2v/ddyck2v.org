Actually, Ginny is much more popular in the fandom than you realize. Maybe 10+ years ago you would be right, because of all the shipping drama after HBP and DH came out (especially HBP). But in the book fandom, people have generally began to warm up to Ginny as the series has taken time to solidify within the fandom.

  she is a bit of a Mary-Sue character because JKR didnt develop her much

Except that we are seeing the series from Harry's perspective, so it's natural that we see a rose-tinted view of Ginny. But even then, we do have flaws we can easily see:

- can be mean and spiteful
- is openly jealous and a little childish
- is not always forgiving especially toward her family members
- is stubborn to the point of recklessness
- can be too trusting
