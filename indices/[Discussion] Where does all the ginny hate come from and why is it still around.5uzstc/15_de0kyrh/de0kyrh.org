Personally I am not fan of bashing and usually avoid such stories. Having said that I have never been fan of Ginny. And I generally avoid reading stories about Harry/Ginny. Just not my cup of tea so to speak.

I /really/ wish JKR had left ending open and up to the interpretation (or fantasies) of the readers. Instead she has locked canon down and continues to do so to this day through Cursed Child and Pottermore. It's like she just can't let go.
