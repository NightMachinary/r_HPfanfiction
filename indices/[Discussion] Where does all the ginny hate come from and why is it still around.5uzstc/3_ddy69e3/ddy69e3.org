For me I'm pretty neutral on Ginny but why is she bashed? Well she makes an easy and obvious target. So much of fanfiction is decided by pairing. This means for any non-canon pairing you have to have a way to remove Ginny from the equation. This can be done tactfully, killing her off, never having her in the equation to begin with or having them separate amicably. Alternatively you could bash her to make it clear why she isn't in the picture anymore. To give a reason why Harry isn't dating her but this often goes way too far.

Ginny can be seen as a bit mean. I disliked her view of Fleur. Take that and the idea that she was basically using the other boys and she seems a bit cruel.

Fan girly, I didn't like the way she was almost out of nowhere the object of Harry's attention but okay, can deal with it. At the funeral however, she says some stuff that can be interpreted as 'I'm still a fan-girl', the whole it was always you Harry. Now soul mates or fan girl? Lets just say JKR doesn't do a great job.
