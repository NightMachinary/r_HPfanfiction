  I'm also of the opinion that JKR could have handled this better.

I agree with this to a heavy extent, but I think the under development of this (and other key plot points that sometimes appeared out of NOWHERE) is a symptom of something bigger: she had massive writers block while writing book five, party because she had written herself into a corner. The first four books all came out one year after the other, then there was a three year wait. While she has never said she had writers block by name, she has admitted to it being a struggle to write and at times contemplating extreme measures to "explain" why she wasn't writing quickly.

Book five represents a massive tonal shift for the series, and there are many, many things happening in it. She also had a very specific ending she was aiming for with the series and needed to figure out how to get there. The problem was that a kids/pre-teen series wouldn't be the agreeable vehicle. So she needed to do the literary equivalent of bashing some code together simply to make it work. A lot of details are shoved rather hamfistedly in, and, most importantly, left out. While one of her strengths is casually foreshadowing something, book 5 was rather short on this. It was a means to an end to get her to a conclusion. Book 6 then picks up the story again as if book 5 had been more elegantly told. The problem is that it wasn't.
