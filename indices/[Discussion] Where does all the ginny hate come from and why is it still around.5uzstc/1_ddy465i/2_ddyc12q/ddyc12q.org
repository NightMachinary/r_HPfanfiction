Can confirm this, since my younger brother is also a Ginny fan, lol.

  Another group of haters are of the opinion that Harry/Ginny relationship developed out of nowhere. I'm also of the opinion that JKR could have handled this better. One has to do multiple rereads of OoTP to notice all the details and hints of their relationship. Not many in the fandom have paid that much attention to Book 5.

Yes. There is a world of difference between Harry/Ginny being capable of being improved in canon, and claiming that there was nothing for it anywhere in the previous five books.
