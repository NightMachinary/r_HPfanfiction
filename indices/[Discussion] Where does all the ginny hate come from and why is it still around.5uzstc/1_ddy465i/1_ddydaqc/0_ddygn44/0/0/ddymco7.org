Some may disagree, but I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] should be considered as a Harry/Hermione/Ron story. They might not be in a traditional romantic relationship, but their bond and trust exceeded that of most married couples. [[/spoiler][I also don't believe they would NOT engage in sexual activities if they slept together every night.]]

When it comes Trio smut fics, I like [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/955771/chapters/1870387?view_adult=true][No Boundaries]].
