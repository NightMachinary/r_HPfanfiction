[[/u/taure]] ran a survey here a few months ago. It turned out Ginny's biggest haters are teenage girls, while her biggest fans are teenage boys, and to a lesser degree older women.

Ginny's intention behind dating other boys didn't sit well with many. She never really liked those guys, and her goal was mostly building up her self confidence. That was a pretty utilitarian thing. However, many haters tend to overlook that this was Hermione's idea to begin with.

Another group of haters are of the opinion that Harry/Ginny relationship developed out of nowhere. I'm also of the opinion that JKR could have handled this better. One has to do multiple rereads of OoTP to notice all the details and hints of their relationship. Not many in the fandom have paid that much attention to Book 5.
