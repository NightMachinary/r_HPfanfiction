  Ginny is not well developed.

She always reminds me of the humorous sequence in the MrPlinkett reviews of the Star Wars prequels in which he asks friends to define characters from the prequels without mentioning their appearance or their jobs. "Hm yeahh... hmm Ginny... she's a red-head... whooops... and I guess she likes Quidditch... uhm..." Yeah I'm being hyperbolic, there's a bit more to her, but she's really limited.
