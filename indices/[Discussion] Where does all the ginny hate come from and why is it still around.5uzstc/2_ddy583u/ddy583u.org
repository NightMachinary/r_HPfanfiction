I think for the most part the hate on Ginny derives from 3 things.

- Harry's sudden roaring chest monster.

Many would have liked to see a romance developing over a few books. Ginny came in Book 5 and then was just /there/. The signs and hints were too little, too late to make this relationship into something that felt like it developed organically. As it is, the feeling is often like Ginny went from fangirl to love-interest over the course of a few weeks. One symptom of this underdeveloped romance is definitely the "Love Potion" thing so many fics entertain.

- The Character itself.

Ginny is not well developed. Yes, relative to other HP characters she had enough screentime to get known, but once you look at her character from a more objective viewpoint, you see how underdeveloped it is. Rowling focuses /a lot/ on the trio. In terms of story and character development, they are far beyond every other character in the universe, Ginny included.

- Her "target group" doesn't relate to her.

As InquisitorCOC already pointed out, Ginny is not liked among the group of people she represents - young, average girls.

  taure ran a survey here a few months ago. It turned out Ginny's biggest haters are teenage girls, while her biggest fans are teenage boys, and to a lesser degree older women.

Given that a wooping majority of ~3/4 of writers on FFN are female, I can definitely see a correlation here.

I personally have been a fan of Harry/Hermione during my first read. Both were characters I related with. Nowadays however, I'm of the opinion that the canon books would have been better off without the relationship between Harry and Ginny, and without any serious romance for Harry. Killing the epilogue would've been good as well.
