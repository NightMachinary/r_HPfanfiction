Why is she bashed? I would say because the writers that do it don't have the skill to pair Harry with someone else without doing it. H&G are my favourite pairing, but, as others have already pointed out, she is underdeveloped in the books and the films twist the knife even further. Thats why I like fanfic, I can write her like I wanted her to be in the books.
