I think her problem is her development is there, just hinted at indirectly, and thus not delved into deeper. We know from what she says and what others say about it that she is physically pretty, very strong, a relatively powerful witch, brave, petulent, childish, prone to jealousy, and a bit conniving, among other traits. That's not nothing as far as development.

The problem is we don't really get the "why" about her. There is a backstory there but it's never explored. For example, when she scolds Harry for forgetting she was possessed, it hints of a darkness in her but the issue is brought up and forgotten about quickly. Fanfiction generally gets it right on this issue by making their shared connection to Voldemort a great source of character exploration. Rowling, however, was too focused on the trio to give Ginny much more time to show herself, which is a bit odd since she winds up married to Harry and is perhaps the greatest love and closest person in his life.
