I gotta say that of all the criticism against Harry/Ginny, this is the most aggravating argument. Harry starts spending actual time with Ginny his 5th year into the summer before 6th. He's known her as Ron's little sister and just never thought about her in any other way until she shows him her personality and she is actually a person, an engaging, funny, pretty one at that. When he sees her with Dean, it all clicks. It's ENTIRELY realistic for him to develop a strong crush at this point.
