The problem is that he's a teenage boy, I think. They don't just... Not notice attractive girls until they see them snogging. He should have shown even a little sexual interest beforehand, but I feel Rowling was too stuck on the true love angle and by the story being technically for children, so sexuality goes out the window.

God, I can't even remember if he even thought Ginny was pretty before the sixth book, that's how unforshadowed it was.
