Fair point. It could be assumed. There are numerous examples of Harry noticing her hair and eyes in a positive way throughout the series. It was likely attraction yet at the time he probably didn't see it that way. I'd chalk it up to Rowling only writing about relevant things as they occur. Harry finding Ginny attractive only becomes a relevant point in book 6.
