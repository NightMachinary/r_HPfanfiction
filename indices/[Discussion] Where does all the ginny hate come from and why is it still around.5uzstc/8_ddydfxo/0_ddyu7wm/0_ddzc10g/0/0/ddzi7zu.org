Yeah, those are good points I'll admit. It's been a long time since I've read the books :/ only thing I disagree with is the crush thing. I'm not saying he needed to ha e a crush on her, even a little, just that there should have been some indication that he found her attractive prior to the monster part. He could have found her attractive but since it's never mentioned we can't really say that he did.
