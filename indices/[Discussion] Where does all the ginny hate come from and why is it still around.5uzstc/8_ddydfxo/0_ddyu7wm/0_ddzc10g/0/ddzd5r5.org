Remember though that for much of 5th year he is pining/dating Cho, plus he's a moody kid who has a lot on his plate that year (Umbridge, Voldemort). So I'd excuse him for not noticing Ginny.

Also, rules of attraction (girl pretty= I like girl) don't quite apply for Harry and Ginny since he grew up knowing her as Ron's sister and thus blocked his mind from seeing her as an attractive girl. But when she actually spent time around him, that changes and thus his eyes open to who she truly is. Plus, he starts fancying her when she is 15. Perhaps this was a time development-wise where it became impossible to not notice Ginny was very attractive.

Finally, and maybe most important, there is a difference between noticing a girl is attractive and having a crush on them. It is entirely plausible Harry did find her attractive but never had feelings for her for reasons mentioned above, but once he actually got to know her, he did develop feelings. It speaks to Harry's character and the difference with him liking Cho that it would be Ginny's personality that made him want to pursue her. With Cho, it was simply Harry finding her attractive. With Ginny the crush developed over much deeper feelings.
