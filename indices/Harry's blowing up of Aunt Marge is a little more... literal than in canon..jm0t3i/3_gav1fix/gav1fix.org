I did this in a drabble I wrote. For context, it's Slytherin fem!Harry and Snape had a meeting after the Goblet of Fire spit out her name

#+begin_quote
  The Slytherin common room gapes at their Head of House. His usual method for any problem is to pour a potion on it. If a potion can't solve it, his impeccable wisdom is to “take care of it however you need to but do not, under any circumstances, get caught.”

“Where's Potter,” he snaps.

“I think she's gone to bed, sir,” someone says.

Harry sighs, shoving the invisibility cloak off. “I'm here.”

Several people jump. A few cringe back in guilt. She'd decided to spy instead of giving into her exhaustion. The younger students are simply excited to have a Slytherin champion. Most of the older ones have decided to stay out of it except for the few fanatical Death Eater hellspawn. Surprisingly, Malfoy is not categorized as such. Harry might hate Lucius, but Narcissa is trying to get Draco and Harry together for the Black inheritance and quite frankly, Draco is a bit terrified of Harry. It's why she tolerates him.

“Up here, Potter.”

Harry obeys. She's always on her best behavior with Snape. She wants him to like her so desperately that sometimes she hates him for refusing.

“Harry Potter did not enter her name into the Goblet of Fire. There is no need for your childish speculation; I am personally investigating the matter. In the meantime, I expect you all to act like true Slytherins. What is the first thing I taught you cretins?”

“Slytherins stick together,” all seven years worth of Slytherins chant.

He nods, the most amount of praise he's willing to show. Probably the most amount of affection he's capable of. “Potter has agreed to compete to the best of her ability for the sake of our House. I will not tolerate disrespect to either of the Hogwarts champions. I will also remind you that it is forbidden for champions to seek outside help. Completely unrelated, I will inquire as to the second thing I ever taught you.”

“Do not get caught,” they recite.

“Very well. Any questions?”

“Did you really kill your aunt last summer?” A second year asks.

Snape glares. Harry morphs into her Lucius Malfoy persona: arrogant, innocent, and charming. “Aunt Marge was pieced back together and is living her dreadful life in relative discomfort. That was an unfortunate incident of accidental magic, as said by the Minister himself. I do not condone killing muggles, your fellow wizards, or any sentient being without due cause. You can owl my solicitor for any more questions.”

“Relative discomfort?” Cassius asks.

“Due cause?” A sixth year questions sardonically.

“Is Sirius Black really your godfather?” A firstie asks.

Snape tenses, but Harry smiles winningly. Sirius would absolutely love this.

“The Potter will does in fact specify Sirius Black as my godfather and in turn the Black will lists me as heir. I am unaware as to Black's location or goals. I will, however, point out that he never had a trial and spent his recent foray at Hogwarts breaking into Gryffindor Tower instead of our glorious dungeons. Infer what you will. Any further inquiries can be referred to his solicitor, who coincidentally is my solicitor. Any other questions?”

“Merlin, you're as bad as Malfoy Senior,” someone says.

“Thank you. It's the look I was going for.”

“Did you really kill a basilisk in your second year?” Another kid asks.

“Are you going into politics?” A seventh year wonders.

“I do not have any current plans or desire to go into politics. However, I've nearly had it with my life being determined by politicians like Voldemort and Dumbledore, so ask again in a few years. As for the first question...” she glances over at Snape, who is staring at her with dead black eyes. It's a promise of death reserved specifically for those bearing the Potter name. She gulps. “It was meant to be a surprise for Professor Snape, but I've been working with a few older students on cleaning up the Chamber of Secrets.”

The room erupts into a cacophony of teenagers. Snape blinks at her, then at a handful of smirking seventh years.

Shafiq raises her voice to be heard. She's been blessed with a voice made for battlefields. It's one of the reasons she was chosen as a prefect and then Head Girl.

“That plan has apparently been cut short,” she says with accusatory glare. “It's nowhere near clean, but it's safe enough for a tour.”
