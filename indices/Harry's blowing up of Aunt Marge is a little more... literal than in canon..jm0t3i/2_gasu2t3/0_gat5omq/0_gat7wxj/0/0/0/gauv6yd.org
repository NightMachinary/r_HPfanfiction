He knew and authorized what Umbridge did. That's just as evil and fucked up as Trump retweeting a video of his supporters trying to run a Biden campaign truck off the road with the comment "I love Texas".

Not to mention his utter incompetence at managing his nation, contributing to stalling progress in society, his actual nation-scale gaslighting for personal gain... Fudge is the Magical Trump minus the authoritarian streak, Daily Prophet is some crossover between a cheap tabloid, Breitbart and Stormfront, the Death Eaters are the Proud Boys and other far right fringes. And instead of climate change looming on the horizons, Wizards have to deal with Muggles becoming more and more powerful...

Fuck it, the entire Harry Potter series has way roo many prophetic elements.

(The only one I haven't found an equivalent for in contemporary times is a Voldemort... Trump is many things, but not /that/ cruel.)
