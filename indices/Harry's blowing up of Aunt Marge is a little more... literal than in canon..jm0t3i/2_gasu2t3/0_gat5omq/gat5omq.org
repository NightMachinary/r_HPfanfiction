Lol. I mean, I really wish I could present a counterargument...\\
But it's not just Dumbledore, in fact let's assume he does the thing he does in every badly written bash: condemn allies and forgive enemies, and condemns Harry.

"And that, Minister, is why Harry Potter must go to Azkaban. It is of course regrettable, but we can't allow favoritism, no..." said Albus Dumbledore to the shock of those listening.

Given that the whole scene was happening in the bar room of Leaky Cauldron moments after the minister had arrived to assure Harry Potter that clean up was almost done and that he was not in trouble, of course, it caused quite a ruckus. Most of those speaking were not actually on Dumbledore's side. Minister himself saw this, if nothing else, he knew how to read the room.

"So you would punish a child for an episode of accidental magic?" he asked.

"Yes"

"Which occurs only for children that are either very, very young, or extremely distressed?"

"Yes, but.." Cornelius Fudge was having none of it. He continued:

"So the boy has found himself in a situation where his magic had to react in such a spectacular fashion to protect him and you want to condemn him!?" working the audience was also a skill Fudge cultivated, and it was serving him well here, he could almost feel the tide turning and Dumbledore's respect and influence melting away "After you vouched that he was safe!? After you assured us that he would be taken care of!? That we didn't need to involve ourselves!?"

"Cornelius..!"

"No, Dumbledore. This is too much. I will not have you condemn another wizarding child to that... that hell. When Lord Rosier introduced the Wizarding Child Protection Act, we thought it was too extreme, that it was not needed... Obviously , now I know better."

"But the muggles, will you truly take away their children?"

"If that's how they treat a child? Absolutely!" It was a resolute Fudge that strode out of a room, seeing an off duty Daily Prophet reporter slip away in the corner of his eye. He almost skipped as he made his way to the Ministry to put his words to action. The upcoming election would be the easiest one yet! The Protector Fudge, yes, he liked the sound of that.
