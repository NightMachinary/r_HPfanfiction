I feel like it's just part of 'The Eyes are the Windows to the Soul'. But frankly, its always made more sense to me to explain how characters see emotions in others based on facial expressions. Either way, facial expressions along with the eyes are rather big giveaways for emotions unless someones mattered a poker face (and tbf, not many people do). Dilation of the pupils can indicate happiness, excitement, several positive emotions (or that it's a dark area) while the pupils shrinking would be the opposite. Keep in mind these are overall subtle shifts but could be pointed out nothenless.

But yeah, I've never understood the focus on eyes rather than expressions either.
