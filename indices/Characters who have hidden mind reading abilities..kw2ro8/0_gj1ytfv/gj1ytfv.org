Eyes are something that people have put too much stock into with respect to writing. Particularly in Harry potter fanfic where they go into his "emerald green orbs" or "Avada Kedavra piercing eyes".

I don't think you can really glean much from a person's eyes unless they are about to cry. If you want to read a person's mind or what they are feeling or going to say, the face always gives a better tell. Facial expressions like twitching, being unable to look at you, looking down, frowns, worry lines, these are the things that will help a person out more.

No one actually stares into another person's eyes in real life. It's a bit unsettling if you do it for too long and generally you need to be fairly close to do it, so yeah.
