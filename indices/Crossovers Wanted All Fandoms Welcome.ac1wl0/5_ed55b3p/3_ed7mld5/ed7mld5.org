I remember reading Effloresco Secundus and really liking it years ago, but then it took so long between updates that I couldn't remembered what was going on, so I haven't kept up with it. I really don't remember the details now, so at this point if it ever finishes I will do a reread. But given the current pace that will take several decades.
