Thank you so much for the many recommendations. I've never explored the Fate/Stay Night fandom before, so this is a good opportunity to do so. I love Tolkien, and this particular story I started reading a while ago, but for one reason or another I stopped reading it, I don't know why. Thank you for reminding me of a very good fic that I forgot about. As I've mentioned in another comment, I've never been a Naruto super fan, but these two that you've mentioned both sound like they have fun premises, the crack one especially seems like it has a lot of fun potential. Thank you again <3
