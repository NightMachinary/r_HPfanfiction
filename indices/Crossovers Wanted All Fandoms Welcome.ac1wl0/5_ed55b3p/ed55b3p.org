In the Fate branch of crossover, linkffn(10918531) is quite good. You might need *some* notions of the Fate world but even then it takes care to explain everything that doesn't appear in the canon.

It has some real character growth, an extensive worldbuilding and isn't afraid to veer into AU.

Also, it is one of the few fics that makes justice to Mr. "Just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right!" also, it makes you like (or empathise) with one of the worst (excuse the language) shitstains in the Fate verse.

.

Still in the same branch of crossover, linkffn(12881601) manages to be a tad more accessible for newcomers while still having interesting character development and some decent worldbuilding along a fairly good plot.

.

On the Tolkien side of things, linkffn(11115934) is extremely good, with the author making some extensive work to fill the gaps in canon (gaps due to the lack of material, not due to any mistakes by Tolkien). No canon knowledge should be required (though having at least seen the movies is obviously a plus).

.

For Naruto, I have linkffn(11634921) that is pure crack but somehow extremely good.

You should know the Naruto canon til at least the timeskip to fully appreciate it.

.

Again for Naruto, linkffn(8525251) is quite a nice read, especially if you like (slightly) darker AU (on both sides).
