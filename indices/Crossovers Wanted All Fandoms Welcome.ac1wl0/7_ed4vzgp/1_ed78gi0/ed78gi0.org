I really wanted to like this one, especially because of how long it is. I wish the author didn't rush everything so much at the start by making everyone somehow related to each other as family or friends and making the universe in the fic seem minuscule. It is a bit of a turn off for me because it takes away one of the most special things about xvovers, which is the two different universes meeting and coming to terms as the characters meet.
