While I have definitely had Child of the Storm on my radar before and have given it a few glances, I don't think I've ever had a proper go at it. I certainly never knew that there was a sequel. I must admit, I'm one of those plebs that has no other experience with Mavel than the MCU, although I have loved the films so far. I'll definitely try this one again, and I'll make sure that I make a good go at it this time; what you say intrigues me. If you have any other recommendations, I'll happily take them! Thank you for the suggestion. <3
