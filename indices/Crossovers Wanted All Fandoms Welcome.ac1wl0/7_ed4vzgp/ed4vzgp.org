I've got quite a few, I love crossovers, but of of the best is linkffn(Child of the Storm)

It's a mega crossover mostly focused on the marvel universe though, with a few other characters and references here and there. The idea is that James Potter was a failed reincarnation of Thor to teach him humility, but the trauma of watching his family die as a spirit drove him mad so the memories were removed. Until Harry needs help and sends an unconscious distress call to Asgard...

It's got a lot of the Avengers doing their thing with wizards mixed in. The fic itself is finished but it has a sequel that updates almost weekly. Combined they are over a million words. Even if you don't know marvel beyond the movies and don't know any of the other occasional crossovers, it is an extremely good fic.

Tell me if you want more, I read so many crossovers
