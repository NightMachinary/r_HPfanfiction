[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/163632][What's Past Is Prologue]] linkao3(163632) is a Doctor Who/Harry Potter crossover. Hardly an obscure crossover, I know, but it's a pretty unknown fic, I think. You do probably need to have seen the Tenth Doctor era for this fic to be worth reading. I like it because Harry after DH and Ten after Journey's End are an interesting character combination, given that both have experienced a lot of loss, and carry around a sense of responsibility.
