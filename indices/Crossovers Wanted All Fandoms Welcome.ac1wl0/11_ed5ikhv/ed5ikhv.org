Linkffn(The Magic of Torchwood) is probably the best crossover with HP and Torchwood. It's pretty long, but the humor is great and the characterization of everyone is perfect. It's my favorite fanfiction and I reread it every chance I get.

Linkffn(De-Aged) is also a really good crossover between Doctor Who and HP. The characters are true to form, however, I will say there's not a lot of the main group of Harry Potter characters. I reread this one pretty often as well.
