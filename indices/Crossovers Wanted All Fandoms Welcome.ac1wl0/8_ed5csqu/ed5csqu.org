I recently stumbled upon this HP-GoT crossover fic called The Winter Witch; linkffn(12689889)

Basically, Hermione accidentally lands smack in the middle of the Battle of the Whispering Wood, where Robb Stark routed the Lannister army (I am assuming that you, like me, have a cursory knowledge of the GoT universe), and then the story proceeds from there. I was about to board a flight when I unexpectedly found this fic and I gave a quick skim through it during the journey. However, I must admit, thanks to some deadlines that I had to meet at work, I totally forgot about the fic after that trip. I was reminded of it only after I saw your post.

In the few chapters that I managed to read, I found the writing to be good. The underlying, universal trope of all superhero comics was basically what captured my attention in this fic - a witch who can virtually do anything, all thanks to her wand, in an ancient world of warriors who've had very little exposure to modern ways or magic. Additionally, I think the plot tries to adhere to the Song of Ice and Fire books, because you'll encounter characters who you've never seen on the show. However, I must warn you that the fic does does tend to lean towards the super-Hermione trope that fic readers generally hate.

It's a three-part fic (part 2 ongoing) and since I haven't completed the fic myself, I'll not go to the extent of recommending it. But you could have a look.
