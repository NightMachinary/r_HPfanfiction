A bit of a late response, but here's a writeup of the HPxX crossovers I'd recommend on my favourites list. If you want me to go into more detail on one/chat about it feel free to say so. :)

- linkffn(*Harry Potter and the Natural 20*)

Milo, a D&D Wizard, finds himself in an insane world with other people claiming to be wizards but who clearly follow different and bizarre rules of the universe. Shenanigans ensue. Very solid read, especially if you're somewhat familiar with roleplaying games.

- linkffn(*The Shadow of Angmar*)

Probably the best LOTR crossover, Harry wanders around in Middle Earth about a millenium before the events of LOTR. Totally awesome.

- linkffn(*The Power He Knows Not*)

By the same author as The Shadow of Angmar, Harry finds himself in Middle Earth during the events of LOTR and meets the fair maiden Ã‰owyn. Sticks close to Tolkien's style and is completely wrapped up.

- linkffn(*Strangers in Bars*)

Harry finds himself drinking in a bar with Marvel's Thor, exchanging battle stories. Pretty short and very fun.

- linkffn(*One-Eighth of A Chance*)

Humouristic one-shot that features Discworld's Death but doesn't require any knowledge of Discworld. It's funny and it's great.

- linkffn(*I See The Moon*)

Bruce Banner, on the run, meets a not quite sane Harry and they become great friends. Mostly fluffy and a totally lovely read. This fic is great.

- linkffn(8145794) - *Chance Encounters*

Harry runs into the members of the Avengers throughout his life, a chapter at a time. The first half is a good bit better than the second half imo, but it's still overall a great story and I'll heartily recommend it.

- linkffn(*Discordant* by Heather Sinclair)

Harry's a bounty hunter in the Star Wars universe and gets involved in the storyline of the prequels. It's a fun and solid romp cut short by presumed abandonment. Current contents are worth reading though.

- linkffn(9978546) - *Mistaken Identity*

The Tenth Doctor (played by David Tennant) crashes into the HP universe and finds himself mistaken for Barty Crouch Junior (played by David Tennant). It's a short story but it's a good one and it's a lot of fun seeing the Doctor running around interacting with various characters.

- linkffn(*Harry Potter: The Last Avatar*)

A blend of the Harry Potter and ATLA universe with a good bit of AU sauce slathered over it, this is a quite compelling tale. Sadly abandoned though.

- linkffn(*All Hallow's Eve - New York*)

A fun one-shot which finds Harry Potter, Master of Death, rudely interrupted while grocery shopping when he is summoned by a madman from the Marvel Universe.

- linkffn(*Steve and The Barkeep*)

Captain America befriends Harry Potter, a local barkeeper. It's a nice story that'll leave you with a smile on your face.

- linkffn(*The Sea King* by Doghead Thirteen)

A one-shot crossover with Discovery Channel's Deadliest Catch, yes you read that right, has Hermione on a quest to track down Harry finally finding him, at sea. It's got some flaws but overall is surprisingly great.

- linkffn(*Avatar* by Von)

A crossover with James Cameron's Avatar. Harry wakes up from a magically induced coma and finds himself on an incredibly polluted Earth where magic is gone. He struggles to find a place for himself while also being in the eye of the public as a curiosity.
