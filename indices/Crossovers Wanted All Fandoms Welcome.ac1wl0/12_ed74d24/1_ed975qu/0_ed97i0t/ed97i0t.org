Heh, that's good. I find that whenever I find a good fic recommendation/request there are only 1/2 fics that take maybe half a day to read so I figured that I might as well provide lots of options for lots of reading. Then I saw a post about hating massive lists of recommendations and got self conscious, glad to see you liked my recs.
