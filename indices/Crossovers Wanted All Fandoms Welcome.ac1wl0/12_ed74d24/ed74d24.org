Tad late here, but as someone who reads almost entirely crossovers, here would be my picks.

linkffn(12772385) This one is a HP and High School DxD Crossover where Harry and Ginny don't have a good marriage, so they break and Harry goes to Japan with their only child, Lily Luna. Also, this is updated close to monthly whenever the poll's lean its way (Almost always) with chapters of 30 to 60 thousand words.

The HSDxD verse itself is a very fanservice heavy harem anime, but it's set in a world where most gods/religious figures are real, resulting in very powerful people (and also harem). HSDxD revolves around a peerage (team/family of reincarnated devils) and its place in the supernatural world.

​

next up is linkffn(9443327) A Third Path is a HP and Marvel Comics crossover featuring a "dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty" launched into the marvel comicsverse (earth 616). Also its by the same author as above and below, and is updated every couple of months with huge chapters. (avg word count of 45K).

​

And here is my personal favorite out of this author's stories. linkffn(11577249) is an HP and Star Wars crossover which takes place pre--prequel and involves Harry meeting his mums ghost who's like "I have to go now." before he goes "NO!" and teleports his little kid self to a Galaxy Far Far Away. (Also has really long chapters, updated every 2-4 months.)

This is set in the Star Wars Legends verse (All the old books like the Thrawn Trilogy), but should be readable with just an understanding of the movies (though the Clone Wars tv show would help a tad).

​

Moving on from Vimesenthusiast, we have linkffn(12307781) which is an EWE (I think that's how you use it at least) story where Harry moves to New York a couple months before Marvel's Avengers (2012). Story is updated 1-2 times a week and is currently moving into Civil War. (Kind've assumed you've watched the MCU here, lmk if you need more of an explanation.)

Also, I'd like to second the recommendation of 'Wand and Shield' great story.

​

linkffn(7591040, 8186304, 10301672) The Queen who fell to Earth and it's 2 sequels (discontinued) are HP and Dragonriders of Pern crossover stories where during the Tri-Wizard Tournament, Harry realizes he has no chance and decides that suicide by dragon is a good way to go. Instead of that happening though, one of the eggs hatch and the dragonet bonds with him as well as reawakening the intelligence buried within all Dragons. Kind of a political story and I think the pairing is supposed to be HP/HG/f!OC.

Dragonriders of Pern itself is a book series by the now deceased Anne McCaffrey and her son Todd. It's a story about humans living on a planet called Pern which is struck by astral attacks of 'Thread' that rain from the sky and eat organic matter for 50 years every 200. (Knowledge of Pern isn't really necessary for TQwftE, but it does make the story a bit more fun.)

​

linkffn(8096183) Is a D&D and HP crossover where a D&D character 'Milo' is summoned to the HP world by Lucius Malfoy, battling off the weirdos with masks, Milo gets picked up at Hogsmeade and is sent to Hogwarts to learn magic... which he can't perform as it doesn't fit with his system. Pairing might be Milo(OC)/Hannah.

D&D knowledge is required to the extent of "I know how the stats work."

​

Back to DxD and we have linkffn(11976393). Sitting on a Bench is a 4-shot Harry and Koneko in the HSDxD world. No knowledge of DxD is required. Cept for maybe knowing the characters, so a wiki could be useful for that. Or just tell me and I can provide dem knowledge drops.

​

linkffn(9622073) is a HP and Inheritance Cycle crossover featuring immortal dimension traveling MoD!Harry taking the place of Eragon's (The main char of IC) teacher 'Brom' as the latter died in front of him to poison.

IC is a 4 part series about Eragon and his Dragon Saphira as they battle against the Empire and it's dictator King Galbatorix. Thankfully, they have help in the form of the Varden, the Dwarves, and the Elves. (Parallels Star Wars a lot.)

​

linkffn(10716188) is an HP and Naruto cross where Harry is Naruto's cousin or something, Naruto finds out he has a cousin, and goes to meet cousin. Cousin takes him in, summons to soul of dead father of cousin, and talks to dead father of cousin before going with cousin back to cousin's home.

At the current point of the story (Not being updated in over a year being that point), very minor knowledge of Naruto is required, some names and places will do.

​

Also, seconding 'Itachi, Is That A Baby'.

​

linkffn(4044086) HP and Naruto where they have a shared mental space and grow up spending the nights with each other, Naruto mentions chakra, and Harry learns magic pre-Hogwarts. Knowledge of Naruto up to end of Part 1 is quite useful.)

​

llinkffn(12091997) Harry is reborn in the world of Remnant (from RWBY by Roosterteeth) and is found by Qrow Branwen (An important character in RWBY canon).

Remnant is a planet where Humanity has been forced behind walls by the forces of the Grimm, infinite waves of black soulless beasts. The main characters are four girls who go to a school for Huntsmen and Huntresses, those who protect humanity from the Grimm.

​

linkffn(11815818,12651746) Harry is kidnapped by order of Lucius Malfoy and ends up in Japan after 2nd year. Stuff happens, and he ends up trapped within Sword Art Online.

SAO is a light novel/anime series about a VRMMORPG without magic, which turned into a death game and trapping 10K starting players inside. Main characters are Kirito (loner, OPAF), Asuna (worst girl), and a bunch of harem girls who never get into the harem because there isn't one. (Argo best girl though.)

​

linkffn(11759933) and it's sequel linkffn(12089357) are HP/Star Wars stories where the Dark Lady of the Sith (like Darth Vater) is met by Riven, Bastille, and Darth Marr (Basically important people from hundreds of years before the prequels), they send her to earth to train a new order of force users to prepare for the Empire. She arrives just in time to watch Voldemort kill Lily, scare him away, and adopt Harry. Starring characters include, Horcruxes, Susan, Daphne, Ginny (none of them being the pairing), Remus, Sirius, Tonks, those other Dark Lords from Pottermore, and a few jedi from the prequels and SW: Clone Wars.

Knowledge required from Star Wars is watching the movies and Clone Wars, from HP you can safely continue ignoring Pottermore's existence as everything is explained in the story.

​

linkffn(4521407) Harry dies to Vernon when he's like 7, Snape betrays Dumbledore for Voldemort, and the Dark Lord controls most of Britan. Luna wishes for someone to help and Ben Skywalker crashes his X-Wing nearby.

Knowledge of Star Wars Legends would be "Ben Skywalker is Luke's kid, a Jedi Knight who fought in a galactic civil war, Jaina is Han and Leia's daughter, a Jedi Knight and 'Sword of the Jedi' as well as a fighter pilot, Alanna is Jaina's nephew, and her dead brother's daughter, Corran is a Correllian Jedi Knight and former member of Rogue Squadron, his kids Valin and Jysella are also here.

​

linkffn(11576387) is a fic where Kyle Katarn (Main character of some SW video games and Jedi Master) feels something in the force which urges him to go to earth. Find Harry being sad, and trains him.

Everything SW is explained pretty well.

​

linkffn(9068231) Harry fights in a war against demons, and in the last battle is sent through a destabilized portal sending him to Felucia (The planet that Aayla dies on) just in time to save Aayla Secura (The blue skinned lady with head tails).

​

And That'll do it! Thanks for reading my list, and I hope that you enjoy the stories here..
