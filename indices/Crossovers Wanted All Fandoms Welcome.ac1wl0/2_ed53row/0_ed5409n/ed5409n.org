Thank you for the recs. I love a good HP/GoT xover, so Harrenhal looks fun. I think I've read the Artificer before a while ago, but I'll have to check, but if I have thank you for putting it back on my radar. If this is the one I'm thinking of, then I remember loving it. I must admit, I don't usually go for Naruto - I tried reading the manga, and I just found it very repetitive, but this sounds like it would be cute, and I can go for cuteness every now and then. Again, thank you <3
