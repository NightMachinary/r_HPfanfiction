Thank you for your suggestions. While I have already read Tsume Yuki's work, it is a great suggestion, as it's one of my favourites that they've done recently, although I despair at Tsume Yuki's propensity to abandon their fics about 10 chapters in, just when I'm getting super invested (D:) Gives You Hell, however, I look forward to reading, and I certainly don't mind that it's Twilight; there's some good potential in the twilight universe, especially with vampires already present (and only briefly explored) in the HP universe. I've never heard of AlwaysEatTheRude21 before, but I shall definitely check out their works. Again, thank you for suggestions. <3
