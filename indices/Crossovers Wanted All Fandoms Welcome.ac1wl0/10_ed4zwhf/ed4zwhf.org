Yo, here are my favourites...

- Like the Rain Chooses the Grass by Tsume Yuki

This is a HP/Black Panther xover. I recommend this fic because it has visible and well written character development, Tsume Yuki creates a realistic Erik Killmonger who you are able to empathize with, and it has the right mix of HP-verse and MCU-verse. In regards to Black Panther, Erik Killmonger is the nephew to a previous King of Wakanda. By Wakandan law, Erik has the right to fight for the crown. However, due to circumstances in Erik's childhood he became orphaned in the slums of America. Erik grows up fighting, studying and working his arse off trying to gain the Wakandan throne and better the lives of himself and all black people.

- Gives You Hell by azzie adams

I'll probably get crap for this because of the "obligatory" "ew Twilight" but, for reals, give it a chance. If you've ever read Twilight or watched the films you'll see that family (genetic and chosen) is a major concept in the plot. I believe that Gives You Hell really showcases the strong bonds that come with family that we choose throughout time. (Also, I really dig the mention of Albus and Gallert's previourelationship [which is canon]). You probably already know or have an idea about Twilight. "Teen" animal-blood-drinking vampires live in a small town in WA, USA when a trouble-magnet Bella Swan comes to town. She attracts human-blood-drinking vampires, head coven vampires and werewolves.

Also, I'd recommend checking out Araciel and AlwaysEatTheRude21's works on ffnet as they have a lot of good quality HP xover fics. (But they tend to start a lot of new fics and they update them sporadically if infrequently).
