  You can skip the show without missing anything much.

I take issue with this, because the show is some of the very best TV you will come across... But as far as understanding the story, yeah it helps but probably isn't /needed/.

PSA for those jumping into the Firefly TV series for the first time: if you are worried you might not get into it, particularly with a pilot episode that's double the length, start with "The Train Job". It was aired as a substitute pilot since FOX thought the original pilot was too slow burn.

Don't get me wrong, I think the intended order (actual pilot first) is best. But if an hour and a half feels like too long for you to dive into, "The Train Job" is a good starting place as well.
