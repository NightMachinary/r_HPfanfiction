Though, to remind OP or anyone else: watching the show, while recommend, is NOT necessary. Watching the movie Serenity should be more than enough if you're only looking to get into the fic. The movie will give you a complete picture of the setting so there will be no confusion. But if the summary/comments of the show make you want to watch it, then definitely go in the correct order of show-movie-fic for the most complete and spoiler free experience.
