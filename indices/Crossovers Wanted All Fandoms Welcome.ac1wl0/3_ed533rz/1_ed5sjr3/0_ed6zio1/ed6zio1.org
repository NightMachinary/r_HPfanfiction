To be truthful, I'd also recommend watching the TV show. It is great at combining a future sci-fi multi-planetary civilization with western elements, while keeping the best of both. I was really disappointed they cancelled the show after just one season. At least they did pretty well with the movie and gave closure to the fans on most plot points.

The only reason I said the show could be skipped was because OP didn't want to spend too long trying to get into a new series just for reading a fic. But I'm hoping anyone who reads the fic or watches the movie will like it enough to go looking for the series themselves. It might be slightly spoiled, but I doubt anything can really take away Firefly's charm.

This was actually how I got into Worm myself, and even though it was somewhat spoiled for me, I greatly enjoyed it anyways. Great writing stands well enough on its own. Always.
