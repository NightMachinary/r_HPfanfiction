I have 1 recommendation-

Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon

It's a crossover with Firefly, a sci-fi TV show set in the future. It was cancelled after just one season, but they did an awesome movie to tie up the loose ends.

I'm not sure if I can judge whether or not the story properly explains the setting of Firefly within itself, since I already knew its plot going in. At least I don't remember having any problems even though it had been many years since I last watched the show or movie. But if you want to familiarise yourself with Firefly, you can just watch the movie (Serenity (2005)) first. I'd recommend that anyways, since it's a great standalone movie and the plot of the movie plays significant part in the fic. You can skip the show without missing anything much.

As for the fic, it's my no. 1 all time favourite Harry Potter crossover. It plays well with the canon of both sources. It doesn't make Harry out to be some OP immortal master of death, just what we actually see in the books: a regular guy with powerful magic and a slight instinctive understanding of magic (remember he mastered Patronus at 13). It just scales that up to what he might be like at age 150. And throughout the fic we see how interactions between the characters lead to personal development for all of them, not just one or two main characters.

Next, the link between the two sources is explained very well, resulting in an overarching plot that is intriguing and not something you could have guessed. Instead of going from one fight to the next, one mission after another or something like that, it can easily leave the mould of an episodic TV series, since it is set after the end of both sources. The plot of the story itself is about the link between the source fictions.

Overall it's a fun story with many jokes thrown in, and it always keeps you laughing or enjoying yourself. I haven't found many that are as good as this. I cannot recommend it enough.
