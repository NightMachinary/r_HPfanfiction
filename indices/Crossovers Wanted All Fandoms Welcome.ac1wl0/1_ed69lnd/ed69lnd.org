linkffn(8177168) Wand and Shield -- HP/Avengers crossover: surprised no one's mentioned it yet here. It is unfortunately incomplete and on hiatus, but I re-read it quite often, it's very well-written (her Tony Stark is spot-on, along with Peter Parker), and does a really good job at tying the two worlds together. Harry, as Master of Death, leaves his world and arrives in the Avengers world, where he /seems/ to be the only wizard on Earth. Timeline is set at the beginning of Iron Man (along with all the other Marvel timelines that coincide). There's a great scene in here where Harry meets Bruce Banner (in both forms). There's a cool (if obvious) parallel of the Hulk and the werewolves in the HP world.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3236603/chapters/7050041][Island of Fire]] -- HP/Temeraire crossover, but you don't need to know anything about Temeraire (well, I think -- /I/ didn't know anything about Temeraire and still greatly enjoyed it). An epistolary novel with incredible world building; if you're into magic and it's non-combative possible uses, it's a great fic. Set during the events of Goblet of Fire, a portkey mishap happened and a bunch of the wizarding students from all schools find themselves trapped on an island. The entire survival part, from gathering food to building shelter, with magic, is a delight to read.
