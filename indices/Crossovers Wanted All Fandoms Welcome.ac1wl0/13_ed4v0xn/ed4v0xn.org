*Harry Potter + Katekyo Hitman Reborn! Crossover*

The crossover itself isn't really visible at the start, tho part of that might be that I'm not overly familiar with Katekyo Hitman (I think I dropped the Manga quite quickly, might even be back when I watched Anime)... but to me this story is first a walkthrough of the HP story with a OP-(HP)politically savvy-(Female)Harry (which I enjoy greatly) with the Flames from Katekyo being introduced/discovered at the endgame of the HP story... then it seems like it's a walkthrough of the Katekyo story with HP cast being OP background characters.

The greatness imo (this story is my favorite atm) comes from the style of writing, where MCs actions/feelings are explained in a way I feel no other does... some randomish examples:

#+begin_quote
  Finding Pettigrew that very evening and getting framed for his murder and that of twelve innocent bystanders by the cowardly rat was all a bit too much for Sirius.
#+end_quote

I think it's the irreverence and past tense that make it for me...

#+begin_quote
  Squalo recognised that Luss had sent him the best Squads first. He even understood why the Sun Officer had made sure that for the early stages
#+end_quote

yea I think it's the irreverence.

#+begin_quote
  It had been four weeks since he'd changed Squads and Squalo still wasn't sure why the Mist-mook tailing Fuseau like a disgruntled duckling was called Bolla.
#+end_quote

and the way at least the Katekyo segment is chock full of these types of descriptions of events... I simply love the tone of it all.

oh, quick note; the Harry is Sirius' daughter blood adopted into the potters due to james being sterile thing... it's just there for 1-3chapters at the begining then mostly ignored. (I felt a bit skewed out about that semi-ntr part)
