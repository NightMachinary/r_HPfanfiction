Thank you for this suggestion, although I have read this story before. I certainly enjoyed the story and enjoyed the writing and probably got to at least the halfway point before finally getting bored with the Katekyo part, but I did eventually tire of the very slow plot, unfortunately. I believe I still have the fic saved somewhere though, so it might be time to pick up where I left off and see if I still enjoy it. Thank you again for the recommendation though <3
