Ooh, this looks interesting. Thank you for what looks to be a very fun fic. And I loved Buffy as a child, but I don't think I've ever read a Buffy fanfiction. I have my reservations about multi-xovers, I must admit, but the premise of universe hopping and your description does alleviate a lot of those fears. I'll definitely give it a go. Again, thank you for the rec <3
