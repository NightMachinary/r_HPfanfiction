The concept of universe hopping seems like a good way to get to play with all the different worlds but you don't run into the issue with having to make them play nice with each other. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds to me like it will be like a number of mini ficlets, in different crossovers with an over-arching story, which I certainly don't have a problem with. This seems like a fun read, and I will get on it <3
