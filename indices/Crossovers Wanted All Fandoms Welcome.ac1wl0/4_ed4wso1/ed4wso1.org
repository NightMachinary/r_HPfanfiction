[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]] I am recommending this specifically because I have never seen it recommended on here before. It is decently well written and is the start of a bunch of sequels (both official and unofficial).

Because of a prophecy Hermione goes universe hopping to pick up some heroines to help her deal with a demonic invasion. Crosses over with Buffy, Stargate, Secret World of Alex Mac, DC , and Million Dollar Woman. You don't really need to know much about the other fandoms for this one. They explain what you need in the story. I hand never heard of Alex Mac before reading this so it should be pretty accessible to any HP fan
