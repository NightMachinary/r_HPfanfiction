Flameraiser works :

Who's This White Kid? linkffn(13095858) which is an Avengers crossover. It's pretty recent so not so much to tell about it. Harry gets transported in the Avengers universe in his infant body and bonds with a panther. He's most likely in Africa and will encounter Wakandan population but it's speculation for now.

The Swallow and the Dragon linkffn(12343855) Witcher crossover where Harry meets Ciri after learning of the prophecy. It changes his life and after beating Voldemort he's bored (he's immortal) so he goes through the Veil hoping to find Ciri again. He does indeed stumble in her world long before her birth so he decides to wait for her while preparing the World to be better for when they'll finally meet again. Lot of world building and happens on a long period of time which I like.

Let's Try This Again linkffn(11761091) SW/HP crossover. Harry is tired of living but cannot die so Death try to cheer him up and send him in another universe. He meets Revan and Bastila. Revan disappears so Harry uses his unlimited time looking for him even if he must become a Sith for that. I like it because like with the Witcher crossover it happens on a long period of time and his immortality is put to good use.
