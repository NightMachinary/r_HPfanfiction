This is such an interesting idea. - I'd love to see a Hagrid-raises-Harry story. I am not 100% sure Hagrid would make the most responsible guardian (loving? Sure. Responsible? Uhmmm...), but even that could create some interesting story material.

The only problem is that Hagrid is unquestionably, completely, loyal to Dumbledore, and going against his wishes (to the point of fleeing the country even), seems so very out of character for him.

Hmmm, maybe that /is/ why he is moving, though. He feels lousey for taking the kid, but at the same time feels like he cannot /not/ take him. But now he does not know how to face Dumbledore and tries to avoid that confrontation not because he is suspicious of Dumbledore or anything like that, but because he just cannot deal with seeing dissapoinment in the older man's eyes.
