Hagrid revved the bike to life, and took off. He waited until he heared the tell tale sounds of apparation, before circling back to pick up the shivering bundle on the step of Number 4 Privet Drive.

"As good o' a man as Dumbledore is, it ain't right to leave such a little tyke out in the cold like this. Why... Lily" he sniffled as he continued to speak, almost trying to refrain from crying "she always said her sister was the worst gal ye ever did see. She, yer mum, little Harry, showed me some of them letters yer aunt sent. They were horrible, nasty things, and I reckon she'd be horrible to you. So, I do belive I'll be takin' ya with me, and I'll do my best to keep ya safe." Hagrid tucked the little bundle back into the modified side car, and flew off into the night, soon becoming a blink of light in the distance. Petunia was not startled when she walked out the next morning to get the milk bottles, and all the cupboard was used for was to stash away more junk of Dudley's.

Harry and Hagrid adopted new identities, Hagrid now going by Rory Haward, and Harry became Louis Cooper. 'Louis' grew up around interesting, sometimes dangerous creatures, thanks to Rory, like wood nymphs, thestrals, hippogriffs, dugbogs, and nogtails. Animals were attracted to him, loved him, and found they could easily communicate with the young boy. He became fluent in French, as did Rory, thanks to Madame Maxime, the half giant headmistress of Beauxbatons.

"Bonjour, petit Louis. Comment vas-tu aujord'hui?" inquired the woman, as she walked down the large expanse of field to the little cottage on the outskirts of the grounds.

"Bonjour, Madame Maxime. Je vais bien aujord'hui, comment allez vous?" The rather tall, lanky boy asked, as he pushed his glasses up his nose.

"Ah, très bien. Je me sens merveilleux, comme le temps est beau, n'est-ce pas?" Madame Maxime had finally reached the small house, pulling to a stop near Louis.

" Le temps est magnifique. Rory dit qu'il s'attend à ce que nous ayons plus de jours ensoleillés bientôt."

"Ce serait merveilleux, mais je crois que les prévisions météorologiques de Rory sont un peu erronées, non?" She gestured to the dark clouds rolling in on the horizon, chuckling at how horribly Rory could predict the weather. "Dites-moi, où est Monsieur Haward, j'ai une question pour lui." 1/?
