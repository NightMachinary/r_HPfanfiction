  Translation charms. Even if they're not canon, this is fanfiction.

Hagrid was kicked out of Hogwarts partway through third year. Basically he's a seventh-grade dropout, with a snapped wand. Unless he has someone dedicated to casting and recasting non-canon spells on him day after day, that won't work.

He hasn't been all that understanding in the books. Not even of Harry saying he doesn't want to go back to the Dursleys when he's 12 or more. It doesn't seem likely he'd go along with Harry out of the country at 1.

You can take all kinds of twists and turns to force the idea to work, but once your workarounds look like a pretzel it'll be tough to sell. Fanfiction is fanfiction, but if you're rewriting entire characters to make it work the OOC kills SOD.
