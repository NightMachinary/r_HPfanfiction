  Hagrid doesn't speak French. He barely speaks English.

Translation charms. Even if they're not canon, this is fanfiction.

  While the French magicals are less prejudiced than the English ones, the odds against him getting a job at Beauxbatons are huge.
#+end_quote

We know nothing about France beyond a little bit about Beauxbatons. For all we know, giants are kept as pets there. Madame Maxime being headmistress despite being half-giant does imply that France is less prejudiced, as you said, and so I don't see why Hagrid would be denied a job for not being fully human.

  Plus he'll be an international criminal who stole a baby and crossed national borders, against the orders of the Holy Dumbledore, in whom Hagrid has total faith.
#+end_quote

I'd like to think Dumbledore would understand, unless you're going for an evil/manipulative Dumbledore. Hagrid having faith in Dumbledore is a good point, but Hagrid isn't an idiot. As Dumbledore himself said, “I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being --- forgive me --- rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.”

  There's way too much OOC here to make this work.

I disagree, but anyways, this is /fanfiction/.
