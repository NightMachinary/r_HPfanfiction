Hagrid doesn't speak French. He barely speaks English. While the French magicals are less prejudiced than the English ones, the odds against him getting a job at Beauxbatons are huge. Plus he'll be an international criminal who stole a baby and crossed national borders, against the orders of the Holy Dumbledore, in whom Hagrid has total faith. There's way too much OOC here to make this work.
