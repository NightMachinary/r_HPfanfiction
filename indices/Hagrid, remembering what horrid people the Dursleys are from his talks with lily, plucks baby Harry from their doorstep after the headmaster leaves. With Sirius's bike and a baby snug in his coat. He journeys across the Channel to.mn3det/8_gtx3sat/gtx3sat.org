Hagrid was just about to start his bike again when he heard Harry cry. Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall had already Disapparated and Hagrid was alone on the street. Alone and in doubt. Could he leave a baby out in the cold? And not just any baby, but the child of his friends Lily and James. It didn't take long for Hagrid to make a decision. As much as he respected professor Dumbledore, he simply could not leave a baby in the cold to freeze to death. He could not live with himself if he did. Decision made Hagrid got off the bike, picked Harry up and flied away into the night.

After a few minutes of the cold air hitting his face, he could think a bit more clearly. Staying in Britain was out of the question. Dumbledore would find him in less than a day. Hagrid wasn't worried- he knew Dumbledore would not harm him. He couldn't face the disappointment on Dumbledore's face and he also knew Harry would be left with those horrible muggles again. Hagrid briefly contemplated settling in Siberia and starting his very own dragon reserve. After indulging in that dream Hagrid realised that the harsh winters and giant fire-breathing creatures would not be conducive to raising a child. He then remembered visiting rural France some years ago to attend a Jump (and Fly) race of Abraxans and meeting madam Maxime. (The flying horses although large were surprisingly agile and quick). But more importantly than horse racing- would madam Maxime take Harry in? Would France be far enough from Dumbledore?

The next morning classes at Beauxbatons were disrupted by a very strange appearance. A half- giant soaked through (it had rained over The Channel), clutching a small bundle that was somehow still dry, was banging his fists on the chateau's gate. The headmistress promptly exited the building, wand drawn, and ordered the students inside and the teachers to bar the door and protect the students.

“/Who are you and what is your business here?/” asked the headmistress harshly.

“Can you speak English? My French is a bit rusty.” Hagrid answered jovially undeterred by the severe look on the woman's face.

“Who are you and what do you want?” madam Maxime repeated her question.

“Good morning, I am Hagrid. We met several years ago at the races. I work at Hogwarts” he was trying to look presentable, but hesitated “I ‘ave come to ask you to take this child and protect it. His parents were murdered by the Dark Lord”

Madam Maxime's expression softened somewhat, but her voice remained firm: “If you are monsieur ‘Agrid then what was I wearing when me met?”

Hagrid had to rack his brain hard to remember that sunny afternoon he spent in Maxime's company. “A green dress with a Beauxbatons badge and a white hat, madam” he answered. This reassured Maxime it was really Hagrid and besides that the effects of Polyjuice on giants and half-giants were notoriously... unpleasant. And so, she invited them into her office.

“So he is truly gone then? Dead?” Maxime asked excitedly. In the last few months there were several incidents of missing people in the area of Caen. The journalists had had a field day with speculating it was the British Dark Lord branching out.

“Aye, he's gone. For now. Merlin knows what dark magic he possesses. I wouldn't be surprised if he returned one day” Hagrid had tears on his face as he had told Maxime of the fall of the Potters. “That's why I've come here, to ask for your help. Can you take ‘Arry and protect him? I respect professor Dumbledore. But he wanted to leave poor ‘Arry with his muggle relatives. He would have been completely defenceless and ignorant.”

Madam Maxime remained silent for a long time, thinking. “I understand your plight monsieur ‘Agrid. But what do you expect of me? This is a school, not a nursery or kindergarten” The desperation was evident in Hagrid's eyes and it moved her. She continued “Return tomorrow morning and you will have my answer”

Fortunately, Hagrid always carried his money in one of his expendable pockets so he rented a room at a nearby tavern. This proved somewhat difficult as he spoke little French and had to convince the innkeeper he hadn't abducted Harry. Well, he had /technically/ done that, but it was all for the greater good as professor Dumbledore was wont to say. Finding nappies for little Harry and changing them proved a challenge for him, but in the end he succeeded.

On the next morning Hagrid, along with Harry, was again sitting in madame Maxime's office and waiting. “Good morning, ‘Agrid. I have good news. I spent yesterday researching how to help you and found a legal precedent. It hasn't been used in a while, but I believe we can grant young Harry “scholastic sanctuary” It would protect Harry until he is off age and allow him to live here.” Maxime explained. Hagrid was very happy to hear that Harry would be safe. He didn't worry for himself too much. He could always find work with his experience and knowledge on animals. Or he could always just lift heavy stuff in construction.
