The students at Hogwarts were excited to meet the foreigners from Beauxbatons. But what really caught their eyes were the two large figures of the headmistress and Hagrid. The reappearance of their lost hero Harry Potter drew gasps from the crowd. He had been gone for so long that everyone focused on him and not the blonde girl holding his hand. Not being the center of attention was a new, and welcome, experience for Fleur Delacour. She was not going to participate in this tournament as she quite liked her body intact and free from scars. However, madam Maxime had explained she needed Hagrid to tend to the abraxans and everyone knew that where Hagrid went Harry followed. Maxime had offered to write a recommendation letter and introduce Fleur to the famous Charms mistress d'Amboise. The truth was that Maxine didn't have to cajole Fleur too much to come to Scotland. As much as she wanted to become a charms mistress, Fleur also valued her friendship with Harry Potter very much.

She thought to that autumn morning four years ago when she had first met him. Harry, being British and raised by a half-giant was the odd one out and was being bullied by upper year students. Fleur had made a short work of them with a few charms that ensured them an embarrassing visit to the school nurse. Harry had been following her everywhere after that. This had irritated Fleur greatly at first- she already had an annoying little sister and didn't need an annoying little pseudo-brother.

However, as she had come into her Veela heritage Fleur became more and more lonely as the other girls envied her and the boys lusted after her. She found herself enjoying Harry's company more as he seemed unaffected by her changes. He always had a new story about his guardian and the creatures they looked after or a new quidditch move. And thus, Harry and Fleur's friendship started in earnest. The last year had been marked by thoughts that made Fleur blush and worry because Harry was too young and she didn't want to ruin their friendship. And now she had the chance to spend this year personally tutoring Harry. Yes, things were looking good for Fleur Delacour and not even the dismal Scottish climate could dampen her spirits. Harry Potter would be hers before the year was out.

Hagrid, on the other hand, was on pins and needles. He had abandoned professor Dumbledore and taken Harry thirteen years prior. He was amazed, and a little saddened, that no one had ever come to look for Harry. Hagrid had become an apprentice to the local magizoologist and after a few years had saved enough money to open his own veterinary clinic. His gentle nature and vast knowledge of creatures had ensured the success of his business. People from all corners of France came to his clinic with their creatures raging from crups to hippogriffs and thestrals and on one memorable occasion a real dragon egg. After a brief internal struggle Hagrid notified the French ministry so they could transfer the egg to a dragon reserve. Now, he was scheduled to meet with professor Dumbledore at his office after dinner.

“Good evening, Hagrid. I am happy to see you in good health after all those years” Dumbledore greeted him later that evening. Hagrid was feeling like a little firstie in the headmaster's office and was surprised at his jovial tone.

“Professor Dumbledore, sir, I can explain” Hagrid began, but was interrupted by the headmaster.

“There is nothing to explain my friend. It is perhaps, I who owes you an apology. I shouldn't have left Harry with his muggle relatives. A year after you... left Vernon Dursley was arrested and sent to prison for embezzlement. They really were the worst sort of muggles” Dumbledore explained and Hagrid felt his fear lessen.

“I... dunno what to say, ‘eadmaster. I expected you'd be angry with me” Hagrid falter.

“I was at first. But on the evening after you left, I had a most enlightening conversation with madam Maxime. She informed me both you and Harry were safe and about the legal precedent she had found.” Dumbledore pretend not to notice the look of astonishment and surprise on Hagrid's face. “I suppose I would have been angry had you taken Harry to a less secure place. But Beauxbatons has centuries old protection and living there would let Harry grow up away from his fame.”

Hagrid felt relief wash over his body. Even after all those years he was afraid he had disappointed and let down Dumbledore. And there was Dumbledore greeting him like an old friend and congratulating him on a job well done. Dumbledore was truly a great man.

The End.

AU: Well, this got a bit longer than intended and I was trying to keep it brief. But I have a few errands to run so I'll just stop here. I'm sorry, but I hate, /hate/ writing accents and halfway through realised I also have no idea how to write Hagrid's dialogue. And I just couldn't keep myself from inserting Fleur in there. And I totally stole the scholastic sanctuary from Philip Pullman, so sorry about that as well.

Edit: Thanks for the award.
