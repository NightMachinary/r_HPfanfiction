Interesting... kinda reminds me of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160475/1/Harry-McGonagall][Harry McGonagall]] wherein McGonagall takes him and takes him to a squib nephew of hers who is about to move to America, applying permanent transfigurations to his hair color, fingerprints, and footprints so he won't match any records that may exist from Lily taking him to muggle doctors. He also gets a (step) sister lol
