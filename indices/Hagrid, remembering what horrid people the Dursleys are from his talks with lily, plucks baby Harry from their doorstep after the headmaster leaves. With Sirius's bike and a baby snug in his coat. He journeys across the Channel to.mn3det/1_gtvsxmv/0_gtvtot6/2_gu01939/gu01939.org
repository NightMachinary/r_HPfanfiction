...given that she's born a couple years or so after Harry so they grow up together, the closest they get to that is when she steals Harry's wand (he gets pre-Hogwarts American magical schooling cause of course Hogwarts is behind the times lol) to play with it and try to cast spells, Harry gets angry and charges her yelling, she accidentally stuns him in a panic at his anger, and then she freaks out thinking she'd killed him... but he's fine and this being her first accidental magic everyone gets over it (I say that's the closest cause technically she's handling his wand lol, just not the wand I think you meant... or maybe my brain is just in the sewer but that's normal for me)
