This is perfect. It illustrates Hagrid's respect for Dumbledore, but doesn't cliche it down to 'Dumbledore is perfect' and makes it more nuanced.

Presuming there's no bullshit 'Dumbledore can magically find Harry anywhere (there has to be a limit to that deluminator)' I could see Hagrid being safe in France and Harry not being discovered for a long time.
