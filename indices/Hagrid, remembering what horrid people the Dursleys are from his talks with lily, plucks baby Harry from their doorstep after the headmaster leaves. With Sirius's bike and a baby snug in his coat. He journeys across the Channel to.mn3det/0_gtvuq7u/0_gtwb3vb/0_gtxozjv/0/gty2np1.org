I've seen that in a fanfic, but I don't recall the books ever saying how far it extended. I could be wrong.

Now granted, I think "Britain"wide makes sense, as I really hate the idea of bullshit magic able to find people across the world. :) One could even say outside distance, it'd be stopped by the water, a lot of magic is in myths. But that's a headcanon.
