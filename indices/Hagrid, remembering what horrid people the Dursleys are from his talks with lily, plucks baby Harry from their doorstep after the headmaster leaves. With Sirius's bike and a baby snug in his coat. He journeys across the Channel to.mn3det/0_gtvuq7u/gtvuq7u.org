Hagrid hopped on Sirius' bike once more and looked at the house where Dumbledore had put little Harry.

"Good man, that Dumbledore." he muttered, looking towards the witch and wizard as they disapperated.

Minerva had told him a little about what she had seen from the muggles as Albus settled Harry in. It wasn't good or flattering... And that wasn't including what Lily had told him in the past nine years he had known her and James.

"He's a good man, Albus Dumbledore is." Rubeus said again, a little louder to himself as he started up the motor bike. It barely hummed and he couldn't feel the vehicle shake beneath him at all.

Lily had often came to him, crying over losing her sister, ever since first year. Petunia had been happy at first... Then came the realization that Petunia wasn't a witch too. Hagrid felt for the poor girl, he too was stuck looking into a magical society he wasn't allowed to fully be a part of. But where he had remained optimistic and jovial, Lily's sister had grown jealous and hateful.

He still remembered her seventh year, when Lily had come crying to him that first night because no one else would understand. Petunia had slapped her and called her a freak that had gotten their parents killed just before Lily had left for school...

He wasn't sure if they had spoken at ALL since then.

"Albus Dumbledore is a good man," he declared loudly to the night, "But even good men make mistakes." and with that he was off the bike and scooping up Harry. "It's going to be ok Harry..... Ain't nobody gunna hurt you. Even if I gotta fly across the Channel to keep you safe."

With naught but two large strides the giant was back at his bike and had put little Harry back into the side car, fitting the one year old like a bassinet for an infant. And with little more than a brief rev of the engine, the pair were gone into the southern sky.
