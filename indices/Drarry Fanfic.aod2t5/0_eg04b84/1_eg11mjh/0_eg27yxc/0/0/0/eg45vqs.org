It isn't even, at least not yet, a Dramonie fic yet right after the Battle of Hogwarts when Hermione decides to leave she give Draco a way of keeping track of her and gives him a letter to give to Harry. There was obviously no other way of giving something to Harry. And what was the genius idea of giving somebody you just fought against a way of tracking you?

I'm sorry but some author's seems to just skip the "Giving a reason" part of making such interactions seem plausible. And does it just because.

I know that based upon the summary it might sound like That class of fics, but it isn't.
