It might be fun to have a free-form RPG where the PCs are very rich Muggles in the post-Voldemort Potterverse who got a hold of some preliminary evidence of magic and are trying to learn more about the wizarding world while flying under the proverbial radar. (Very rich, because it means that they can have easy access to things like bodyguards, DNA sequencing, and whatever else they feel like using, /from Muggle world/.)

It'd require the players to be /very/ good at separating player knowledge from character knowledge, though.
