Why? You wouldn't want to see Hipster Wizards?

Thats actually a good point though you brought up. Harry Potter had a very cool feel that would really only work in the UK. I agree that I don't think it would translate well to America.

Very curious to see the world outside of the UK. But it would be very difficult for JK to world build like that given that she has written the wizarding world to have a certain look.
