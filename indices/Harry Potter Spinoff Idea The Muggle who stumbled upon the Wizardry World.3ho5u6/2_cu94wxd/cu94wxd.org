linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

There's a sideplot with a muggle police officer finding out about magic, is obliviated, but she has already written the report on the station's new computer (1993, ye?), so she realizes something is wrong.

Her adventures trying to figure out more about this world is probably the best part of this fic, and she gains more and more scene-time as the story goes on.

As for your idea, I like it - as long as there isn't any mugglewank, the characters are done well and it's paced well enough. I can see a setting like this be quite hard to pull of right.
