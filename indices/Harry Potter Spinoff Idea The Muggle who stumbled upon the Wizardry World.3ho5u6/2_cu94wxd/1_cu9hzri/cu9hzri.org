Ok, haha, sorry what is "muggle wank?" This is literally an idea I had last night and I have never even read any fan fic or been to this subreddit.

Yeah, a lot of people told me about that story - I got to check it out. I am thinking the character to be like a cross between Artemis Fowl, Tony Stark and a James Roday Character from Pysch. I want him to be cheeky, smart, cocky and confident. Incredibly likable. Basically constantly cracking jokes but he has the skills to back it up because there really has not been a character like that in the series and I also think he would be super fun to write.

The sole focus would not be on the kid. Probably for the first 1/3 of the book would be just him. Him talking to his father and beginning his investigation would be like the first 2 -5 chapters of the book. He would then meet with the government (i am not sure how, most likely immediately after) because they are curious about this world. I really love the idea of the US government (or UK) having knowledge of wizards but it is some super secret stuff, like only a handful of people know. Think X-Men first class when the guy from the CIA brings the mutants to his base. But I DO NOT want the Humans to have ways to negate magic. That would be too game breaking I feel. Like if they had "silence" grenades or helmets that prevented "Obliviate." That would be way too complex and make the humans too powerful. I mean, they would have obviously a very strong technical advantage and maybe in the inevitable firefight they get a kill or two, but they still get destroyed.

I also would like down the road for the kid to meet a wizard (female) and introduce that kind of love story. For starters, I think it would be really fun to see a muggle impress a wizard with his skills, his tools from the muggle world and what not. It would be fun to see a female wizard who has a certain disdain for the muggle, slowly become infatuated with this world. Like basically you get to see a wizard and a muggle fall in love (akin to Harry Potters Parents). Because you only read about it, in the series, in terms of they are already married. I would like to see it unfold. This would also make for a funny epilogue sequence with the kids.

But honestly, I got like maybe a 1/3 of the story figured out. I have no idea who the villain would be or what would happen after he meets this girl. Would he go to Hogwarts? I am thinking this all takes place before Voldemort and have the "big bad" be some disciple of his who has plans to do something bad (like destroy Hogwarts, Kill Dumbledore, blow up Diagon Alley, etc). That feels a little bit to generic for my taste. I was thinking of introducing maybe a human villain as well. An eccentric rich billionaire who wants to rid the world of magic for his own crazy reasons. I feel that this is where the story goes awry because I want the story to stand on it's own and not really re-introduce characters from Harry Potter's world. But it would be a hell of a lot easier to do so because the world is already there and I wouldn't have to envision a whole other school and what not.

Ok, I am just rambling here - I am not sure if I will ever write this but the ideas are fun.
