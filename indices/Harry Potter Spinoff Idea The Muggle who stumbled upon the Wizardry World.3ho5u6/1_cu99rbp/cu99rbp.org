  The father goes through years of data that he collected about this magical world. Blurry pictures, broken wands, weird magical artifacts that don't work and so on. The kid slowly becomes convinced about this.

The first several plot arcs of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings%20With][/With Strength of Steel Wings/]] (W: 719,300; WiP) are like this. The difference being that Harry's still a wizard, and so they eventually use him to try and infiltrate the magical world (since he's the only one who can get past the anti-muggle / pro-wizard barriers).

  I would so love to see a muggle in the world of Harry Potter. Using his wits and what not to survive without magic. I think it might be super interesting.

Somewhere into the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][/Resonance trilogy/]] (W: 1,713,423; Abandoned), there's a peripheral character that does this. Unfortunately the idea doesn't get explored and featured to its full potential.

I think if done well this can be a great story. Especially since the protagonist himself is a child and doesn't have a powerful patron to be supporting his endeavours. If you decide to write it, please make a new thread linking to the first chapters.
