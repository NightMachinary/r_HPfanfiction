Kind of thinking Artemis Fowl meets Tony Stark. Like a very smart kid but he's incredibly cheeky and constantly pokes fun at the magic world (like the newspapers and what not).

I would like for him to be a bit older than a kid, like 15-17 only because it would make sense for him to know certain things I plan on him knowing.

Also having the government involved would be an interesting but complex subplot. I wouldn't want the muggles to have tools that could silence magic or negate it (unless a rogue wizard taught them). I would love a scene of guns versus wands because that would just be fun to witness.
