I love a good Weasley bashing but it is canon that the Weasleys are financially irresponsible.

1. They can't afford to buy Ron a wand but they run off to Romania for Christmas.
2. They win the lottery and blow the money going on holiday to Egypt.
3. They only have 1 Galleon and 58 Sickles (approx. 21 pounds) in their Gringotts vault.
