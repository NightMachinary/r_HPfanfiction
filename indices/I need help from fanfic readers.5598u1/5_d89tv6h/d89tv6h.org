As far as keeping with the Dramione theme, I enjoyed An [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=582][Aversion to Change]] (need an account to read the story), as well as *Aurelian*, *Silencio* and [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=212][A Pound of Flesh]]. Everyone and their mother loves [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=1][The Fallout]] but it was much too angsty for me to remotely enjoy, however you might like it.
