This might not be what you're looking for but it has amazing world building. It's on going bit really worth the read. It follows Percy as the main character, but has alot of nice bonding moments between the weasleys.

Description: A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.
