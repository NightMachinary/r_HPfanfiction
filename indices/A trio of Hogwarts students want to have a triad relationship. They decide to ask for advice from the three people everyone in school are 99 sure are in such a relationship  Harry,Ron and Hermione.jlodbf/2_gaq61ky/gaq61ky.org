Guy comes to the trio as they are hanging together in the common room.

"So, wanted an advice... Everyone knows you three have a pretty close relationship"

Ron said "Can't be closer, alright"

"And you fullfil each others appetites..."

Harry's and Hermione's eyebrows go up at once as a scarlet color comes to their faces.

"It's not like-" Hermione hurries but is interrupted by Ron.

"All the time," Ron says, thinking of food, "And Hermione knows I have a big appetite, she says so all the time!"

Hermione's cheeks go even redder.

"Err mate, I don't think you realize..." Harry started.

"And you are into sandwiches. If you know what I mean..." The guy asked.

"Tons... All the time... Of all kinds... Just the other day Harry and I had just had our share and Hermione let me had hers."

"Ronald!" Hermione shouted as Harry scratched his head in embarrassment.

"Thanks, I'll tell my friends you could give us some tips," the guy said as he left.
