I remember reading one where Susan and Hannah offered to replace Ron (it was 4th year, pre dragons), with one of them willing to change to male if that was the ratio Harry and Hermione preferred. Totally weirded out our heroes.

Didn't go anywhere, other than being the springboard to the rest of the story.

(I think it was a Rorschach's Blog story where Harry ends up building his own island in the Pacific.)
