The issue is not committing to characters. I've made several attempts, but it's pretty difficult to come up with an in-depth character who is, to a certain degree, original.

And once you have written a few stories, you begin to run into the issue of having used the characterisation. I don't want to write Katie Bell like, for example, Penelope Clearwater from Dawn of Darkness, or Pansy Parkinson from Accidentally Married.
