Hmm I think there's plenty of avenues to pursue: Maybe she has other interests besides Quidditch? Maybe she isn't even that big into Quidditch and just does it, because her father wants her to play (wow, such character development)? Maybe she's generally aloof and likes to play hard to get (ice queen of Gryffindor?). Maybe she has a huge shoe collection or is secretly way more into makeup than Lavender&Parvati and scoffs at their terrible fashion sense? Or maybe she's a huge space nerd and has every book by Carl Sagan + a VHS set of Cosmos?

I feel like people are sometimes just afraid to invest in their characters, especially when they are love interests. You could probably just throw a dart at a board of characteristics and just force yourself to commit to wherever it lands and build on that.
