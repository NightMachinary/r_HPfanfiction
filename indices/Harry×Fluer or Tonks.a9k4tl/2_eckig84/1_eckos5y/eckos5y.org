Personally I think Fleur (and Tonks) make a lot more sense than somebody like Cho for Harry's first crush. Older, flirty, beautiful, they check all the right boxes for it and I think it's realistic for Harry to end up with somebody older and more emotionally mature based on the life he lived. I think he would very much want that kind of stability. Katie Bell is another character that I think checks enough of the boxes that it would be interesting to seem somebody really develop that character as a genuine love interest for Harry.
