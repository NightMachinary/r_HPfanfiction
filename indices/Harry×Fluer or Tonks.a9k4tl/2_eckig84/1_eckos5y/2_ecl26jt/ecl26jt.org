I like Katie as a school fling or one shot character, but I think she lacks the depth to be a good character in a focused romantic fic. To me her entire character is fun and engaging enough for the reader to be invested in the relationship, but she won't form a deep enough romantic partnership with him to prevent the inevitable breakup. For me she's the perfect first relationship girl for Harry.
