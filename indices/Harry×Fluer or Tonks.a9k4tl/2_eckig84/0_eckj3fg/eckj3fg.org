Not OP but the main reasons are:

- Attractive woman
- Socially isolated
- Magically gifted
- Opens options for creativity with French/continental magical community
- Magical creature themes

Not all of those do it for me but fics like linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter--the-Wastelands-of-Time]]) and linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]) opened the door for me on her as a viable character.
