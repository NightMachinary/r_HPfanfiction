A Group of two Wizards polyjuiced followed by two More invisible, and two More on the Air (dissilusioned). The invisible ones acts as taggers, those polyjuiced stun the Target and put him on a Bubble charm+body binding hex, then bag him on an extended bag, finally the bag is taken by air team using a portkey, the other members get out and portkey/apparate away.
