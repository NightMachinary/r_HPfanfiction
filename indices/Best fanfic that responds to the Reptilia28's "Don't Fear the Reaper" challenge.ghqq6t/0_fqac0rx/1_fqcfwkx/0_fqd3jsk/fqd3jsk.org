  Harleen squirmed in her seat, her cheeks flushing a brilliant red as her eyes darted about and her fingers plucked nervously at the potions vials in the box in front of her. "Uh... i-if you're asking if I'm at-attracted to girls... well... well, I'd have to say yes," she admitted meekly. "But I swear, I would never-"

  "I have already said that I believe you, Miss Potter, let us let that lie. This does present a small problem however. The boys and girls dorms are separate in order to help discourage any... explorations amongst the students, however there is no such consideration for students of the same gender."

Now, I understand her point and I understand why are boys and girls dormitories separated, but tell me where exactly does this leave gays and lesbians to sleep? On the top of the Astronomy Tower? McGonagall then doesn't follow on her talk and she is quite an enabler of the Harriet/Hermione explorations (I mean really, you give Harriet this spiel and then you put them two alone in a dorm, really? Of course, I know, that the story is a soft porn, so they need to be alone, but it doesn't make much sense in the logic within the story), but still I don't understand what are the policies of McGonagall towards gays/lesbians. If there are thousand students at Hogwarts at any given time, it is statistically probable that there are around forty of them homosexual. Did McGonagall ever met another one?
