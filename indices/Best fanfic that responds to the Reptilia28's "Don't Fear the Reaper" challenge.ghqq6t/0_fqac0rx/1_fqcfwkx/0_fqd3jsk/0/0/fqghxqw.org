I don't want to drag this thread longer, because one throw-away comment is not worthy of it, but just two points:

I didn't say that the author is a homophobe, just when writing femslash it was surprisingly not well thought through, but my conclusion is that this is one of 99% of all slash/femslash stories which are not the authentically interested in the LGBT situation, but it just a soft-porn using homosexuality for titillation. (I am not a gay myself, but I was very touched by the raw authenticity of linkffn(12507814) ... it is about the transgender Harry, so we actually still don't know what orientation he/she is, but it was written by somebody who is transgender him/herself and it rings as real).

So, no I was not questioning his support for homosexuals but how much thought he put into their world-building.
