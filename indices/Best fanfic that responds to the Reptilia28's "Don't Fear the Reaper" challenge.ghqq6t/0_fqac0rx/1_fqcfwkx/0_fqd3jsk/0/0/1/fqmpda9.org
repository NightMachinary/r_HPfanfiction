That's fair enough. I assumed based on your statement that the author was a self-proclaimed supporter of gay rights or something, and that the story made you question that (I didn't think you were saying they were homophobic, just not really supportive of LGBT like you implied). And like I said, it could very well be that the author just didn't think too hard on the world-building of that portion of their story. I definitely think the story has quite a few flaws, but I enjoy discussion/debate so I figured I'd defend the author since I didn't really see anything wrong with it. Personally I wouldn't call it soft-porn (granted I haven't read it in a while so I might be forgetting some stuff)- there's a bit of sexual content (I'd say PG-13 level) but not enough for me to call it that. It might turn to that, but I'll reserve judgement until later on.

TL;DR: I don't heavily disagree with your argument, I just enjoy discussion/debate and found what you were saying lacking in evidence. The story is definitely flawed in quite a few ways, and I agree that if the author really wanted to make an in-depth story about gay relationships in the wizarding world they should have done better in the world-building.
