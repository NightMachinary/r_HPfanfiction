  Harleen nodded and took out the box of potions from the inside pocket of her robes, expanding it as Minerva continued speaking. "Miss Brown... from what I was able to gather in speaking to her while you showered and dressed this morning... it appears that her primary concern in sharing a dorm with you is that she is uncomfortable sharing a space with someone that she thinks might look at her in a... less than platonic manner. Now, while I do not believe that you would ever use your situation to take advantage of any of the other girls, I fear I must ask if there is any truth to Miss Brown's concerns?"

This is the context of the quote. The reason they're discussing the dorm arrangements is because another student is uncomfortable, not purely because Harleen is a lesbian. So this:

#+begin_quote
  Now, I understand her point and I understand why are boys and girls dormitories separated, but tell me where exactly does this leave gays and lesbians to sleep?
#+end_quote

doesn't really present much of an argument, since we really can't say that Lavender would be uncomfortable if it wasn't for Harleen's change in sex.

#+begin_quote
  I mean really, you give Harriet this spiel and then you put them two alone in a dorm, really?
#+end_quote

In all fairness, she essentially says that she trusts them not to do anything inappropriate, even if she encourages the relationship.

Anyway, I don't think the fact that the author possibly didn't put too much thought into the history of gays and lesbians at Hogwarts means that they're not supportive of gay people, just that they didn't put a lot of world-building into the history of gay people at Hogwarts. However, I'll act as if they did and play author's advocate.

Like I pointed out before, the main reason for the dorm change is because Lavender is uncomfortable with Harleen because of her transformation. It's possible that, normally, students don't have much of a problem with their gay or lesbian dorm mates assuming that they've been friends for a few years before they start becoming more interested in romantic/sexual relationships. So they'd have a friendship established before they come out as gay or lesbian, and it isn't seen as deceitful like it is in the Lavender/Harleen case seen here. However, if a student does take issue with it, then there's already a solution presented within the story: to give them their own dorm room, open to be shared with friends if they want. They aren't completely isolated or anything since the common room is still open for them to see everyone, it just provides them with a private room to change and sleep.

There's also the fact that many not-straight people stay in the closet, or at least don't talk openly about their sexuality. Especially considering the fact that this takes place in the 90s, and we don't really know how canon wizarding culture views those people. This is somewhat supported by the fact that Hermione is a lesbian but never tells anyone. However, if it's generally an accepting culture, then this would only be a discussion that needs to happen occasionally when someone is uncomfortable, rather than for every gay/lesbian student. If it's generally an unaccepting culture, then they would be more likely to stay in the closet, which, again, would make this a rare discussion needed to be taken on a case-by-case basis. I also don't think presenting the culture as not generally accepting of gay and lesbian people means you're not supportive of gays and lesbians, since it's a certain culture's views and not your's. The author is clearly accepting and supportive and shows that type of culture to be wrong.

As for where would you keep the gay and lesbian kids, if no one takes issue with it why would they need to be moved? The seperation of boys and girls makes sense given the vast majority of the students will be straight, and not comfortable with the opposite sex seeing them or sleeping in the same room as them, but unless other students are uncomfortable then there's no real reason to move the gay and lesbian kids to a completely different dorm. That would kind of defeat the purpose of separating them anyway. Moving all the gay kids to one dorm and lesbians to another would potentially encourage the behavior the separation is trying to discourage, as you pointed out in Harleen/Hermione's case. Though McGonagall does seem to trust those two particular students to not be inappropriate.

Anecdote: From my own experiences, in high school I was bi and in the closet, and there were two guys in my year that I remember who were openly gay. None of us had to use a different locker room than the rest of the guys. If one of us were staring at the other guys or making comments about them then I'm sure we would have at least had a talking to, but as far as I'm aware no one was bothered by it.

So, I don't really see what the big deal is. The author might have just not put a lot of thought into how gays and lesbians are treated at Hogwarts, but even with the info we have I don't think there's any evidence to really say "how could this be written by someone who supposedly supports gay people?" If the rest of the story shows support towards gay people and this one section just isn't fleshed out very well, that's not really a fair reason to question if they're really supportive or not.
