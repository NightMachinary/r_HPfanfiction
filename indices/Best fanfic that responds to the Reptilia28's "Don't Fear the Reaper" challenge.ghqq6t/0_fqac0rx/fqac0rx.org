- linkffn(A Fair Life by Rtnwriter) ... fem!Harry (with femslash Harmony), decently written, some scenes with relations to homosexuals which make me wonder, how could it be written by somebody who supposedly supports gays.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Last Chance by LeQuin) ... nice Harmony take over Prefect duties after completely negligent Ron/Lavender.
- linkffn(Reboot by Kallanit) ... really nice with good Petunia, good Snape (with Slytherin Phoenix!), Lady Hermione Graynge (tearing Malfoy as fake pretender to nobility)
- linkffn(The best laid plans by Lowten) ... very original start (one of few who use Hermione's Polyjuice accident for something interesting), but it turns into rather plain vanilla Harmony.

Each of them has some interesting idea, but each of them without an exception have the worst signs of bad Harmony story: extensive Dumbledore and Ron bashing for example.
