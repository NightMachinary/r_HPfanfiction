I don't know how much was ever written down or published, but I did know someone from DeviantArt, back when I did stuff over there, who had a Ravenclaw OC she'd written with George. The character was called Lissy, the user WhisperWings. Very sadly, she got sick a few years ago and we lost her very quickly.
