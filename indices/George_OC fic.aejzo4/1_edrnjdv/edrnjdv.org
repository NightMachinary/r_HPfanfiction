I've linked this before. Personally I think its the most comprehensive and well done George/OC pairing and best of all, its complete. It can technically follow canon until after the war, I haven't read it in a while but I think its not quite matched up with the epilogue although I remember most pairings remaining the same.

From the site: George & Annie: an Unofficial Biography by shosier "Fred and George Weasley's troublemaking careers didn't start the day they reached Hogwarts. In fact, they had been honing their mischief-making talents for years, with the help of a feisty little Muggle girl named Annie Jones from Ottery St. Catchpole. Their secret friendship continued even after the twins began leaving for Hogwarts, as the children kept in touch via owl post. It deepened into something more as teenagers, when George and Annie discovered an attraction to each other that they couldn't deny. Their love struggles to survive one of the most trying times in the magical world -- the Second War -- and its devastating consequences. A happily-ever-after awaits them... eventually."

I think I have more George or Fred fanfics if you want, let me know. I love the weasley's in general.
