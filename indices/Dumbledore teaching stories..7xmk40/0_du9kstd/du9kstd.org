hmm... The only one I've seen is the second and third books of the Rigel Black series. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8239413/1/The-Serpentine-Subterfuge][The Serpentine Subterfuge]] he teaches Defense after Lockhart gets petrified, and in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10041727/1/The-Ambiguous-Artifice][The Ambiguous Artifice]] he's an Alchemist Professor.

It doesn't actually focuses on Dumbledore, if that's what you want, but since I'm slightly obsessed with this series, I have to recommend :)
