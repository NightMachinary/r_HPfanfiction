In canon, he despises her and sees her as a disgrace to magic.

In fanon, I can imagine a lot of great ideas including, but not limited to, being grounded, having his wand taken away, sending him to timeout, demanding he take out the trash, making him hug his aunt, bringing out cookies in a death eater meeting, and even forcing him to babysit his new little sister. The idea of a ridiculously overprotective Voldemort defending his little sister over the hazards of a slightly breezy day is hilarious to me.
