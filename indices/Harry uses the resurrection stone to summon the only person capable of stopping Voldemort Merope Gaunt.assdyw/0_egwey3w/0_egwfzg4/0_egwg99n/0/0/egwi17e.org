I wasn't talking about canon clearly. It's the idea of him living for quite a while and growing wise. He wouldn't be a good person, but he would see his actions in the past as being incredibly immature.

Another idea is that his name is leaked. People begin to fear the dreadful name of /Tom/ as much as the name Voldemort. Nobody names their kid Tom for hundreds of years. Dark Lord Tom is the most feared name in all of creation. He made the name his own.
