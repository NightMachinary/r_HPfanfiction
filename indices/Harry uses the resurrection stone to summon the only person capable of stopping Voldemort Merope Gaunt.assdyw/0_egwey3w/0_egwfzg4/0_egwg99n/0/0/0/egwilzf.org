  I wasn't talking about canon clearly. It's the idea of him living for quite a while and growing wise. He wouldn't be a good person, but he would see his actions in the past as being incredibly immature.

Ah, I see. Well, it's a thought.

  Another idea is that his name is leaked. People begin to fear the dreadful name of Tom as much as the name Voldemort. Nobody names their kid Tom for hundreds of years. Dark Lord Tom is the most feared name in all of creation. He made the name his own.

Honestly, if his name were leaked, I think he'd just give people a combination of the spiel he gave the Death Eaters about his family, and of what Diarymort said to Harry in the Chamber when introducing the anagram. "It was an unworthy name which I cast out. Tom Riddle is dead. I am Lord Voldemort."

Mind you, it's still a funny thought experiment. Your scenario would be bad for the /Leaky Cauldron/'s business, I think... Oh, and since Harry made the Dark Lord's real name public post-War, I wonder if there /was/ a noticeable drop in mothers naming their children Tom. I mean, probably not. The Wizarding World is small enough, and wizards wacky enough when picking names, that it seems to me that aside from Muggle-borns it's a precious rarity for two wizards alive at the same time to have the same first name.
