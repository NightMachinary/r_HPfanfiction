  Hence why I enjoy it when Voldemort admits that he isn't annoyed by his true name, Tom.

Now, see, /that/ I don't think would ever happen, personally. He has many valid reasons to hate the name. First, it's the name of a Muggle. Second, it's the name he used as a young man, and thus ties him to a part of his life he'd rather have everyone forget ever happened. Third, it doesn't fit his delusions of grandeur in the slightest; excepting the "Muggle's name" bit I could perhaps see him coming to accept Riddle, which, after all, sounds pretty cool and dark-wizard-ish in its own right. But "/Tom/"? /Come on./

(It is my belief that if he had to give a first name to go with the last name "Voldemort", he would have said "Marvolo", which is at least a wizard's name.)
