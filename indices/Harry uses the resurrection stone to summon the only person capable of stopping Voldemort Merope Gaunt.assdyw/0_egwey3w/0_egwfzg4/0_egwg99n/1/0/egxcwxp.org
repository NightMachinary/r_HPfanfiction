I'm not sure about real life... In literature that is definitely the trend in stories with old characters. The wise old man who faced countless trials who has grown compassionate. If you think this isn't a thing in the HP universe, then I refer you to a minor character. He isn't too big a role. Just Albus Dumbledore. I really do hate Beasts, but that is the trope being played. Dumbledore as a teen was young, arrogant, and dark. As a middle aged man he was arrogant and good. As an old man he would be old, wise, and humble. This archetype definitely exists.
