These are the feelings he has shown since he first learned of magic that his mother couldn't possibly be a wizard because she died. Those ideas had quite a while to fester. He didn't seem to have any gripes with killing his own grandfatherish family, so I doubt he would have anything except maybe being nice enough to kill her quickly at best.

If you want to go realistic, then he likely would change his mind over time. People tend to become more understanding of the struggles of others over time. Hence why I enjoy it when Voldemort admits that he isn't annoyed by his true name, Tom.
