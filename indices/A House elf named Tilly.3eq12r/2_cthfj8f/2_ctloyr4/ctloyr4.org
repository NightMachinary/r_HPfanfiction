There's one fanfic where an eccentric Pureblood family named all their elves after Roman generals, but that is a very eccentric fanfic itself so... I could only see the Malfoys giving their elves human-inspired names like "Bumblebore" or "Potty" just to feel superior, but not like, actual people names.

To be fair the elves might name their own children and what we're getting are just examples of elf culture.
