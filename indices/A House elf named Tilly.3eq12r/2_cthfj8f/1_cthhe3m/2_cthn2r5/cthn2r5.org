There's nothing wrong with it, but it is nice to see some originality. It's been a while since I looked it up, but Emma doesn't make much sense as a name for dr. Granger. It doesn't fit in with the names of the period she would have been born. IIRC, it doesn't become popular until the late 60s or the 70s.
