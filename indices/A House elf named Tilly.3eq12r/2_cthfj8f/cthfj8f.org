It's like Dan and Emma as the Hermione's parents. It's lazy, sounds okay, and fits the Dobby, Winky, Hokey trend. I wonder why Kreacher doesn't have a similar name. I do think Tilly is better than some of the names. Some fics have the Malfoy house elves with Roman names which makes no sense. I can't see the Malfoys giving house elves human names-they don't deserve it in their eyes.
