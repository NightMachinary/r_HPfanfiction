I've never used Tilly.

I named one Urkel- he was the headmaster's spy and was killed by Dobby on order of his mistress. Another was Clinker- named specifically for the sound his wire-and-bottle-bottom glasses made when he disappeared. In an unpublished piece I have an American elf-guild elf show up wearing a mummy-style shroud of woven red tape. I'm thinking his name should be Bibblespink.

EDIT: Just remembered the two other elves I gave the Malfoys- Froople and Yappi.
