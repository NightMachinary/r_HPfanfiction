Here are some possible sources for house elf names (a bit of fudging on the spelling is required here and there, be warned):

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobby_%28cloth%29][Dobby]] is a /"is a woven fabric produced on the dobby loom, characterised by small geometric patterns and extra texture in the cloth"/ (Wikipedia). So his name could he a reference to the cloth he wears. Doby also means /time/ in Czech...so there's that.

Tilly can be slang for /utility/, which makes sense in this context. *Tily* means /watchman/ in Malagasy, the language of Madagascar. Tilly is also the title of a poem by James Joyce about a cattle herder (maybe all those fanfic authors are just J.J. groupies)

Kriecher means /crawler, groveller, bootlicker, sycophant or toadie/ in German. I think this fits Kreacher's personality, and perhaps JRK chose it with this in mind? It is also a homophone to /creature/ which also fits well.

In general I think the names are chosen to be offensive in their shortness and banality:

  /Spittle flew as Lucius raged at the presumptuous female house elf, "That is our word! You don't get to use that word!" he frothed eloquently, "Steve" is too good of a name for the likes of your spawn! I shall rename him Dicky!"./
