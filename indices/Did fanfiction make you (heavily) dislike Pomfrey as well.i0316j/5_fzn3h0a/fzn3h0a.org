I've seen a lot of mixed portrayals of her, and the most negative ones seem to be in bash fics which I try to avoid (though those often also contain mind-controlled/obliviated/blackmailed portrayals, so even then it's still mixed), so it hasn't affected my opinion too much.

In most cases she's just strict and a bit unfriendly, but outside of bash fics that's hardly a damning character trait.
