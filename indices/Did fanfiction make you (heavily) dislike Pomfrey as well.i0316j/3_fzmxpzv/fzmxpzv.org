No, I always find Molly and Pomfrey hating/bashing to be immature

I remember fics where Lupin was always reminding Harry to not get in trouble... nobody cares

But replace it with Molly telling Harry to not get in trouble... all of a sudden there's tons of reviews talking about hating Molly and how annoying she is
