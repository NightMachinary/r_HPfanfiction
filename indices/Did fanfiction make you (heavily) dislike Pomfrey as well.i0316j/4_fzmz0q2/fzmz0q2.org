That is the fault of poor writing or blatant character bashing, since few people characterize her as an actual person. In bad fanfiction, she is a caricature of a fussy woman who acts like a bitchy helicopter parent rather than the "medical professional who runs a tight ship" that she's supposed to be characterized as.

As you can see, the stereotyping & belittling of her character is a pet peeve of mine.
