It'd be a more interesting reversal if the Dursleys were some elitist pureblood family and Lily Evans who's a Squib married a muggle/another squib and had Harry, then Harry also turned out to be non-magical, but somehow the whole boy who lived business still happened when Voldemort tried to get rid of them for being non-magical. Then the Dursleys get Harry forced on them still.
