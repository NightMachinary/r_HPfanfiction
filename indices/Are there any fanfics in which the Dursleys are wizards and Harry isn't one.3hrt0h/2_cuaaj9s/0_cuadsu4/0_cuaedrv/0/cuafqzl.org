I thought so too. He'd be stuck with them and he'd be stuck in the wizarding world. Things would happen like them delegating the House Elves who adore him to take care of him until he's able to take care of himself and then free all of them and make him do all of their work so he's both without friends and still ends up doing chores. The only thing is where it'd go from there, maybe he escapes to the muggle world at some point, but Voldemort is still after him and he uses muggle tech as the "power Voldemort knows not" since he's fucked over magically. The whole muggles trumping wizards is a bit weird, but why not team up with Dumbledore who hunts the horcruxes at some point later on and then have Harry finish Voldemort with a sniper rifle. I'm not sure where he'd get training for that though.
