I've recently started reading a fic which explores those ideas. The story diverges in second year on the premise that the destruction of the Diary didn't remove its compulsions from Ginny's mind. The fic shows her internal struggles and slow downward spiral as she tries to cope while the lingering compulsions prevent her from telling anyone the truth.

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

The fic covers some extremely disturbing events (mind the warning tags), but there's no attempt to romanticize or make Voldemort's side any less horrific than in canon. The story doesn't flinch from showing the tragic consequences for Ginny and the people around her.
