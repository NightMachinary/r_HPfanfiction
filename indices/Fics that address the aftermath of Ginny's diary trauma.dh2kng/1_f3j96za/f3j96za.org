linkffn(More Than a Mug of Hot Chocolate by keeptheotherone) (or its rewrite linkffn(Hidden Chambers and Unseen Monsters by keeptheotherone)). And I am slightly touching this in my story I am writing right now: they just didn't have enough money for it. How many psychological traumas and PTSDs are untreated because of lack of money?
