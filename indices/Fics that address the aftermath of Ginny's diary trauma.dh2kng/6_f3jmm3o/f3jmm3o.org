If anyone can help, I don't remember the name of the fic. An adult Harry had been sent back in time to an alt-U that didn't have a Harry and I think Neville was the BWL. Anyway, during the Chamber situation, Ginny managed the willpower to throw the diary into the Chamber as the entrance was closing, locking it inside. But 'Tom' was still in her head. Every year Ginny begs not to go back to school, but every year she gets sent back where the proximity makes Tom stronger and harder to ignore. For years Ginny's been walking around like a zombie and no one knows why.
