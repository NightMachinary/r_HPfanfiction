I've read a few fics where it comes up. !linkao3(Runic War Warding) and !linkffn(Gaining Power) (the sequel to another fic) are both (non-slash) Harry/Voldemort fics. Ginny has only gotten one scene in Runic War Warding, though it was an interesting one. In Gaining Power, Ginny was made for more ruthless and cunning by the diary's influence, and even acts as a go-between for Emily and the Order of the Phoenix.

!linkffn(The Thorny Rose) also features a Ginny that was impacted heavily by the diary. The Ron bashing is annoying, but he at least gets a redemption by the end of the series.

I'm also going to second chiruochiba's recommendation of !linkffn(Black Ink, Red Rose). Bolshe is a good friend of mine and I love his work, with this one being my favourite from him.
