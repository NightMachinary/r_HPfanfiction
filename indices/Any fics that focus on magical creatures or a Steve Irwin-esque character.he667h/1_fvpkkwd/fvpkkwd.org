If you are also a fan of Hermione or Snape or (ideally) both, corvusdraconis (many stories on AO3 and more on ff dot net) has a lot of fics that involve magical creatures. Start with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14750382]] Born Unto Darkness, 100k words, where Hermione is basically Steve Irwin, and try [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17656049]] Eye of the Dragon, Hair of the Cat, 50k words, next. A much shorter one is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21875080]] It's the Thought That Counts, 10k.

Many of the stories are not marked complete but I have found that all are functionally complete - you can read them and not feel cheated. They just don't mark them as complete because sometimes they update them if they feel inspired.
