Usually it's the connotation to how it's used that people don't like, I think - just like most other tropes people look down upon, they're not /actually/ bad in theory. Hadrian carries great connotations if used well - in my view, it'd warrant a tweak to the WW to make it a bit more conservative and noble dominated, probably with an influential part played by the Romans, but past that it shows that Harry fit into that more ancient/aristocratic world.

However, one of the failings (in my view) is when people actually start using Hadrian all the time. Harry is Harry - his birth name being Hadrian should not change the way he refers to himself, and works best if reserved for more formal occasions. We don't see Ron called Ronald all the time, or Ginny Ginevra - changing the way Harry is called is pretty jarring.

Beyond that this sub does have some fairly judgmental views on things, usually due to being in a bunch of garbage fics. If someone's read a bunch of bad fiction using, say, a super powerful/smart Hermione, that'll make the concept stick out to them as bad (or, at least, a sign of a bad fic). Same with magical cores (often used as an excuse to make Harry superpowerful), inheritance testing (ditto), manipulative!dumbledore, etc.
