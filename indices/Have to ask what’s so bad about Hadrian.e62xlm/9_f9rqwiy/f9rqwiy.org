Hadrian can work in humor/parodies. It turns out Lily was a giant nerd for the Roman Empire and she wanted what was best for her "little emperor", so Harry was getting an Imperial Roman Name like Hadrian Nerva Traianus Augustus Potter or whatever she could come up with. James was able to negotiate her down and settle for Hadrian James Potter. He intended to change it on all legal documents later to Harry when Lily was distracted but he did not get chance, and later they died.

So for most people Harry is just Harry, but for legal purposes - i.e. banking, identification, Hogwarts admission and classes - he is known as Hadrian. To his chagrin ;)
