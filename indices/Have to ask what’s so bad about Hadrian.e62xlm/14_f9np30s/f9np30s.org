I don't mind it either-- it's a nice name, and I could actually see the HP universe being one where some kind of secret, or extended, name is a thing, particularly because it's a universe where names do have some sort of power. Just think about the taboo curse on the name Voldemort. Sure, that isn't his real name, but it's used to refer to him much more than Tom Riddle ever was. What if similar things could be done with Harry's name? It then might make sense to his parents to name him one thing, like Hadrian, but only tell people that his name is Harry.

Sure, there's no specific reason to think that is the case. But an argument can be made for it that doesn't clash with canon, provided that's something you care about.

I can see where some of the other commenters are coming from, in that they associate it with certain tropes. Still, it's never bothered me. But that may partly be because the tropes themselves aren't always bad to me either.
