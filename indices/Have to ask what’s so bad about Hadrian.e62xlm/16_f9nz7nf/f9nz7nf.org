Honestly, I really like Hadrian as Harry's proper name (is that what it's called?) /nudge-nudge wink-wink community flair/. It gives off a really cool aristocratic flair to Harry's character and personality that screams out /don't-you-dare-fuck with-me-cause-i'mma-blast-you-if-you-do/. A completely Smart, independent, /'cunning' if i say so myself/ Harry who knows what his position is in the Wizarding World and knows/acknowledges his paternal pureblood roots. A Harry who's not just his mother's emerald but his father's little slugger too.

Hadrian and Hardwin are my most preferable choices for naming Harry as Harrison gives me the old man creeps and Harold just feels too close for comfort with Ronald. Even Tommy boy Redesigned his name cause it felt too simple or should I say /pathetic/ for his standing as a dark /cough-dork-cough/ lord.

And let me remind you that the Potter family is quite deeply rooted in the history of the Wizarding World, dating back to the Peverell brothers as Iolanthe Peverell (granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell, the original owner of Death's Invisibility Cloak) married Hardwin, son of Linferd of Stinchcombe, "The Potterer". That shows that his family dates quite back to the the times of Peverell Brothers and should have a sway in the Upper-class Circles.

So, it does seems nice to have Harry's proper name as Hadrian, while still asking his friends to /just call me Harry/. Like c'mon Atleast Fleamont and/or Euphemia (or Charlus and Dorea for me, I like these two more) would have said something about their grandchild. And even if they were dead, their Wizarding portrait would have seen baby Harry *atleast* once and could have suggested a aristocratic name or something.

Anyway, thats my rant on why Hadrian (or Hardwin) sounds way better as a primary/proper name for Harry. Cheers Fellas !ยก! /~Ares Out/
