This is so cool! /If/ you're writing Hadrian 'Harry' Potter as an American boy, that is. Then it fit perfectly, the reasoning is entirely sound. His ancestors came over on the Mayflower, all that sort of thing.

However, Harry Potter isn't an American boy, he's British. His 'proper' name, if he had one, is likely to be Henry, which /is/ an aristocratic name, umpteen kings and one of our current princes have that name and that short form of it.
