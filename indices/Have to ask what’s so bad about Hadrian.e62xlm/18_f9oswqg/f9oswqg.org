I agree. This is a series where the other main characters have names like Severus, Draco, Bellatrix, Remus, Sirius, Filius, Albus, Pomona, Argus, Rowena, Salazar, Astoria, Hermione etc. Among that backdrop, Hadrian isn't that outlandish, especially when James's closest friends had similarly outlandish names and Lily (the little that we saw of her in canon) showed willingness to fully integrate into the magical world.
