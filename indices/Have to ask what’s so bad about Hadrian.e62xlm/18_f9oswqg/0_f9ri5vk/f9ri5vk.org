To be fair, with the exception of Hermione and Remus, most of those characters you named are either from a much older generation and/or come from a dark/pureblood family. Even Hermione's name is only so strange because Rowling chose a rare name for her so little girls with the same name as that character don't get picked on. In-universe, Remus is basically the only true exception but even he only had that name because Rowling thought naming a werewolf Remus Lupin (or the far more absurd Fenrir Greyback) was the height of intelligent symbolism. Peter was one of James' closest friends and had a very normal sounding name.

Just look at the rest of the kids in Harry's year. Aside from Hermione, the only kids in Harry's year with outlandish names was Draco (dark, pure-blood supremacist family). That's it. The rest had pretty normal names (e.g. Dean, Seamus, Hannah, Justin, Terry, Theodore, etc). Some had some relatively old-fashioned names (i.e. Neville, Millicent, etc) but they weren't outlandish at all.

Even in the years above Harry, you had names like Fred, George, Percy, Oliver, Lee. The most unusual names from the older students were stuff like Penelope or Marcus, the former merely being a bit old-fashioned and the latter is very similar to the name Mark (which is a normal name). But again, Marcus Flint was a Slytherin from a dark pure-blood family.

People generally look down on the epilogue (be it because they think Albus Severus is a stupid name, because they shipped Harry/Hermione, the subjective quality of DH as a whole, or whatever other reason you can think of), but even in the epilogue the next gen kids names were almost all normal sounding unless they were named after a dead character. Even then, they weren't outlandish.

James, Lily, Rose, Hugo, Fred, Roxanne, Molly, Lucy, Victoire, Dominique, and Louis all seem like normal names. The names of Fleur's kids don't seem that outlandish, though I'm not well-versed on French naming trends. Hermione integrated into the wizarding world arguably even moreso than Lily yet she opted for normal names that wouldn't be out of place in the muggle world such as Rose and Hugo, rather than some ridiculous sounding names like Hadrian. The only outlandish names were Albus (named after Dumbledore and Snape) and Scorpius (from a dark and/or pure-blood family, also fits the constellation/star theme of many Black family descendants since Draco was name after a constellation).

*TL;DR: Hadrian is a stupid cliche because its a big neon light indicating an Indy!Harry who has like 50 Septillion galleons in his Gringotts account and is lord and heir to every notable wizarding family. In canon, everyone in Harry's year barring Hermione and Draco had normal names, and even most of the older students had normal names unless they were in dark pure-blood families. In the epilogue, the only weird names by our modern standards would be Albus and Scorpius, since the rest were normal.*
