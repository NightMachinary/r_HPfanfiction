Imo, Hadrian is not Harry's name and as I don't see anything wrong with the name Harry the use of Hadrian sets off all my "Look at this Harry he's not gonna be a weak pushover like canon Harry and he's clearly unique"-sensors. I use those sensors to avoid Lord!Potter and Jerk!Potter tropes, so I am trained to avoid fics with prominent use of Hadrian.
