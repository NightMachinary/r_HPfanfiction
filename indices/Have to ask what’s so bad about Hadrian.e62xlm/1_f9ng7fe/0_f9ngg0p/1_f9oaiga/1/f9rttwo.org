  Harry finds out (not through gringotts or the library haha) that he's first in line to the British throne and his life spirals out of control. I thought that in this instance, a slightly pretentious name would definitely be right.

Remembering that the person who's actually first line in the actual British throne is just called "Charles", of course.
