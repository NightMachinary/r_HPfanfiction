Yes that's true! I'm going out of my way to rehabilitate the name Hadrian in a fic I'm writing and trying to avoid every possible FanFiction cliche. In essence, Harry finds out (not through gringotts or the library haha) that he's first in line to the British throne and his life spirals out of control. I thought that in this instance, a slightly pretentious name would definitely be right.
