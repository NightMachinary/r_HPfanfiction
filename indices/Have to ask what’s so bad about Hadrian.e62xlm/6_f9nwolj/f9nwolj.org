The trouble with Hadrian is that he has half a dozen vaults, containing detailed instructions from his parents about how to deal with every canonical challenge, and artifacts of immense power and forgotten lore, and possibly a marriage contract that he can take or leave (but the other party is bound), along with mountains of gold generated by his string of estates, which are maintained by his army of house elves, to which the friendly goblins will helpfully introduce him.

It's not his name that's the problem.
