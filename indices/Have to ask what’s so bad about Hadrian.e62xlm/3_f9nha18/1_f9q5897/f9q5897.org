  For the Malfoys or the Blacks or the Lestranges, perhaps. But the Potter family is not one that uses Latin names. James's grandfather was named Henry, and it's possible Harry was named in honor of him.

We don't know all that many Potter names, from my understanding. But Harry's ancestry /does/ certainly include some Latin names - for instance, according to the wiki, the 2nd Potter (Hardwin) married a Peverell, Iolanthe (greek) with a father who had a latin name (Ignotus). Later on we get an Abraham (from Hebrew origin). James' mother is called Euphemia (greek origin). That's enough of a grab bag approach to names that (particularly with the very varied set of names in the wizarding community), having a Latin name like that isn't the /worse/ that could be chosen.

Past that, most of those names aren't actually ever mentioned in the books, and are certainly not /prominent/ in the fandom. So, if writing a fic that includes a likely more aristocratic bent to the WW (in canon, it's hard to know /exactly/ how the government is set up with regards to family lines and nobility), having the Potters be more aristocratic in their naming scheme is not really something I'd see problematic. It's not going to fit well without a context like that - but then there wouldn't be a point to having another name for Harry, so kinda beside the point.
