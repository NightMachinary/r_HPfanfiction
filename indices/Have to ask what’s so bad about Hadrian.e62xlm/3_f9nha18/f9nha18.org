Probably due to its over use and the fact that it is usually paired with dumb tropes like wizarding nobility and indy Harry.

For the Malfoys or the Blacks or the Lestranges, perhaps. But the Potter family is not one that uses Latin names. James's grandfather was named Henry, and it's possible Harry was named in honor of him.

Fleamont is the one "weird" name in the Potter family, but only because the aforementioned Henry didn't want his mother's maiden name to be forgotten.
