That's an interesting idea! Reincarnation is topic I haven't seen in a lot fics, so I think it would be really cool to explore that especially if Harry is still a Horcrux. That would be cool getting dreams about what Voldemort is doing and getting dreams about a past life, that could lead to some internal struggle about identity I really like the sound of that.
