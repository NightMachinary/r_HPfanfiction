I like the name Hadrian as long as fits the story. If it's a part of the OP Gringotts line of stuff then sometimes it's meh. If the author takes a second and writes a couple of lines about Harry not liking his name and deciding to change it on his own for whatever reason then it makes the story 10x better than showing up at Gringotts and learning your name was Hadrian the whole time.
