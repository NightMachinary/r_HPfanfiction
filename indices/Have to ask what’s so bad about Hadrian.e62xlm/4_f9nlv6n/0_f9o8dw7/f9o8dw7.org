I have a first name that I was unaware of until I started school. I had always been called by my middle name. By parents, my older sister, neighbors, etc. when I got to school they called me by my first name (it being catholic school and all) and I was legitimately confused as to who they were calling.

I'm in my 30's now and still get weirded out when I hear my first name.
