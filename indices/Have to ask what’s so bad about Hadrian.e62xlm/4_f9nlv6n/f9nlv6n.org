Nothing bad about it if it's an original character. Or the roman emperor. It's just not Harry's name. It seems... unbelievable that his parents gave him a secret name that is only ever used to sign documents. And no one in his whole life tells him until he goes to Gringotts and the goblins start bending over backward for him because he remembered Griphook's name. Thanks, but no thanks.

And anyway if Harry absolutely must have a secret name it simply needs to be Hardwin. Because there are no easy wins in life. (I'm not even remotely sorry.)
