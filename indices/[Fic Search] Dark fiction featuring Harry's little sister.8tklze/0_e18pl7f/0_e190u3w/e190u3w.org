Yes indeed, the Potters abducted Ginny, replacing her with their own daughter in the process, and sacrificed the baby in another ritual to give Harry a chance to survive. I don't think it was explained why all of this happened, but the fic was still going on, so it coult be that it was addressed sometime later.
