I did some forum-based Potterverse roleplay for several years, but as they often do, the board died out as people moved on to other things.

I'd love to pick it up again, never tried chat-based RP. To be honest, I enjoy Potterverse (original characters, not actual HP/Hogwarts canon) more than Hogwarts/canon stuff, but I'll be happy to give it a try if you get something going.
