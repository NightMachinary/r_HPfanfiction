I read it a fair few years ago, so I'm not sure how I'd like it now, but I remember enjoying The Soul Adores by Maeglin_Yedi (won't link because Rule 8). It's stuck in my head for years. Harry/Tom.

A Lightness by Teh Tarik is mostly Lavender-focused, but does contain mild Lav/Padma: [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=485960]]
