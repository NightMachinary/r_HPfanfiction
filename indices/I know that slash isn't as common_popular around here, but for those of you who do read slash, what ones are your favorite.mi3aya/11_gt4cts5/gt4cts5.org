I like a lot slash pairings with harry, in fact my first OTP had been drarry! :) my current obsessions are time travel fics so I read a lot of snarry, tomarry, jeverus, and some abraxas malfoy/harry potter and remus lupin/sirius black by default. My favorite tomarry fics are To Kill You With A Kiss by Paimpont on ao3 and Stand Against The Moon by Batsutousai on ao3(apart of the series 'Like A Ghost In My Town.') My favorite jeverus fic is Earning His Forgiveness by OwlsWithFins on ao3 and I can't quite think of my favorite snarry fic off the top of my head, hopefully that was helpful though and I hope you have a great day!
