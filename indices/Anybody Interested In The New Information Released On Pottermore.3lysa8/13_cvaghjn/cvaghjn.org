Hopefully this provides new fic material.

That said, I didn't find the information particularly interesting. I think I'll keep my (fanfic) version of Harry's lineage in mind, where the Potters are deeply rooted in the Peverells and their idea of conquering death.

Since the Potters and Voldemort are both descended from the Peverells, I found it sensible that both might focus extensively on defeating Death.
