The story of the Hallows is not about immortality. None of the three brothers sought to live forever. Accepting your own mortality is not sufficient to become the "master of death" -- if it were, then /all three/ brothers were the master of death, because all of them accepted their mortality. The master of death is someone who has no fear of death, who doesn't seek it but embraces it when it comes.

Living your entire life under an invisibility cloak so as to avoid death is not the act of someone who does not fear death. Eventually taking the cloak off doesn't change that.
