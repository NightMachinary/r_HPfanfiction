You make a good point. The fic I'm writing is going to be rather AU, anyways.

I always felt that Harry might, too, pursue immortality and cheating death. After all, death took away his /parents/. I find the idea of a Harry as focused on conquering death as Voldemort intriguing, but I understand it might not be everyone's cup of tea.
