I haven't made many changes to canon (not yet, at least), but I do plan on having a few (seemingly) small things cascade down and make the story /very/ AU.

Harry will pursue immortality not only for himself, but out of hope...

I think Horcruxes totally require some level of emotional/sentimental attachment. Emotion is a potent source of magic. Perhaps creating a horcrux requires some sort of sentimental/emotional threshold, like a Patronus charm.

Immortality should be interesting to write about. In a society of magic, there must have been countless who understood that perhaps they might have the power to seek it. This allows for a great deal of AU/historical worldbuilding, I think.
