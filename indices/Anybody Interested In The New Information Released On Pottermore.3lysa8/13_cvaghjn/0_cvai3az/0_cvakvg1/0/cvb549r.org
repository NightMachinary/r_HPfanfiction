Oh, I don't have issues with AU, I have plot bunnies where Hermione is a Fay changeling, Harry has an older sister being raised by Snape (who isn't her biological father), and many other things that don't quite fit in with the books. I specifically like changing one big thing and trying to be canon-compliant beyond that, as far as it's possible. Just seeing that one change cascade through the story.

I was just pointing out that using the Peverell connection was a tad questionable. The idea of Harry pursuing immortality is certainly interesting.

Have you ever wondered if horcruxes require an emotional attachment to the object to be created? It would explain Voldemort's sentimental choices even though he is very intelligent. A grain of sand tossed into the Atlantic would be impossible to find and as such much better for the goal of immortality.
