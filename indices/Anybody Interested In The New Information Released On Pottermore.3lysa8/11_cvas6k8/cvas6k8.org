I was never sold on my versions of James's parents, so I literally just replaced all their names in my story with Fleamont and Euphemia. It just changed conversations that I haven't written yet. Charlus and Dorea were far too young to be Harry's grandparents, anyway. I'm still giggling over the name "Fleamont", but other than that I didn't find this very earth-shattering.
