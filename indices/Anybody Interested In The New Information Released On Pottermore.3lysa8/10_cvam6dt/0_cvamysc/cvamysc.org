From the W.O.M.B.A.T:

#+begin_quote

  1. What change would 18% of wizards like to see to the requirements for membership of the Wizengamot? (source: Ministry of Magic poll)

     a. Average age lowered from 87

     b. Proof of pure-blood status

     c. Maximum of three years in post

     d. Goblin representation
#+end_quote

Obviously Goblin representation isn't even a thing, and I doubt that Dumbledore at least only served for three years.

Pure-blood status - given that the resurgence in obsession with blood status is actually fairly recent according to Pottermore - seems less likely than being a certain age, so as far as canon goes, I'd hazard a guess at just being an exceptional witch/wizard of sufficient age.
