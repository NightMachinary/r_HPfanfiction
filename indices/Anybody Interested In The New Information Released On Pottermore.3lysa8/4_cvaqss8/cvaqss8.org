Has nobody else noticed that JKR clearly messed up when James inherits the Invisibility Cloak? We know he had it at Hogwarts thanks to Sirius and Remus' accounts of seeing James disappear beneath it many times, but in this passage it's apparent he didn't get it until his parents passed away. This is contradictory because they died at some point between James' marriage and Harry's birth, not when James was still in school.
