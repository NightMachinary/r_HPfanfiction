Inherited could just be a legal term, there's nothing to prevent his dad letting him take it to school but not giving it to him. They could have just regarded it as a family cloak, for everyone to share. Who "owned" it would only be important as far as it being a Deathly Hallow, which is probably why JKR mentioned the inheritance.
