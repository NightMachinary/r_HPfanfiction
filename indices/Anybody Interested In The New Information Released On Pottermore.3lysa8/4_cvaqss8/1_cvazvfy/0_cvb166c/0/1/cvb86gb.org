Yes, everything you say is true, it's just that to me, it's weird to make a point of saying that he inherited something that he has been effectively owning and using for years. It's different from something like a house because it can change hands much easier. You could not, for example, steal a house from someone, but you could feasibly steal the Cloak, in which case you would now own the artifact.

It is worthy to note that I know I am nitpicking. I'm just a believer that authors should be conscious of their word choice, since it is their chosen medium, so they should say exactly what they mean, especially in documents such as this that are more factual than literal.
