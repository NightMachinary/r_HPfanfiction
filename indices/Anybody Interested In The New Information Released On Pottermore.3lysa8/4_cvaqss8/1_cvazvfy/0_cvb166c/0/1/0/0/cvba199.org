Yes. I guess the real question is when did James begin to consider it his, and not his father's Cloak? This is also assuming that the Cloak acts in the same way as the Elder Wand, which again is feasible because they are both highly powerful magical artifacts, and more importantly both Hallows. However I was always under the impression that the Elder Wand followed the rules of ownership of wands in general. I didn't interpret the change in ownership as that of a Hallow but instead that of a wand.
