Effectively owning and using just isn't good enough for a powerful magical artifact, though. Owning it makes you 1/3 of the way to being the "Master of Death", but ownership wouldn't officially change unless it was formally given to someone else, death of the owner, or maybe in case of someone stealing it like you said. It didn't change to Dumbledore's even though he had the use of it for years.
