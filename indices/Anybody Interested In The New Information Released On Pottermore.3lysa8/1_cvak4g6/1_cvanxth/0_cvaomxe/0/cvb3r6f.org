No way, I think it would work especially well on Potter hair, but James wanted to look different from his father and thought wild hair made him look like a cool quidditch star, and Harry's just clueless. He doesn't use wizarding grooming products except as the school provides them (like the soap in the prefects' bathroom), he never even heard of Sleekeazy until Hermione mentioned it 4th year at the Yule Ball, and it doesn't occur to him to spend money on that kind of stuff.

Now if someone had told him his grandpa invented it the poor little tyke would probably use that shit every day worse than Malfoy and think it was great. But clearly no one ever did.
