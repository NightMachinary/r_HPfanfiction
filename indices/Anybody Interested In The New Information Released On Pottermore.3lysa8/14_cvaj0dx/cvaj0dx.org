So Harry's grandmother had pink hair?

It's about time we get the names of Harry's paternal grandparents. While Euphemia is lovely (I can't help but think of Euphie from Code Geass), Fleamont was wholly unexpected. Not only that, but that Sleek Eaze was created by him, bet that shocked all when they found out. Though it seems the creative potion skills jumped ship with James, as that he was more transfiguration orientated. This just makes me want more information on the "Marauder" years.
