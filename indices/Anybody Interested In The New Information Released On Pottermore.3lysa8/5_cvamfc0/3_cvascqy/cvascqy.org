Where does it say he wasn't invited to the Slug Club? I don't recall that.

I can picture James getting kicked out for causing trouble or something. Or refusing to go on the grounds that it's silly. Also, for what it's worth, my headcanon had Marcus Belby's uncle creating the potion on a grant...and while he didn't get a lot of money from the project, he did get a lot notoriety for his success. Just one potential explanation.

I think Slughorn cared more about popularity and the possibility of future successes, not money.
