I imagine that as rare and hard-to-make as the Wolfsbane is, Belby jacked up the price 5000% like that recent scumbag CEO. Not all werewolves have been werewolves all their lives like Lupin, some might have made good money beforehand, or own their own business or something where they can work when they choose, or have family money. And those people would pay whatever it took to not risk biting anyone. My headcanon says there are a lot of werewolves in hiding who live normal lives and haven't registered.

Maybe James went to one Slug Club party, decided it sucked, and didn't go back. Or maybe he wanted Sirius to go too but Slughorn wouldn't have him since he was on the outs with the Blacks.
