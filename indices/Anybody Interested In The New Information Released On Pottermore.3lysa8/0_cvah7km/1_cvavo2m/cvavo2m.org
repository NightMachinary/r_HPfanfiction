I would presume during Harry's life the Potter fortune was actually at its peak.

- Previous generations of Potter's were successful, contributing to a number of notable potions.

- Harry's grandfather multiplied the existing fortune by several times.

- James likely didn't make a significant dent. He left Hogwarts, got married, and went into hiding shortly after.

I really hope to see some fics that include this information properly compared to previous fics that just assumed Harry had x amount of titles and x amount of Galleons. My headcanon has always been that Harry was wealthy but otherwise had the same status as your average Muggleborn.
