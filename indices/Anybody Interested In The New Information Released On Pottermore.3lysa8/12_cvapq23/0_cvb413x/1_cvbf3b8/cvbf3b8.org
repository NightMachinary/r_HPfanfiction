  Published to mark the 9th redesign and relaunch of the Harry Potter website, Rowling's expose on Hermione's early life begins with her parents, Dan and Emma Granger. She described them as â€œtwo locally well-beloved dentists whose love of Shakespeare and mutual dislike for their plebian first names lead them to name their daughter Hermione." In a display of humbleness that emphasizes her connection to loyal readers JKR said this: "I would like to thank /U/cavelioness, who provided the inspiration behind Dan and Emma's names." Reddit user Cavelioness had this to say "F U JKR!".

  The illustrious author went on to clarify that "Hermione had loads of friends before Hogwarts, I don't know where people ever got that idea". She goes on to detail how Hermione's love of My Little Ponies^{TM} as a child leads to her 2nd animagus form being a pretty, pretty pony."
