I think much like everyone else, I will stick with Charlus and Dorea being James' parents. It makes it much more beautiful I think, even though each Charlus and Dorea are totally different, aside from their taking in of Sirius. I like the idea of James and Sirius being related like that.

Much like I ignored Minerva's backstory when I write hers.

My big problem with Pottermore releases is very often they dont have any heart to them. Sure she's just talking about the history, but I dont get the feelings like I do when reading about Minerva growing up on a poor farm in Scotland.
