In terms of fic writing, I'm sort-of conflicted. The history I wrote for the Potters in my AU is actually pretty similar (West Country, old blood, James' parents dying by dragon pox, family jewels through alchemy rather than potionmaking but you get the drift). That being said, I called them Charlus and Dorea. Retconning it won't make much difference to the story, but I actually like the names more (they fit the image I have in my head, at least). I'm just not sure how the readers would take it...
