  shaming her for thinking outside the box.
#+end_quote

Agreed, derogatory shaming is bad

  I don't care if other people like it or don't like it. What I don't like is people telling JKR what she should be doing
#+end_quote

No one can tell JKR what to do. It is her story. It is perfectly fine for readers to express dissatisfaction though. They can *ask* her to do or not do certain things and she has the freedom to respond as she likes.

Thinking "outside the box" isn't inherently positive. It depends on what is done outside of the box.
