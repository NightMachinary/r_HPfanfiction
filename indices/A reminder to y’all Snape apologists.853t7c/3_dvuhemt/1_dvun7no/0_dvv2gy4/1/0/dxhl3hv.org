Random reply to a comment I made a month ago.

But no, movie!Snape is almost nothing like book!Snape. In the books, he is an unrepentant asshole, a greasy and mean spirited man with almost no redeeming qualities outside that he happens to work for the good guys to get his revenge. In the movies, Snape is Alan Rickman in a black wig. He's funny, charismatic, and has a commanding presence. That makes for a good movie character. But he is everything the Snape isn't.

Alan Rickman was frankly too good a guy to be anything but a lousy choice for Snape.
