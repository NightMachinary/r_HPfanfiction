Most Harry/Voldermort stories (that I know) have time travel, though, so either Harry is really old (often hundred of years old, in which case the age difference is a whole /other/ issue) or he goes back to the past and they're both young.

Still, the only way for this ship to work is if either of them is extremely ooc. Either a dark(often edgy)!Harry or Misunderstood!Voldemort.
