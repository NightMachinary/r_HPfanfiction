Is Harry x fem!Voldemort any different than Harry x Voldemort/Tom Riddle or Harry/Hermione x (sexy) Snape or other death eaters. I can't say I like those pairings, but why bash them and then go around and say that if the evil murderer is a hot woman then it's perfectly fine?

I guess the age difference or the fact that she is the head of a terrorist group who wants to kill all muggleborns is perfectly okay in that case since she is attractive. I really think that people should be free to like whatever pairings that they want. I don't think its fair to bash not necessarily morally good characters that other people like and then be perfectly okay with other just as evil if not more evil characters only as long as it's someone you think is attractive.
