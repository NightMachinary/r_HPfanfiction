Well, my headcanon for fem!Voldy is Izma from the Emperor's New Groove, so I'm not sure I can agree with 'hot', but it's definitely... interesting.

Unless you go with the route lots of HPLV shippers go and make Voldemort Tom Riddle again, since Tom is apparently the prettiest little shit that ever lived. Who'd be a hot fem!Riddle, then?
