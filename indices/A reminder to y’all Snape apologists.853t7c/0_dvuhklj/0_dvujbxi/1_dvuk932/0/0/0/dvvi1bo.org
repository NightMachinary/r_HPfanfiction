A lot of Harry x Voldemort fics are more of the Harry x sexy Tom Riddle kind. I don't like that pairing at all, but I am surprised just how much hate the Snape, Voldemort and other death eater pairings get while the same people are perfectly fine with Harry x hot fem!Voldemort or Harry x Bellatrix. They are both still terrorists and horrible people, (and not to mention the age difference) but for some reason it's perfectly fine in those cases since they are totally hot women.
