I am not sure where I read it, but I think I read a theory/fiction in which Harry and Ron went out drinking to celebrate, get drunk and in a drunken stupor he named him Albus Severus Potter. When he wakes up the next day and realizes what he's done, then proceeds to tell everyone, he named him for the two greatest men he ever knew...

I do not know about you lot, but in my mind this is canon.
