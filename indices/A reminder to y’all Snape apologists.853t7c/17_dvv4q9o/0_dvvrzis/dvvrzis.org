They don't, really. A lot of people either only watched the movies and therefore their Snape is Alan Rickman Snape (which is honestly perfectly legitimate), or they like the fact that Snape's character was interesting. Some people like writing fanfictions with redemption arcs, and some people like to shit on all of the people above because God fucking forbid you like a fictional character who's a major asshole without prefacing that with you knowing that he's an asshole literally every single time before you speak about it.
