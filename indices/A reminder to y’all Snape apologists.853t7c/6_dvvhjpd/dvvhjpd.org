Here's my response from the last time this was discussed:

Ugh, I hate giving possible explanations for Snape's deplorable behavior because everyone always assumes it means I condone it, which I don't, I'm just good at empathizing with people, but here goes:

This happened during GoF right? So for, what 13 years or so, he's been sort of hanging out at Hogwarts, to protect Harry, just in case Voldemort comes back. You're a good guy now, but you can't be too good, have to keep up appearances. Everyone knows you're an asshole anyway, that's not hard to maintain. After all, you are an asshole, no use pretending. So just, keep your eyes open, keep up the status quo.There was that Quirrel thing. That was scary. And the ghost-ish thing in the chamber of secrets... But this year, it's different. Your mark is getting darker. Voldemort is coming back. Like really coming back. SOON. This is no longer an academic exercise. You're going to have to go back. For real. To him. And be fucking convincing about it. And not just when you're there, at DE meetings, but all the damn time. There is no relaxing your guard anymore. No letting things go. You have to be a full time bad guy now. Because you're being watched. Hell, half the students in your house are the children of DE's and nothing wins mommy's and daddy's approval like juicy gossip. "Draco and Harry got in a fight and Master Snape gave Draco detention!" "Draco put a really sweet hex on that mudblood bitch, but you'll never believe it, Snape yelled at him for it and took it back off! I thought he hated mudbloods just like us?" shudder No. When Voldemort comes back, (and he IS coming back this time, and soon, you know it, Karkaroff knows it, just look at your bloody arm!) he has to believe that you've been his this whole time. Can't have any questions or doubts to try and explain away. Maybe later you can back off a bit, but not now, not now. So Draco is smirking and Pansy and the rest of your Slytherins are behind you Iaughing their heads off and you better just sneer and say "I see no difference." if you want to live to follow Dumbledore's orders.

Again. A truly truly perfectly good person would not be able to talk themselves into any excuse for bullying children. But Snape was not. He was a messed up dysfunctional human being in an impossible situation that Dumbledore was able to use precisely because he was so messed up. Which I have issues with, but that's a whole nother thing ðŸ˜‰
