You can like the character and have no desire to ever meet anyone like them in real life. Its fiction, these people don't actually exist so I don't see why it matters whether someone likes to read fiction with them or not. Lots of people like villains in books and movies (another poster on here mentioned the Joker as an example of terrible and yet very popular character.) and yet no one accuses Joker fans to want to be best friends with a serial killer/murderer in real life.
