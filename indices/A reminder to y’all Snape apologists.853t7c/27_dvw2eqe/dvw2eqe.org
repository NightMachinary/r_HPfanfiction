I don't mind Snape, I think he's one of the more interesting characters to explore in fanfiction.

But what I can't stand is when apologists make out James Potter as the worst human being alive because he was a bully as a teenager. Some are even deluded enough to portray this as being morally equivalent to joining Voldemort, which is /absurd/.

I mean look, I was plenty bullied as a kid, I've been publically embarrassed and whatnot, but what you come to realise is that bullies are not usually terrible people. If you spend your school years being mean to kids usually it's caused by all sorts of personal issues, coming from abusive families themselves etc. A lot of people stop doing it when they grow up, some don't - I also bullied some kids once I became pissed enough at my own circumstances, and before I sorted myself out. It's a vicious cycle that's hard to break, but it doesn't make you a VILLAIN.

From the information we're given, Snape clearly wasn't a darling in Hogwarts. Everyone knew he was into the Dark Arts, he hanged out with the worst blood purists etc. Bullying him, as much as some people can't seem to get over it, is not surprising or uniquely horrible. Kids get bullied for being slightly different, let alone being creepy and surly Slytherins. The Marauders had their own issues but it doesn't compare to what Snape did during his life.
