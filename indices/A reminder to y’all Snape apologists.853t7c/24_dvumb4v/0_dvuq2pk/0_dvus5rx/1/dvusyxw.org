Good point, too many signed up before they knew what they were getting into. In addition, Death Eaters were probably getting progressively worse as the war went on, just like the Nazis, who didn't appear nearly as bad in 1936 vs in 1942. In fact, as late as in 1938, there were huge rallies in America supporting the Nazis, and American industrialists such as Henry Ford were still very busy kissing Hitler's ass.

There was no quitting from the Death Eaters. Regulus was another example who found out the hard way.
