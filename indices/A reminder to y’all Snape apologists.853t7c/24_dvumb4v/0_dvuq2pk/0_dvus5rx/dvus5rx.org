Thank you for making my point for me. How many Germans are you aware of that went against Hitler's orders when they were exterminating Jews or burning Soviet villages on the Eastern Front?

I'm not saying they weren't there, but the majority of the population supported the Nazi Party, and so that makes what Snape did even more exceptional -- and that's even without the fact that the "allies" in this case were his bullies.
