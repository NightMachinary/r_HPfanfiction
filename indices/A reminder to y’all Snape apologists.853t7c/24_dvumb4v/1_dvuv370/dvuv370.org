This 'shitty life, no options' thing actually makes me think of Sirius. At 11, he decided he didn't want to be like his psycho family. At 16, he ran away from them entirely instead of falling in line. Despite this, he gets thrown into Azkaban by his own side with no trial and apparently not a one of the people he fought with speaking with him. Instead of that turning him, all of his anger and his hate remain directed at Voldemort and his followers, and he dies fighting against his own family. (Note that Regulus also dies at 18 defying Voldemort. No matter what side they were on, the Black's were freaking hardcore.)

Now, I've heard the argument that 'Sirius had friends. Snape didn't.' However, Snape did have a friend. He had Lily. He ended up in a different house from her, but remember that he wanted Slytherin despite Slytherin seemingly having a pretty crappy reputation that wouldn't be good to or accepting of Lily. He still wanted that. He still made friends with people that hated people like her. We also don't know if his looks were the sole reason he had no friends outside of that or if it was his sullen attitude that made it so that Lily couldn't even convince her friends he was decent. You're placing a lot of emphasis on his looks here when, really, Snape had a shitty, unpleasant attitude and that's documented in the books. Slughorn was ugly but he knew how to get in with people. Narcissa was pretty but her attitude and accompanying facial expressions made her unattractive. You're the one placing so much importance on his looks by arguing that's all people saw in him.

I'm not saying there wasn't tragedy in his life. I just call BS on the 'no options' line of thinking, He did make choices. He made them because he was young and foolish and bitter, but he still made them. You can say it would have been hard for him to choose differently but so what? "We must all face the choice of what is right and what is easy," remember? He wanted power and he went for it in the shittiest way, a way that lost him a good friend and then got her murdered.
