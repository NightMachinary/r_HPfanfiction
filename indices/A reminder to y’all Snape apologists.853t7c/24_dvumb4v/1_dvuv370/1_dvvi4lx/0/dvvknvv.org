You don't just look up to positive adult influences because they exist. You make a choice to look to them and emulate them instead of the other crappy influences in your life. Sirius made that choice, with his uncle and with James' parents. Snape was at a school with decent adults and Lily's parents seemed to be decent adults. He wasn't just surrounded by shit influences.

Sure, Snape was bullied. Sirius wasn't. Sirius was combating an upbringing that promoted prejudice and supported murder as a way to achieve purity and had to cut himself off from his parents and sibling to be somebody good. Snape wasn't in Sirius' situation any more than Sirius is in his. Their situations aren't identical. I never said they were. I was using Sirius as an example of someone who, at the age of 11, was already making choices about what life he wanted even though following in his parent's footsteps and supporting Voldemort would have seemed "natural". (And he probably would have gotten similar "but his life sucked" defenses on here if he'd been the reformed death eater.)

I don't know what that comment about him being abused has to do with Snape maybe not having friends because he had a shitty attitude. It's a reason for his attitude but it comes down to the same thing with classmates. He treated people like shit and nobody was obligated to put up with that.
