  You make a choice to look to them and emulate them instead of the other crappy influences in your life.

i mean, many children look up to the adults in their life because they take an active, ~positive interest in /them/. the onus is on the /adult/ to seek out and mentor the child

the point i'm making is that choices aren't made in a vacuum. hence bringing up sirius at all is pointless, because he doesn't have snape's experiences. you might as well bring up anybody else. and you're making a lot of assumptions about sirius and the context in which he made his choices. his disentangling from his family could easily be seen as an intuitive split from people that were neglectful, pressuring, abusive then he was exposed to james and gryffindor, etc. just like snape going against his father and extending that to all muggles can also be understood intuitively, then being exposed to lucius, bullied by james and sirius and needing protection and security from an opposed group, etc.

as for snape having friends. eh, i'm saying we have no proof he struck first, that he was mean to random people etc. we only see that as an adult. as a kid, he's mostly mean to people that are mean to him
