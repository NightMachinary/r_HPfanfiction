...you're the one who said you're, obviously, making assumptions about the characters. we know what sirius did, we don't know the specific context in which those actions, those choices, were made. we don't know who he sought out, if he was influenced, etc. for snape, we do know how jkr speaks about him. she's said snape's behaviour was a consequence of james' actions. she said he was a bully and became one because of it. etc. how she speaks about him is clear

yes, people are entitled to their interpretations, but not all interpretations have the same merit
