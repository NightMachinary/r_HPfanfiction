Except the child does not have to accept the adult in their life. That's my point. It's not as simple as 'positive adult influence = better life'. Even kids have parts to play and choices to make.

And of course I'm making assumptions about Sirius because we didn't have a marauders story. We got glimpses of their past. Even talk about Snape is based on a lot of assumptions (that nobody else tried to reach out to him, that people disliked him all because of his looks, that he was seeking security from people like Lucius instead of seeking power, that Snape was some kind of death eater that didn't kill/torture as I see some claiming.) We have to assume a lot because we actually know very little about any of their lives.

And, if bringing up examples is pointless, we can't have this discussion at all. Everything we think we know about abused and bullied children is based on studies of other abused and/or bullied children who don't have Snape's experiences. Every time we try to examine a character's motivations, it's based off personal knowledge or experiences. That's why people can see one character's actions in a dozen different ways. The post I responded to was even using school shooters as an example of victim response. There's no such things as choices made in a vacuum, but there's also no such thing as judgements or character analysis made in a vacuum.
