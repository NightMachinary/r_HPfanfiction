I'm making assumptions about his thought process. Not the events that occurred. You stated there was no support for what I was saying but the events are the support. We don't have Sirius' POV so using the facts to support it is the only thing we can do. And nothing about Snape invalidates what many say about him. He made crappy choices that put him in the situation he was in. Tragic reasons and bad influences don't invalidate that. Agree to disagree on that, I guess.

Not all interpretations have the same merit unless they're all based on logic and facts from the books. If someone can support their argument with logic and facts, it has merit, and the logic and facts can still result in very different interpretations.
