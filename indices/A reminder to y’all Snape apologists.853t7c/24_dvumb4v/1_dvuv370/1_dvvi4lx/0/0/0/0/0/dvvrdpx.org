What claims about Sirius are unsupported? We know he made a choice to travel a different path at 11 because he remarks on how his whole family was Slytherin and then happily talks about breaking this tradition. We know his family is against muggles and muggleborns because we met his dear old mother in the photograph. We know they were okay with murder to purify the wizarding world because Sirius says so, that they thought Voldemort had the right idea and their views are what led to his brother becoming a death eater. We know he defied them throughout his teenage years because Harry remarks on how he stuck muggle banners and Gryffindor banners on his wall with a permanent sticking charm. We know him leaving them at 16 was a big matter because he was blasted off the family tree for it and he thinks his uncle was blasted off for supporting him. We know he went to the Potters himself because he remarks that they took him as a second son after he ran away. We know why he left because Harry asked him and he says he had enough of their beliefs about blood purity and the superiority of their family. We know he had to be cut off from the family to be something good because he says himself that anyone halfway decent in his family has to be disowned. The books themselves say a good amount about Sirius.

The most relevant comment from Rowling about Snape is probably: "He was all grey. You can't make him a saint: he was vindictive & bullying. You can't make him a devil: he died to save the wizarding world." Snape was both a victim and an aggressor. She says he valued goodness but couldn't emulate it.

As for Merope being a better example, I completely disagree. The original post I responded to was talking about how Snape's choice to associate and become a death eater was natural given his situation. That's what my example was about, another situation in which it would have been easy for someone to make all the wrong choices and end up a death eater. Whether their situations were identical isn't the point. The relevant similarity is that both of their situations could have easily led them to the same endpoint (being a death eater). Or, to summarize my point in all of this: Snape made crappy choices when he was younger.

I'm not sure what that end part means. Yes, they behave and act in the context of their arcs. However, characters actions and their arcs still need to be interpreted by the reader. It's why people can view Snape/Lily so very differently. For some, it's sweet and enduring. For others, it's obsessive and selfish. These two ideas are created from personal beliefs and experiences and create judgements and analysis that can be wildly different. That's what I mean about it not happening in a vacuum.
