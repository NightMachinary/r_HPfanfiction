  And of course I'm making assumptions about Sirius because we didn't have a marauders story. We got glimpses of their past. Even talk about Snape is based on a lot of assumptions
#+end_quote

eh, the 'assumptions' i'm making are taking cues from things jkr has said, because she created the characters and designed their arcs. i haven't read much or anything to support your claims about sirius, whereas she has directly said and supported a lot of statements about snape, why he is the way he is, why he joined the DEs, etc. that he was vulnerable, that he was an outcast, that he should have been treated more kindly, that he was bullied and thus became a bully, that he values goodness. she even partially condemns ootp sirius for not looking to see the positives in snape, which is a lot, even for me. if the only way we could know their backstory and minds is if she wrote about it, then what she thinks is relevant, and we know what she thinks. i don't it's a claim to make that she's a 'snape apologist', because she is. she has her protag forgive him even though he never even apologises to him. she's always going to characterise his bad actions with an element of sympathy, because he's a main character and she cares about him in a way she just doesn't for a lot of other characters

  And, if bringing up examples is pointless
#+end_quote

eh, i didn't say bringing up examples is pointless, i'm saying sirius isn't a useful one. merope, maybe, would be a better example in terms of influences. that's all i can think of in the series. carrie from the stephen king novel would be another.

  but there's also no such thing as judgements or character analysis made in a vacuum.
#+end_quote

yeah. characters behave and act within the context of the arcs they're given
