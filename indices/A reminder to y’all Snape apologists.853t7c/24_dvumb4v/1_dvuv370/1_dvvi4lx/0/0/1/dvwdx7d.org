Snape and James & Sirius had a rivalry from their meeting on the Hogwarts express and already then did Snape know more curses and hexes than most seventh year students. And he was friends with Slytherin students that would later become Death Eaters. He did so willingly.

As to Snape being rather friendless. He might also be an introvert who just didn't hang around with his friends 24/7. People that it's noted he was friends with: Avery, Mulciber, Lucius, Evan Rosier, and Wilkes. He was also part of the Slug Club, though Slughorn didn't think he'd ultimately amount to much but was there because of his skill in Potions.

As for choices not being made in a vacuum I'll point to you that Sirius most likely was pressured to joining Slytherin by his family. But he didn't, and he still had to live there for 5 years. You don't think that they'd try to 'convert' him back to their point of view.

As for Snape only turning bad when exposed to the Slytherins I'll have to call bullshit. As I've already said he knew more hexes and curses than most seventh years when he started. That does not point towards him being a happy go lucky kind of kid. He was troubled and that shows, but that does not excuse his behavior. Did Harry turn out as bad as Snape? No, he didn't, and they had more or less the same formative years. The only difference is that one chose to rise above his upbringing and one chose to want revenge for it.
