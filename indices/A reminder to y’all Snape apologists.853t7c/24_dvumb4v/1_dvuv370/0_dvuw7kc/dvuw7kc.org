Honestly, I like this argument. Sirius is a good example of how Snape could have made different choice as a kid. Several points, however.

One: Like I pointed out in my original post, your social circle usually determined your outlook on life, on what is right and what is wrong. Sirius did have friends -- and those friends held opposite values compared to Snape's associates.

Two: As I understand, Snape really dove into the DE camp after Lily's rejection. I don't know about about you, but I find that throwing away a friend over a word thrown in anger and despair is not very friend-like. And, sure, there were things leading up to that, but, point is: Lily was his sole tether to anything good in the world. With it gone, he made the worst choices.

And, yes, those were his choices. You're right. But, as you point out yourself, they were made as a kid. And kids make terrible choices all the time. That's why, when we judge them, we factor in age as a mitigating factor.

Snape paid for his choices -- those done at a young age, when he was bitter and full of resentment -- all his life. He paid most heavily for them, but pay he did, despite the fact that nothing forced him to, except his own guilt and conscience -- and when most people probably wouldn't have, and that's why I find him a hero.
