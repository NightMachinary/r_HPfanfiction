Doesn't need to be sympathetic, but actively mocking and bullying children makes him a dick, and many of his actions make a case for him being irredeemable (my opinion varies from day to day honestly). He could've been biased towards students in his house while not being such a raging bastard. Then again he didn't like muggles did he, and had no problems being a leading member of a group sworn to eliminate muggle borns. We see nothing that would hint he changed his overarching world view. He simply went to Dumbledore to try and save Lily, not because he had a whole hearted change of views.
