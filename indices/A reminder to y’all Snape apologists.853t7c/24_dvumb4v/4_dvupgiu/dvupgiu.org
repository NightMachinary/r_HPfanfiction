You hit the nail on the fucking head. Let's also point here on the WHO that is involved in the incident shown. He cannot be shown being any sort of sympathetic, yet he doesn't do a damn thing to Hermione as she flees. The guy is a good spy. Was it a shit thing to do, yes, but it was part of the game he was playing. Snape is right decent compared to some of psychos in Harry Potter. (He doesn't in register compared to ASOIAF characters.).
