  You hit the nail on the fucking head. Let's also point here on the WHO that is involved in the incident shown. He cannot be shown being any sort of sympathetic, yet he doesn't do a damn thing to Hermione as she flees. The guy is a good spy. Was it a shit thing to do, yes, but it was part of the game he was playing. Snape is right decent compared to some of psychos in Harry Potter. (He doesn't in register compared to ASOIAF characters.).

This fundamentally misunderstands the kind of spy Snape is. Both sides know he is a spy, there's no secret to it. If the Death Eaters question his actions, he can point towards needing to convince Dumbledore that he is loyal to the Order (as he did to Bellatrix in HBP). If the Order questions his actions, he can point towards needing to convince Voldemort that he is loyal to the Death Eaters.

The result is that there is no burden on Snape to behave in accordance with any particular side. He can just do what he wants - which he does.
