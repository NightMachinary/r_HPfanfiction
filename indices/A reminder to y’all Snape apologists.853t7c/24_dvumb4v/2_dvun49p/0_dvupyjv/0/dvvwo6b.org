You can still hold people morally culpable where other people in the same circumstances would likely have done the same. This idea is the foundation of the principle that necessity is not a defence for murder.

It's an interesting historical public debate - the case of R v Dudley and Stephens (1884). Essentially a group of four sailors had become shipwrecked and escaped in a lifeboat. Three of them killed and ate the fourth in what was at the time an accepted "Custom of the Sea" - the idea that it was necessary that one should die, rather than four.

The case caused a huge public debate and resulted in a judicial decision that stands as good law to this day, not only in England and Wales but also in the USA, Canada, Australia, India, etc.

Some excerpts:

  To preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it. War is full of instances in which it is a man's duty not to live, but to die. The duty, in case of shipwreck, of a captain to his crew, of the crew to the passengers, of soldiers to women and children, as in the noble case of the Birkenhead; these duties impose on men the moral necessity, not of the preservation, but of the sacrifice of their lives for others, from which in no country, least of all, it is to be hoped, in England, will men ever shrink, as indeed, they have not shrunk.

  ...

  We are often compelled to set up standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we could not ourselves satisfy. But a man has no right to declare temptation to be an excuse, though he might himself have yielded to it, nor allow compassion for the criminal to change or weaken in any manner the legal definition of the crime.

Snape's moral duty remained to be a good person, notwithstanding that he had a troubled upbringing. If moral duties disappeared simply because they were difficult to achieve, it wouldn't really be morality anymore - merely convenience.
