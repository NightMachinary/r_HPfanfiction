That's a very good point, but it stresses the legal culpability of actions, not the moral ones. A court of law found the survivors on the boat guilty due to specific details pertaining to the case (like their inability to predict the future, which removed the justification for murder), but we're not a court of law, and we're judging a character based on an entirely different set of principles.

But let's say that it was Snape's moral duty to act like a “good” person. At its core, that's a decent a decent argument. I will be the first to admit that Snape was generally an unpleasant and downright mean individual. However, this view is often taken to an extreme by a variety of Snape-haters; they perceive him through a rigid set of Boolean principles: If bullied children, then EVIL, everything else -- doesn't matter. My post was an attempt to explain why that's a narrow-minded view; that not everything in this world is strictly black or white.

You don't have to like Snape. But there is so much more to him than a mean teacher. And to deny that is a butchery of his character.
