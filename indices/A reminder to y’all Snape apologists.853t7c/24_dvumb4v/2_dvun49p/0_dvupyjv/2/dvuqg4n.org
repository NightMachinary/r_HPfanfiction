Not saying he wasn't brave, or brilliant. He also was a racist until a personal connection with one person (let's not get into that topic now) made him try and save â€˜her'; not even her husband or child! Then after she died he treated many children like shit. Sorry, but regardless of his upbringing he was close to what would be considered abuse. He definitely was bullying a pupil with this specific example towards Hermione; which would get his ass fired in a normal school in the UK, and as a teacher - his attitude towards many of his students is abhorrent.

Again, I used the word excuse - I get understanding why he was like he was, but that doesn't make any of what he did better in hindsight
