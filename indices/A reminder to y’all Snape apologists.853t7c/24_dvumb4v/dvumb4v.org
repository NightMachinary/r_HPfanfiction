I'm ready for the downvotes. Here goes.

Snape didn't turn out to be a great person. However, shallow posts never ask why. They never look into Snape's past; instead, they turn into the equivalent of judging a book by its cover.

So, let's take a look at Snape.

Snape had a miserable childhood. His only positive friend that we know off was Lily Evans. Who were the others? Sons of Death Eaters. Now, most children strive to conform to the ideology of their peer group -- that's just basic psychology. In Snape's case, this would be reinforced by the actions of the more egalitarian clique, aka, the Marauders. Now, if there is any person in here that thinks a child would go, “Well, Sirius Black and James Potter have bullied me mercilessly for years and almost murdered me on one occasion, but they sure have some swell ideas about muggleborns,” please, realize you are deluding yourself. Snape would have been pushed towards the only people that showed him any consideration -- the Death Eaters.

Now, let's take a look at Snape's adolescence. Maybe he had a happy life here, right? I mean, otherwise the “Snape-hate” narrative becomes a little narrow-minded. Oh, but wait. Snape was a child soldier. That doesn't sound so good, does it? Now, some of you may say at this point: But he chose this life! It was his decision! And, once again, you're missing the point. No, Snape really didn't have any other options available to him. He was a bullied teenager, reviled for his looks (he's an ugly git with sallow skin and greasy hair -- EVIL, amiright?) and his poor clothes by the people regarded as the “heroes.” It's natural he would have joined the group opposing them.

As a side note, how many school shootings in America are perpetrated by bullied, outcast students -- just like Snape was?

Now, let's move on. Lily dies. Snape is overcome by feelings -- some of them not very positive. Again, given his history, an expected reaction. What does he do? Does he ignore her death? Carry on as a soldier in Voldemort's army? No, he betrays Voldemort. That's right, he betrays the homicidal megalomaniac that will torture him to death if he finds out. Oh, and let's not forget that Voldemort can READ MINDS. Snape defies Voldemort for years -- how many of you would have done the same? Hmm? Any volunteers to risk torture and death for no other reason than guilt?

Somehow -- and I'm still flabbergasted as to why -- people overlook all this. They get hung up on his oily hair, proving, that even in books characters can be judged by their appearance. They get offended by his treatment of children. Go be bullied all your childhood, join a gang, fight a war while risking death from BOTH sides of the conflict -- see if you turn out any better.

In all his life, Snape probably could count on his fingers the number of times he was happy. To put it plainly, his life sucked. He needed therapy. But, despite everything, he managed to turn away from Voldemort. I would argue that 99.9% of people wouldn't have had the courage or the conviction or the strength of character to do what he did: to risk it all and lose it all for...what? A memory?

But, no. Let's all hate Snape. He bullied children, and was a greasy-haired git.
