We have no idea what his childhood was like. His parents could've been poor, or he was simply not well cared for. The only thing we know about is that his parents fought often and that Tobias abused Eileen emotionally and mentally, though one could guess that it was also physically. And his ideas about blood purity and magical supremacy could just as well have come from this time.

Snape and James & Sirius had a rivalry from their meeting on the Hogwarts express and already then did Snape know more curses and hexes than most seventh year students. And he was friends with Slytherin students that would later become Death Eaters. He did so willingly.

As to Snape being rather friendless. He might also be an introvert who just didn't hang around with his friends 24/7. People that it's noted he was friends with: Avery, Mulciber, Lucius, Evan Rosier, and Wilkes. He was also part of the Slug Club, though Slughorn didn't think he'd ultimately amount to much but was there because of his skill in Potions.

Next off Snapes changed sides first when his love was in danger. Not because he had any qualms about killing those like her. That's like an SS officer loving a Jew but not caring until she was in danger.
