Plenty of stuff worse than verbal cruelty, but not as bad as rape. Physical abuse and beating bad students like Filch is usually shown as being a fan of. Or even just torture like with a blood quill.

Or even Dumbledore with the Mirror of Erised, letting Harry return over and over literally letting him torture himself with the idea of family. Before it was assumed he read Harry's mind to know what he saw, I always thought that he knew because Harry would talk to them and Dumbledore just watched and listened.
