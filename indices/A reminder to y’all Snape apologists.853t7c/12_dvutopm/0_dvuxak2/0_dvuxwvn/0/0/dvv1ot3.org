You have a point there, I just wanted differentiate what Snape was doing was cruel, but not the worst cruelty to me.

I didn't like the whole cruelty, to children from a teacher was the worst thing, idea. Cruelty is too broad a term to use for that

Snape could be stealing Hermione's left sock to make her left foot cold and suffer the terror of a cold foot while also having one warm one. That would still be cruelty towards students from a teacher, but is that really a step down from murder? I'd say no lol

Though I would love a story of a Snape in his own mind being this cruel and terrible person. But in reality just causes minor inconvenience.

"Yes Harry! It was me that took the last treacle tart."

"Ohh. That sucks, well guess I'll have some cherry pie then."

"You hide your suffering well, but I know how truly deep your sorrow is."
