My issue with this post in particular is that there isn't any effort on the part of the OP. Linking an image and giving a provocative title isn't necessarily going to stifle discussion, but it will definitely make it easier for low effort posts to pour in.

As long as it's an occasional thing and we don't reach a situation in which half the posts on the sub are like this, it's probably fine.
