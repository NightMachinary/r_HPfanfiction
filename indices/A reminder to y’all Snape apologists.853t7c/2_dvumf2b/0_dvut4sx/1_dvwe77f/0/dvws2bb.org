Sure! I have quite a lot that meet that criteria though, any specific themes or characters that you like? Here are my favorites:

linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Big time AU where Voldemort won the first war. Amazing character portrayals and lots of morally ambiguous characters. Also some good twists on who is a "good" guy or "bad" guy while keeping everyone in character.

linkffn(In blood only) A take on the Snape is Harry's father trope. The fic was written before half blood prince so it's not completely canon, but Snape is quite in character personality wise and the end result of his and Harry's relationship is hilariously disastrous.

linkffn(Stronger than hope) Snape mentors Harry fic where Snape is not a particularly good person. Lots of focus on occlumency and legilimency.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux) Voldemorts horcrux awakens in Harry's head and starts talking to him. A good portrayal of him influencing Harry's personality and his thought processes while being influenced by him as well.

linkffn(Rectifier) Sadly abandoned, but quite good. A Tom Riddle researcher who never turned into an evil murderer from another universe travels to the canon universe and becomes a professor at Hogwarts. Has a good explanation for how he could have possibly turned out "good" while keeping him consistent with Voldemorts character.

linkao3(Keep Your Enemies Closer by Riddletobien) A Voldemort won at some point during Harry's Hogwarts years. Quite dark at times.
