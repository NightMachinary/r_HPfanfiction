There is no "hate-speech", just free-speech that you don't like! Sorry, but you can't have free-speech and hate-speech laws/rules because that always censors peoples free-speech and censorship is something only dictatorships should EVER engage in!

Sorry, but democracy should be able to take people voicing bad ideas - if it can not then it has failed and deserves to fall! - which then get drowned out on the marketplace of ideas!
