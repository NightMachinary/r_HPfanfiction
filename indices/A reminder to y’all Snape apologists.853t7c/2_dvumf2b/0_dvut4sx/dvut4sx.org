This entire thread is just one big Snape hate circlejerk. The title may not be hate speech, but a lot of posts on here are just Snape bashing and seem hostile to anyone who doesn't agree that Snape is the worst person ever. Although just about every "discussion" post about Snape devolves into a debate split between people who absolutely hate or love him so I guess that's to be expected.

As someone who likes him not because he is a good person, but because he is an interesting complex character that I find entertaining to read about, it does make me kind of sad. I know he is terrible, but what can I say? I love some good sarcasm, dry humour, cynism and characters who are kind of bad doing good things for all the wrong reasons. I find his insults and comments hilarious and his speeches passionate and interesting. He is terrible with people, has serious problems and is generally all around messed up, but there are some underlying circumstances both of his own doing and upbringing that led to that.

It's not just movie Snape either. That speech in potions about stopping death in first book? Just wow. He is obviously exaggerating but the way he talks is poetic, his character voice has presence even when written and it's awesome. I can't help but love it even if he follows it up with some horrible insults to Harry.

I like reading fics that explore all those aspects of his character. They are more interesting to me than edgy, independent Harry bashing everyone that the author doesn't like or morally entirely good characters that battle evil. Fanon! misunderstood! Snape that has no flaws or issues definitely annoys me though.
