But he‘s not my husband, he‘s literally a fictional character in a book. Like I said, I would never want to meet someone like him in real life, I'm sure he‘d be an ass. But some people just enjoy reading about twisted characters and that's okay. Just like some people enjoy murder mysteries, doesn't mean they want that to happen to them in real life or that they want to be a murderer themselves. How many people like the Joker from Batman? Yet somehow, they are never called “apologists“.

You can recognise that someone‘s bad life made them the way they are and feel bad for them in that way without excusing their actions, just saying.
