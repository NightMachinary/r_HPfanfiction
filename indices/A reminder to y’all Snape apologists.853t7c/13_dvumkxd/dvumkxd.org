Okay, so Snape is my favourite character. Was he an awful and unfair teacher? Yes. Was he wrong for not accepting that Lily didn't want to be with him and for treating Harry like shit just because of who his father was? Yes. Was he bitter and spiteful? Yes. Would I ever want to meet a real-life version of him? Hell no. But I still like him, I just do. You can love a character to pieces while still acknowledging that they were an asshole most of the time.
