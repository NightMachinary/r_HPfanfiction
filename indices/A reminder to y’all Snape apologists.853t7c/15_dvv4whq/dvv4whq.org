Setting aside the fact that this supposed discussion post is so hostile that it makes a mockery of the very idea of "discussion"...

The term "Snape apologist" came about as a play on words from "rape apologist" and is pretty disgusting, tbh. I don't care how bad you think Snape is, you shouldn't equate liking a fictional character with /literal rape/.
