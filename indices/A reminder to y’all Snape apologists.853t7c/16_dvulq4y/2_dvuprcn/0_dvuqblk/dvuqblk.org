  Snape was a death eater, who truly believed in the cause and enjoyed making people suffer.

What makes you so sure? At the least, the way I've seen TrueDeathEater!Snape written, and the way Rowling seems to present him before the reveal, is that like Voldemort he used the Death Eater movement as an excuse to let loose and practice dark magic. I don't think there's any substancial evidence that he "truly believed" in blood purity, except his using the word "mudblood" which I think had more to do with fitting in with Mucliber and Co. than with his true beliefs.

As for enjoying people's suffering... again, I don't know if we can safely conclude he was sadistic in the same way as someone like Bellatrix. He enjoyed /winning/, he enjoyed defeating people, he was a vengeful man; but would he be the kind of man to use the Cruciatus, I don't know. As I wrote above, I see his jabs more as extreme cynism and misanthropy ("I'm going to do what /I/ think is funny and/or liberating, and to hell with what the other pathetic apes think").

But whatever the case may be, you're kind of answering besides my comment. OP was trying to use his teasing Hermione as evidence that he was an evil unredeemable scumbag, which I think it's a wrong, lame argument, regardless of whether he really was evil or not.
