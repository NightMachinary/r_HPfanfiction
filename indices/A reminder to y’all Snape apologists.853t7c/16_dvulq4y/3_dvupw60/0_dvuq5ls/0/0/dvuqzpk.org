His enjoyment of Dark Magic certainly factored into it, but I was under the impression that being an anti-Voldemort Slytherin in the 1970's was pretty much an intenable position, and some very bad things could have happened to young Severus if he hadn't cheered like everybody else at night in the dormitories when the older students began discussing the Dark Lord's latest moves. I dunno. That was certainly the impression I got.
