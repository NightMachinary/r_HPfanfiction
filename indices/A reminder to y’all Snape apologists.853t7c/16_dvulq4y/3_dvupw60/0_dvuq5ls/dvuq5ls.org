I don't think Snape was evil in the same way Voldemort and Bellatrix were /evil/ --- it wasn't a core part of his character, he just gave in and committed very evil actions in circumstances where his entire social circle pushed him to. Much like a lot of Nazi soldiers, to be honest. Were all of these thousand people irredeemably evil? There's a philosophical argument to be made both ways, of course, but I would say no.

But whatever the case may be, you're kind of answering besides my comment. OP was trying to use his teasing Hermione as evidence that he was an evil unredeemable scumbag, which I think it's a wrong, lame argument, regardless of whether he really was evil or not.
