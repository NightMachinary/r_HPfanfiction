I never said that he was "one of the most trusted" Death Eaters, just highly trusted, I believe that's an important distinction to make.

My reasoning is based on Voldemort's instability and casual cruelty - we see it in GoF when he's freshly resurrected; Pettigrew had just gone 'to hell and back' to return Voldemort to a body, and yet he was left to suffer and bleed until Voldemort felt like healing his arm.

If /that/ is how Voldemort rewards a servant who brings him back to life, telling him about a prophecy is small potatoes in comparison. So it stands to reason that Snape was held in very high esteem to even /dare/ ask for that kind of favor, and even higher esteem that the favor was granted.

After all, Voldemort hated muggles and muggleborns, it was trying to murder them all, so sparing Lily went /completely/ against his ideology, and people (especially madmen like Voldemort) don't like going against their personal ideologies.
