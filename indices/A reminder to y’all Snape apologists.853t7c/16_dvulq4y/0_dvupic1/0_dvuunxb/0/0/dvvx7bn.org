To be fair Voldemort after his resurrection just seemed completely crazy and unstable, I don't know why anyone would ever follow him. Maybe he was more reasonable and more sane before being killed by a 2 year old? I don't see how he could have gotten such a large following or any success otherwise.

As for wanting to kill all muggleborns. It's always been my theory that while he absolutely despises muggles, he doesn't really care about blood purity that much and mostly preaches it so much to court all the purebloods. Why would he hold Snape, a half blood in such high regard if blood purity was so important to him. And didn't he offer James and Lily a place in his ranks at some point, or is that some fanon concept that I read that never actually happened.
