Come on now, /you're completely ignoring the fact that he was a Death Eater/, and a loyal one. He knew that telling Voldemort about the prophecy would condemn an entire family to death, and he did it anyway. Not only was he a Death Eater, he was a highly ranked, and highly trusted one as well - he asked Voldemort to spare Lily's life, and Voldemort /complied/. Voldemort was willing to spare the life of a muggleborn because Snape asked him to! What kinds of atrocities does someone have to commit in order to get on Voldemorts good side to that extent?

So in my opinion, Snape is far beyond "/mean/", and well into "evil" territory not for his inexcusable actions as a teacher, but for his conduct as a terrorist.
