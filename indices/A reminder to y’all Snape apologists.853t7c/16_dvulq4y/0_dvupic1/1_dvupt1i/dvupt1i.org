Now /that/ argument I can make sense of. I think there's room for interpretation on just how awful what Snape did was (I think it's conceivable Voldemort just thought well of him thanks to his Potion and Duelling skills, and how useful they made him, as opposed to any /particularly/ horrible deeds), and with that in mind I think his years of atonement, spywork and eventual death are enough to redeem him at the end of the day. But if you're arguing /that/ way, I can respect your opinion.

/However/, that is not what OP was doing. The original post took his /jeering at Hermione/ as a counter to "Snape was only a human, and a forgivable person". Regardless of his Death Eaterism, I think you can agree that OP's argument was rather lame.
