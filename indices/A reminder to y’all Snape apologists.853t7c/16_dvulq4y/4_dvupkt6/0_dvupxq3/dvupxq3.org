  Yes, his past can explain what he did, but it doesn't excuse it. He still has to take responsibility for his actions.

I'd argue his spywork, atonement, and eventual death to help good win are enough to redeem him. I don't think Snape was evil in the same way Voldemort and Bellatrix were evil --- it wasn't a core /part/ of his character, for all that he may have given in and comitted very evil actions in those particular circumstances.

But whatever the case may be, you're kind of answering besides my comment. OP was trying to use his /teasing Hermione/ as evidence that he was an evil unredeemable scumbag, which I think it's a wrong, lame argument, regardless of whether he really /was/ evil or not.
