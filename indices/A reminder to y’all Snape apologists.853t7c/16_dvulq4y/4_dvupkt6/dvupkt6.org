When he joined the Death Eaters, he would torture and murder people and rape women. If he didn't do it personally, he aided those who did. That makes him evil. Then there is the fact that he painted a target on some family for death. He didn't know that it was Lily's family, but it was someone's family.

Yes, his past can explain what he did, but it doesn't excuse it. He still has to take responsibility for his actions.
