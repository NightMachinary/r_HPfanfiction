If I may: jerk =/= evil. Professor Snape was a man with a bitter temper and rather mean sense of humor. He was (utterly) lacking in basic human decency when it came to day-to-day dealings, but if we're being honest, this is a trait he shared with young James. I see both of them as essentially the same unlikable-but-not-evil people when they were young, two merciless bullies each very convinced they were sufficiently above everyone else they were allowed to pick on others for fun. James grew out of it, Snape didn't.

But again, I see Snape as /mean/, but not /evil/, those being two different things. Teacher is clearly not the profession he was meant for, but people don't deserve to go to Azkaban just because they tease and mock in a rather cruel fashion. Snape /was/ in the end a good character, just not one any of us would want to socialize with.

About this particular moment, again, I think it's not so much that he "enjoyed making kids cry" as that he enjoyed being mean and sarcastic about life in general, and didn't give a damn if it upset other people' feelings.
