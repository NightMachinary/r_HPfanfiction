I agree with your points, and upvoted you, but I just want to point out a piece of fanon you've included that most people don't realize isn't canon. You don't need a Potions NEWT to become an Auror. You 'just' need any 5 NEWTs, Exceeds Expectations or higher. Potions is one of the recommended ones, but it's not required.
