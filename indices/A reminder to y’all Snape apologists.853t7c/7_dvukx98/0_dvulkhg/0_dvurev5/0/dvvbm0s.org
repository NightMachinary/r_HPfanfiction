Wasn't he? He was always biased in favor of Slytherin, he took points for breathing to loudly (!), he allowed Slytherins to sabotage the other houses (if I remember this right...) in potions, he only ever took students with an O in the potions OWL (thus hampering the Aurors who could recruit less people...not to mention that healers probably also have to get a potions NEWT, same for some who want to become potionsmasters! Hell, most jobs probably benefit from a potions NEWT, but with Snape in charge? Nope, only his favoured few get that!)
