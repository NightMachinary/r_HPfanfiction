Malfoy was an asshole who should have been in prison for a long long long time! Coerced my ass! The guy is an accessory to murder, he's a member of a terrorist group, he was complicit in high treason (overthrowing the ministry!), he participated in torture, kidnapping, appartheit (muggleborn segregation and oppression!) etc.!

The fact that he didn't like it does NOT redeem him at all! If he had fought alongside the trio or something then that would have been redeemed IMHO!
