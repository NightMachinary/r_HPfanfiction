Book 2 he helps to make the mandatory draught.. admittedly that would be part of his job.

Book three he makes the wolf's bane potion. And goes after lupin when he knows it's the full moon. Book 4 I don't know but goes back to spying which may save a lot of lives. Book 5 still spying. Book 6, he saves draco soul if you want to count that. Also still spying..

Book 7. I really think he could have done worse as headmaster. Sending the gryffindors into the forest with Hagrid is way better than the cruciate.
