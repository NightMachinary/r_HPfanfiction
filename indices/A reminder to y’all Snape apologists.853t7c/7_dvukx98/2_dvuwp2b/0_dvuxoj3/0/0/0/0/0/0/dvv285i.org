  Book 2 he helps to make the mandatory draught.. admittedly that would be part of his job.
#+end_quote

Can this really be used to make someone seem like a good person? What other choice did he have? "Nah, Dumbledore, do it yourself."

#+begin_quote
  Book three he makes the wolf's bane potion. And goes after lupin when he knows it's the full moon.
#+end_quote

Again, I doubt he had a choice. What was he going to do, just tell Dumbledore no? And he didn't go after Lupin for that reason. He saw the Marauder's Map, saw Sirius Black and Remus Lupin on it. He is happy about the thought of giving the two to the dementors to be kissed, despite knowing there was more to the story.

  Book 4 I don't know but goes back to spying which may save a lot of lives.
#+end_quote

Not in the fourth book he doesn't. He might've spied for Dumbledore during the very last chapter, but save lives? Voldemort wasn't even attacking anyone.

#+begin_quote
  Book 6, he saves draco soul if you want to count that.
#+end_quote

Draco would have not killed Dumbledore. And he made a vow. It was either help Draco or literally die.

#+begin_quote
  Book 7. I really think he could have done worse as headmaster. Sending the gryffindors into the forest with Hagrid is way better than the cruciate.
#+end_quote

Not that they didn't get the Cruciatus on other times anyway. But I don't blame him for that. Not much he could have done. I just don't think he was a morally ambiguous guy. He was a straight up piece of shit who tried to redeem himself for Lily --- and ultimately failed.
