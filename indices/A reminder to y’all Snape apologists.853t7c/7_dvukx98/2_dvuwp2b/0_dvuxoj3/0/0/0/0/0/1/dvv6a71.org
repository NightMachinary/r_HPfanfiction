Book 2 he whispers a duel tip to Draco: throw a snake at Harry. Why would he do this, if not to suss out what's going on with Voldemort, to see if he's wrapped himself around Harry the way he wrapped himself around Quirrel? He gives the appearance of being part of the dueling club to favor his house, but he's looking at the bigger threat, when no one else is.

Book 3 he damn well knew Lupin was with kids when he ran after him.

Book 4 he is investigating Karkaroff and Moody the whole time.

Book 6 and beyond, he is a double agent, risking death and worse for the order.

Book 2, I'll grant, if he wasn't there, the outcome would have been similar. The rest, he is instrumental.
