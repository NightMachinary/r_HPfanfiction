The movies started when book 3 was out when some (most?) people didn't get the hints that he was gray not evil, but, there wasn't any truly evil acts to atone for either. So it's hard to say.

For what it's worth , I like Rickman, but he was never 100% Snape to me. I don't know how old he is , but he is very clearly waaaaaay to old to play someone who graduated from Hogwarts less than 15 years before the 1st movie.
