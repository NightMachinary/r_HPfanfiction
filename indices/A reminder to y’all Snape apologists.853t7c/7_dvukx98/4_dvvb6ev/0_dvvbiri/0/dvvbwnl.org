is this a joke? his 'redeeming feature' was turning his back on his past ideals and actions and working against them. his entire role in the series was shown *in the first book*, where he's mean to harry who then finds out he was trying to save him all along. his 'redeeming feature' was a series a of redeeming features. by this logic, you can say he only had 1 'bad feature', being mean. as for why he's liked: he's easily the (second) most tragic character in the series, and that garners sympathy, and he commits himself to atonement, which requires personal courage, and the execution of that, physical courage
