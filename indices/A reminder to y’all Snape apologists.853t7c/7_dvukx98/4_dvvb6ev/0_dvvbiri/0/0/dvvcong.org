I said main redeeming event. None of the rest are significant enough to outweigh all the shitty things he does. Turning on a genocidal maniac isn't something I consider a redeeming event. It's simply gathering your common sense and not serving a genocidal maniac. Working against them? Yeah, great and all, too bad he was a complete piece of shit the rest of the time.

And when we're talking about liking him, we're not talking about liking him as a complex character. That much is rather obvious by the context of this thread.
