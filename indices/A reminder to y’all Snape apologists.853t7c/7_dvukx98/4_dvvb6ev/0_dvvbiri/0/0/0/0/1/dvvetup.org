...what? i never said how he treated students was okay. your argument seems to be that his actions for the war weren't significant. if we're talking about intentions and actions- then mistreating his students was bad, being willing to sacrifice his life for others was good. if you want to argue about the actual effect he had, then i'll ask again, what are the consequences of him being mean to children? i've known shitty teachers and i...don't think of them. it has no consequence on my life. we know the actual consequences of his actions in the war. harry went to sacrifice himself because of it. draco was saved because of it. harry named his child after him

  Listen, the only reason he even switched sides was because Voldemort was going to hunt Lily down. That's fucking it. Dumbledore even points out this, that Snape only cared for Lily and didn't give a shit for what happened to James and Harry

...and then he reforms, and is appalled at /dumbledore/ for how he treated harry

he tried to save lupin in the battle of 7 potters

  JK Rowling herself has said that he's a very sadistic person.

jk rowling herself has also said he died to save the world, and was working to make right his past terrorist actions, and supported lily's cause

  Draco was never going to kill Dumbledore. Harry thought so, Dumbledore thought so, and Snape only did it because Dumbledore asked him to and because he made a vow.

he made the vow and agreed to dumbledore to protect draco, and further defended him to voldemort. when draco failed, they needed dumbledore dead or he'd be punished. snape took his place
