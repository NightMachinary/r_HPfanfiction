  your argument seems to be that his actions for the war weren't significant.

*No, it's not. It's that he didn't redeem himself in the end.* This has been my argument from the /very beginning./

  i've known shitty teachers and i...don't think of them. it has no consequence on my life

Ok. Good for you. Again, just because JK Rowling decided psychological issues weren't important doesn't mean that bullying children is okay. It's abuse. It can cause psychological issues. Just because you were okay doesn't mean everyone would be. It doesn't mean making kids cry is okay.

  ...and then he reforms, and is appalled at dumbledore for how he treated harry
#+end_quote

He's appalled that Harry has to die in the end, and "appalled" is even a strong a word for it. There is no other reaction in terms of how Dumbledore treated Harry.

#+begin_quote
  he tried to save lupin in the battle of 7 potters
#+end_quote

Fair enough. Then it's evened out for the time he tried to get Lupin Kissed.

#+begin_quote
  jk rowling herself has also said he died to save the world, and was working to make right his past terrorist actions, and supported lily's cause
#+end_quote

This isn't a counterargument to my original argument.

And who the hell is upvoting my comment ten seconds after I post it.
