  uh, no, I'm definitely saying his good actions weren't good enough. That's literally my entire point.

...oh my god. are you trolling? am i being trolled?

this is what i said:

#+begin_quote
  your argument seems to be that his actions for the war weren't significant.
#+end_quote

this is what you responded:

#+begin_quote
  No, it's not. It's that he didn't redeem himself in the end. This has been my argument from the very beginning.
#+end_quote

so you're saying snape can still bully children, you just want more on screen heroics, right? his good actions were more consequential than his bad ones. what does he have to do to outweigh his bad actions then?

#+begin_quote
  sigh. Just because you raise someone like a pig for slaughter does not mean you treat them horribly as they're growing up.
#+end_quote

i'd say snape thinks raising a child to slaughter /is/ the horrible mistreatment in and of itself

#+begin_quote
  lol. very loose moral standards.
#+end_quote

like caring about the physical safety of people he thinks are innocent and being willing to sacrifice himself for them?
