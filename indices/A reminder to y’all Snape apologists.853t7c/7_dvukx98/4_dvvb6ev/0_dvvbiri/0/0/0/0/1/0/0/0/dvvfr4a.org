  you specify specific events like what he did at the end of the series and saving harry from the broom
#+end_quote

Yes, because my argument is that he did not do enough to redeem himself because he was still so shitty throughout the series.

#+begin_quote
  it is abuse, and it can. but where did it, in the text? do you want the children to have lasting psychological effects because of snape's mistreatment?
#+end_quote

Just because they didn't have lasting effects doesn't mean what Snape did wasn't horrible.

#+begin_quote
  i mean, the entire line about manipulative!dumbledore...was said by snape. he was horrified, and accuse dumbledore of raising harry as a pig for slaughter. strong fucking words
#+end_quote

You said he was appalled by how Dumbledore treated Harry. What exactly is so appalling about how Dumbledore treated Harry? Was Dumbledore supposed to say, "Hey, Harry, by the way, you've gotta die."

Dumbledore did what he could with Harry's situation. Snape was appalled because he believes everything he did for Lily was for nothing. He doesn't give a shit about Harry. He makes it clear in the very same scene when he says "/Him?/ Expecto Patronum!"
