  What exactly is so appalling about how Dumbledore treated Harry?
#+end_quote

i don't know, ask him. he said it, not me. he thinks he raised harry like a pig for slaughter, *his exact words*

#+begin_quote
  Yes, because my argument is that he did not do enough to redeem himself because he was still so shitty throughout the series.
#+end_quote

and i'm saying he did, and his good actions are more consequential than his mistreatment of students. you're switching between 'i didn't say his good actions weren't significant enough' and 'his good actions weren't significant enough'

snape was appalled because he thinks dumbledore is a freak who doth protest too much. he makes it clear he doesn't have personal like for harry, but also has...moral standards
