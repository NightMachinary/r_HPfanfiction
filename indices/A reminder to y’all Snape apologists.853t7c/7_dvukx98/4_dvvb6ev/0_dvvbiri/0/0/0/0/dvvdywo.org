  i mean, what significance does him being shitty have?
#+end_quote

Seriously? So as long as you're doing good stuff, you can also do a bunch of shitty things too and be all good? We're talking about redemption here. You don't get to do a bunch of bad shit, and then more bad shit with some good sprinkled in there and call yourself redeemed.

  him being mean to children doesn't have any lasting consequence on...anything
#+end_quote

He was a straight up horrible bully to children, worse than whatever James did to him. He made children cry. What lasting effects could there to bullying children? Is this a real question? Just because JK Rowling jumped right over psychological issues doesn't mean that what he did wasn't completely horrible.

  he agreed to murder dumbledore and then protected draco against voldemort to spare his soul
#+end_quote

Draco was never going to kill Dumbledore. Harry thought so, Dumbledore thought so, and Snape only did it because Dumbledore asked him to and because he made a vow.

#+begin_quote
  he's the one who told harry about the horcrux inside him
#+end_quote

This wasn't heroic or some great deed. He passed on information. Wow, so redeeming. Wow, he put a sword at the bottom of a pond because Dumbledore told him to. So worthy of redemption.

  tried to save lupin
#+end_quote

What? When? I remember him trying to give Lupin a fate worse than death, but certainly not trying to save him.

Listen, the only reason he even switched sides was because Voldemort was going to hunt Lily down. That's fucking it. Dumbledore even points out this, that Snape only cared for Lily and didn't give a shit for what happened to James and Harry.

Yes, he did good things. But he also did a lot of shitty things. He was willing to give two people a fate worse than death in PoA even when he /knew/ there was more to the story. JK Rowling herself has said that he's a /very/ sadistic person.

*TL;DR: He's a sack of shit that attempted to redeem himself but ultimately let his bitterness and immaturity lead him to failure in that regard.*

  ..characters don't have to be good people to be liked. that much is rather obvious by the amount of snarry fics in existence. you want non-morality reasons why he's likable? he's a genius, he can fly, has a cool aesthetic, he's funny, he's smooth, etc. etc.
#+end_quote

Christ. You're still not getting it. This isn't about whether or not he's a likable character. It's about whether or not he's redeemed himself at the end, whether or not he's a good /person./
