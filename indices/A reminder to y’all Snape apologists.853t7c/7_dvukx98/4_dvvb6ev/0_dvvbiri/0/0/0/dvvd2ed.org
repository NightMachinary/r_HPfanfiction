  None of the rest are significant enough to outweigh all the shitty things he does.

i mean, what significance does him being shitty have? him being mean to children doesn't have any lasting consequence on...anything. he's even forgiven by the child he was primarily mean to. hermione doesn't even hate him for the act above

he agreed to murder dumbledore and then protected draco against voldemort to spare his soul, and let the wizarding world hate him for a crime he didn't commit. that's...extremely significant. he's the one who told harry about the horcrux inside him, gave him the sword, protected the kids at hogwarts where he could, saved dumbledore, tried to save lupin. he himself says he's saved people when it was possible

  And when we're talking about liking him, we're not talking about liking him as a complex character.

...characters don't have to be good people to be liked. that much is rather obvious by the amount of snarry fics in existence. you want non-morality reasons why he's likable? he's a genius, he can fly, has a cool aesthetic, he's funny, he's smooth, etc. etc.
