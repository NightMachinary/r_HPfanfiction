I love Snape and to me he's easily my favourite character...that said I won't pretend he wasn't an utter bastard. Ironically, Snape apologists actually end up hurting the character by trying to make him seem so saintly when it's the fact that he's a deeply flawed individual that makes him so appealing at least to me.
