[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]] is my favorite currently updating regularly fic. Plus there's a bunch of excellent spin offs and side fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The-Pureblood-Pretense]] series is good too. The latest one is book 4.

Both of these may or may not fit your definition of updating semi regularly though. It's typically a couple months between updates(though if you include the spin offs and side fics, the first one usually has a couple updates a month).
