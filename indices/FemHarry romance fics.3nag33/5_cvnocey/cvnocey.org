linkffn(9486886) I can't belive Moratorium isn't allready mentioned-.. scratch that I know why it hasn't been mentioned. It has some really big flaws, Mary Sues, Self Incert'ish and very weird paceing. But on the other hand its ending is really nice, and not like School Days nice but actually nice, and a pre-avatar Night Shamalama twist. So if you want a 225K complete story that ends itself without leaving anything major hanging, to this one, though I will admit I couldn't read more than a chaptor at a time.
