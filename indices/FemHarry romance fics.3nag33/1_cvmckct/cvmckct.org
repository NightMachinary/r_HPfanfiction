I'm a pretty big fan of [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2221413/Tsume-Yuki][Tsume Yuki's]] fics, several of which have fem!Harry paired off with a guy, though often times the guy is non-canon, as she writes a lot of crossovers. I particularly like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10873705/1/This-Dream-s-On-Me][This Dream's On Me]], though it hasn't updated in half a year, but she's still active, so there's hope. Another good couple of authors of fem!Harry are [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1318815/The-Carnivorous-Muffin][The Carnivorous Muffin]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1485356/wordhammer][wordhammer]], but you've probably read those if you like the genre.

Another good fem!Harry Hobbit cross is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate Be Changed]] and a good non-cross is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10942056/1/crawlersout][crawlersout]] (I'm not typically one to read genderbent fics, excepting Ranma 1/2 ones, but still like these anyway, so it's primarily because I find them exceptional enough to overcome my lack of interest in the genre).

EDIT: Can't believe I almost left out [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1/Black-Sky][Black Sky]]. Seriously, this is probably my favorite of all of the ones I listed. So much intricate yet perfectly fitting plot with well-developed characters on top of it.
