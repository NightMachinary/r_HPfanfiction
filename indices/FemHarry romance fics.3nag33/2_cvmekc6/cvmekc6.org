[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9081608/1/Fire-Born][Fire Born]] has a rather awesome depiction of Tom Riddle. The way it developed the relationship between Tom and Fem!Harry was very interesting mainly because it featured a Tom Riddle who's still a psychopath. I really wish there was more to this story because it was really intriguing while I was reading it.
