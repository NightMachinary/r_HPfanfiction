From the very early days of Star Trek fanfic, when it was circulated in (badly) mimeographed fanzines. Kirk-slash-Spock stories, shortened to "slash" stories. Sufficiently popular (by the standards of the time, most zines had a /tiny/ circulation) that there sarcastic remarks about the matter in the novelisation of Star Trek The Motion Picture. Eventually became genericised to all same-sex romance and/or smut fanfiction.
