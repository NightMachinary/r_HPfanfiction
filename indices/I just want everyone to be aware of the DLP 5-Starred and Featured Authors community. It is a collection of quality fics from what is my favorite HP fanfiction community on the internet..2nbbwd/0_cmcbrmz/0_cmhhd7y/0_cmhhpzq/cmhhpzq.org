I like the forum, but I still realize there are quite a few problems with it. They are a strong echo-chamber of various ideas, and so help you if you go against them. They are also fairly vitriolic in their disagreements. Additionally they have a heavy emphasis on darker aspects of FF, lighter fluffy ones are much rarer. Possibly due to there being less good ones, or the aforementioned biases.

So while they can be a good gauge of quality, I take anything said there with a heavy pinch of salt.
