Eh, that's just DLP. 99% of the time it's not even said seriously. I've been a member since '08, lurked for a few years before that every once in a while.

Also, I would definitely say that while part of the reputation might have been earned (and a larger part came from butthurt writers), most of the members have grown up. DLP isn't nearly the same DLP that it was when it started and it isn't the same DLP that I joined in 2008. People are whole lot more mellow now than they used to be.
