Can you tell me what part of the fourm is annoying? I want to preface our conversation with I am not trying to start an argument(just in case you had a really bad time there). I see that a lot on fanfiction.net as well and I am wondering what has happened to make a lot of people bitter. I have been there and it just seems like a normal message board to me. Apart from the high amount of quality fiction.
