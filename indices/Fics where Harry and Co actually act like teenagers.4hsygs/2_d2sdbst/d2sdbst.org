I've often thought about writing more realistic teenagers in my stories, but I just hate teenagers so much. I get so annoyed by my own writing of them in the editing process, I just restart.

It's much easier to make a slightly more aware teenager that does stupid things from time to time, than a realistic one. Let's be honest. If I were to make a teenager story, it would be awkward, self-centered, and incredibly whiny. Not trying to be a dick here, but when I was a teenager, I didn't know what I was feeling, let alone pay enough attention to look how anyone else was feeling.
