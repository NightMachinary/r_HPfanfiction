Yeah but not all teenagers are like that. There's shades of grey just like how not all adults are boring/mature/intelligent/mean-spirited.

You can write teenagers realistically and still have a good story. You just need to ensure that the main character is still someone the reader wants to see succeed. They should still be able to understand his decisions and empathize with him.

I don't know about you, but when I was a teenager I didn't just do illogical things for no apparent reasons. I did things, sometimes the wrong thing, but I had reasons which made perfect sense with the information I had at the time.

The biggest thing that differentiates teen me and me now is the information and experience I have now.
