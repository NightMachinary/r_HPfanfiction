I just think if we are all honest, teenage drama and inward nature wouldn't be the most interesting story. I'm not trying to say all teenagers are the same or irrational. Obviously there is grey in everything. True teenage writing in my opinion, creates an extremely unreliable narrator. In the hands of a great writer, that's fine. However, in the hands of most fan fictions writers, including myself, it creates a messy story that doesn't make much sense.
