This would be nice. Almost all the fics I read, every Hogwarts student, at age 11, understands how emotions work, can read into minute detail the inner thoughts of their fellow students based on how they diverted their eyes one time, are fully versed in how adult politics work, and have a complete knowledge of magical history for the past 1000 years, including how dark magic isn't actually dark.

Edit: Except Ron of course.
