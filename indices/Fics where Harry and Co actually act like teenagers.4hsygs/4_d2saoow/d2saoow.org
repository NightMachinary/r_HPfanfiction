I can't say that linkffn(harry potter and the final straw) actually has them acting like teenagers, but I always liked this little acknowledgement speech by an adult OC (a teacher):

""So what do you suggest then Albus? If the kid has the goods on you the way you say he does, I don't see how there's anything you can do. He can always just refuse to cooperate when the time comes, and you can't afford that. Plus, and correct me if I'm wrong.....what has he done that's so wrong? He got his freedom from relatives who hated him, is that bad? Snape was fired, after he attacked him, how was that Harry's fault? He wants total control of his Defense group, a group he never should have had to start in the first place, but did so on his own initiative, with very positive results. What has he done that's so wrong? If the kid was plotting to become the next Dark Lord I could see what all this fuss is about, but all I see is a young man who is quite justifiably paranoid...a paranoia that you have fostered Albus. Add to that his behaving like....I don't know....a teenager? Who would have thought that could happen?""
