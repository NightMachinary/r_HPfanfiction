  divination is viewed as a useless class
#+end_quote

In Britain and only by people who know the current professor. One could assume that because of Trelawney, not because of the general uselessness of the magic, Divination got the bad name it has in Hogwarts. And Trelawney /was/ right several times, she just didn't interpret the signs in the right way, being so stuck on her death predictions, telling us that there is some truth in the subject (next to the prophecies). A competent Divination professor may have turned the subject around for good (and Harry's life, for that matter).
