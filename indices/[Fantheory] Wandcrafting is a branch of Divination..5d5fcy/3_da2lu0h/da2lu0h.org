  That is, unless when both wands were crafted they were created specifically for Harry and Voldemort.

If this was the case, why didn't Ollivander have Harry try that wand first? If he knew the wand was special, why have Harry test a bunch of different wands? Between whispers of Voldemort's return and Harry coming of age, it would seem fairly obvious to have Harry test the wand immediately if divination was involved. In this case, I think it suggests that it's not the wandmaker who divined the pair of wands, but actually /Fawkes/. It could also have been Dumbledore, but I doubt it given how he treats Riddle. That is, assuming there was divination involved at all in this particular case.
