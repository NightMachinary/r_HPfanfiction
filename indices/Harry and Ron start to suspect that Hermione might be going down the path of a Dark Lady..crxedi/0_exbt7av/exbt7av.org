There's a DarkGryffindor!Hermione plot bunny that I've had for a long, long time. Here's some prose show the divergence.

â€‹

The news came the morning of the leaving feast. They weren't supposed to. After all, the year's mystery had been solved, the battle fought and won, victims rescued or healed; and, for bonus points, exams cancelled, a slave freed, a fraud unmasked, and an innocent exonerated after five decades.

But not soon enough.

The details had been sketchy, the accounts contradictory. A rogue Dementor---that's what they called the monsters that guarded Azkaban, apparently---had eaten his soul, some said. An old man suffering a heart failure in prison, said others. Ultimately, the exact mechanism did not matter.

Harry spent the rest of the day in a daze. Hermione just said "If I hadn't been petrified..." and fell silent. Ron was just there.

The funeral was two days later, Hogwarts Express to London postponed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrived at the wake together, but quickly found themselves separated.

Harry could see Hermione speaking with Dumbledore, looking increasingly frustrated. Ron was with his family.

And Harry, Harry found himself face to face with perhaps the only man he now hated more than Voldemort.

"Terrible business, all this... I heard you were close. Dreadfully sorry for your loss, Mister Potter."

Harry sputtered, surprised by the apology. "But you killed him!"

"Mister Potter, that's a very serious accusation!" A short, squat woman dressed in pink with a perfunctory black funeral veil interrupted with a cough. "Mister Hagrid was over sixty, and a half-giant. Giants have short life expectancy, you know, so it stands to reason that it may have simply been his time."

"You put him in Azkaban!"

"A perfectly reasonable precaution, given the evidence available to us. We did everything right."

"Now, now, Dolores, let's not be hard-hearted. We did everything right, but every death is a tragedy. I really am terribly sorry for your loss." Cornelius Fudge turned to move away.

"Mister Potter, please accept my deepest condolences!" The newcomer was blond witch who had fluttered over. "Perhaps we can speak later about your memories of the deceased."

"Minister Fudge," she continued without missing a beat, "Some have called for your resignation in light of this incident. What is your answer to them?"

Fudge puffed himself up. "Well, Rita, if someone wants to accuse me of excessive zealotry in protecting their children from harm, then I plead guilty as charged and throw myself to the mercy of the court of public opinion at the next election."

"Surely it doesn't make sense to dissolve the government over an understandable accident? The only one who was hurt was a Hogwarts dropout known for handling dangerous creatures around children," the witch in pink added.

Harry's wand was half way raised to point at the officious duo, when he felt Hermione's hand on his shoulder. That gave him enough pause to notice a man in a crimson robe looking him in the eye, hand in his robe as well. Of course the Minister for Magic would have a bodyguard.

Hermione herself looked livid, but did somehow manage to speak in a level voice, "Dumbledore says there's little he can do. Fudge has to resign or be voted out, unless he decides to prosecute himself."

The topic was the talk of the Opinion page of the /Daily Prophet/ for the next month. Hermione had her say (edited for length). There were rebuttals. Even Dumbledore weighed in, with a call for institutional reforms to provide more judicial review for detentions and better conditions for prisoners, but stopped short of calling for Fudge's resignation or endorsing an opponent.

And then, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, and Hagrid was old news.

***

"The Ministry murdered him, and nobody cares, because he was a penniless dropout half-giant," Hermione summed up the outcome on Hogwarts Express. "My parents and I came home from France to find three dozen wizard letters. And the first one we opened turned out to be a Howler. And the Ministry refused to believe me when I told them so, and gave me an infraction for underage magic."

"Welcome to the club," grumbled Harry.

"Professor Flitwick had to come in to place a Charm on our house to redirect letters to Hogwarts! And then, we had to sprint through Diagon Alley the way some wizards were looking at us."

She grasped his and Ron's shoulders. "But I've understood something... It's not about Fudge, or Umbridge. Not even the whole ministry. Dumbledore was right: it's the institutions that need to be changed. But the public doesn't care. /They/ don't think what happened to Hagrid could ever happen to a /proper/ wizard. Until someone disabuses them of this notion, nothing will change."
