A bit late of a reply, but I don't think I have the time or the talent to write this fic well. The way I /would/ write it would probably hit the following plot points during the Hogwarts years:

- Hermione would have a growing sense (that is only somewhat accurate) that the past 50 years of progress in the wizarding society had occurred because its proponents had an uberwizard (Dumbledore) on their side and its opponents did not. Furthermore, she would conclude that Dumbledore has moved things as far as he is willing, and also, that once he dies from old age, things could easily backslide. (Her research might even uncover Dumbledore's history with Grendelwald.)

  - Some events will take place that would reinforce this belief. For example, after Sirius escapes, Fudge would authorise Dementors on Hogwarts Express without telling Dumbledore. After what happened to Hagrid, Dumbledore would refuse to let them near Hogwarts, however. The /Daily Prophet/ would be neutral, but then Sirius would break in, at which point Fudge would be seen as vindicated, and public opinion would turn against Dumbledore when Dumbledore persists in refusing to let Dementors near.

- Hermione would therefore set out to become her generation's uberwitch---or at least match the destructive ability of the uberwizards of the XX century---by any means necessary. That is, she becomes what Dumbledore might have become had he not fallen out with Grindelwald.
- Meanwhile, things actually go pretty well for Harry. In particular, when he learns the truth about Sirius, Fudge does still feel genuinely guilty about Hagrid, and so ultimately decides that he can spin the whole thing in his favour, get some photo-ops with BWL, and maybe some value out of Sirius, so he chooses to believe him.

  - Hermione, the Debbie Downer, might point out that someone not as rich or as well-connected as Sirius would not have received as much consideration---but Harry is understandably happy to have his godfather back. Sirius is happy to go along.
  - Hagrid's death would derail the Buckbeak plot thread, but some alternative subplot could be conceived, in which Hermione spends weeks putting together a legal case to no avail, and then Harry asks Fudge for a favour at the right time, and the situation is resolved in no time flat. For Harry, all is well. For Hermione, it's a matter of who you know.
  - More generally, Voldemort's return is delayed by a few years relative to canon, so Harry's adventures from Year 4 on are cancelled.

- Harry and Ron would notice that Hermione answers much fewer questions in class and asks many more, often with a destructive bent, and they get some indications that she is applying the knowledge.

  - For example, she asks McGonagall (acting scared of the prospect) whether it's possible to conjure poison gasses and such. McGonagall says that in principle, yes, but to master a substance you must understand it on a visceral level---so if you want to conjure poisonous gas, you basically need to breathe enough of it to be poisoned. McGonagall moves on.
  - After the Christmas break of that year, Harry and Ron notice that Hermione has burn scars on her hands and arms. She laughs it off as her forgetting how dangerous electricity could be from all the time she spends studying magic, and then goes to Pomfrey to get them healed.
  - But a few years later, they witness her electrocuting an opponent by shooting lightning from her fingers, and they realise that she had gotten those burn scars by electrocuting herself until her accidental magic gave her some control over electricity, which she developed since in order to have an ace in the hole technique that only a muggleborn with iron will, willing to suffer for power from a young age could develop.

- More generally, Harry and Ron find that Hermione has become much less averse to danger, challenging herself at every opportunity.

  - They are surprised when Hermione manages to get herself into the TWT.

- Hermione would like Harry and Ron to join her revolution, but she fails to convince them how broken the world is (partly because she is overstating the case, partly because things are going pretty well for them, and partly because she isn't actually that good at convincing people); as she begins to get the sense of what the price of power might be for her, she doesn't want them to get hurt; and as she sinks deeper, she begins to view them as security risks: both Harry and Ron have too many people watching over them.
- Dumbledore still dies hunting horcruxes. Before he dies, he passes what he knows on to Harry and Hermione. Harry, because he is still destined to fight Voldemort if Voldemort so chooses, and he still doesn't have a way to remove the horcrux; Hermione, because she is the closest thing he has to a successor, and she hasn't actually done anything Dark that he knows of.
- They graduate from Hogwarts a year later. Cornelius Fudge is still Minister for Magic, Dolores Umbridge is still Senior Undersecretary, Harry's on a pro quiddich team, and Ron is working at his brothers' joke shop. Hermione, she is somewhere between Bellatrix and Voldemort in combat ability---making her the single most powerful living combatant in Britain, but far from unbeatable by 2-3 elite aurors or 3-5 ordinary aurors---has a reputation as a prodigy but also as a troublemaker (with Fudge and Umbridge having some personal animus towards her), maybe half-dozen fellow Muggleborns she'd managed to persuade to her cause, and no idea what to do with what power she has to advance her political cause.
- And then, Voldemort finally manages to get himself a body. (Though, it may well have been the case that he had resurrected himself a long time prior and has been gathering his forces, but he hadn't used Harry's blood, so he had to wait until Harry was an adult and the sacrificial protection had expired.)
