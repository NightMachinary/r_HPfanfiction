Awesome! Thanks for the write-up, it sounds really interesting! I definitely understand feeling like you can't do an idea justice, but do keep in mind the only way to get better is practice (assuming you have an interest in ever getting better :P). I often see ideas like this that I would love to read, but personally I have no skill or interest (or honestly, time! Kids are huge time sinks) in writing them myself.

Being late about the reply just made me get to go back and enjoy it all again, so no worries there :)
