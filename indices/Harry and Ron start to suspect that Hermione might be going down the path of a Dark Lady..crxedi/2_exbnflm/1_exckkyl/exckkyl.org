It's because "lady" makes no sense - a "lord" directly implies having power over someone or something (the Latin word for lord is "dominus", incidentally) whereas "lady" simply implies 'high class and female'.

A dark lady sounds like just some shady chick. "Dark mistress" might be more accurate, but implies BDSM or something.
