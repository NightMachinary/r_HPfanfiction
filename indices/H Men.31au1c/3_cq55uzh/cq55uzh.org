Not /quite/ X-men, but from what I remember a few weave in and out of the story - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Invincible-TechnoMage][Harry Potter and the Invincible Technomage]] has Harry raised by Comic!Tony Stark (as opposed to MCU Tony). Even if it's not what you were hoping for its worth a read. It's quite old and unfinished, but I think it still gets updated.
