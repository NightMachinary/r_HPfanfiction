I forget the name, but there's one fic which is written from Hermione's perspective as like a history book excerpt. Where it's heavily AU, they train both Harry and Neville from early childhood to fight the war, but Neville ends up dying due to some experimentation they did on them. After winning the war Harry studies quantum mechanics and figures out how reproduce magic with technology and gives said tech to muggles, which leads to the wizarding world becoming unnecessary.
