Also came here to rec this! Here's a review that I wrote for [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/nilzxk/ten_time_travel_titles_to_try/][this post]] last week:

Lavender/Tom is probably the oddest pairing I have ever read, but it somehow really works here. Lavender time travels to the 1940s and begins working as a Seer to make ends meet, which is how she meets Tom and ends up investigating a mysterious murder. Lavender is really fascinating in this story; she's a pragmatic adult who survived a traumatizing war, but she retains her femininity, her brash confidence, and her... selfishness? Selfishness in the sense that she looks out for herself and her own and doesn't go out of her way to be righteous. Tom is very amoral and ambitious, but he respects Lavender and what she can do. I feel like they both have equal power in the relationship, which you wouldn't expect. "Unfogging the Future" has great reread value with the mystery solved, because you'll be able spot clues you missed and focus more on the varied Divination techniques and occult references.
