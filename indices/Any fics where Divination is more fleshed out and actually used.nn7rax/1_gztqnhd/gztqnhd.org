I've got the best fic for you. It's actually so brilliant and I can't express my love enough for it, it's fits this prompt so well. linkao3(unfogging the future by Naidhe) has Divination as an actual useful skill that the main character, Lavendar, has. She gets transported to 1947 and gets a job in a fortune tellers shop. She gets taught Divination methods, for example, the witch often does get drunk or use the â€˜special fumes' because it opens up your mind to different currents and possibilities , which kind of explains why Trelawney was drunk.
