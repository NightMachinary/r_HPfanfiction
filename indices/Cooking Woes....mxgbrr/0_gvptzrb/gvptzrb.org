Parvati being immune to her own spices I can buy. Hestia and flora having to fight their food before serving is hilarious. Gabrielle cheerfully getting Harry drunk of his ass is genius.

On the other hand, Ginny, Hermione, Daphne and Cho remind me too much of lame anime plots. If their cooking is just bad, they should realize they are poisoning everyone the moment they try their own food.
