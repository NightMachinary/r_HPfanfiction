linkffn(10610076): Time to Put your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is. It's basically a Master of Death Harry Potter is reborn as the older brother of Sirius and Regulus Black.

linkffn(12200475) Potters Against the World. Be warned this story contains incest, but the incest is handled really well at least in my opinion. Harry is banished from the magical world and his younger twin sister with the help of Gabrielle Delacor finds her brother, gives him his memories back and they time travel to the triwizard tournament to stop Voldemort. the incest is pretty well done, it's not shown as some triumphant beautiful thing like most incest is, or it's not ignored and treated like a normal romance either. Harry and Rose admit that they are fucked up and broken people throughout the story and it does have consequences within their friend groups and family.
