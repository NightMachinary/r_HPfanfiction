Linkffn(Three Black Birds)

Harry is Born in Fred and George's age group and is the older brother of the boy who lived. Its a pretty good and decent look at neglect and how it affects a family. James and Lilly didn't abandon Harry for their WBWL brother on purpose they are just a young couple caught up in everything and when they are finally told that they've fucked up they work their hardest to fix the problem.

Harry is also a decent older brother in this even if his brother doesn't deserve it
