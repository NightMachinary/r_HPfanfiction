I don't really understand why people use the fic space to reply when they can just reply to the person who wrote the review (unless they are a guest... and then you can reply by making a comment on the chapter). I guess they want everyone to see the reply?

I did read one fic that did review replies at the end of chapters that I actually enjoyed... because she did it well... it was a bit of a dialog with the readers that offered a bit more insight into the characters and gave hints of what was to come. Most of the time, I just skip them.
