It is story dependent, but from what you've given, it looks as though /this/ story is best served by having him die, and there's another story you've yet to write, with a different beginning and middle, in which he survives the shrieking shack, where the whole story is written to support that.

I mean, you can actually, in the second story, just jump to his surviving and go from there, filling in as you need to.
