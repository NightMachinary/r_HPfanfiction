You could have it so that Snape survives Voldemort in the shack, but still dies in the Hogwarts battle, either by sacrificing himself or being got by a cheap shot once the battle is over by a defeated DE, so you can still have him and the Slytherin's fighting but still have an impactful and sad death.
