You would need a lot of core muscle for flying uside down, sideways, doing rolls and other acrobatic manoeuvres. That is even more true for chasers and keepers. I don't think they build that much muscle from the actual training, but like ice hockey, they need to build it to be able to go through the challenges the matches involve. So it's more preparation than anything else.
