Avoiding bludgers, and other players while trying to see, catch up to and catch a tiny golden ball? Keep in mind that Harry does this every training session and match, so at least twice a week, and to avoid the bludgers alone he would be doing /loads/ of stunts like sloth grip rolls. All that work would probably even make one of my friends fit, which, no offence to him, is a lot of work.
