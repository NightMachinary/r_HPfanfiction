It would build a certain amount of wiry strength, like yoga but without the stretching. I usually have him with a built-in need to be active; when stressed he walks of jogs around the lake to think, paces back and forth, etc. Sometimes I have him with a subconscious need to be outdoors because of the years he spent locked in a cupboard. Either way I think h'e best served with a wiry but nearly fatless build like a triathlete with comparable endurance. Endurance, speed, and skill are what he requires most, so I don't really see the need to give him some muscular build. Unless you're writing smut for bodybuilders, I guess. I mean, it's your story, give him whatever you wanna give him. My $o.o2.
