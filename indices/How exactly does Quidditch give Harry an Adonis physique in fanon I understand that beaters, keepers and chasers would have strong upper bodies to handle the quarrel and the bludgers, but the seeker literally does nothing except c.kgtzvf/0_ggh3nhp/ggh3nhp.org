I would assume it is the same as race car drivers. I mean, have you seen the Formula 1 drivers? They look like olympic swimmers with the neck muscles of weightlifters. They also only sit in their car and do nothing. But if a normal person that has not done it before and has not built the required muscles over time would experience those insane forces during a race, they would come out with a handful of broken bones, assuming with their lack of muscles they could even make it through the track fast enough to generate those forces, which is doubtful.

Not saying playing quidditch would give him a body like that, but to play quidditch on a high level it might be required to train into it. At least that was always my thinking when I read a fic where something like you mentioned comes up.
