If I had to guess, all those sloth-rolls(?) where he'd spin on the broom to avoid bludgers, the quick turns, and the need to hold the broom tight on those wronski feints, must have worked his core and forearms a lot.

Add in Wood being a fanatic who made everyone do calisthenics and drills whenever he could book the field and it could be possible.
