Later after one Wizengamot session that would stay in history as the "Night of the Red Spells", Dumbledore sat in his new office, after Fudge and many members of his cabinet were arrested for corruption due Lucius Malfoy being the first to be interrogated, and he had /much/ to tell. Bringing to even more arrests, the Aurors had a at least a dozen more arrest warrants to complete.

With him were Amelia Bones, Augusta Longbottom, Head Auror Scrimgeour, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Cyrus Greengrass the new Chief Warlock, a compromise to keep some of the more recalcitrant Moderates happy.

Dumbledore first turned to Cyrus, "I can't thank you enough for what you did tonight, , however, I can't help but think it was all planned."

Cyrus smiled lightly, "Why Minister, we had contingency plans, most of them were to just hide or leave the country with our families, but when I saw you enter into that Chamber in a flash of Phoenix fire and heard the way you spoke, I knew you finally had the will to do what was needed, and I love my homeland, my daughters grew up here, and I wouldn't want to leave and see it turned in some dictatorship for that madman."

Dumbledore nodded, "Good, with your support things will be much easier, I must say I never wanted this,"he gestured at the office,"but I see no other option."

After murmurs and nods of agreement, he turned to Amelia.

"I am increasing the DMLE's funds, and authorizing a substantial increase in your numbers, however, as I am sure you know, we must be cautious in who we trust."

Amelia nodded tightly, "I know that Albus, that's why we are adding a new screening process, it's more invasive, but it will leave us more secure that we aren't being infiltrated."

"What about those that are already in?" Augusta Longbottom asked.

"Those are being dealt with as we speak, we are reviewing all our Aurors and workers too, thanks to some...information we received." she glanced momentarily to the side.

It was an unspoken agreement that such valuable information would be useless with Fudge in command and would only backfire on those that offered it.

"I am glad we managed to do what we needed today, I must momentarily return to Hogwarts and inform them of this...new situation, I will be back shortly so we can plan our next steps and capitalize on the confusion caused by today's developments."

As everyone rose and said their farewells, one stayed behind.

"Lord Greengrass, is there something I can help you?"

"Call me Cyrus, I think we will be working together a lot in the future."

"Call me Albus, then."

"Very Wel,l then, Albus, I now come to you as a concerned father." he pulled two sealed envelopes from his robes, and then a sealed scroll.

"My daughters, Daphne and Astoria, after what happened today, I feel they won't be safe in Slytherin House, and I ask you to remove them, at least from the Dungeons."

"I take it you have information to corroborate that."

Cyrus nodded gravely and gave Dumbledore the scroll, he opened and saw a list of names, student names from Slytherin, and some from Ravenclaw, it got from fourth year upwards."

"These are students who we believe are willing to.../act/ in the name of their parent's master and do terrible things, if ordered, some may lack the spine, but others are, well, I am not going to sugarcoat it for you, others are already criminals."

Dumbledore almost crushed the paper, corrupting children for this...to what levels of...

He nodded gravely, "I will act upon this, we have ways to check, and I will also be certain that your daughters are safe, I already have a way to do it."

He had never seen Cyrus Greengrass with such naked emotion on his face, relief. For him to be so worried, there must have been good reasons for it.

"Thank you, thank you! If you need anything else, you have but to ask, most of my party is behind me in this, and the others dislike the other side more than they dislike you. "he gave then the envelopes, one for each daughter, "If you can deliver this to them, they'll know what it means."

Dumbledore nodded again, and took the envelopes, after some words, he called for Fawkes, who, since this whole thing started, seemed more energized than ever, and in a flash of fire, he was back to Hogwarts.

He needed to talk to Harry, things were going to change a lot for the boy, no, the young man, he needed to be prepared, Dumbledore's attempt at giving him a regular and happy childhood had failed, but maybe in being treated as an adult, Harry would find his center.

He would call for Sirius and Remus, and finish recalling the Order, they needed to activate the safehouses, created new ones, Hogwarts could be the Headquarters, or even Sirius's old family home.

He looked at the two letters he was carrying...perhaps he could also give Harry some companionship to teach him about his place in Wizarding Society, and ingratiate him to the other Party, he would need all the help he could get on the days to come.

He smiled to himself, now he was acting as the Master Manipulator everyone thought him to be.

It was oddly freeing.

PS: just to clarify, I think when people saw that, yes, Voldemort was back, those in the know wouldn't want to be led by Fudge, nor have to abandon their things and move to Hogwarts while Voldemort rode roughshod with the rest of the country, also because many wouldn't want to leave positions of power. And between Albus Dumbledore and the crazy lunatic who was known for torturing his own followers, I think they would take the former.
