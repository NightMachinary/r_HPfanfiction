The Chamber of the Wizengamot was silent, shocked by the revelations presented, and by the actions that Albus Dumbledore was about to take. The Lords and Ladies were looking at each other in worry, until one rose, the leader of the middle faction, the Moderates, fence-sitters as they were called sometimes derisively.

"So let me get this straight Dumbledore, you show us undeniable proof that that man is back through the most horrible of magics," he points at the stunned Barty Crouch Junior, Fudge tried to protest with claims the man's mind had been manipulated, but was cowed by a myriad of glares "that he still has followers and the war is about to start again."

Dumbledore nodded gravely, "I am afraid so, Lord Greengrass."

"And now you would abandon Britain, to retreat to one of the most protected places in the island and fight him from there, while you let us here, to fend for ourselves, and being led by this..." he pointed at Fudge, who was looking redder by the minute," bumbling, incompetent fool who was about to deny everything and let that monster act unopposed?"

Fudge was about to protest, "Silence! Fool! Traitor! You were about to condemn us all!"

There were several murmurs of agreement, and the one speaking looked around receiving several nods.

"I find this unacceptable, I propose a vote of no confidence to Cornelius Fudge, he was about to betray us all to Voldemort, and is clearly compromised and incompetent to lead us in a war."

Far more quickly than expected, Fudge saw his government crumble with an almost unanimous vote.

"I now propose we elect someone who can lead us in these dark times, someone who I see now finally has found the courage to act and do what is necessary, I nominate Albus Dumbledore."

Stunned silence, the Moderates had always been vocal against Dumbledore's leniency and soft politics, always more aligned with the Traditionalist faction, the look on Lucius Malfoy's face was of utter surprise, and even fear, he started looking for the exits, but they were all blocked, and he saw people closing in on him, while many of his associates came closer to whisper that he should nominate himself, fools.

"I second that motion." Augusta Longbottom rose quickly, "Let's vote right now."

Albus Dumbledore was shocked by this development, he expected to spark debate and maybe put Fudge in hot water, but that the Moderates were more aware than he thought and believed he would be the safest option was surprising, he was expecting that after they saw how bad the situation was, they would join the Progressists in Hogwarts.

Dumbledore saw in this an opportunity, to save those who wouldn't be able to reach Hogwarts, and preserve more of the infrastructure of the government.

"I accept."

It was one of the fastest elections ever, other nominations were practically ignored, for the first time in decades, the Progessist and Moderate parties voted unanimously on a single candidate.

Once Dumbledore was nominated Minister, he received a significant look from Lord Greengrass, he signed heavily, he never wanted this, but he must think of the children. He nodded back, and Lord Greengrass rose again, Dumbledore's trained eyes noticed movement around the chamber.

"Congratulations Minister, I know you will be able to lead us in this fight, but first allow me to help us have a good start by /cleaning house/."

As soon as he began saying those words, there was a blur of movement, and dozens of red flashes were seen around the chamber, Lords and some Ladies started falling unconscious and their sleeves were pulled back. Dumbledore noticed that some of his own people were helping and that some of the Moderates were targeted.

"Death Eater!" the cry came from Amos Diggory who was holding Lucius Malfoy's arm with a strong grip, his face a picture of utter rage.

The cry repeated itself over and over in the chamber, and the stunned members started being brought down to the Aurors, who were looking shocked, Amelia Bones, however, had a most severe expression.

Dumbledore looked sadly at those being brought, he knew some of these as children, he had taught some of them on how to hold a wand, how utterly he had failed to prevent them from being tempted by darkness, but now he had to fix his mistakes, and think of those that were still children.
