Voldemort's main theme is that he could have ruled the whole world but instead he focused almost everything on the prophecy and in the end lost to it due to his own obsession with immortality. Him fucking up due to stupidity/the manifestation of primal fear is just as much a core element of his as being able to slaughter his way through a group of wizards.

And the very nature of Horcruxes, as well as the spells we see in canon, make them basically worthless unless you make yours a random pebble and lob it into the ocean. And that is also something which would go against Voldemort's core personality since he insisted on founder artifacts whenever possible.
