Unless going alone was the smartest move and those are the stupid things and would have gone worse.

You're talking about changing what happens to portray Dumbledore as more competent while saying that Voldemort couldn't be more competent because canon is canon.

If you can say that Dumbledore brings a squad with him to get the ring and succeeds without getting cursed because that's the better way to go about it, you can also say that Voldemort's defences are powerful such that all of them die trying and alerts Voldemort to the attempt.
