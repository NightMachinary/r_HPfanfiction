  The thing is, Dumbledore is alive for the first four books, Voldemort is a fancy ghost and has been for a decade at that point. Which means that Dumbledore can act without being countered.

Again you're suggesting changing canon for Dumbledore but acting like it's impossible to do the same for Voldemort. Voldemort could have plans in place that have him revived the day after his body was destroyed.

Just because Voldemort doesn't have a body doesn't mean that Dumbledore is guaranteed to be able to counter everything that Voldemort has set up in advance.

  That's why you send in a bunch of death eaters as "penal battalion". And I'm willing to bet that there are more of them around than traps on the Horcruxes (especially since the ring is the only properly defended one).

And why must it work that way?

10 death eaters used as meat shields or mine sweepers does not need to mean that 10 traps/defenses are overcome. A Horcrux invulnerability can't be overcome by numbers. The DADA curse couldn't be overcome with numbers. The fidelious charm doesn't care about how many people you throw at it. Etc.

Maybe the penal battalion all dies and nothing is gained. Maybe Voldemort's defenses detects their dark marks and their intent and teleports them to a safe house, so all you've done is freed some death eaters. Maybe Dumbledore can't even find the Horcruxes because Voldemort hid them better.

Dumbledore can be written as competently as an author wants. But so can Voldemort.
