  A Horcrux invulnerability can't be overcome by numbers.

You know, if you insist on coming up with convoluted reasons, fine, just nuke the whole place with Fiendfyre. We know that it works against Horcruxes, and if anyone can control it, Dumbledore does. So rather than come up with anything remotely interesting, just burn everything you even suspect of being the hiding place for one. Plot resoved.

Well, that's still 10 less Death Eaters. So either they achieve something useful or they die, a win-win situation.
