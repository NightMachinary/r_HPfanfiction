Percy is a significant character in the later stories of the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/306153][Lion and Two Snakes series]] - but they'll make no sense without the first one, which is light on Percy.

And the second story has a lot of explicit slash. You can probably skip that one entirely, I think the third one would still make sense.
