If it's been a few months, then sure. If it's been a few hours, then no, they're just being rude and wasting time. Somewhere between those two points is where it becomes acceptable to ask again, and I'm not going to speculate where exactly that point is, because it's probably different for everyone.

And yes, reddit's search is horrible, but it's perfectly capable of handling this sort of thing. Most, if not all, of the common requests can be summarized in just one or two words that you can search for, like "healer," "dark Harry," the name of the ship you want or the characters in that ship, or the name of the other fandom you want to read a crossover with. That will probably give you plenty of posts to look at, and if you still want to ask, sort the results by new and make sure no one else has asked recently.
