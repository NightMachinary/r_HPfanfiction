To a certain extent, you're right. But some people really don't put in the tiniest bit of effort before posting. I've seen posts from people looking for a specific fic that I found by just googling some of the exact terms they used. And I've seen posts asking for recommendations that someone else already asked for (and got several responses for) mere days or even hours before. Those people deserve every downvote they get.
