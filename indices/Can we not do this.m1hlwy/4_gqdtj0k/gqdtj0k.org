Meaning, nobody wants to be your personal servant. Yes, we would like to help and we all share tips for good stories, but nobody is happy to do the simple work you can do. Like making one quick search on Google/AO3/FFnet. Show us some effort first, show us some ingenuity. Asking for the best completed stories of all times every other day, or the best WBWL story, best fem!Harry story, etc. shows that somebody didn't even bother to search through this subreddit. And we are inundated with these stupid questions, so people tend to get a bit edgy about them.
