Well I was trying to re-read some fics that I had initially read 10-15 years ago and no one responded probably because most people don't even remember them. If people don't want to respond to fic request posts about fics they know, they don't want to respond to fic request posts they don't know... then what's the purpose of this community? May as well shut down this sub.
