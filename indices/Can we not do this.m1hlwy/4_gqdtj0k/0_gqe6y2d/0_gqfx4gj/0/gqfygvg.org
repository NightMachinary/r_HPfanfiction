I would disagree that there's much labor involved. My case for example is that if I know something off of the top of my head I will respond because I can spare two seconds for that. If I don't, I don't.

However I do agree that there should be more discussion and I personally enjoy your detailed analysis of various aspects of the HP universe. But many times there are posts with prompts (some really stupid - I am guilty of some) or discussion threads that have no responses or maybe a one or two that don't really lead to any entertaining discussion.
