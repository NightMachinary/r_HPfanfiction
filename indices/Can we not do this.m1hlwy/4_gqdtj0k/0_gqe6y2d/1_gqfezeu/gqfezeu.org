Don't make overly general requests. Pull out from your memory all even irrelevant bits of information which could help to identify it. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m14p3m/looking_for_hermione_g_james_p_story_where/][Requests like this]] or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m1imwz/lf_fic_where_harry_meets_his_family_and_is/][many others]] are [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/m1i7ma/help_finding_two_fics/][definitely]] acceptable and there are plenty of them answered every day. (I don't care about any of these, and I am not saying that they are perfect, just that they are recent and nobody was attacked in comments). And yes, two out of three have no replies, but c'est la vie (and when the requests here are used as the last resort, it is probably something really difficult).
