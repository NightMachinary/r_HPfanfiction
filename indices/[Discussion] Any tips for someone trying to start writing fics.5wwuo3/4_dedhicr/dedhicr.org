No, it's not bad to use names lol.

Anyway, when you're writing your story, always ask yourself the following question:

*Would this make sense in the real world?*

Obviously, only apply this question in terms of human interactions, events occurring- since magic is not possible IRL.

Don't create drama /just for the sake of it/. And try your best to avoid doing the whole "main character doesn't explain himself/herself quick enough, making the romantic interest leave off in a huff" garbage- lots of people fall for this trap.
