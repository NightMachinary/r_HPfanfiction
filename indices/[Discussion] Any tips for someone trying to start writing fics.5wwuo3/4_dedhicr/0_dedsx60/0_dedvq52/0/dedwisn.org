I wouldn't say it was her strange views that ruined it. It was a myriad of small details that added up. Each of them harmless (class-size, evil slytherin, harry's abuse, dumbledore's behaviour) but taken together it made the world so inconsitent.

And there aren't that many stories that do magic better. Either they apply "Eragon-Style" energy-based magic, mana-pools ("magical cores") or other similar boring concepts. Rowlings Magic is delightfully unlogical, and I love it.

A few stories that do magic and magical culture better are linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh; Dodging Prison and stealing witches; Prince of slytherin) - but the majority is actually worse.

Most of the stories with an evil or manipulative Dumbledore are quite horrible. Additionally, it feels like with the FB movie JKR has learned - it's a lot more mature, and makes a lot of sense, just look at the villian. I mean Grindelwald has a point, while Voldemort hasn't.

Sure, elements of the series could have been improved, but HP is already great in my opinion.

Edit: Since the reply to this is deleted, I have to answer here: The /magic/ is unlogical and I'm fine with that. It's unrestricted, and doesn't follow very set parameters (compare: Eragon)
