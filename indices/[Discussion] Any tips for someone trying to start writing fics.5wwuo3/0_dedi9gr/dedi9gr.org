I think people will react negatively if you were to invent other friends for Lily instead of including the known canon characters. 'Who's this Wanda Fulbright girl? Why didn't you just use Marlene?'

A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end. Seems obvious, yet fanfiction is replete with stories with great concepts, wonderful characterization but that never go anywhere, much less arrive at their destination.

A good story is also about change; where things are at the end shouldn't be the same as the beginning. You have to make the call- how are the main characters going to be by the end of this? Does the plot actually take them along that path? This applies to all the main characters- protagonists, antagonists, obstacles and assistants and comedic distractions alike.
