If you've been writing for a while, then you'll probably know to do something similar to this already - treat your characters, and the way they behave, like /real/ people.

Too many fanfics have characters make contrived, confused or out-of-character decisions because the plot forces them too, and at the same time have problems with the realness of their dialogue. Work your conversations and interactions between characters into a place where you can easily visualise the conversation taking place in front of you. Read and re-read your dialogue (from the start of a scene to the finish) to see that it flows well, that the conversation occurs - particularly on an emotional and character expressiveness level - the way you want it to go.

It can be a bit of a time-sink at times, but the reward for being thorough makes your characters that much more /real./

Also, if you're worried about your actual writing in a grammar/spelling sense, I recommend finding a beta or a someone you know who'd like to read things through before you post them online, and also to bounce ideas off of. I can't overstate the importance of having a secondary perspective on your work when you need it.

Good luck!
