Plan it out. Pretty much every writer I've ever encountered plans differently, so the specifics of that are up in the air. But before you get into it you should know exactly what it's about, who's in it, why they're in it, what plot points happen when and why, and how long it's going to be.

The last one is the one most often overlooked. Most people, when they start writing fiction. Have no idea how long a 60,000 word novel is. Have no idea how long a 120,000 word novel is. And have no idea just how long 200,000 words is. ((Hint, it's about 400 pages, single spaced, of prose writing in a document or approximately the length of Deathly Hallows)).

As for cannon characters, just don't have them act exactly how they do in someone else's work and it doesn't really matter. Hell, they can even act similar just don't have them say 'exactly' the same thing.
