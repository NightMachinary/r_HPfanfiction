  ((Hint, it's about 400 pages, single spaced, of prose writing in a document or approximately the length of Deathly Hallows)).

Another hint: the exact number of words per page depends on the format of the book and stuff, and generally varies from 300 to 550 words per page. At least one version of Rowling's works has an average word per page count of about 330. This means that, if using her style, a 200.000-word-long story would be about 600 pages long.

PS. I know it's a nitpick, TE7, but “canon”.
