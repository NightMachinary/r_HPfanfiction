Usually I get the idea for one or several scenes to begin with. Like, one day I might just go "oh, what if Harry takes Luna to Slughorn's Christmas party, but DOESN'T leave to go after Draco?" I'll write that specific scene out first as the premise, and try to build an outline around what the changes in canon would be with that divergence.

Really, I just start writing. You can plot for 10 or 20 thousand words, but without getting some actual story out to make use of it, it's really just words. So really, I just like to take an idea and see where it goes.
