  When Harry finds a potion that can restore him to how he should have been without the Dursley's mistreatment, he is more than happy to make it and take it. After a slight mishap, so are most of the witches he bumps into...  My response to the 'Harry Potter and The Botched Potion' challenge by Octavian. This is the first time I've written anything, so if there's anything out of place, please let me know.
