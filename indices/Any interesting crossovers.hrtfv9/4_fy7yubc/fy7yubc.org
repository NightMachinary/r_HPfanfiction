There's a handful of stories I have read that can meet your criteria. You have Spectacular by megamatt09 that has Harry bitten by a spider (ala Spiderman) and hooking up with Gwen and others.

And then you have How Could One Will Cause so much Chaos by darkoraclegirl. IIRC it's a response to blood brandy vegas challenge so has Harry married to natasha, Tonks, and X-23.

And the last one is Natasha Romanoff and the Secrets of Death by JacobApples where when Natasha dies in the MCU Death brings her to the HP universe to take care of Harry right after the Killing curse bounces back into Voldemort. Eventually Peter and Gwen get pulled to this universe as well.
