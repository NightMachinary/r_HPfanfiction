Time for a deep dive of my favorites, enjoy!

*The Return of Magic* - linkffn(12292532) - RWBY Crossover: A very interesting take on Harry exploring the world of RWBY.

*For Death's Amusement* - linkffn(12710549) - RWBY Crossover: Another good crossover.

*FILFY teacher* - linkffn(12772385) - Highschool DxD Crossover: A super well thought out story has plenty of solid moments of family, action, and drama.

*Harry and a Vampire* - linkffn(13150962) - Rosario + Vampire Crossover: There is a lot of wizarding world bashing in this story. Harry also changes throughout the story but its a strange crossover so I thought I mention.

*Pack* - linkffn(13391615) - Jurassic Park Crossover: A surprisingly interesting one. Again lots of wizarding world bashing.

*Raptor* - linkffn(11689576) - Jurassic Park Crossover: This one is really good, less bashing in general but a bit of bashing of Hermione at first.

*One Punch Wizard* - linkffn(12355543) - One Punch Man Crossover: A lighthearted fun story that is excellent and should be enjoyable.

*When Harry met Wednesday* - linkffn(11674317) - Addams Family Crossover: There are quite a few of these surprisingly and they all are pretty good.

*Shining Light* - linkffn(7125352) - League of Legends Crossover: It is pretty well done, has good character dynamics, and entertaining comparing the two worlds.
