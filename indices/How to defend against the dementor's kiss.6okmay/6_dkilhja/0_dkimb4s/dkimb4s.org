Damn. Now I'm imagining Dementors made by some dark ritual to find some desperate romantic a soul mate. The ritual says that in order to make loves true kiss and be one, first they must see all of their loves worst memories. That doesn't sound too bad, and wouldn't it be nice to truly know the person you're going to unite with? So they do the ritual, and suddenly they can't seem to get warm no matter what they do, depression and apathy sink in. They start to feel hunger for their friends happiness, but when they are around others everyone has a sort of lame time. The affected person starts to draw away from people, which means no one is there to watch them turn into a shade. The dementor comes to, only knowing that it's seeking, seeking it's other half in a world full of souls, and somewhere out there is their perfect match.

Granted, we know dementors seemingly breed, and also that other than that there's no known data about them, but the idea of a ritual goes wrong is pretty chilling. After all, who doesn't want a perfect match ?
