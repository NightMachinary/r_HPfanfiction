Does the dementors kill actually suck out your soul or that just the assumption based on what people see? Maybe it eats some kind of paste that sticks your soul to your body and getting kissed means you just go to the afterlife like normal. Maybe dementors are the scariest glue eating morons to ever exist.

Suppose everyone was born a wizard at the beginning of humanity and getting killed by a dementor means they sucked out your magic and now you reincarnate as a muggle.

Maybe you have like 7 different souls that go to various afterlives but since they're all perfectly mirrored with one another it only seems like one and they just get the one and the other six scamper off to wherever.

What if everyone is their own dementor in a sort of yin/yang relationship and when a dementor finally devours its other half it goes off to disappear from the world because it is now complete and all the bad memories it gave them in life turns into positive karma in death. The worst kind of soul mate.
