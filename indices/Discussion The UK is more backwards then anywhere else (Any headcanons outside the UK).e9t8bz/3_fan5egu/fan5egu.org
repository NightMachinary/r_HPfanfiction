I tend to be of the view that the "national character" of wizarding nations largely mirrors that of the Muggle world. So wizarding Europe is likely to be a lot more socially progressive than the rest of the world, to the point that much of the world considers European wizards deviant and dangerous.

I imagine in most of the world, there's no conflict around Muggleborns on the basis that it's universal consensus that Muggleborns should be excluded from wizarding society.
