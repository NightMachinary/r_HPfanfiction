  Lycanthropy is a metaphor for stigmatized illnesses (hiv).

A very poor one because of how it is transmitted. Unless Rowling wanted to imply that the Hi virus makes someone into a bloodthirsty murder-machine once a month, it is very unfitting. Because werewolves do not get infected through accidents, bad medical standards or lack of knowledge about safe-sex, but through acts of violence. Also, all but one werewolves we see join magical Hitler, so I am really not sold on the metaphor.
