What gives you the idea that we have moved past such things? Racism, sexism, etc are still a thing in our world. Far right political movements are on the rise. Lycanthropy is a metaphor for stigmatized illnesses (hiv). That's also still a problem. Most of the things you criticize are metaphors for problems in the real world which are still very much problems nowadays, and not just in the UK but everywhere.
