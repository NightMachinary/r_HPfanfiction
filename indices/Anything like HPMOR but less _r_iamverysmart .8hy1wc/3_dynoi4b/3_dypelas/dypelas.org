If it's dominant, squibs would just be nonmagical people with magical parents. The story doesn't contradict this view. But then muggleborns don't exist. Either the magical gene was somehow suppressed in their parents, or they're all bastards.

If it's recessive, then there would be plenty of muggleborns, and two heterozygous mages would end up with only one in four children being able to use magic.
