The problem with HPMOR is that many people are used to terrible fics and assume that everything the protagonist thinks or explains in great detail reflects the opinions of the author. As far as I know the fic is a bit autobiographic and trying to show the process of a "genius" kid coming to terms with the real world and that other people can be smart too. It deals a lot with the frustrations of not being taken seriously because "you're just a child" but then overcompensating into arrogance and one dimensional thinking.
