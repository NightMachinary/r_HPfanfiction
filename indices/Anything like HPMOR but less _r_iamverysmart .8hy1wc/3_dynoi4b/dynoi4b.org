I feel ya, I liked the story until I got to the whole gene controlling magic bit. I did some work and couls find no way in which to get 25% of kids to be squibs. Assuming that magic is a recessive gene like is implied then magical parents CANNOT have a nonmagical child. If it was a dominant gene then squibs couldn't exist as people would be either magical or non. No halfway point.
