I agree! I felt like it had potential, but everything spiralled into "Hermione is an unmatched genius and everyone /adores/ her even though she's terrible to them." Her emotional responses are so shallow, and the character is so fixated on "common sense"/"logical" choices that it starts to verge on psychopathy (imo). I've more-or-less kept up with it (I'm in this deep, might as well finish), and lately [[/spoiler][she's an appallingly horrible girlfriend on top of her usual lack of empathy---she insists on making choices she decides are objectively best rather than accounting for anyone's feelings on the matter, even hers, and she's clearly out of touch with her own emotions (or lacks depth of emotion altogether)]]. She also spends the series weirdly aware of her own age, like "I'm only 15 so I'll defer to my parents" or "I'm 17 and too young to decide whether I'm in love with my boyfriend of several years." It's... creepy. Teenagers just /don't act like that/, regardless of smarts or relative maturity.

I actually don't mind godlike problem-solving in fics---I often even enjoy it when characters are made talented enough to fix all the problems of canon and live happily ever after. But Hermione in this fic is just... so inhuman.
