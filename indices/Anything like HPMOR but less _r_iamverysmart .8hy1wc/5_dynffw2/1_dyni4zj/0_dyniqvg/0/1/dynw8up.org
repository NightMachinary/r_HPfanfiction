I actually love Hermione/George, but I was pretty disappointed by the amount of relationship in this story... which is to say, barely any. Overall the Hermione in this fic is very rarely emotional at all, and applies cold logic to a vast majority of her decisions. It wasn't really my cup of tea, though it may be yours.
