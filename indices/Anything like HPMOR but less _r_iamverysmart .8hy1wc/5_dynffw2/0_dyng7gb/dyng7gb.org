Disclaimer: I've only read The Arithmancer, haven't got to the sequel yet.

I think there's a difference between a scientific/logical fic and a fic featuring a scientist or a logical person. The Arithmancer is great, but it's pretty conventional in terms of story telling and not exceptionally scientific or logical. Is The Big Bang Theory scientific/logical?
