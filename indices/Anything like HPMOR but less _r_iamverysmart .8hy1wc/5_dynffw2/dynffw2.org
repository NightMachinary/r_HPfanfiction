linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) followed by its sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes by White Squirrel) is probably what you're looking for.

This story is about Hermione instead of Harry but it basically shows her as a mathematical prodigy, which translates into a master arithmancer (basically spellcrafter) when she gets into Hogwarts. On the whole, it goes through her seven years in where she is even cleverer and more logical than she is in canon. She uses her mathematical and scientific skills to explore many elements of magic (mostly spellcrafting) similar to HPMOR.

For example, she creates spells out of scientific knowledge like curses to [[/spoiler][cause heart attack]], she explores with atom rearrangement to [[/spoiler][turn carbon into diamond]], she uses a lot of arithmancy to [[/spoiler][work out Gamp's sixth law]], and much more. The way many elements of magic work are also shown. For example the logic behind the way the trace works, or how wands are made. The theory behind other subjects like ancient runes or alchemy are also shown.

Overall, it's pretty light-hearted. I would say it is quite similar to canon in how it starts off for kids but slowly gets darker as the series progresses. Honestly one of my favorites stories I've ever read.

p.s I swear I've seen the author on this subreddit before, but I can't really remember.

Edit: I just realised somebody posted this one minute before I did. Oh well, I'm still keeping this up.
