Eh, different strokes and all that.

However, I gotta rebuke your life is too short. Maybe it's odd but I'm of the read all the books because literature and food are the most important things spin life mindset. Then again I'm not into the social and spend roughly 7-10 hours of my day basically every day reading or cooking or working out leaving me with an abnormal amount of time and dedication to literature.

Point being, life is never too short and all literature for the greatest literary masterpiece of an age to your 6 year old nieces short story have a value greater than any physical object and are enjoyable when viewed I. The right light and remembered at the right time.
