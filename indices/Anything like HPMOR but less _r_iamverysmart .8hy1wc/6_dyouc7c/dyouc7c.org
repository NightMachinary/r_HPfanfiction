linkffn(8484470) - Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy.

Magnificent world-building, the author's prose is - from both story-telling and purely technical points of view - amazing, and it manages the exremely rare feat of writing convincingly clever characters. (Most 'clever' characters are just the author's idea of what a smart person is like, a phenomenon Stephen Fry has been exploiting for /years/.)

It also makes entire sense of horcruxes, the prophecy, the Mother's-Love-Protection, the Manipulative Dumbledore trope, the Lapis Philosophorum, wandlore, British Wizarding Society, time travel vice time-turning, legilimency, pensieves, House Elf 'enslavement', spell-crafting, the Fifth Exception To Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration and many, many other things.

It also implicitly blames the rise of Voldemort on the Daily Mail, which got an honest-to-goodness belly-laugh out of me.
