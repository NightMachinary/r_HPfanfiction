There's treason, but I'm guessing they discounted that because it's only against Volde's government. It doesn't specify the time period, so there's the use of the Unforgivables - he cast the cruciatus, and imperius twice. So, that's three more counts. Robbing Gringotts and stealing that dragon might also count. Breaking into the Ministry, attacking several Ministry workers, and stealing their identity might count.
