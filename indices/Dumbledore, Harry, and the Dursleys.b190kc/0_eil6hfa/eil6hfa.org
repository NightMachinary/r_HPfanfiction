  Is it not possible that the British wizarding society is just more... accepting of â€˜abuse?' Neville Longbottom was dropped out of a window, and when the story was retold, everyone laughed.Severus Snape didn't have the best home life, to my knowledge (that might be a fanon thing, I'm not sure), and nobody did anything.

Nobody doing anything sadly is also the case in the real world. Many children (and adults) face abuse (psychological, physical and/or sexual) in their home lives. Despite sometimes obvious signs a lot of it is never uncovered or acted upon, sometimes things are wilfully ignored. I see the same being true for the wizarding world. It's not about being uncaring or accepting of abuse.
