  Is it not possible that the British wizarding society is just more... accepting of â€˜abuse?

Dumbledore admitted that he knew that Harry was facing "ten dark years". He could have stepped in at any time. But no, let's make Harry disappear before any legal procedure can commence. And let's never bother to actually do something about that miscarriage of justice I uncovered.

That is actually canon. Dumbledore is pretty Machiavellian. Which is perfectly alright if you admit it, but the "he is so good" characterisation feels incredibly OOC to me.
