By my lights, Harry Potter is an extreme example of the underdog hero's story. The whole point is that he persists on his hero's journey despite having every reason to GTFO or just roll over and die and wins despite so many circumstances stacked unreasonably against him.

It is an explicit (toxic, IMO) message that, particularly if you're young and male, there's no higher value than working hard to help your society, even if it treats you like shit - and even to help and/or save the lives of specific individuals who have treated you like shit. ^{This bit I particularly disagree with.} And that you should persevere no matter what, because if you do, you'll win too, and get to start a family with a hot young wife (or more, if you're in some older or more 'out there' stories).
