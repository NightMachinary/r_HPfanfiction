Weeb is on my 'to read' list, but I keep ignoring it. I think I started it while it was still being written and it didn't really grab me... then again it hadn't gotten that far in at that point - Harry was into the anime, etc. but didn't really know about magic yet I think. I'll move it up a place or three.
