Depends on what you think of Dumbledore as a whole.

Me personally? Albus found out How Riddle remained alive after the Diary showed up, but didn't do anything about it until he got poisoned/cursed. Now living with a literal deadline, he had to rush to let someone else finish the job for him. As to when he realized Harry was a Horcrux, during GoF would be my guess. iirc Harry mentioned the dreams to Sirius, I don't see Sirius keeping that to himself.
