I think Dumbledore realized Harry was a horcrux in COS when he got the diary and realized that was how Tom was still 'alive'. GOF is when Dumbledore realized how Harry was going to survive. When Harry explained how Voldemort came back using his blood, inwardly Dumbledore was thinking 'Yes! That's it!'
