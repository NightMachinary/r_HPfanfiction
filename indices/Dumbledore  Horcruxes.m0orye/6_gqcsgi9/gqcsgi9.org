He didn't know for sure Voldemort intentionally made multiple Horcruxes right after CoS. He knew it wasn't like Voldemort to leave something so important to someone else to guard unless he had a back up but remember, there was no precedent of someone ever making multiple Horcruxes so he only had a vague suspicion. Even if he wanted to act on that vague suspicion:

1) he couldn't have known what to look for. Remember, thematically the diary is entirely different from the rest of the Horcruxes. With the diary and Harry being the only known horcruxes, the possible other horcruxes could be literally anything. If Voldemort had given say, the cup to Lucius he could have probably won the war because no one would suspect Voldemort would consider his school diary to be the same value as the founder relics or his family ring

2) couldn't have known where to begin the search. I think there is no evidence in canon that Dumbledore knew anything about Voldemort's parents at this point, he probably only found out about them after GoF when Voldemort bragged about his muggle father to Harry.

Visiting Little Harlengton would lead him to the Gaunts and eventually by the end of OoTP to the ring, and by following Merope's tail he finds out about the locket- and when he figures out the last known location of the locket he finds out it went missing along with the cup, estabilishing a pattern of founder relics.

I believe he only found out about Nagini being a horcrux after Harry had that vision about Arthur getting attacked.

Also his suspicion about multiple intentional Horcruxes only gets confirmed after the graveyard scene (Voldemort said something along the lines of venturing farther into the path of immortality than anyone else) and he gets the final confirmation of the intended number from Slughorns memory.

TL;DR he didn't know before GoF
