I think most things are as other people said but I believe Dumbledore suspected Voldemort had latched, even if unintentionally, a piece of his soul to Harry from the start because he expresses his concern that Voldemort might have survived right in the first chapter. He has very little to go off but I think that he might gotten some form of confirmation when Harry is revealed as a Parselmouth because he is happy to learn Voldemort had used Harry's blood in his resurrection at the end GoF. It's then when he gets his confirmation that Voldemort had created multiple Horcruxes when he says that he'd gone down the path of immortality further than anyone else. I believe that's when he starts his research on Voldemort. The final confirmation that Harry is a Horcrux I believe comes when Harry has the dream through the eyes of the snake and he does that thing with his device which tells him that Harry is not possessed.
