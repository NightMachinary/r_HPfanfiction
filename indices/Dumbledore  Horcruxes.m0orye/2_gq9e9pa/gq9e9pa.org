My head canon is as follows:

Voldemort's defeat until COS: Dumbledore knows Voldemort survived and is out there somehow, but he doesn't know how. He spends this time researching and may have come across horcuxes in his studies, but isn't able to confirm anything.

COS: Harry brings Voldemort the diary and horcruxes are confirmed. Dumbledore also highly suspects Harry is a horcrux. Not sure when exactly Dumbledore considers it confirmed, but most likely when he realizes Harry's scar hurts when Voldemort is up to something (which I believe is about midway through GOF). Now that he knows what he's looking for, he starts theorizing about other possible horcruxes in his spare time - keep in minds he's still headmaster, Supreme Mugwump, Chief Warlock, etc.. Tom is still a disembodied wraith, so there's no immediate rush.

POA: Dumbledore is a bit preoccupied making sure Harry isn't killed by Sirius Black to do much searching. Unfortunately, all things considered. This was Harry's safest year.

GOF: Preoccupied hosting the TriWiz and dealing with the curveball of Harry being entered. Not much time for horcrux hunting. Dumbledore immediately realizes how Harry may survive when Harry explained how Voldemort returned using his blood. Later gives Snape orders to have Harry let himself be killed by Voldemort specifically.

OOTP: Shit hits the fan. Voldemort is back and the Ministry is doing worse than nothing about it. Dumbeldore's time is spent running the Order.

HBP: Dumbledore's backburner research has paid off and he finds the Ring. And he's also dying. Fuck. On a clock now, Dumbledore lets his other duties suffer and concentrates on horcrux hunting. He sends Harry to get a number from Slughorn. He begins to provide Harry with information on Tom's past in the hopes it'll help him find the remaining horcruxes. Notably, Dumbledore correctly identifies all but one, the diadem
