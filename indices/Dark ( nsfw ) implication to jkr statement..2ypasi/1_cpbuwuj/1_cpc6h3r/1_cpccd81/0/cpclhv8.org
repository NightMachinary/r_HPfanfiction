I'm gonna have to call bullshit on two blue eyed parents having a 1% chance to have a blue eyed kid. Blue is recessive. Two blue eyed people can pretty much /only/ have blue eyed children, though there is a very small chance of green eyes. This chart also super over simplifies how eye color inheritance works for the other colors. :/
