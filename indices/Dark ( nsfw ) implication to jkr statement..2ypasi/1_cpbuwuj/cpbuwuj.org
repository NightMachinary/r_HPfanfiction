I believe JKR suggested that magic was a 'dominant trait' in a literary sense, not genetic. In JKR-speak, that means kids of a wizard or witch mated with anything else they can make a baby from are wizards/witches, unless they're both pureblood in which case inbreeding gives a chance for squibs. Squibs are sent off to be muggles, but enough squib-grandkids marry other squib-grandkids and they'll sometimes make a wizard.
