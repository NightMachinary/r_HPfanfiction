Not sure why this deserves a NSFW tag but okay.

What you describe is one of the premises of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age][The Golden Age]] by Arsenoe de Blassenville, among other stories. (In TGA, Hermione discovers her origins and acts on this knowledge.) It's a pretty common and plausible trope in fanfiction writing.
