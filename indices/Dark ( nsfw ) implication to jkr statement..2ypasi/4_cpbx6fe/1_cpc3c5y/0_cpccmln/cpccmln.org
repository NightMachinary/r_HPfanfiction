Yes , pretty interesting read and it could explain many things. Still i think the same reasoning of the issues the wizzarding world would have with the rapid population growth of the 20th century would stay.

From the 1800 to the 1980s the population quintuples , which means that on average even the number of muggleborn should quintuple. The influx on the wizzarding population would be /massive/ since it's implied that it's a rather stable population (families like our red headed friends are exeptionally rare and big)

So yes , from a geneticaly standpoint it makes sense but from the population one it doesn't. Hogwarts should have a lot more muggleborns it has for that theory to be true.
