I was taught the genetics of the wizarding world in one of my genetics lessons.

Magic is the recessive gene, muggle is the dominant which would explain muggleborns because both parents would have to be a carrier of the magic gene. E.g Lily and Petunia, there was only a 25% chance that they'd be magical. Purebloods will have a 100% chance of having magical babies because both parents genes would be only recessive. Squibs are squibs due to a genetic mutation.

If I can find my worksheets I'll post them if anyone's interested.
