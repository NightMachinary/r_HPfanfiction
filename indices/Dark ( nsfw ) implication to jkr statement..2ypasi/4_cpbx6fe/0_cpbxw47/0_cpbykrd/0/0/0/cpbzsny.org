Oh not offended at all! I was just describing my level of knowledge on genetics (almost none)

I guess what I'm trying to say is that your theory doesn't explain the facts I have, and thus ask you to either update your theory (e.g. explain something that I failed to understand) or invalidate the contradictory facts (e.g. J.K. Rowling's statement that purebloods and muggle non-carriers will not in fact produce magical children, despite canon).
