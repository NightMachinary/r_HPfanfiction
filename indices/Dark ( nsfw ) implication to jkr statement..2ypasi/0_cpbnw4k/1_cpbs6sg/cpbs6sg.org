I think that the ammount of paranoia of an average person isn't high enought to justify random parental testing. Obviously it would happen if a woman became pregnant without recollection of any intercourse but if someone is on a normal relationship and they become pregnant and the relationship is average and stable i doubt people would go out of their way making paternity tests for even slighly major differences. It would be justified in some way like " oh yeah my granfader's aunt had the same cheekbone it must have skipped generation" , the human brain is paranoid but /not so much/ .

It would be simpler but Her Highness says otherwise. Honestly , i like trying to uncover as much canon worldbuilidng as i can , my evidence is jkr and the only thing i have is inference and deduction.

It's not a "conspiracy" , it's an horrible behaviour of some twisted immoral wizzard. If you think about it you need just arround 4-5 people to account for the ammount of muggleborns in every given year. And given the fact that there was a bloody civil war going on it doesn't ease the suspicions.

From a purely genetical point of view the likelyhood of a trait spontaneously manifesting itself and being the same of another isolated subset of popolation is ridiculously unlikely.

Imho given the numbers it's also unlikely that the gene is recessive. If it were the wizzarding population would have tons more muggleborns than it has : think about the explosion in population of the 20th century it would have spread the recessive gene like wildfire. The purebloods wouldn't be the canon 15% but way less.
