I can't be digging through the books right now, but HPWiki says that it was Amortentia that Merope used. The Amortentia page makes no reference to Ron, but Ron's page mentions that he took Love Potion, and the link there goes to Amortentia.

I'd call that strong evidence and weak evidence, respectively, unless the wiki has a reputation for bad information that I haven't heard of yet.
