And +date rape drugs+ /love potions/ are a common thing that is sold to teens over the counter, and giving them to someone is not a punishable offense. Also, house elves are a /slave race/ and only Hermione feels any outrage at this (because there is no way that they evolved to be slaves, they had to have been magically manipulated by wizards for this). Also, attempted murder is not worthy of expulsion to certain students (Sirius Black on Snape via werewolf, Harry Potter on Draco Malfoy via Sectumsempra). Legilimency/Occlumency aren't considered dark arts even though they obviously are (the former for obvious reasons, the second as a way to commit perjury). The list goes on forever.

JKR tried to pass these off as yet more eccentricities of the magical world, but some of them are extremely dubious from a moral standpoint.
