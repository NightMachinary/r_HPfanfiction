Probably best explanation I ever saw of the Sirius/Snape/Werewolf bit, that explains why Sirius ISN'T a horrible person was:

Snape was pretending to know more then he did, in an attempt to learn more. Sirius fell for it, and believed Snape already knew Remus was a werewolf. Sirius then dared him to follow him into the shrieking shack, in much the same way you might dare someone to jump off a cliff. It's not meant to be taken seriously.

If someone dares you to jump off a cliff, and you are stupid enough to do so, you can't defend your actions with "He dared me to do it!".

Of course, Snape DIDN'T know, and there was no way in hell Sirius was going to admit to his friends that he fell for Snapes lies. Dumbeldore found out what happened via legilimency and made the problem go away.
