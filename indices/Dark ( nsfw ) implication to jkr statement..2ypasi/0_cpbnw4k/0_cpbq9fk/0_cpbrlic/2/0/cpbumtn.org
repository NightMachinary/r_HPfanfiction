I see Occlumency as the equivalent of a "how to beat a lie detector with magic" thing - if you can resist Legilimency, then in all likelihood you are able to resist Veritaserum and the Imperius. Whatever cannot be verified independently cannot be trusted as long as Occlumency exists short of using unbreakable vows to swear in witnesses. With the Wizengamot obviously a political organization, that makes impartial judgment effectively impossible. The jury system is far superior to a bunch of politicians in control of both law and judgment without a way to get to the truth (/cough/Lucius Malfoy/cough/). Also, to learn it you need to be exposed to Legilimency, so there is that.

With the magical legal system as shabby as it is, then an Occlumens has a free pass to do whatever he wants as long as there are no witnesses (left alive) to see it.
