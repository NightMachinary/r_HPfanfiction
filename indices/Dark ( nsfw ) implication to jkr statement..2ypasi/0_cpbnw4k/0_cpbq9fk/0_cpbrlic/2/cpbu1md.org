  Also, house elves are a slave race and only Hermione feels any outrage at this (because there is no way that they evolved to be slaves, they had to have been magically manipulated by wizards for this).

House elves seem like they're enslaved [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_(folklore)][brownies]]. In which case it would be normal for them to help out in a household, but in the folklore they're completely independent creatures and rarely interact with humans, certainly aren't owned by humans.

  Legilimency/Occlumency aren't considered dark arts even though they obviously are (the former for obvious reasons, the second as a way to commit perjury).

Legilimency, sure, but I don't see how you can justify Occlumency being a dark art just because it could potentially be used to resist interrogation.
