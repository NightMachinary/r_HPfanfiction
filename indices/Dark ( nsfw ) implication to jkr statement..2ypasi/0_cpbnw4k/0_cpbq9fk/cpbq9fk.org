  For instance, I think someone might have noticed all muggleborns were conceived this way. Imagine a black haired man rapes a blonde woman, whose husband is similarly colored? They might become suspicious, and check, and that single confirmation would be all that is required to reveal this 'conspiracy'.

Memories can not only be erased but also modified. The rapist could leave the victim thinking they'd had sex with some imaginary other person. Personally I find it extremely disturbing how casually memory charms are treated in canon. I think they're as deserving of the term Unforgiveable as the killing curse.
