I'm pretty sure rape isn't required to explain the muggleborn stigma.

The idea isn't without merit (and surely many muggleborns are the result of such unions), but it doesn't entirely explain the existence of true 'muggleborns' (i.e. genetic children of muggle parents) who must also exist.

For instance, I think someone might have noticed all muggleborns were conceived this way. Imagine a black haired man rapes a blonde woman, whose husband is similarly colored? They might become suspicious, and /check/, and that single confirmation would be all that is required to reveal this 'conspiracy'.

It's much simpler to simply say that magic is a recessive trait, or else triggered by some magical effect that follows rules we do not know, and that Joan Rowling hasn't thought much about genetics. Which is characteristic of her, considering how she has previously stated that Hogwarts has 1000 students.
