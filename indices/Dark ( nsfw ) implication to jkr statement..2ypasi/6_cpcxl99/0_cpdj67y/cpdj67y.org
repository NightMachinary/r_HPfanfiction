I thought about it too , but a non-mendelian origin of magic doesn't make much sense. The reason is simple : evolution. A gene evolves and sticks to a population if it gives a benefit otherwise it's "washed out" and it's not refined by natural selections. This means that for magic to be non-mendelian the magical gene while non active needs to give some kind of benefit , which form the few information we have from canon it seems it's not the case. A multi-gene approach fails from an evolutionary prospective , it's way more unlikely than a single gene approach.

Obviously we could pull stuff out of our asses and claim it might be an envoirmental factor (like "magic radiation") , or just claim it's *magic* , but from a scientific prospective those are not satisfactory explanations because they are not backed by any evidence.
