Dominant trait does not necessarily mean that a person is guaranteed to be a wizard if a parent is. I wonder if you're thinking of high school bio genetics, where the most complex study of genomics is a 4x4 Punnet square. I have always assumed that magic operates in multiple genes- you have to "turn on" a certain number of genes in the set in order to get magic- and its dominance ensures that kids with one magical parent are usually magical. If a squib shows up, it's because the parents have a sufficient number of recessive, non magical alleles that allow for the rare occurrence of a non-magical phenotype. Muggleborns operate similarly- the muggle parents have a small number of dominant alleles that will on occasion result in a magical child, but are not enough to cause a magical phenotype in either parent.

Of course, this would mean that the pureblood are right to a small extent- you have to have a certain amount of magical heritage in your bloodline in order to keep producing magical heirs. But going all consanguineous with your marriages like the Black family will also eventually cause normal, human inbreeding problems over generations.
