Depends on what I'm reading, but usually ambient and experimental stuff like Aphex Twin, Arca, Forest Swords, Tim Hecker, etc. as well as a lot of jazz (as a human being with a pulse, you owe it to yourself to listen to the new Sons of Kemet record). Aside from that, it's mostly depends on the genre and I can listen to anything from The Beatles to Death Grips to Bathory. Though since I end up reading (and writing) a lot of melancholy postwar fics about the trio dealing with adulthood, I'm a sucker for sad-dad indie rock bands like The National and Frightened Rabbit.
