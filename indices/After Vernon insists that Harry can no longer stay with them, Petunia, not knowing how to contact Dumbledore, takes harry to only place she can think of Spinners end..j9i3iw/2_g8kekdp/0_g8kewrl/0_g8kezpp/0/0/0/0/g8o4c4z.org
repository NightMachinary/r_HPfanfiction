if they are intent-based and dementors don't honestly have malicious intent. Plus who could have expected the dementors which are controlled by the MoM to go rouge on November 1, 1981?

Ps i have a theory the wards got wonky after the first year when Harry saw Hogwarts as his home.

EXCERPT OotP

Dumbledore to Harry: “But I knew too where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated ... to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.”\\
“She doesn't love me,” said Harry at once. “She doesn't give a damn --”\\
“/But she took you/,” Dumbledore cut across him. “/She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you/, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”\\
“I still don't --”\\
“While you /can still call home/ the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.” ([[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/the-harry-potter-novels/op/op37][OP37]])

“Five years ago, then,” continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, “you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as /happy nor as well-nourished/ as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances.”
