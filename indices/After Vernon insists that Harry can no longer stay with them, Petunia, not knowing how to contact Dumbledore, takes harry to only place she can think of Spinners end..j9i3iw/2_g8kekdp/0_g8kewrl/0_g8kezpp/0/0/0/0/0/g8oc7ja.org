Meaning it works inside the house, or probably some perimeter that includes the garden, etc. because it's part of the property.

It does /not/ extend further, if a DE wanted to get Harry while he was in school or going to the market, or the park, they would still have managed too.

Remember the touch based protection is just against Voldemort, who could sill hurt Harry with spells, and that same protection was lost after Fourth Year.
