Yeah, I think it's a bullshit reason, it's just an excuse to keep him there for the plot, until Voldemort returned he no one was interested, and then the Ministry almost got Harry with a pair of Dementors while he was taking a walk in the park, if it had been a pair of DEs I doubt Harry would be able to defend himself as well. Nice set of protections they got there.
