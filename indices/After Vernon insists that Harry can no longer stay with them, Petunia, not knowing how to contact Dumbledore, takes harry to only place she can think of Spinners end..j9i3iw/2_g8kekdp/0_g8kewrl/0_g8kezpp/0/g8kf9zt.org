canon!Snape is not a nice person, but I doubt he would accept caring for Harry, and canon!Dumbledore would never leave Harry with Snape for a multitude of reasons he would probably go and talk with the Dursley's and if they were really set on not keeping him(which would probably break the protective enchantments), then he would place him with a nice trustable and safe family with kids he could befriend.

All the while making heavy changes to his plans.

Honestly Dumbledore knew the Dursley's were crap, but at least in-universe for some unfathomable reason he was safest there.

If you remove the plot part of JKR needing a mistreated orphan hero and then the in-universe protections, there's no reason to leave Harry there.
