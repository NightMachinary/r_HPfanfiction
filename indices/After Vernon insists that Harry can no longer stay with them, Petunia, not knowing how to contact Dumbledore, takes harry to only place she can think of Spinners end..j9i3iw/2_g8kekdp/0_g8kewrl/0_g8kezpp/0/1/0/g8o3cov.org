I like the sheer angst when they discover they are family though... Call me evil but reading these two brains break is enjoyable. I like the fact fandom Snape isnt a complete caricature of a one man's pathetic pity party. He needs to grow up and after a very adult-like mental breakdown angst and the fact JKR claims Lily and him were on the mend), I can hope to have him struggle with his emotions, employ Occlumency religiously and ACT LIKE AN ADULT DAMMIT. I hope he would take advantage of 'usurping' James as HP's father and feeling toasty by showing up his adversary one last time. okay I'm aware he is a twatwaffle... but there are a few Petunia fics where she tries to raise harry better than her sister 'ever could' and Petunia and Snape are literal mirrors of each other so.
