Harry would grow up brainwashed to despise his father James and how James was a cruel evil man who stole the love of snapes life and forced her to marry him

and then one time Harry will mention it to dumbledore about how he is nothing like his vile father James.

and then dumbeldore will lay the truth down and harrys world would be complete shattered, his cold adoptive father had lied to him his entire life and he had hated his birth father for no reason
