I honestly see no reason for Harry to be left with Snape in a universe were Dumbledore is halfway decent.

He knows Snape despises Harry's father, he knows Snape is NOT a nice person to leave a child with for plenty of reasons, most of them Snape would agree with.

Heck, I don't see Snape wanting to care for any kid on a regular basis.

I can see Minerva having much bigger chances of wanting that and being much better.

I see Dumbledore doing it himself with the help of Hogwarts House-elves.
