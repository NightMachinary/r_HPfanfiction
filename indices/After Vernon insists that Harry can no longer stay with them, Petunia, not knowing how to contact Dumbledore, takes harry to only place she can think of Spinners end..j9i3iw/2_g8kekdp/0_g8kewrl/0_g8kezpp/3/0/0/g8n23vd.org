Yeah but they also said a lot of other things that in hindsight were obvious lies. Snape could specifically target James Potter while being generally honest and "kind" otherwise, which would make Harry genuinely believe him.

What is worse, for a period at least, James did do legitimately reprehensible things that Snape could point towards to prove his point. So reversing Harry's opinions would be far from easy, especially if Snape has shown no other signs of being untrustworthy.
