Snape would never be as bad as the Dursleys. It takes a special kind of cruelty to abuse an innocent toddler, and no matter his feelings, someone who swore to protect him wouldn't then proceed to abuse him worse than the Dursleys.

That's not to say he would be /good/ for him of course, things are just as likely to go horribly.
