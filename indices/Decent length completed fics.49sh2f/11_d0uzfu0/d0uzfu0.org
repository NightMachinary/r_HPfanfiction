My current list of "the best": linkffn(firebird's son; delenda est; a cadmean victory; the lie I've lived; denarian renegade; renegade cause; wastelands of time; reign of power; a black comedy; an old and new world; letters by theendless7; the pureblood princess).

All of those should be above 100k words, some well above that. The sequels to Firebird's Son and Denarian Renegade are all complete and I recommend them as well. There are incomplete/abandoned sequels to HP and the Wastelands of Time, Delenda Est, and Renegade Cause.

The pure fluff fics--Letters, Pureblood Princess--might come off a bit Mary Sue, I can't remember. Daphne is pretty much an OC, regardless, and Fleur is only a few steps removed.

I've read all of these stories multiple times, except A Cadmean Victory because it hasn't been around that long.
