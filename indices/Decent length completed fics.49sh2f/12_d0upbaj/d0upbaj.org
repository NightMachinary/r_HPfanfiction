These are a few of my favorites. Each of them I've read more than once.

Linkffn(Harry Potter: Dark Memories) - very good "what if" fic.

Linkffn(Poison Pen) - an interesting take on what some people see as what's wrong with the Wizarding world.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Gift of Time) - time travel fic, but interesting, even if Harry is a little over powered in my opinion.

Linkffn(To Shape and Change) - another time travel fic. This one is Snape though, after he gets over his hatred of Harry, and tries to protect him. Non!Gryffindor Harry

Linkffn(The Fox Who Lived) - crossover with YuYu Hakusho but actually amazingly well done and incorporates the universes quite well. It's fairly long and goes through most of both stories plot lines.
