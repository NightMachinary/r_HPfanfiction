[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]]

Thorn Circle is the first in an ongoing series - all are novel-length, and the 5th is set to come out sometime this year or next year (if Inverarity gets a move on). They're /truly/ in a class of their own, quality-wise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Bitch]] is absolutely hilarious - a fantastically funny and clever fic. Basically a Peggy Sue fic, and the love interest is Tonks, but it's not a shipping fic by any means.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] had me on the edge of my seat the entire damn time; /this fic alone/ made Bellatrix/Hermione one of my favourite pairings. Lots of wonderful scenes and lots of angst. There's a few short sequels by the author that follow up the events of the main story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] is a great, if very angsty, Harmony fic without any of the usual accompanying Harmonian bullshit (i.e. Weasley-bashing, Dumbledore-bashing, et cetera). Dimensional travel plays a large part, as does Luna.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5906518/1/Ron-El-Greco][Ron El Greco]] explores the "mature" side of Ron/Hermione, and involves Ron being a diplomatic Auror in a rogue Middle Eastern city-state. Very adventurous, but ultimately down-to-earth.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10402749/1/War-Paint][War Paint]] is the only HG/TR fic I'll ever read, and for good reason.
