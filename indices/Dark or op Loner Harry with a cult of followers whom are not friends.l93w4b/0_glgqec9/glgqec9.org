Harry is creeped out by these weirdos who worship him. Maybe one of the most extreme one yells "To our lord Potter!" before suicide bombing at a pureblood gathering. Something really fucked up like that. Can Harry really turn away all the potential help from these super creepy people who seem to think he some sort of an omen god of death or something to fight Voldemort and his followers? Won't they just do whatever they think if he doesn't tell them what to do? Could they turn on him if he doesn't display enough god like qualities? Could Voldemort twist them to his cause if he doesn't take charge even though he's kind of terrified of them? Make it creepy and super tense.
