There are at least 2 reasons that should make your plan fail :

- This one could easily be fanon, but there is a theory that say that "Muggle money" is worthless in the Magical World, including for the Goblin. According to this theory, the Goblin only accept to change Pounds against Galleons to ease the integration of the Muggleborn, but they either share the cost with the Ministry or the Ministry completely refund them afterward.\\
  With that in mind, the Goblin could refuse to exchange a massive quantity of Muggle Money, especially if it becomes a comon occurence.
- The other reason is that they wizards are not completely stupid. If rich Muggles start to give a lot of money to random people, it should make some waves in the Muggle World if only because the "heirs" trying to protect their inheritance (as an example we have the "Bettencourt case" in France), if some Muggleborn just happen to receive a lot of Muggle Money at the same time, the Ministry should make a link sooner or later.\\
  I don't remember if the specific law is precised, but Canon made it very clear that the usage of Magic on a Muggle (without a reason) is at the very least an offence, one that would probably send the culprit in Azkaban for some time.
