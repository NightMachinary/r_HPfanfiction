Instead of doing a currency exchange since I can't imagine that staying unnoticed or going over well with the wizarding world I would recommend using that muggle money to buy things in the muggle world that are either useful to the wizard or can be resold. Property, jewelry, raw materials, food... it'll cut into profits but I would think it would be more viable long term.
