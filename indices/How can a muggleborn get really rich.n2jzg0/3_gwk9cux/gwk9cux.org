That's just stealing with extra steps. I assume that this is the sort of thing Aurors are well-practiced at arresting people for.

Repairing stuff, including renovating buildings, would take some skill, but probably be less illegal if you take care to make things to muggle standards. I have a WIP about Sirius and Remus fixing up #12 Grimmauld Place until they can rent it out to muggles.
