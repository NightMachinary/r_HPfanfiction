Since galleons are made of gold, I'd watch the value of gold and sell, when the exchange rate is high. I'd then buy galleons again and repeat.

One galleon apparently equals roundabout 5 pounds and considering that the goblins will probably exchange pounds to galleons for a tiny fee I'd say that you'd get one galleon for maybe Â£ 5,50 - 5,60 ish... Sounds rather profitable to me...
