I think the best bet for a muggleborn to get rich is to leverage their magic in the muggle world. It's not illegal: it's only illegal if you are enchanting muggle objects. Using magic in the muggle world is perfectly legal as long as no muggles learn about it. The hardest part is getting the proper paperwork in the modern world to pass any background checks.

Take broken furniture from RoR, fix it with magic, sell in the muggle antique market. (I can't take credit for this idea; saw it in a fic.) You can start with the RoR as your initial seed, but furniture restoration is huge business. Haul it to your workshop, let it sit for a month or so (because quick turn-around would be suspicious), then cast a few repararos. Profit!

Honestly, pretty much sorting through the RoR will give you endless money-making schemes.

For a longer buildup, get a bunch of expanded space containers (trunks, etc), and sell offsite storage services to businesses. They don't expect to be able to access things on their alternate site. You haul it away in a truck, shrink it down for storage, and reverse the process if they want access to any of it.

Shipping/logistics. Shrink the stuff down, apparate or floo to wherever, unshrink and deliver. With a good scheduler, one person can deliver a LOT of stuff. You'd only need one delivery vehicle, as you can shrink and carry that with you as well.
