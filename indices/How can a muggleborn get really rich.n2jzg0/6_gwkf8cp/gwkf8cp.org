I think the old favourite is antique restoration. Maybe old cars too?

It wouldn't be like billionaire level but enough to live a simple life

As an artist I've thought a fair bit about the concept of transfiguration and how that could translate to working with materials. So again, most artists don't make a mint, probably, but it would be an enjoyable way to live

I'm bad at this because I don't really care very much about being a millionaire

I mean, even working as a cleaner would be pretty easy lmao
