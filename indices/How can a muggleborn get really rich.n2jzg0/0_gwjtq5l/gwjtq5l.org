The issue with all the inevitable ideas you'd come up with is why did no one else do it first? Why did the Death Eaters, who don't believe Muggles are humans and love imperio not just use them for funds? Mugglewank fics where the OC uses stupidly imbalanced gold to pound to galleon ratio's in fics should explain why everyone and their mother doesn't do it first, and how the wizarding economy survived it.
