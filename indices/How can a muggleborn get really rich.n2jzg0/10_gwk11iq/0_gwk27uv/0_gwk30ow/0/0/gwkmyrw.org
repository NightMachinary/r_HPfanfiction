The possibility for a morbidly amusing one-shot aside, there's no real canon evidence that magic cast by a witch or wizard dissipates following the death of said witch or wizard. If it did, things like the Sorting Hat, magical portraits, the Marauder's Map, and possibly even Hogwarts itself would essentially not exist in any usable state.
