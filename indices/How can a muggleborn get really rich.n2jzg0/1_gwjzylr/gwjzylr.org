Here's a legal one, especially if they're in the 90s:

There's a HUGE market for information technology in the wizarding world. Just think about how long it took them to search the library for information about Nicholas Flamel. A Google search could've done that in a fraction of a second.

With almost any physical product (apart from the really complicated things like ultra brooms) the situation is that there's a lot of people who could make that thing by themselves, so you can't make that much money selling it. But not information. Everyone still relies on good old books for that.

If anyone can create a magical variant of the smartphone and internet, capable of providing a massive amount of information with an easy-to-use search function, maybe also with instant messaging and online shopping, and capable of some number crunching tasks for arithmancy research too, it would easily make many millions of galleons. Perhaps even a billion, which would probably be a record considering the small size of the wizarding world. Especially if it took a ton of effort to develop so competition won't happen for a while.

It doesn't even have to be magic compatible electronics. All software consists of mathematical constructs built from simple instructions which in turn are constructed from logic gates. It doesn't matter if that logic being done by electrons in silicon or by something else.
