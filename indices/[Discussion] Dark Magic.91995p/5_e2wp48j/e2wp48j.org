All spells which are fueled by negative emotions are considered dark in my opinion. It is as Bellatrix said in book 5, you need to want to hurt them or dominate their will to be able to cast the spells. It was mentioned in book 4 by fake moody that they can all point their wands and cast the killing curse at him but he wont even get a nose bleed . That means that the intention/ hate/ other emotion to fuel the curse is not present.
