  “If you don't mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let Draco do it?”

  “That boy's soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I would not have it ripped apart on my account.”

  “And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”

  For me, this reads that Dumbledore doesn't want Malfoy to try to use the killing curse because it means Malfoy will need to initialize the darker emotions in his soul. The reason he is asking Snape is because Dumbledore knows Snape can tap into those darker emotions that are lurking beneath the surface.

  Snape understands the Dark Arts, and the Mind Arts, well enough that he can hate Dumbledore for a moment in order to cast the curse. I still believe when Snape cast the Killing Curse, he absolutely meant it for that second. I do not think you can think of 'saving someone from misery' and cast the curse. After all, fake!Moody told the class about the Unforgivables intent, and how none of the students would be able to give him more than a nose bleed.
