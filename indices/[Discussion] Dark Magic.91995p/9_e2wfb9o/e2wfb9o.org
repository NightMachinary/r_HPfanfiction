> But in canon, Dumbledore explicitly stated that Avada Kedavra used for euthanasia would not harm one's soul.

When does he say this? I do not remember it.

For me, Unforgivables are banned because they required malicious intent for the spell to work. This is backed by canon with the Cruciatus curse. It takes a certain sort of mindset to fuel the curses. I doubt the killing curse could be used for any reason but murder.

Dark magic is whatever the Ministry of Magic (and other wizarding governments) decide it to be. There is no separate 'dark magic' branch we often see in fanon, and it is certainly not addicting. I always assumed Dark Magic is usually based on intent and emotions, which makes it finicky and problematic.

As for people using Dark Magic, I wouldn't be surprised if people use it more and more as time goes on, because once you get in that mindset (of anger, depression, hate, etc), it becomes easier and easier. Dark magic, to me, is powerful yet dangerous. It's not like a drug where it is physically addicting, but is a way of releasing your anger and frustrations to the world. A happy and content person could not fuel a dark arts spell just like Voldemort or someone depraved could make a Patronous.
