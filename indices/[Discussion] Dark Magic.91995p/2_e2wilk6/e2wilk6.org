Magic seems to be more about skill and capability than anything. We know from canon that not everyone can throw around a killing curse. Crouch Jr. pretty much implies its difficult to actually cast. The Cruciatus and Imperius Curse are likewise difficult to cast successfully, and much of this seems to depend upon the person. Bellatrix, for instance, seems to prefer the Cruciatus Curse and have a talent for it.

So why use all those other spells? Possibly its because those curses are /hard and require a certain mentality/ to work correctly. You need to want to dominate someone to use the Imperius Curse. You need to want to enjoy the pain to cast the Cruciatus Curse.

Plus, much like in muggle combat and warfare, you should never underestimate the twin dragons of surprise and shock value. People know what the killing curse looks like, but how many people know what a vein shattering curse looks like, or how to treat it? Not to mention, and this is important, dark wizards in Harry Potter are more like /terrorists/. You want to go for visually flashy and horrifying. Dead bodies are a lot more scary when they're covered in lacerations and a look of utter fear adorns their faces.

In short, yes you can accomplish a lot of the same things with an /incendio/ or a /diffindo/, but its not quite as frightening when everyone knows how to do that. Using dark magic is about stepping outside the acceptable and mundane of magical society. Finding the taboo and weird and turning it against the lay people. Its not a good thing, but how many people in history have been fascinated to pursue things that the general public recoiled at?

Answer: quite a few.
