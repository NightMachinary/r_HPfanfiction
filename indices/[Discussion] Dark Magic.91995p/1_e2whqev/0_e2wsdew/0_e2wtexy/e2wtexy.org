I would headcanon that there are a few more specific meanings for specific contexts (ie people who normally deal with legal issues, ie Ministry workers, might mean something closer to: "spells that are illegal," or "stuff that Aurors deal with"), but for general use the term is vaguely defined.

Arthur Weasley probably calls cursed vacuum cleaners Dark Artifacts, yet Lucius Malfoy probably just calls that a prank - but no one is using the term "incorrectly."
