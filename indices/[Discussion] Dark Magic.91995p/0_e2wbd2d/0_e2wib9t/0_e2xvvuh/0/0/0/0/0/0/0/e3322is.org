I literally took this from the actual definition of evil. So no, I don't think the least amount possible means profoundly. It's just what went along with the actual definition of the word.

Dude, I don't care anymore. You're trying to be pedantic about a weird definition of evil that nearly no one goes by. Why? What's the point? No one uses the word in the way you're describing.
