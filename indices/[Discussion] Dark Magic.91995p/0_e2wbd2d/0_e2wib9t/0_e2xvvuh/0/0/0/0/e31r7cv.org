Since they incapacitate, make uncomfortable or can even slightly injure or cause pain, they are definitely evil by definition. Just very little so. Just as pranking someone is be evil - it shames them in addition to any other direct negative effect of the prank.

I know what we generally mean by evil, and I don't mean that. I just like to be thorough given the discussion. Legally, of course, I can hardly imagine minor jinxes and hexes being classified as evil, it's more likely something where inordinate pain, incapacitation and/or murder would fit the definition. But you can certainly jinx and hex an enemy without doing any of those things to any considerable extent, and I can imagine it would certainly still be frowned upon and not exactly allowed in civil society. So, practically speaking, that's why I would classify them as evil. Because of their effects, intent, and targets as the case may be.
