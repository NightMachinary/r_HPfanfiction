So a diffindo at someone's arm is Dark Magic and therefore evil? What is considered 'harm'? Only bodily harm? Or psychological harm as well? Is levicorpus dark magic? What about indirect things like levitating a club above someone's head and dropping it? What about a simple tripping or stinging jinx?

If your definition is indeed correct then Dark Magic is a pretty useless label...
