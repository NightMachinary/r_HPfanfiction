The unforgivable cursed are cstegorized that way because of the intent of the caster. There is nowhere in the book that even points to Avada Kedavra being used for euthanasia.

Avada Kedavra needs a muderous intent. And so does Crucio (intent of torture) There are multiple instances of this being explained in the book.

In short i think that dark magic!=evil but all magic that is 'evil' is dark magic. For example sll curses are "dark" but not all of them are evil (Reducto curse is the best example)
