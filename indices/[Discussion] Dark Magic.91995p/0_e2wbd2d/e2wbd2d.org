I'm really not sure why this is something that fanon gets so... strange.

The books are quite explicit about this: dark magic is using magic to harm someone. Dumbledore even gives Harry a lecture on how some spells that are called dark magic can be used to do things other than harm people as well, and they wouldn't be dark magic.

That harm can also be to the caster.

By the rules JKR has given us, this is dark magic:

1. Magic that causes harm to the caster.
2. Any magic that is used to cause harm to someone else.
3. Any magic that must cause harm to a third party as part of its casting.

So basically dark magic is entirely about intent, however some spells don't have much of a use if your intent isn't to cause harm (perhaps Sectumsempra might be an example of that?)

Dark magic is categorically evil according the canon, but that's because dark magic is DEFINED as magic that is used to do evil things, no matter what kind of spell it is.
