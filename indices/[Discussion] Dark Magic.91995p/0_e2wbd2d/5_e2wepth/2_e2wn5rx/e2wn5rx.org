First and foremost, in the context of the rules stated above, most uses of the Imperius curse horribly break rule 2.

Second, the whole point is that "Dark magic is about intent".

What you seem to be ignoring is that many people find mind control to be inherently evil in almost all situations. Sure there is the one off "I could totally use it to stop someone from jumping off a building" excuse used in countless bits of fan fiction, but most people look at it and see all the myriad opportunities for abuse.

So far as we know, it does not directly cause harm, however, consider some of the best advice for implementing a new piece of magic or technology in your story. What was its original intent? How will it be abused? How will this affect the richest in society? How will it affect the poorest? How can it be marketed? What will the black market look like?

Sure, with the imperius, you could conceivably have some sort of therapeutic use for psychologists, but I can't see many more benign uses for it.

As I've stated, so far as we know, it does no direct harm (I'd be interested in a study of dopamine overdose in relation to this). However, the potential abuse is far too high to classify it as anything but dark.
