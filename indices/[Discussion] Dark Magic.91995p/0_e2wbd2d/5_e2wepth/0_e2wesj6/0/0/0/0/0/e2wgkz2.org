Violation definitely works, although it does sound /wrong/. Like the spell is raping a person or something.

I guess, maybe "Manipulates/changes in an unnatural way" sounds better, although that is a sentence, not a word.

Using this, definition, it would work with all of the three unforgivables, and the rest of Dark Magic

Then again, the happiness Imperius causes *could* technically by natural, but that's just me nitpicking.
