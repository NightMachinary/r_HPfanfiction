JKR left a very open-ended definition of what dark magic is.

But of all the spells the three unforgivables are one of the main ones set as both dark and evil and for good reason. Imperio /is/ bad. It doesnt cause physical harm but certainly causes psychological harm, and requires the will of the caster to dominate that of the victim. And if you don't think that is harm, you need to reevaluate some things man.

Not to mention that if the caster tells thr victim to kill himself and/or harm another it is causing /both/ types of harm.

Basically is like enslaving someones will, how can it /not/ be dark and evil?
