  Dark magic just is, it is the intent in which it is used to determine if it was for evil or not.

It /is/ evil. That it isn't, is just nonsense invented by edgy fanfics.

Like dude, it's not "dark" and evil because Rowling arbitrarily declared it such. Dark Magic is Evil because it's all about the Bad Juju.

What about the concept of a curse spell intended for murder where hatred is a prerequisite and butchering your soul is a consequence sounds not horrible? Or the ones specifically intended for torturing and enslaving other people? Or that "Drink of Despair" potion, that causes both physical and mental anguish in its drinker? Or the resurrrection ritual Voldy did, featuring fun stuff like graverobbing and mutilation of both yourself and others? Or the Sectumsempra curse whose effect is straight-up maiming people?

What about any of this sounds morally grey and tragically understood?
