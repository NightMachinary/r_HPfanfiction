Holy crap this was while ago.

Canonically, dark magic /is not/ evil. Dark magic has been classified as any magic that harms. Not everything that harms is evil. Your headcanon is dark magic is evil because it is all about bad juju, but we are talking about canon in which not all dark magic is evil, but all evil magic is dark.

It doesn't matter if Rowling arbitrarily decided what is considered dark magic, that is how things get brought up when coming up with ideas for a story. She had decided that any magic that harms is dark magic. Just because something is harmful, does not make it evil.

There are a ton of dark magic that is used in canon, any jinx/hex/curse no matter how minor is classified, canonically, as dark magic. If you think Anti-Intruder Jinx, which is classified as dark magic, is evil, then sure, you have an extremely broad view of evil magic. In which case, for you *all* dark magic is evil. But probably for a majority of people, something so minor in the darker spectrum, would not be evil.

  What about the concept of a curse spell intended for murder where hatred is a prerequisite and butchering your soul is a consequence sounds not horrible? ...

I never said that wasn't evil. Everything you listed can definitely be seen as evil, I am not arguing otherwise. I am arguing that dark magic does not automatically equate to evil per canon. If you choose to decide dark magic is evil, that is headcanon and that is fine. Just don't argue that in canon, all dark magic is evil. The fact is, dark magic is just a classification, dark magic just is.
