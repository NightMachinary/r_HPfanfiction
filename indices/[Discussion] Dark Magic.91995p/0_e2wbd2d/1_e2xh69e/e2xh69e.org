  Dark magic is categorically evil according the canon

I agree with most of what you said except this. Dark magic is not categorically evil in canon. Dark magic just is, it is the intent in which it is used to determine if it was for evil or not.

A lot of good wizards in canon use dark magic and aren't evil. You can't keep casting evil magic without turning evil.
