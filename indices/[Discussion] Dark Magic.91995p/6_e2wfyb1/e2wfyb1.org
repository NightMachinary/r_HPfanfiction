I think the unforgivables explain themselves. Imperius lets you completely control the actions of another person if they haven't got enough willpower to break it. For the Cruciatus, you know, clue's in the name. The Killing Curse is imo a bit trickier to fit into the unforgivables though. In a way it could even be thought of as merciful, since it causes instant and painless death as opposed to, say, cutting their heads off with a Severing Charm. The unforgivable part of the Avada Kedavra in my mind is the mindset required to cast the spell, as it requires a feeling of hatred and promotes negative thinking like that.

Other Dark Magic requires 1 things: Intent

Any spell in the Harry Potter universe could with the right use, mindset and intent kill a person (a fact i feel is greatly underused in fanfiction). A Wingardium Leviosa can be used to drop a rock from a height almost certainly killing a person by splattering their brains everywhere. You can banish a rock at a person, Bombarda is obvious, the list goes on and on. The Oppugno Jinx is a favorite of mine just for the sheer possibilities of how you can kill a person with it. So how do you separate using a Severing Charm to cut off some rope and a Severing Charm to cut off a head? Intent! If you perform a spell with the intention of hurting someone that in my mind makes it Dark Magic.

However there are exceptions. Spells that are made for the sole purpose of hurting people. I can't really imagine using, say, Fiendfyre for any good reason other than pure destruction.
