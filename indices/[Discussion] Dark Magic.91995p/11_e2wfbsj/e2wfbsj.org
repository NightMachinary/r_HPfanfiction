In what I tried to define, dark magic was magic inherent only to dark mages, because those were easier to explain through what was ready at moment.

But in laymans terms(though, not a complete explanation), it is magic of high stakes and going "outside" of what one can call normal.

Going by this, those are *very* dangerous but equally rewarding to those who success at it. Like, I dunno, a russian roulette where you have 3 bullets, an empty chamber, panacea pill and you dont know what is in the last.

Yeah, it'd be a good metaphor if not for 3/1/1/1 chances. In reality, those are more... multiple?.. and are not available to be known.

But yeah, doesnt fit canon division.
