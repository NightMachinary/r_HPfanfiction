I have an alternative theory that might work with canon.

Dark Magic involves having the spell sustain its effect, even actively resisting the ending of the spell, until the target is no longer capable of being cursed in that way.

Most curses are considered Dark magic (depending on which interview with JKR you take as authoritative).
