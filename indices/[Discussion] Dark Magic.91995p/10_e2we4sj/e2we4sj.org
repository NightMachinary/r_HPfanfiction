I prefer the idea that dark magic isn't more powerful, but easier to learn and use. You need far less skill to use the Killing Curse than a Cutting Curse - all you really need is to really hate your target.

As far as the drawbacks of dark magic are concerned, I usually run with this: Since you need to feel hatred, a desire to subjugate and dominate and hurt others etc. to cast it, they tend to corrupt you, not only affecting your emotions negatively, but also making you more emotional over time, more prone to act without thinking.
