  What is your definition of dark magic?
#+end_quote

The same as the canon definition: Magic that by 'virtue' of itself and what it does is Bad Juju, that can't actually do anything remotely good.

Like that one spell where you need to summon up your hatred of another in order to kill them, the act of which will rip your own soul apart. Or the torture and enslavement curses. Or that one drink of bodily and mental anguish that Dumbledore drank. Or the resurrection ritual where you need to go for graverobbing and mutilation. Etcetera.
