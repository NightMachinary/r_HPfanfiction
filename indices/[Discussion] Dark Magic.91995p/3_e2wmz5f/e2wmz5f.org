That's why Fiendfyre is so great. You get a homing, semi-sentient and self-sustaining fire that burns everything in the vicinity and is ridiculously hard to control, so once you "levelled" your dark magic far enough, nearly no one can counter it. It can be used both offensively and defensively (unleash it and run in the resulting confusion).
