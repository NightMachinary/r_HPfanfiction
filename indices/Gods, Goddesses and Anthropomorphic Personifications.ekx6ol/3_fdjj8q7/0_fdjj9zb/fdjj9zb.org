#+begin_quote
  ...Don't necessarily make the master. If anything, it's the other way around. “The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one Master of Death.”Except, Beatle the Bard was not quite right---and neither was Xenophilius Lovegood. Now Harry must find his own path as the Master of Death, all the while dancing a one-man tap dance between Death above and Death below. What's worse, unmaking and remaking the Hallows is only the first step.
