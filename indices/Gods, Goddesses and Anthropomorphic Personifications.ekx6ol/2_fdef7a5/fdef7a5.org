Linkffn(as good as death) - this one is interesting and if I remember correctly Harry here is gathering followers to become a deity, just like his daddy Death and aunty Destiny.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5936137]]) - this one... eh... good but... It has an interesting idea and it's well written. Death's subordinate fucked up and took Harry's soul when Death and Fate made a deal long ago about him surviving. Death feels guilty and decides to have his first vacation since the beginning of his existence and ventures into the mortal world to live as Harry Potter. Sounds very interesting, right? Why would I be so unsure about it? It's readable only up until the start of second year (if not earlier). The author got impatient and wanted lemons. The pairing is snarry. The result is disgusting. I understand that Death is millions years old and it's just his body that is 12 years old. And his body is very horny. It would be probably tolerable if only Death felt that way. But when Snape starts having wet dreams about mf 12 years old boy... WTF??? So. I advise you to read it until the end of the 1st year, then drop it and say "ah, it's so sad that it's unfinished". This part is really interesting. And I liked the interactions between deities.
