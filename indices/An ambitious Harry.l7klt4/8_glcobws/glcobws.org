This prompt is ruined by the unnecessary time travel.

Why have him time travel? You say you're sick of fics which don't do new things, and then do the most clich√© thing imaginable? No doubt Harry would just play along with school, and be basically a silent observer as canon plays out 100% like it did in the books.

Here's how it should be done:

- Harry is deceived into thinking he's the heir of a bunch of debt, which has him taken into custody by the goblins, his wand broken.

- Their punishment for debtors is forced labor in silver mines all over the world, which makes it exceedingly hard to locate him, because there are so many prisoners and so many mines.

- after 5 years of raids, skirmishes and wars, Harry is located and freed.

- Instead of rehashing canon, the story begins here. Harry is scarred, traumatized and damaged, but he was never broken - no, his will was reforged into steel in the face of adversity.

- Harry becomes ruthless. His new wand is made from the handle of his pickaxe, and its core is a muscle fibre from the arm he lost during the slave revolt that freed him and the other slaves. It becomes a morbid but effective symbol of the cause.

- Instead of a fucked up plan like goblin genocide, Harry concocts something a little more intelligent: he plans to dismantle the goblin nation, its leadership, and Gringotts Inc., liberating the goblin people. There were not just human slaves in the silver mines, after all.

And so on. An original story would be much better than rehashing canon.
