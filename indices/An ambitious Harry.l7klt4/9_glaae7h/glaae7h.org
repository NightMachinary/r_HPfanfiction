A less exaggerated version where it's 5 years and there's no shinimodori, and he gets out in time to take his NEWTS. He's a wizard, so I imagine the goblins would have taught him something so he's more useful, so his knowledge and abilities may be heavily specialised in one direction. He'll have to figure out how his weird specialisation can help him fight death eaters and catch up on his studies while adjusting to life at Hogwarts.

Or maybe it's 30 years, but the negotiations to get him out succeed after 5 or so but he has to go back to complete his sentence after he defeats Voldemort, making the story bittersweet.
