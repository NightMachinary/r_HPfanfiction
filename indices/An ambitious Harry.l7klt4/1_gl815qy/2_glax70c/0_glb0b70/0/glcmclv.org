Truth be told, we could probably sidestep the whole slavery plot altogether without much trouble. Here is a teen who just won a war having seen many friends die and being traumatized beyond measures, a teen who just so happens to have access to a stone capable of getting him in touch with petty much all teachers in history, a wand that will perform any spell to their most murderous potential, a cloak of invisibility that will never wear off and petty much the entire ministry being run by either his friends or racists that hate goblins. Even some minor scarhorcrux related power boost wouldn't be off the table.

Then you have Goblins baying for blood after the dragon incident, in cannon they seem to have been smart enough to either forget it or be reasonable in their demands for retribution, so what if they weren't? It wouldn't be hard to introduce either a misunderstanding of Harry and his friends standing on the magical world or a cultural difference that leads the Goblins to bite more than they can chew. Harry probably wouldn't be overly concerned by losing some of his own money, but if they went after the Weasley's and Grangers too? Those are much easier targets and things like stealing the burrow or ruining the Grangers would probably hit them much harder them acting directly again Harry even if he is just moderately wealthy instead of filthy rich, make a bad enough offense based on differences between the societies (if having something unspeakables is /really/ necessary than having them *try* to make Hermione pay her part of the debt with sexual services -I say try because I can't really think of any situation Hermione would accept it, to say nothing of Harry, Ron and the order- or even get them to do something like discriminate against Teddy being a werewolf later on) and then you have the perfect setting to get Harry to hate Goblins in a moment when he is powerful enough to do quite the damage if he put his mind to it.
