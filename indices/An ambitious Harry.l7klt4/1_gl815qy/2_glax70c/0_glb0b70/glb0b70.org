Or they bring in a Curse-Breaker and deal with this.

Look, I know it's tempting to just handwave stuff by adding fanon magic that cannot be beaten, but that's not a good idea. It's like bringing in the military to deal with a schoolyard scuffle - sure, it solves the current problem, but now that you have the military acting as hall monitors, your school shooter drama is going to suffer some problems, and making the school shooter use a tank so the soldiers can't stop creates even more problems down the road. Unless you're really into torture porn, the "Harry was a slave for thirty years" is not needed at all to make him ambitious and bent on destroying Gringotts. In fact, it's so outrageous and causes so many problems, I don't get why people insist on keeping it.
