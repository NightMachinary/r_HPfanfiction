True, but the success or failure of a rescue operation depends on actually rescuing your target. It doesn't matter if you bake goblins into pies afterward if they torture and kill Harry first - and if he gets kidnapped right in the bank and spirited away to hidden facility, any overt action will hurt, and any covert action will take time - especially if the 'official' position of Ministry is "We can't help you."

Add in that the 'good guys' usually avoid permanent solutions, going for half-measure and what not... Yeah, problems.

Plus, I actually enjoy the reversal of "Goblins capture Voldemort's followers as branded cattle on behalf of Lord Of Many Names Potter and set them to work in concentration camps".

It's also one of the few non-OOC reasons for a returned Harry to actively pursue vengence and see it through to the end.

Especially if, in the camp, he meets scores of muggle-raised who'd been caught by the Goblin-friend scheme or tricked by blood-test. (Just so his 'saving-people-thing doesn't kick in to save the goblins, but instead condemns them further)

"NEVER AGAIN."
