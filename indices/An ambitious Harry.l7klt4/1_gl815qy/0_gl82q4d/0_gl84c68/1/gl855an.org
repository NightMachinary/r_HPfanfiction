I agree with you that this is unlikely. I do believe it can be done though.

Let's take even the lousy, overused fidelius charm. As long as the Keeper keeps their gob shut, no one is finding the thing. And good luck finding the one goblin amongst hundreds while the little shits cover for one another. One thing they have over wand-wavers is the unity.

Though honestly? I'd rather see Hermione going fundraiser route. If all people who owed Harry contributed a few sickles, or in the special cases like Malfoy, a few galleons, the thirty years could be cut down to three - enough for trauma and motivation (premise of the prompt) but not enough to fully grind him down in the first timeline.
