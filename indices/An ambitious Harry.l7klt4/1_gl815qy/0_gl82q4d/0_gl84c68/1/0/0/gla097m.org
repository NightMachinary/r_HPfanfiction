Well, I agree that it would be tricky to pull off. However, I also think that just because a scenario is hard to do well doesn't make it unworthy of an attempt.

One comment about 'badass avenger trope', its monologues and assorted cliche:

#+begin_quote
  If you have to look along the shaft of an arrow from the wrong end, if a man has you entirely at his mercy, then hope like hell that man is an evil man. Because the evil like power, power over people, and they want to see you in fear. They want you to know you're going to die. So they'll talk. They'll gloat.

  They'll watch you squirm. They'll put off the moment of murder like another man will put off a good cigar.

  So hope like hell your captor is an evil man. A good man will kill you with hardly a word.

No monologues, I'm allergic to them.
