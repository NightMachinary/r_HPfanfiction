Yea I agree 30 years seems very excessive, but then again...nations enslave people even now it is not so hard to believe it's possible especially if this slave camp is held outside of Britain and outside the purview of the Ministry. There are loopholes but you bring up a lot of good points for sure...all things to consider if someone wanted to make this as believable as possible. I think this would be an easy idea to ruin if it's not done right.

Also the "adult mind returned to the child body" has never been my favorite - I've only ever read one that made sense as the adults around him would notice, surely. I think if you took out that aspect of this, and there was no time travel, the vengeance aspect would be interesting.
