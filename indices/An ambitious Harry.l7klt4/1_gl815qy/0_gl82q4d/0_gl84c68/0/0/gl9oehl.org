I really don't see either Ron nor Hermione, nor the Order, give up on Harry. Also, if the goblins are so powerful, why could three students raid their bank?

But the main problem is that if the goblins were so damned powerful that they could tell the entirety of Wizarding Britain to go fuck themselves after enslaving the saviour of the country, then why haven't they done much, much worse already?

Further, the whole "back in time" plot is, honestly stupid. The main point is Harry wanting to destroy the goblins, presumably using all sorts of politics, dark magic etc. So why the fuck would you want to add time travel with all its problems to that? That's not adding but detracting from the premise. Instead of the Count of Monte Cristo, you have all the shit about time travel, you have Voldemort to deal with again, you have a Harry who is in a child's body with the mind of an adult - creepy much? - and you're stuck with the canon plot and Hogwarts, and trying to explain how an eleven-year-old does politics without everyone freaking out. And you have a suicdal Harry back in time, more mindscrew... that's all stupid shit that doesn't add anything.

So, I'd say, fuck the peggy sue trope. You don't need thirty years to suffer and develop rage. Have Harry spend six month in a goblin debtor's prison or such, see other wizards and witches be abused, some dying from it, until his friends raise the money to free him, and then it's vengeance time.
