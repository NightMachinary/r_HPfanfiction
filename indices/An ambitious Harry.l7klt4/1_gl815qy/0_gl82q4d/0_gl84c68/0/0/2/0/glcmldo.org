The problem is that Harry can't ignore Voldemort if the plot is actually "Harry gets ambitious" instead of "Harry is a drooling moron". If he ignores Voldemort, Voldemort wins and Harry dies. On the other hand, beating Voldemort is the single biggest advantage Harry can get - the reputation and influence he can get by defeating Voldemort will help him more than anything else in defeating Gringotts. So, dealing with Voldemort has to happen if Harry's smart (and using his knowledge of the future). And that means we're back in the same old same old peggy sue territory, with all the shit that entails (adult in a kids body etc.)
