Eh, while the time travel plot has some /very/ annoying falls it also opens up quite a few doors, for example having Harry hate goblins more than he does Voldemort to the point that he just sends Voldy a letter saying that he is busy killing Goblins and won't be able to attend their bi-annual killing matches that year, the Goblins acting quite baffled at the creepy kid who wants them to suffer while knowing a chilling amount about their culture and way of thinking, hell, maybe even a more bloody version of the Lestrange thief performed /even earlier/ and then Harry just baiting them into a war instead of trying to be diplomatic; not to mention that at this point it would seem as if he was even pettier and more spiteful than Snape, Umbridge and Voldemort together for the other characters (it would be perfectly understandable for us readers, but to the characters it would seem as if first year Harry had just taken offense at some random thing and then ran with it to a genocide extreme).

Though the political angle would be really pushing it and those kind of stories generally degenerate into lordly bullshit quite quickly, much rather if he took the Voldemort path of taking his friends to chill killing and torturing his opposition.

It would probably just all boil down to execution, I could see even a WBWL trope going along well if it was well-written and the author were sensible enough to not stuff the story with more plot-lines than we can be expected to keep up with.
