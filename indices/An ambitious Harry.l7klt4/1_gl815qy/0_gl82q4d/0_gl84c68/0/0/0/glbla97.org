The "back in time" part is just BOY, WHY?

You already have a Harry who not only is an ADULT and COMPETENT AND ACCOMPLISHED WIZARD who KNOWS A LOT OF PEOPLE and is a WAR HERO, why do you want do turn him into a "charismatic, hardworking" TEENAGER WHO IS GOING TO SPEND 90% OF HIS TIME IN SCHOOL to plot his political revenge???? And rehash all the plot points of the series. Not to mention "just got out of the slave camp, let's commit some suicide!"

I can't think of ANY reason for that besides the popularity of the peggy sue trope. It basically created this idea in the fandom that is the easiest way to give a character the motivations you want them to have
