I think you're underestimating some aspects of the world-building. When you create the story this is something you'd have to consider, yes? How is this prison/camp set up? Is there a way that they could eventually break him out? What would the consequences of doing so be? Perhaps they TRIED to(or will try to) and there was such horrible consequences that they never tried again for fear of death or injury to friends, family or Harry himself. We have no idea what the protocols are, the guards, where this camp is even located, what is - besides goblins - guarding it? If it's legal they won't have ministry support for a rescue mission. It be a good exploration and I'd certainly be interested in reading something like this to see how the author figures out the details.

I could see this being a very interesting fic depending on how it plays out. Hermione is, as another commentor mentioned, someone who would likely build a fundraiser. I imagine she'd be working towards demolishing the whole slavery ring in itself. While she cares for Harry more than other people, she also cares about ethics and morals and would 100% not be okay with just breaking out Harry and leaving everyone else(even if Ron would be). So....30 years is a long time. I'd make it perhaps less if I wrote the fic. 15 maybe, or even 10...I think the OP underestimates how badly enslavement ruins the mind and the body, and how quickly.
