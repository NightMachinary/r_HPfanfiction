I have read something like this already .. he gets an inheritance test and looses his fortune[s](not sure if it's just Potter or Black too) due to debts and then once he finishes Hogwarts and defeats Tom, he engineers a goblin rebellion with his newfound fame, connections and starts a goblin genocide for what they did to him .. don't remember which fic though, will post the link if I find it.
