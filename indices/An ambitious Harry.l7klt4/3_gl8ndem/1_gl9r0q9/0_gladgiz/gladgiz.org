It can be contrived at times, a comfortable tool for changing a character's motivations and even their personality without having to mess too much with their background in canon.

In the case of this Ambitious Harry, I think it also caused a missed opportunity. OP provided that whole "harry was sent to a goblin slave camp" scenario but concluded it with "and then we would rehash hogwarts, but this time harry would be ambitious". And this doesn't even make sense... who do you think would be more able to make connections, gather favours, work on a political plot and ascend: a capable adult who is a war hero or a literal teenager who is still in school, even if he is "hardworking and charismatic"?
