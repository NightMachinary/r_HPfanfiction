A common one I've seen is Snape dies and wakes up as a kid and decides to make better choices which to me feels like cheating because he knows what choices he should make after reflecting on it for years. To me it's more interesting if Snape just decides on his own to fight for the order from the start. Or better yet he just decides fuck it you assholes can battle it out for as long as you want I'm going to the countryside and making and selling wolfsbane under an alias
