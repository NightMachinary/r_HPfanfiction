yes! this makes more sense.

but tbh it was both the "immeaditely kills himslef" /and/ the "goes back in time" that turned me off. It felt a bit disjointed? Like... an elaborated reason to make Harry hate goblins and then throw him back in first year because he died??? It made it seem like it was two fics smashed into one, the "time travel" being only a bridge between them.

Why not write it as Harry spent his childhood in a Goblin slave camp because of all that debt, so by the time he goes to Hogwarts he is filled with ambition or desire for revenge or destroy the system or whatever?

Or the ambition for becoming Minister of Magic comes during those 30 years in the goblin camp, so he starts working towards his goal after he is freed while he copes with the physichal and mental trauma it left on him? And honestly, it would be more believable an actual adult Harry making advancements in this, getting connections and jobs and such, than a freaking 11-year-old lmao (even if he has the mind of a 47 year old).
