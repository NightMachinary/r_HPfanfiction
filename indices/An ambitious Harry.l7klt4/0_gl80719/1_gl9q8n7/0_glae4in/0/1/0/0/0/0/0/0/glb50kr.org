Nothing happens outside of Harry's POV in the end, everything that Harry didn't stumble across 7 books just didn't happen. Dumbledore's and Snape's plans exist because Rowling writed that he learned about them in book 7. Ron gets up to nothing except what he tells Harry, because Rowling didn't write that he gets up to anything except what he told. Both examples are still parts of Harry's POV. You aren't drawing logical conclusions, since neither Sirius, nor Dumbledore have given any clues that Dumbledore knew who was keeper.
