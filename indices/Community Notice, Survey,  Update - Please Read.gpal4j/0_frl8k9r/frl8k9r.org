Seeing two identical or very similar request threads posted in quick succession is not uncommon and can be annoying, this is true.

HOWEVER:

The fact that this occurs at all means that the people making these threads are not performing even a cursory browse of the sub before they make their post. Therefore I honestly doubt a stickied megathread would prevent it; these individuals will just ignore the megathread and proceed to post their requests as they currently do.

On top of that, I think there's a risk of the cure being worse than the disease here. Yes, "request spam" can be annoying, but at the same time, I don't think this sub should be taking actions to reduce its own vitality and activity levels. Megathreads can stifle discussion quite effectively. The HP fandom is not what it used to be in terms of numbers; we can't afford to be shutting down swathes of good discussion.

And these threads /do/ generate discussion; sometimes two identical requests posted within an hour of each other can lead to very different fic recommendations and fic discussions. It's like that classic [[https://xkcd.com/1053/][xkcd]]: not everyone sees everything all of the time, so one group of people may come across the one thread, another group comes across the other thread, and because different people have seen them, they generate different discussions. This is part of why we have so many pet peeves threads - for all that the sub regulars have trodden that path many times, for other people it's a new discussion.

Personally, I would be much more interested in something being done about the large number of low-effort "prompt" posts which are more crackish "shower thoughts" than genuine prompts or drabbles.
