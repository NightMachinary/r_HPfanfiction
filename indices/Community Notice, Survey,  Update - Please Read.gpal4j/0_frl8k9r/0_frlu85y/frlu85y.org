I would agree with all of this! I'm also wondering if there's a way we can encourage folks to say a little more when they link a fic? What they like about it, why they think it fits OP's request, etc. Posts with a bunch of linkffns and no qualifications for the stories they link tend not to contribute much to discussion in a meaningful way, imo.
