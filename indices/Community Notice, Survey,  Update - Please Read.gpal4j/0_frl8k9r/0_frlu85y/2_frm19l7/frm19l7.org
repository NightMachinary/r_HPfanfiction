I don't disagree, and there are definitely requests where this makes sense, but I also think for some requests, the poster has a number of criteria and we're just throwing out fics that match (because you never know what someone has or hasn't read). I mostly don't want to discourage people from posting linkffns for things that match (I guess personally I'd rather have a bunch of links I can look at and determine what looks good rather than fewer linkffns where people tell me all the reasons they like them - especially as that seems like it may result in mostly seeing widely-known fics being recc'd).
