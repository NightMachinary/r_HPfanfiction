The only real policing of fic request threads we do at this time is to prevent what we call “bashing” comments, or comments that attack the nature of the specific request. This rule was put into place after a user made a request for slash fics, and the comments were full of homophobic comments and not any recommendations that fit the OP's request.

I am leary of policing request threads any more than this as we don't want to become too overbearing. If my explanation doesn't make sense, please let me know!
