It's too early for me to agree and say that the Half-Blood Romantic is good. It's the best new Harry/Fleur fic, not that it has much competition. One thing that this story /did/ do correctly, is reignite some interest in the pairing, for which I applaud the author. I can't wait for Steelbadger's H/F, though.

From your list, I'll recommend older decent Harry/Fleur fics that you haven't read. They're either obscure or don't seem to warrant a read on first glance.

People pointed out some elements, so I'm editing in that this gets very dark. As in people may drop the fic dark. I enjoyed it immensely regardless, but I can definitely see how many readers would be horrified. linkffn(4152930)
