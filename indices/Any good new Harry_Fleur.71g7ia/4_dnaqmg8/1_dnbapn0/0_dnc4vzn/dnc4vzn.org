Jeconais has his style, for better or worse, without much deviation: he reuses the same cliches, sets up largely the same villains, describes a similarly well-meaning-but-flawed Dumbledore, Harry tends to be implausibly effective, etc.

His strength is writing well, and adding some variety within them: Dumbledore ranges from clueless to antagonistic, the cliches are mostly well executed, and at worst his fics tend toward guilty pleasure, at best they're quite good. If you can stomache the cliches, I highly recommend him.
