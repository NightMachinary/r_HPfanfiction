Give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12104688/1/Whispers-in-the-Night][Whispers in the Night]] a read. It has a rather realistic take on the harem fic. Relationships are reasonably deep. It starts off slow, but becomes Harry/Daphne/Susan after a lot of difficulties, then goes on to include Fleur. There is also talk of including Tonks.
