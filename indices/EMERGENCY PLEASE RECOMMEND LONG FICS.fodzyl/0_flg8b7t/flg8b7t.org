1)I think “His Twenty-Eighth Life” by Lomonaaeren fits the bill for what you want. It's 69 chapters and despite hating long stories this was not tedious or dragged out in the least bit. Harry is the Master of Death in this story and keeps on being born again in slightly altered universes. He is powerful and is paired with Voldemort.

2)Had I known by kayly silverstorm has elements of powerful Harry, the abuse and trauma he had to come to terms with after the war, and a development of a strong bond with Snape. While it might not be Severitus the bond they get to develop in 50 chapters is truly worth reading in my opinion.

3)To kill you with a kiss by Paimpont is a beautiful Tomarry story were Harry accidentally time travels back to Tom's time. Unlike most Tomarry fanfics this isn't angsty and Harry isn't dark and brooding.The writing is flowery and bittersweet. It's 29 chapters and well worth your read.

4) Consuming shadows by Child_OTKW is an alternate universe Harrymort fanfic. And although Harry is extremely capable smart and powerful he never looses himself and what he stands for not even for the dark lord. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7040089/chapters/16011331]]

5) Vocare Prabia by Amber Evans Potter is a very well written dimension travel story. Harry has ptsd and is very powerful plus his best friends have traveled with him to support him every step of the way.

6) On a Pale Horse by Hyliian is a very well written master of death Harry potter fanfiction its only 25 chapters though so I don't know if its long enough for you. It includes dimension traveling.

7)October by the Carnivorous Muffin is a Master of death Harry-Potter fanfic it's well written and has probably one of the best depictions of the MOD trope the pairing is both Harry/Tom and Tom/Lily its not a threesome though. Also would recommend her other story Lily and the art of being Sisyphus It's a fem Harry but It nearly fits all your requirements up above and I truly urge you to give it a try. I'll put both of the links below.

8) Teaching History (is Old News) by You Light The Sky it's a Tomarry fic which is cute but also very insightful and interesting. In which Tom is the DADA professor at Hogwarts, secretly recruiting followers for his future army, and Harry is the worst Divination professor ever, accidentally messing up Tom's plans.

9) Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot its a smart Harry for sure but very lighthearted and fun!

10) An Aunt's Love by Emma Lipardi is a story were A strong Harry learns how to deal with the abuse and trauma of being the bwl it's long and well written.

I hope this is enough for you and that you'll find something you might enjoy.

My last recommendation which I didn't include in the list is What He Grows To Be by Severus_divides_into_H it's an amazing Master of death fic with Harry raising Tom. Although Harry isn't dark Tom definitely is and it's beautifully written. It's actually one of my favorite fics of all time. I hope you give it a chance.
