The relationship is not the forefront of the story and its not that heavy but definitely its an interesting pairing. I don't want to spoil much but I feel like Tom loves Harry so much that it also influences his love for Lily. But the love is definitely genuine for the both of them. Definitely not an OTP for me but still it's so well written that I like it. Though I might be biased here because my favorite pairing will always be Tom and Harry. I know the Tom/Lily part may deter you but it fits really seamlessly in the story so please don't let that stop you from trying the story because the characterization of Harry as MOD in the story is the best depiction I've read hands down. Plus Tom and Lily's relationship aspect doesn't come up for a long time in the story.

Also sorry for rambling but if you have time please try Lily and the art of sisyphus too. I usually despise Fem Harry writings but this is so unique that it's really really worth reading. I guarantee you that it's nothing like you've ever tried with Lovecraftian, absurd, but also poignant and poetic elements.
