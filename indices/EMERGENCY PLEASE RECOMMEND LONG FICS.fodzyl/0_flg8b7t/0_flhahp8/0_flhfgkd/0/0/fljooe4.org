Oh okay! Thanks for telling me that and I will definitely give both October and the art of sisyphus a try! I've seen both of them hovering around (isn't lily a pokemon trainer in the art of sisyphus?? Idk my brain is weird) and now I've got clarification I'll definitely try them!

I've also just finished into the pale and oh my god aaah it was hands down adorable. A shame it wasn't finished :(
