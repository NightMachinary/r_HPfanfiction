You're actually not wrong about that. The author made a lot of spinoff crossovers with Lily and the art of sisyphus including naruto and pokemon but Lily and the art of sisyphus itself is purely about the master of death and what it might entail. It draws a lot of influence from authors like Philip.K.Dick and Camus. Also it really is a shame that on a pale horse wasn't updated I really liked that story too. Thank you btw for being open minded and commenting back I really appreciated that. (:
