The Fallout.

300k+ word deep dive into what war is and how people cope with it. Dramoine, which I usually don't like, but this isn't really a romance. It's a tale of Hermione and Draco trying to survive a particularly brutal wizarding war and everything that comes with it. Author really uses Rowling's magic system in a way that we've always wanted. COMPLETE!!! i loved it so much I saved it as an ePub, and I NEVER do that. I really cannot recommend it enough.

I'm on mobile, so I'll go ahead and copy the link here and then reply with anything else I see in my bookmarks. Are you in to ASOIAF? Most of my saved fics are in that fandom.
