My all-time favorite Drarry. Will read it a million times. Harry gets a chance to live a few weeks of the alternate life he would have had if he'd tried to befriend Draco back at Hogwarts. Starts as the Potters are on their way to the train station, as in the canon epilogue--and then things change drastically. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879852]])

I love everything Saras_Girl writes.
