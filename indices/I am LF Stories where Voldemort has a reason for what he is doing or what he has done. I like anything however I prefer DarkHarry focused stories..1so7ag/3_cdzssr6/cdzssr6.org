I haven't found anything like that yet, though HPMOR /maybe/ hints at an explanation of Riddle's motivations in the future.

I'm working on a story, dark AU, AMBIGUOUS?HARRY, that tries to go into Voldemort's motivations and madness. It also has a large focus on Beedle the Bard lore, which doesn't get much play in fic, and it goes into the technical aspects of Horcrux creation and /why/ it's such dark magic, which also doesn't get discussed much. That kind of relates to your other post here too.

It's still in alpha, but I have about 350 pages done. PM me if you're interested in reading a first draft. Though, even if that doesn't interest you, I'd still like to hear some of your thoughts and interests, since you sound like the kind of person I'm writing this story for.
