Well if that's the case, I'm sure you've already read the one I was thinking of: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today][Death of Today]] by Epic Solemnity.

I'm sure I've read others, but for the life of me I can't think of any more. I've gone through my many, many bookmarks with no luck. I'll keep looking, but I'm sorry in advance if I can't find any more :(
