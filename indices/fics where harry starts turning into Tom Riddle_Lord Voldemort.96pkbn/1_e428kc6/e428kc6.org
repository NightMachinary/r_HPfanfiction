Here we go:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): probably the most amiable version of the Scarcrux I've ever encountered, definitely changes Harry

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux; Harry Potter and the Chrysalis): I'm guessing this one was what prompted the request, a long form Harry influenced by Voldemort story.

linkffn(What Lies Beneath): this one is slightly different (spoiler), but the horcrux(es) are definitely influential on him.

linkffn(Abraxas): Tom and Harry talk after hearing the prophecy, and while the Horcrux doesn't like him, he is still Voldemort and wants to survive this battle. So the two fuse souls, and Harry begins to think very differently (or at all, depending on your perspective).

linkffn(The Merging): I'm not sure I would really recommend this fic, but that happens literally at the very beginning of this story.
