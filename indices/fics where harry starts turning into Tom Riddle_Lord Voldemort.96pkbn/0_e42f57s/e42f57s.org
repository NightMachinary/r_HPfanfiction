[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11687216/1/The-Carriage-Held][The Carriage Held]] is a good example. Told from Snape's perspective, the story starts in fifth year. No one realizes what has happened to Harry until it is too late. This fic is a slow burn of psychological horror as Harry subtly twists the people around him into mockeries of what they could have been. linkffn(11687216)
