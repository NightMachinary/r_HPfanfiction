Cliched characters are easier to write and understand than the relatively complex characters we were given by JKR. The majority of FFic writers are usually young and/or not experienced enough in writing to capture the complex characters, and accidentally or intentionally end up turning them into flanderised caricatures.

Creating too-good perfect characters makes for a boring mary-sue-fest (although sue stories have an audience too, usually from readers seeking wish fulfillment), and almost no author sets out to do that.

On the other hand, making someone into a too-evil LITERALLY HITLER villain makes for a story that has more conflict, and conflict, however superficial, usually improves a story.

It also doesn't help that people love to feel morally superior. When the target of the bashing 'gets what's coming to him/her', there is a certain vengeful satisfaction. The good guys have won again, etc. etc.

*TL;DR Bash stories are easier to write, and everybody loves a justice-jerk.*
