(1) The character gets in the way of the writer's preferred ship and they feel that villainizing them is the only way to shoehorn them out of the picture. (Particularly common with Ron and/or Ginny when writing Harry/Hermione.) Alternately, the writer is attempting to create relationship drama and is only capable of doing so by turning someone into an arsehole.

(2) The writer simply doesn't like the character in question.
