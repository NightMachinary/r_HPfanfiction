I agree with the other posters, but I would add one point. I think part of it is related to how long people waited between books. It gave us enough time to come up with elaborate fan theories and a lot of people got really attached to what they had predicted. When the books didn't comply with what they wanted, I think a lot of people became a bit angry, and I would say irrationally so. Resulting in over the top bashing.
