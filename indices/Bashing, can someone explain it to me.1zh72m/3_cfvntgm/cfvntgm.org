What I can add here is that I've seen this in every fanfiction community I've read in. That's not too many, granted, but it's about half a dozen or so (counting HP). So it's pretty common, really. I suspect in HP people have read so much they're aware of it, even when they're doing it, so they label it in advance (at least, I've seen some folks do that, which is a nice sign at the beginning that I can just skip this and find something else).
