Yeah I'm at this same point right now.

I can't quite put my finger on it -- I mean, it's really well written, and the story well thought out, but there's something that's really wrong with the way Harry acts throughout. One moment, he considers Bellatrix his team mate, and is game enough to get information from her, but then he's not​ going to tell her what the plan is?

I mean, the author(s) have made it quite clear that he's from a relatively normal canon setting (without the Horcruxes, of course) and that means that Harry should have good leadership skills. Even if it's not canon, the author keeps alluding to others considering Harry to be their leader quite often, but that hardly reflects the way in which he treats Bellatrix. I mean, given their (Bella's and Harry's) past relationship, maybe Harry finds it hard to come to terms with the old and new Bellatrix. And that's fine, really. But it's just that the author has no issues writing Harry fancying Bellatrix, but then immediately makes him close up when he has to divulge something that affects /his/ side of the war.

Then there's the problem with Dumbledore and Moody. Moody is an Auror -- a very paranoid one -- and Dumbledore a headmaster. Sure, they might be friends, and they might share a drink or two, but all I've seen them do in the first 25% of the story is just talk about Harry Ashworth every time they meet. If they're so paranoid about him, Moody as an Auror has every right to ask his department to investigate Ashworth. Is it really so hard to file a few papers of let his boss know of his suspicions? Why does Moody have to consort with a headmaster -- even if he happens to be a Chief Warlock -- about a shady individual?

Then there's the way Harry always forgets to close the doors when he's speaking to Bellatrix, or when he first duelled her. One might assume that being in a war where they were on the losing side and any mistake could be fatal would make them that much more careful about their public image -- you'd make a conscious effort to make sure that you weren't seen consorting with people to would put you in a precarious position; you'd make sure that you'd think first before acting, even if you've acted first before thinking all your life (after all, being on the losing side of war is no easy thing -- you'd have to constantly keep out-witting the other side to ensure your survival); and you'd have better grip on your surroundings owing to constant danger and backstabbing on the battle field -- but despite these, Harry Ashworth still acts totally like a 11 year old, showing none of the hardened battle experience he has up his arsenal. He's only been here in the new dimension a short while after all, and that's hardly enough time​ for him to forget all about being in constant danger on the battle field.

Some might call Delenda Est brilliantly written -- and it is, don't get me wrong -- but I honestly believe it's just not worth the praise it​ deserves because of sloppy story execution. I'm about 25% into it, and for me, it reads as though everything is going in Harry's way quite easily. He gets a job at Hogwarts, and that's the time Voldemort starts his recruitment drive? LOL that's just too much of a coincidence. The author(s) seem to be happy enough to let everything fall into place just because Ashworth is now in town, and that's honestly a big put off for me.
