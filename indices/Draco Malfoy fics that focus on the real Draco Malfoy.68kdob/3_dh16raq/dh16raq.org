This is very long, but it has a sympathetic Draco who starts off very canon but sort of evolves into an interesting side character. Warning: Its basically a year 4 rewrite stretched into like 5 books worth of text, that focuses heavily on the politics. Heck, the GOF doesn't even kick in til almost half way. But still, I kinda like it. linkffn(8045114)
