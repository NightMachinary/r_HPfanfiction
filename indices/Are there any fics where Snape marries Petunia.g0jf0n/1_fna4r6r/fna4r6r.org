There is the story “[[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/terms-of-matrimony.html][Terms of Matrimony by Galad Estel]]” (links point to my review on my blog, where I refer to the means how to get the story, it was taken down from FFnet). I really liked its premise, but its end feels kind of fake: like the author wanted to finish it by any means and rushed the job horribly. However, it is certainly worthy of reading.
