Yes. I'll have to search a bit for it, but there's one where Petunia goes to Snape when Harry and Dudley are young. (Either Vernon died or he beat her; I've read stories with both so not sure which one.) At first it's a marriage of convenience but they come to like each other.

ETA: Found the one I was thinking of: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12712205][Petunia Takes a Stand]] by slytherinsal. In the course of my search, I found [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4923158][3 Slytherin Marauders]] by severusphoenix, which may also fit the bill for you.
