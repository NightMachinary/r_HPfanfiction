If one goes with evil or just Canon Snape and Petunia; Harry would hate him with a passion.\\
Canon Harry had a pretty strong spine and lots of humility. This Harry would probably be a lot more timid than that as I can't see Snape tolerating any opposition. He would be more timid and shy than Neville in his earlier years. He would not like Hogwarts if Snape actually is a teacher there and it would not matter to him if Snape is against Voldemort; he would hate him. Merlin I can only imagine Remus' reaction when he sees Snape (or Petunia) as Harry's boggart. Remus and Sirius are probably going to murder Snape and Petunia.
