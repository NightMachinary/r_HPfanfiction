I think Lomonaaeren has several good Slytherin!Harry fics; one that I just read the other day (which is why it comes to mind) is Other People's Choices: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8835628/chapters/20258512]]

In it, Harry gets resorted Slytherin by the Sorting Hat during the Chamber of Secrets climax; while he definitely becomes more Slytherin, I don't think he becomes rude/entitled/dark.
