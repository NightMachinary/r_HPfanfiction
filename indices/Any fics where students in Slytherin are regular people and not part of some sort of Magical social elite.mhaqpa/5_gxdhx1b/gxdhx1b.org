[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3736151/1/Better-Be-Slytherin][Better be Slytherin]] this is only first year and is Severitus but not the whole “Harry is a poor defenceless baby who Snape will protect”. Snape and Harry don't get off on the right foot but after Harry had a breakdown during Quiditch(Sp?) Flint confronts Snape. The first years are all just 11 year olds and not mini adults. Which is nice. Harry is mostly friends Theodore Nott and Millicent.

Slight trigger warning: there is some sexual harassment from an older Slytherin and rape threats from him. He is expelled though.
