Most of these have Harry in Slytherin, because I'm not sure if the other ones I like where he's not a Slytherin have enough Slytherin content to recommend, if that makes sense.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly][Tread Softly]] was mah fave back in the day. In an ultimate battle, Harry is sent back in time to the Marauders era. He is put into Slytherin. Hilarity does NOT ensue. It is complete and has a sequel
- This isn't Harry-centric. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342][The Changeling]]: Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. It is complete.
- One of my favorite one-shots is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4330836][the heir of something or other]] wherein Harry doesn't request to be placed in Gryffindor and goes into Slytherin. Harry does not immediately fall in with everyone else. Snape still hates him. All the one-shots in this series are great, but this is the most Slytherin-focused.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820][Blood Crest]] is a new fic that is being updated pretty regularly. The author has published 53 chapters in the past year. Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. I'd classify it as a dark comedy of sorts.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/chapters/36417831][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] is an extremely imaginative AU that is updated pretty frequently. I enjoyed this so much I read the author's crossover with Naruto. I don't even watch anime. This was also one of my gateways into the Harry has a Horcrux in his head that talks.
- Speaking of Harry chatting with his head horcrux, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/chapters/45935500][The Devil You Know]] is super fun. It is a dark comedy wherein Harry's Head Horcrux wakes up and gives him some truly interesting life advice. WIP
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1471166][HEX]] is a series that takes place in an AU. I can't quite catch where the point of deviation is, but it's just too fun to matter. It's more of a series of character studies than super plotty and it's very much coming of age. Definitely recommend this one.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/392764][The Pure and Simple Truth]] is post-Hogwarts, but deals a lot with the relationships between Griffs and Slytherins. Everyone acts like a real human, not an edge lord.

Happy reading!
