Probably the only long one, that I can think of is the Pureblood Pretence series linkffn(7613196). There is romance in it, but not the main character, and I think I remember and A/N at some point saying that it would probably stay that way, because she in character has far too much on her plate to consider romance even if she isn't outright asexual.
