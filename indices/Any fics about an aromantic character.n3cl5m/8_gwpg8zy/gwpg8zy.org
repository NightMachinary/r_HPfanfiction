I like “[[https://www.wattpad.com/37216658-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation/][Dursley's Daughter]]” by writerer, which is kind of polar opposite of most other stories: there is no violence, not much romance (and not with the main character), just an afternoon TV series of the life at high school. I don't like those, but this story (and its sequel) is rather nice.
