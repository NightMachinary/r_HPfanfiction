They're all by the same author, Tiro, and it is a four part story. You /could/ stop after pt. 1, 2, 3, or 4, and not read anymore, but they do need to be read in order. Well, actually, you could read /The/ before /Birth of a/ and it'll be fine, just read those two before three and four. Harry is the main character. It starts similar to typical dumbledore bashing whatever, but it isn't really like that, which can be seen if you're not completely blind. Dumbledore and Ron and Hermione, mean well, really, but well... Harry is... Not A Good Person. Er- evil, genocidal Harry who murders people for literally no reason, though he chills a bit eventually, but just a bit. Has +followers+, /servants,/ who he kinda sorta /made/, but also, they have a few issues, but also, murder. Harry is aromantic however, and asexual too. Well, at least he is never in a relationship. He occasionally teases Slytherin (read to find out) about having a crush on him, but Harry never actually has any romantic feelings towards people. Hope this helps.
