Hated You From Hello

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18501823/chapters/43844539]]

This is the best fanfiction that I have /ever/ read and coming from someone who practicaly lives of fanfiction, that is quite impressive. It is a crossover between FFXV and Harry Potter but no prior knowlage for Final Fantacy needed. It sounds bad but /please/, give it a read.

Also Harry has snake called Clementine who just realy makes the whole thing.
