In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12357124/1/Rising-From-The-Shadows][Rising From The Shadows]] (the second book of the Harry of El series), Harry gets a large pet snake called SssSthss. Two books later, Hagrid borrows her for some of his lessons, much to the terror of the visiting Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students.

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23702959/chapters/56911591][That Universe Over There]], Harry gets transported diagonally back in time and encounters his young alternate, Ivy, whom he promptly assumes guardianship of. Ivy gets a pet snake which she takes to Hogwarts with her which proves useful in dealing with the Troll, amongst other things.
