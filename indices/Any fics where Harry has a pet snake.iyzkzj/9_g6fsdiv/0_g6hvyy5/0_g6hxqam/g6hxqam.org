Young Harry's only friends are the small snakes from the garden. Upset over Harry's treatment these snakes go out to learn how to create a basalisk. Harry listens to them and now has the responsibility of caring for her. Harry becomes heavily interested in magical creatures, snakes specifically, and slowly delves more into magizoology.

I do recommend the story and it is unique and decently written. It also seems to picking up in plot now
