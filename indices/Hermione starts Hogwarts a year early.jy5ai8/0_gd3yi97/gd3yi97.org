We need more fics with this premise. It's an elegant way to decouple Hermione from Harry and Ron and let her have her own adventures, and she could probably benefit from skipping a grade, since she is quite mature and disciplined for her age.

I know of two that are readable, both quite flawed:

- linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11568740/1/Brilliant-Magic):]] a slow-burn reverse-harem Slytherin!Hermione romance with the Gryffindor!Weasley twins. This is, unfortunately, one of those romance-focused fics in which the author isn't really paying attention to character interactions or plot outside of the main 'ship, and everything is driven by the need to create angst and drama. This results in not a small amount of Slytherin Persecution Complex and things like Draco bullying Hermione despite them being in different years---and actually winning a duel against her, even though she's been fighting off older students for years.

- There is a fic, that I can't find, in which Hermione ends up in Ravenclaw and is friends with Cho Chang and others. I recall being disappointed when one of the first scenes had a gaggle of Ravenclaw girls, including Hermione, running into Harry on Hogwarts Express during his 1st trip there and start teaching him spells, which he insta-learns, and that tell you who the fic is really about.
