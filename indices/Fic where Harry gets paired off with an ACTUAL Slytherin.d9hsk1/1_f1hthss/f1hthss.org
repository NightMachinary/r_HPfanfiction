[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7037925/1/Living-Dangerously][Living Dangerously]] and it's sequel [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13341726/1/Living-in-Secret][Living in Secret]] have a Daphne that's similar to that. In those she is portrayed as the daughter of a Death Eater who wants nothing to do with the war, but her pureblood-bias beliefs and cowardly nature eventually has her siding with the dark. Though when she joins the Death Eaters it's technically through peer pressure and you're meant to feel bad for her, she's also not a completely innocent of a person either. It's Haphne and only half way through the second story, I think it's designed as a slow-burn trilogy.. Think of it as a casual old-fashion racist being forced into an extremist KKK society kinda story.
