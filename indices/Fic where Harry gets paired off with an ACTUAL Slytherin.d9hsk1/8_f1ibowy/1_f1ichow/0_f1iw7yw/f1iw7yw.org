Although [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer is an *excellent* story, and the OC is a demon and does have Slytherin traits, I don't think thats what the OP was looking for.

That said, all of you, especially the OP, if you have not read this story, should.
