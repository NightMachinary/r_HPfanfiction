Weird choice of a website, but looks good so far: Premise is interesting, and the writing style is acceptable/quite good.

Thanks

Edit: Meh, turned out rather slow and one of those fics where Harry gets 'rescued' from the Dursleys and a lot of problems get fixed (by her parents D:) before the next school year even starts. I really hate those fics where a lot of problems get solved by things that make sense but do nothing in terms of plot, tension, or reader satisfaction.

Also, Pansy is a little bit of a Mary Sue (and way too nice). I definitely dislike her turning out to be flawless and beautiful. I think the reason behind her hiding her beauty is rather stupid, and getting rid of the 'pug-faced' look somehow robs her of her most defining feature. Flaws are often times more interesting than beauty and perfection.
