Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is my favourite Haphne and frankly my favourite romance-oriented fic period. Daphne is an unapologetic aristocrat, and blood purist, and her politics don't magically change just because she starts dating Harry. She feels like an actual person who exists, not just a prize to be tamed and won.
