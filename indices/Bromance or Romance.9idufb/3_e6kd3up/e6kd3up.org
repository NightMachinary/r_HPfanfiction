If Bromance means actual deep friendship and not just jerking and trolling around, I am all for it, but this is truly rare. I can not recall reading any fic that included something like that. Some books come to my mind though.

I love well written romances and I kind of started reading fanfiction, because of my need for more romance. So yeah, I like both.
