  If Bromance means actual deep friendship and not just jerking and trolling around, I am all for it

There is more to the relationship between Sirius and Harry than them just getting up to ridiculous hijinks. The story goes a bit into the deep trust between them, both in battle and out of it. They also get some deeper bonding moments in chapter 27.

*shrug* If that doesn't count as a well written bromance then I don't know what would fit your criteria. Perhaps you could provide some examples of what you mean?
