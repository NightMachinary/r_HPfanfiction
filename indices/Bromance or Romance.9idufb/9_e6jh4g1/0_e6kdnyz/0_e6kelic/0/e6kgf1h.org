Fair enough. Teenagers have crushes and some of them have sex. Yes. /That doesn't mean romance/. Being a normally-formed human I had crushes in school, but no big romance, and most of my friends were this way.

Also, Lockhart... fine, but I really dislike any notion that Pettigrew was a creep. I find his character much more entertaining if he was just so disillusioned and paranoid and desperate that he just turned into a rat and did his best effort to remain a rat forever, giving as little thought to his human life as possible, until he thought once more that there was a threat to his life.
