If you cover the later (4-7) years, it's not about kids. It's about teenagers, who undoubtedly have crushes and explore sexuality. Even canon Harry wasn't exempt from that, and Rowling heavily censored her works because she was writing children literature (stuff like the darker implications of Lockhart or Pettigrew when it comes to girls). Fanfics do not have the same restrictions, if you want an accurate depiction of teenagers, you can simply rate it M (16+), which allows you to include everything short of smut and explicit gore.
