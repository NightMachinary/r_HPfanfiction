It really depends on what kind of story we are talking about. Especially longer stories covering multiple years feel empty without some romantic subplot. That being said, the two aren't exactly exclusive. For example, Harry can have a romance with Ginny while Hermione is his wingman and runs interferences so they can get some quality time. Can you imagine the hilarity of a How I met your mother -esque story where Harry and Ginny become Marshall and Lily while Hermione snaps after the war and becomes Barney, trying ridiculous stuff like the perfect month (a different woman each day) or telling everyone to suit up.
