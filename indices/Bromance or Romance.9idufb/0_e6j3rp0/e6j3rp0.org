Great romances are extremely rare, great bromances are even more so. I'll take a pisstake of a fic that just features Harry and Ron trolling Hermione for fifteen chapters over the most emotional, well-crafted, lovely romance that's ever been put to words.

That said, Harry and Ron are great, but we need to diversify the bromance category my dudes. Sure we've got a couple of oneshots where Harry and Cormac find they're soulmates, but that's about it. What about Ron and Viktor Krum broing it through the world of professional Quidditch? Or like, Neville, Dean, and Seamus forming into a lad culture version of the golden trio. Or Harry and Hermione being platonic life partners because I've read Allure Immune Harry and I /need/ more of that dynamic in my life.
