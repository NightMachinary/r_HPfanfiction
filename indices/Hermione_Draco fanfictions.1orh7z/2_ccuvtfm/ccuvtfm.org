Unfortunately, you might need to get a bit more specific. Like, do yoh want comedy or tragedy? Do you want it to take place during or aftee the war? There are TONS of Dramione fics, some great, others terrible.

So maybe throw in a few more requirements?\\
I will suggest one though: Merry Christmas Mr. Malfoy, by Emerald-Kisses. It's on fanfiction.net. It's complete, has comedy and fluff.

AnneM.Oliver (same site) is good, too, but I find some of her work feels repetitve to I stopped reading her stuff a while ago.

Those are the first two suggestions off of the top of my head. I would provide links but I'm on my phone.

Good luck in your search! :)
