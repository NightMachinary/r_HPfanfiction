Alright, lets do this.

"You heard me Granger, I'm going to give you a makeover that will make every man want you,and make Weasley die of regret. You will be simply irresistible."

/Ron cheats on Hermione with Draco's girlfriend, they decide to get revenge by pretending to date each other/

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2064124/1/Parenting-Class][Parenting Class]] - Complete DHr & HG Sixth years at Hogwarts are now required to take a parenting class, what fun! Hermione, Draco, and Harry are paired up in which they'll trade off being children. Can they live through the class or will being a parent prove too hard?

/More humour in this fic. Pretty easy read/

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5458618/1/A_Marriage_Most_Convenient][A Marriage Most Convenient]] - Hermione lost it all when she divorced. Draco would lose it all by age 30 if he didn't marry. Marriage to each other would be perfect, one would even say it was most convenient. Her daughter even looked like him, although, he wondered why that was.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3888635/1/An_Unlikely_Pair][An Unlikely Pair]] - They were an unlikely pair. He knew it, so did she. Everyone did. It didn't matter,they were merely friends, hardly even that. There was certainly no affection, no romance. Just friendship. Neither wanted more. Honestly. Well, maybe. Nominated fiction.

Also, [[http://dramioneficlists.tumblr.com/post/21297758960/dramione-fics-listed-by-genre][this website]] is pretty good at sorting out the fics by genre/side pairings/themes/etc. It's pretty good for when you're not sure what to read :)
