Hmm... I checked out the parenting class one because the premise sounded kind of fun, but less than a chapter in I'm questioning why it has SO MANY reviews when it's just rather poorly written...

EDIT: I went with it, and it's oddly compelling despite the writing - it is admittedly fun to see Draco, Hermione and Harry as kids in turn with the other two taking care of them.
