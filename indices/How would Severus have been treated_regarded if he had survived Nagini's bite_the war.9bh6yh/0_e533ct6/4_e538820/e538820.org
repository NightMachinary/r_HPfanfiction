Snape was a hero. Simple as that.

For years, he played spy, putting his life in the gravest danger. He asked for nothing in return. He was returning a debt -- but it wasn't a debt to anyone, it was a debt to himself.

As for the Eater Eater angle: he was a kid in a bad situation with a bad group of friends. He followed them down a dark path. In the eyes of everyone, he was rehabilitated.

And regarding the children: Snape willingly put himself up against a homicidal megalomaniac that would torture him mad and feed him to a snake. He didn't have to. Comparing that to "He made Hermione cry", and "But think of poor Neville," well boohoo. Poor Neville took it well. In fact, he grew up and slashed a snake's head off. Not bad for pedagogy.

Ok, I was facetious in that last sentence. But there is this erroneous thought in the fandom that Snape was a bad teacher. And -- in parts -- that's true. But, first of all, remember that Harry is not the most reliable of narrators. Second, think about this: if you have a problem with a teacher, what do you do? You contact the administration. If Snape was /that/ terrible, there should have been dozens of parents clamoring for Snape's removal. Were there? No. And besides, if he actually was a detriment to the school and the student body the Headmaster should have removed him from the position. Did he? No.

So there you go.

Snape would have been a hero.

Edit: Oh, and I just wanted to add that he probably saved a bunch of students during Voldemort's reign in Hogwarts, but that's speculation.
