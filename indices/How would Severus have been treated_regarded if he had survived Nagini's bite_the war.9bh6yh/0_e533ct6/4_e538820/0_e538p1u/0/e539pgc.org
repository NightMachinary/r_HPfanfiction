Those are good points. I disagree.

First, the claim that he was safer as a spy holds no ground. Voldemort was powerful. Voldemort could read minds. One slip up from Snape and he would have been Nagini's lunch, right after several weeks of insane torture. I'm not sure how that is in any way safer to the alternative.

Regarding Lily: that's true, he asked her to be spared, but I was actually referring to his actions /after/ her death. After she died, he had no obligations. He didn't /have/ to protect Harry. He could just leave. Run away. Be free and live his life. He didn't. He stayed.

Now, about bad childhoods: plenty of people with them become good after assistance/help/rehabilitation. We have a social support network that -- flawed as it is -- which is aimed at getting people on the right track. Snape had nothing. He got by on his strengths and the only people in school that we know accepted him were the young pureblood death eaters. The forces of "good", so to say, bullied him mercilessly -- and almost managed to murder him, too.

Finally, the original question was how he'd be viewed by the public at large. You brought up his competency as a teacher to answer that. I'm merely pointing out that a large percentage of the student body didn't seem to actually have that huge of a problem with him, otherwise, yeah, he'd be gone. The fact that you bring up Malfoy just proves my point. The Malfoys supported him, he was obviously good to Draco. And to, probably, many others, who'd continue to see him...not very negatively in the aftermath of the war.
