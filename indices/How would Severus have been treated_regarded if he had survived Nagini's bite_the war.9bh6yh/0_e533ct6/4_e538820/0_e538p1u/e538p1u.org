  For years, he played spy
#+end_quote

Both sides knew he was a spy. Voldemort thought Snape belonged to him, Dumbeldore knew Snape belonged to him. So long as both sides thought he was there he was safe. He was safer than normal members of the Order who Vodemort's lot would have actively tried to do away with.

  He asked for nothing in return.

Lies. he asked for Lily's life to be spared. He asked for help to clear up his mess.

  he was a kid in a bad situation with a bad group of friends.
#+end_quote

Harry was a kid in a bad situation. He didn't develop a fascination with dark magic. Snape knew what he was doing was wrong and did it anyway. Lily called him out on it, why was it different to call her a mudblood when he'd do it to others. He knew what he was doing. He didn't have an easy childhood but that's no excuse. Plenty of people have become good people after rough childhoods. I think its disgraceful that you are so willing to shift the blame. It massively undermines the hard work put in by good people from good backgrounds. A perosn who had a happy childhood's work for charity is still a good thing. They didn't have to do it, they choose to and they should be respected for that.

  You contact the administration
#+end_quote

You what? You contact Malfoy on the board of Governors, a known friend of Snape? You contact Dumbledore, the one who kept Snape out of prison. Snape had to work at Hogwarts, Dumbledore was the one protecting him. He was protected in the same way the Trewlawney was. He couldn't leave.

  Headmaster should have removed him from the position. Did he? No.
#+end_quote

see above. Dumbledore wanted Snape at the school for other reasons. There was no getting rid of him.
