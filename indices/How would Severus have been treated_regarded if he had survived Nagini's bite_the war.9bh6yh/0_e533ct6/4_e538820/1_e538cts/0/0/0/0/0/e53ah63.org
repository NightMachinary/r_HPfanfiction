It's possible, but that's speculation. Remember, Lockhart isn't stupid. He knows how to deceive people, he's been doing it for years. So in OWL and NEWT classes, where the stakes are much higher and it's more possible for his lack of knowledge to be discovered, it's just as likely that he didn't try any risky endeavors, and just had them copying notes out of a textbook and practicing with each other.
