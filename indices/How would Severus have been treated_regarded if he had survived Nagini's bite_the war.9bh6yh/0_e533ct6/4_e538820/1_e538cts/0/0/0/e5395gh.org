Lockhart was /perceived/ as competent, though. This was based on his fame and popularity. Over time, it would have eroded, however. In fact, he probably would have been removed soon; the incompetency wouldn't stand, no matter how many books he'd written. The faculty was already fed up with him.

Quirrel...I'm not sure why you're stating he was a bad teacher, or had to be perceived as such. I don't think canon supports that, although I could be wrong.

And Umbridge was a whole different issue altogether.

So, really, the argument stands. If Snape had been truly horrible to a large percentage of the students body -- not a select few -- Dumbledore would have been forced to call for his removal.
