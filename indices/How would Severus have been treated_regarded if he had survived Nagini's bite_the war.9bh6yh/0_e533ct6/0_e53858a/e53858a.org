I disagree with your analysis, simply because the public would never have all that information that we have from the books and no-one would tell them.

Harry would do his best to portray Snape as a hero and ask for favours in the Ministry. Propaganda works (and the wizarding public isn't critical/savvy in the least)! There'd be lots of articles about how Snape tried to protect children in his year as headmaster, lots of talk about how he was a spy for Dumbledore all along and had to keep up appearances and how he has a golden heart under the creepy exterior. Add to that a press photo of Snape and Harry shaking hands or whatever and he'll be totally redeemed.

It's important to tie a neat bow around a conflict like this in the end. Everyone in the higher ups will be in support of this. Giving any appearance of "greyness" and outstanding issues is completely out of the question.
