What do you mean "use" government propaganda. Harry isn't in the government at this point. He's just going to give interviews, praise Snape to high heavens and demand loudly to show leniency for what Snape might have had to do in his life. That's already propaganda, the government is going to make use of it and roll with the narrative if they aren't retarded (big ask for Magical Britain).
