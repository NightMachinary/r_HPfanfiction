I think dying was best for him. Harry, thanks to the protection he received from his mother and Dumbledore's views on love means Harry has a warped view on love. Voldemort was evil and irredeemable because he was incapable of feeling love supposedly. Therefore love means there is the potential for good. Harry has such a warped view on love that he thought Snape's creepy obsession with his mother meant Snape wasn't evil and instead had good inside him. That's not to say Snape didn't do good things for Harry but it doesn't make him a good person. The rest of the world wouldn't buy that.

To the rest of the world Snape is a petty horrible man. Anyone who had gone through Hogwarts with him as a teacher would have bad memories of the man. Remember, Snape didn't originally stop being a Death Eater because he thought being a Death Eater was bad, he went to Dumbledore because he put Lily as one of the Dark Lord's primary targets. He didn't so much pledge himself to doing good as hedge his bets. He asked Voldemort to spare her but didn't give a shit about James or Harry. If Lily had stepped aside and lived I don't think Snape cares about Dumbledore's lot too much. If it comes out that Snape was a Death Eater who's only redeeming feature was a creepy obsession with Harry's mum, then they don't see how that makes him a good person. He was a Death Eater and now a borderline stalker of a Death Eater. Snape wasn't a good person. An interesting character for sure but he was a dick of the highest order. Never forget that Neville suffered as much, if not more than Harry. Even if you could justify Snape's cruelty to Harry, which I can't, its impossible to justify it to Neville. If it happened to Neville it could easily have happened to other people. He brought Hermione to tears over her front teeth in fourth year in front of everyone. Him being a Death Eater wouldn't surprise anyone. People were tortured at Hogwarts while he was Headmaster, good luck telling the parents he was a good person.

I honestly think Darth Vader has a better chance at being a war hero after killing the Emperor for his son than Snape, and I think the chance for that is somewhere between remote and non-existent.

Edit: I want to add a bit more on why I think Dumbledore has warped views on love. The man was a great wizard, arguably a great man. I'd call him so. I would never say however, that he had the experience to talk about love. After his mother's death Dumbledore had to care for his sister, Aberforth suggests he wasn't happy with that. Dumbledore didn't love his sister until after she died. He didn't love his sister, he loved her memory. No matter what you think of his relationship with Grindelwald no matter how platonic you think it was, you can probably agree calling it dysfunctional would be an understatement. The person who understood him best either killed his sister, caused him to kill his sister or caused his brother to kill their sister. Then he became a Dark Lord who Dumbledore himself had to stop. From what we see in Canon Dumbledore is alone. He has always been alone. He speaks of love but he loves the idea of love but has no idea what it truly is. He can see its power, he is willing to believe in its power but he himself doesn't understand it. He shared his love of the idea of love with Harry but neither of them really knew what it was.
