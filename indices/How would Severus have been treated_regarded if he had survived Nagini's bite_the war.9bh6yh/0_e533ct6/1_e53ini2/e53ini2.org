I disagree that Dumbledore doesn't understand love. Firstly, I think that he did love his sister - but he was a promising eighteen year old that seemingly had to put his dreams away to care for her. As someone that's been in that situation, I can tell you that the love is there - and so is the resentment. Both are present - the presence of the latter does not mean the absence of the former.

We honestly don't know what Dumbledore's relationship with Grindelwald was. It might have been closer to unrequited love than any actual relationship.

But finally, about Dumbledore always being alone - that's a false equivalency there. Just because someone is alone doesn't mean they don't know or experience love. It suggests that to be loved requires you to around people, but that's not true. I can be loved even if I live alone and mostly do my own thing. It also tends to place more unwarranted importance on romantic love.
