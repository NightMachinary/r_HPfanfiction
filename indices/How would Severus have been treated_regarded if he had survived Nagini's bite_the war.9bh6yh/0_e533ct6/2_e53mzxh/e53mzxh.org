the only way people are going to know vader killed palpatine is because of luke's testimony...which is the exact same position snape is in. we know harry hails him as a hero, we know he got his portrait fixed at hogwarts, we know harry took efforts to clear his name. i wouldn't be surprised if he also got an order of merlin. harry sells him as someone who died to save the world, genuinely repented and fought for their cause
