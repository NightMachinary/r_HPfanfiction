I think he would have certainly stayed out of Azkaban. The Malfoys were able to avoid it just by lying to Voldemort one time when Narcissa asked Harry if Draco was alive and claimed that Harry was dead.

I think that Snape would have most likely just lived out the rest of his life alone, possibly either back in Spinsters End or another house and just did Potions research. I doubt he would spend a lot of time around other wizards since I definitely think that a lot of people would still be prejudiced against him. He was Headmaster during the Carrows reign at Hogwarts and many students were tortured while he was there.

And many would still blame him for Dumbledore's death even with Harry's testimony. Since Pensieve memories can be altered, there's nothing in even the Wizarding world to provide the real truth of everything that went down.
