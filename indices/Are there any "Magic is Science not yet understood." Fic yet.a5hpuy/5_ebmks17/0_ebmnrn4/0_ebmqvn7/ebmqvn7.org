Wasn't it more that he realised magic couldn't be explained with the /current/ scientific understanding of the universe? In other words, magic itself is not fundamentally unscientific, but rather the current theoretical framework of physics is missing something, and possibly that human minds are unsuited for thinking about certain recursive problems.

Harry goes off on interesting tangents about that at various points throughout the fic (the mind projection fallacy, etc.) For example, there's this part in ch 14:

  Harry had looked upon magic and refused to be intimidated. People had no sense of history, they learned about chemistry and biology and astronomy and thought that these matters had always been the proper meat of science, that they had never been mysterious. The stars had once been mysteries. Lord Kelvin had once called the nature of life and biology - the response of muscles to human will and the generation of trees from seeds - a mystery "infinitely beyond" the reach of science. (Not just a little beyond, mind you, but infinitely beyond. Lord Kelvin certainly had felt a huge emotional charge from not knowing something.) Every mystery ever solved had been a puzzle from the dawn of the human species right up until someone solved it.
