Yes, but all of this is in, what, the first third. The fact is that whatever the truth may be (and I believe the author has stated that the most plausible conclusion is that the entire HPMOR universe is a simulation), Harry abandons trying to "science-ify" magic for the entire second half. So it would hardly be a satisfying story for OP.
