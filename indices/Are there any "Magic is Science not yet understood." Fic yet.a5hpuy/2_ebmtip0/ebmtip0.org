[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1141722][Safeguard]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama]] touches on the differences between science and magic, but it's unfinished an either abandoned or on a long hiatus. Still one of my favourite stories of all time.

Both [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir]] (Series) and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/719529][Ninja Wizard: The Adventures of Harry Potter, Dimensional Traveler]] (Series) by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mad_fairy/pseuds/mad_fairy][mad_fairy]] touch on how magic is related to science, but mostly in terms of what makes magical people different from muggles.
