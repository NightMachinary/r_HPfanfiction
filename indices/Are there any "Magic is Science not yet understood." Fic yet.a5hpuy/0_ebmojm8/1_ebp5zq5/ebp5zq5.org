I would totally love this "text book." In all honesty I kinda wanted to do magic is science as well but I am not good at building story around it. I could write a pseudo thesis about the subjects

The possible genetics that causes magic to be born with not magical. My head Cannon is that wizard-ship has three alleles that govern it. Magic core is incomplete dominant. mage circuit(enables use of magic core) is recessive. Circuit suppressor is dominant. The routine casting out of squibs caused the Advent of carriers and the reason why pureblood don't like marrying muggles. Muggleborn are technically winners of genetics lottery.

The economic history of wizarding world is reminiscent of the real life effect of segregation. The backwards politics kinda reminds me why France failed to emulate the success of the British empire during industrial revolution. The effect of free communication vs. the government controls all info that stifled progress. Everything is so easy with magic that people did not strive for efficiency.
