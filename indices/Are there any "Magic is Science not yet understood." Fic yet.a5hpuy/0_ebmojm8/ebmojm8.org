TBH I'm working on one, but it's a looooooooooong way from even chapter 1 -

I came up with a (hand-wave) version of Loop Quantum Gravity, and tripled the size of the Standard Model particle chart, which gave me a way to make magic work that fits both IRL and canon.

Using that, I built up a theory of evolutionary biology, which explains why not everything is magical (after all, if it is such an advantage, one would expect the evolutionary pressure to push everything magicward).

Then I extrapolated backwards from canon to construct an entire sociological/political/religious history for the wizarding world, then extrapolated forwards, using the development of mundane knowledge and IRL history as a guideline, to write a history-of-magic-knowledge, considering both which pre-Statute societies had mighty empires, religions and legends, and how magicals might have made reasonable or odd mistakes about the nature of magic, just as mundanes did IRL about the world, then went back and considered how that would have induced changes - in fact, I was able to construct a really nice backstory going back several millenia, that explains the roots of antimugglism and anticreaturism (using the history real-world prejudices as a guide).

I have a thick stack of notes on the backstory, and like, half a page of actual story.

I'm honestly considering dropping the latter and writing a fic that's basically a HP textbook: "The History and Natural Philosophy of Magic" - but as it is, it would require either writing from a God's-eye view, or putting in a small framing story that sets it as being written late in this century or so, Hermione having induced a scientific revolution in the magical world...
