  If you go that route, then any science fiction that isn't "hard scifi" is also space magic.

Yeah, I'd agree with that definition. Soft scifi is 'science themed' and 'hard scifi' has actual scientific backing. There's probably a better way to define the difference between the two, but saying that one has space magic and the other not is a pretty comprehensive roundabout way to phrase it.

Isn't this besides the point? OP was asking about science, not scifi. Pointing to a scifi story that falls very deep in the soft-scifi direction doesn't really help. It's like recommending Star Wars.
