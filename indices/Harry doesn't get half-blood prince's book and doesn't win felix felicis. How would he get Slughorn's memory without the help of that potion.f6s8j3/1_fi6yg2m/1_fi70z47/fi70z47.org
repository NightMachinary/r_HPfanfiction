Oh that would be interesting to see. But Slughorn avoids Harry as much as possible so it would be hard to get him to stay long enough. He'd just run away before Harry got the chance to say more than a few words. But of course here you mean slipping him a potion. That would have been the best thing ever. Only Dumbledore said he most probably has an antidote. But does he take it every time before drinking anything?
