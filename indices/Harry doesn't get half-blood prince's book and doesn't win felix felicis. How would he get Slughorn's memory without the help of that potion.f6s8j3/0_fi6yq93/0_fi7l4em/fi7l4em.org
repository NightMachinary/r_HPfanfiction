Doubtful. I like to think Slughorn uses the Drought of Living Death as a super hard potion for the first lesson of the year to gauge skill levels and summer retention rather than actually expecting them to succeed.

You could maybe argue that Hermione was distracted by Harry sudden skill and she wouldn't have become flustered without Harry having the book, but still... she didn't brew an acceptable potion.

Felis Felicis isn't something Slughorn hands out to the best attempt. They have to succeed with the super hard potion. Slughorn also states only one student has ever won it, and he's been teaching a long time. The Prince's book might imply that one person might be Snape, though bear in mind Slughorn also taught Tom Riddle.
