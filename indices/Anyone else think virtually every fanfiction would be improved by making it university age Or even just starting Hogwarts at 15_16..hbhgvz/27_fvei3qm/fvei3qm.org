Personally I think people have the right to do whatever the fuck they want with their own writing and stories.

That being said I think most people who do the whole "aged up" thing like that are fucking idiots. They're trying to apply modern, real world values and shit to what is ultimately a FANTASY environment. It JUST DOESN'T WORK. It doesn't HAVE TO work. Its a fucking FANTASY story series for god sake.
