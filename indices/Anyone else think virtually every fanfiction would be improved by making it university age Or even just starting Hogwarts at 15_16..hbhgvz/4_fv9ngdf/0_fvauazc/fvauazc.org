I think you could get some really interesting places by starting Hogwarts later and having 2-3 years of mandatory residential prep school... that's only mandatory for Muggleborns. After all, those already in magical society can either get tutors or learn from family.

Having the OWLs be the equivalent of the end of secondary school and the final two years to NEWTs be effectively a tertiary degree program, with apprenticeships for Mastery serving as post-tertiary doctoral equivalents would be pretty sensible.
