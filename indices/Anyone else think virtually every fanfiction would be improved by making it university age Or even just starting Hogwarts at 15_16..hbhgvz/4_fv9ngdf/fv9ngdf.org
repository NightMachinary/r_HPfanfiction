I think Hogwarts would /have/ to be a secondary/high-school (starting from 11 years old), if only to prevent a /hilarious/ amount of trouble with the Statute of Secrecy from muggleborns - puberty-hormones + untamed magic + lots of witnesses = Obliviators working overtime.

Setting it up as a "standard" secondary school also prevents questions from being asked to the parents of Muggleborns, which would definitely happen if they suddenly put their kid in another school between years.

Lastly, as children, they can still adapt to the "magic is real, I can learn it, and there's a whole hidden society based around it" culture-shock. That's a lot harder to do when you're college-age.

It's not great that a lot of fanfic authors can't seem to write a realistic 11-year-old to save their life, but them's the breaks.
