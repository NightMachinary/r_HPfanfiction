Totally agree. But I think 13 is a much better number to start with. I mean, if you only have kids start Hogwarts at 16 when they're almost adults with clear views about the world you'd take away the magic of going to a magic school and learning about the magical world.

If they start at 13 they're more mature but still young teens. And to make the 4th year example they'd be 16-17 then and old enough for a serious relationship.

Also, in canon, kids show their magic from a very young age and not training said kids in magic before 16 seems ludicrous.

Basically, you'd have to make the story very AU if you want to make it believable. Instead of just putting slightly older kids through the same experiences.

Though, reading about the emotional growth and maturity throughout the years of the characters is one of my favourite parts of a HP fanfic. You start off worrying about a foolish 11 year old squirt and then rooting for a brutal young-adult vigilante.
