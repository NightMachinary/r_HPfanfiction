I love kidfic. Really love that. In any fandoms.

The big issue I have is that most people do not know how to write kids. They made him either too ignorant and stupid or way too mature and skilled and knowledgeable. Especially when they want to write smart, independant kids. They read like adults trapped in a kid bodies.

That's why it doesn't work out. Harry in the books get distracted by tasty food, play with fake wands at the back of class, make rash decision motivated by his emotions and lack of long-term consequences thinking, sometimes priotarize Quidditch over much more important things. Despite all his important missions, he still does behave like a kid. at times. That's why it worked.

And even horrible abused kid or that deal with bigger responsabilities than their age (caring for younger siblings, or sick parents) laugh, play and have fun when the opportunity present itself. Harry rarely do so in fanfictions.

You don't really need to age up the character for political plots. You just need to show that despite those talks and responsabilities, they still act like kids. Maybe they screw up a deal because impulsiveness. Maybe they can't help but laugh at something funny, or get distracted a bit in the middle of a meeting because something interesting is going on outside. Or once they finished the talks, they immediatly go play some kids game. Or they seal the deals with Chocolate Frog cards. Or another deal goes sought because the other day kid 1 did something that only a kid would be upset about enough to be resentful days later.

However, I do agree that romantic plots they need to be aged up. Unless it the kind of puppy love, sweet that is more "he is nice to me, and he likes the same thing, and I like spending time with him", than "dude is hot".

And I don't read underage smut to begin with. Not only I found it disgusting to picture teens 17 years old having sex (but that because I'm an adult), but I'm not even sure consuming underage porn in whatever form (so including fanfiction) is even legal in my country, and I really don't want - nor need - to google it.
