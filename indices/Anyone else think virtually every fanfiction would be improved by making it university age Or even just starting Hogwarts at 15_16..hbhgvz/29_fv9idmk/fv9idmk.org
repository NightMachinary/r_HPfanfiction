i could see more fanfic leaning into the 11 year old firsties idea, but you'd have to make them blithering idiots who think they're smart. I've had an idea kicking around my head that could work with that but you have to specifically set up for it, otherwise you're forced to lean into "exactly as competent as they need to be" which is often way too much.
