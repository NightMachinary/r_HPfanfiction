*realism

Also, they say "Wingardium Leviosa", and things float. What realism.

#+begin_quote
  They're based on medieval europe
#+end_quote

The victorian era, but it feels similar. Still, I would /not/ call that "most". The WW is pretty obviously based on the modern muggle world, but with magic added in.

All those political fics are extremely bad, too. I don't think I've ever read a good one that had what you list.

#+begin_quote
  regularily married at 12
#+end_quote

This is just factually incorrect. It was never the norm to marry at 12 or 14. Those were various /lower limits/ on marriage, but these limits weren't actually used by the kids themselves, but their parents. Parents who were the highest, most inbred nobility imaginable.

  peasants regularily
#+end_quote

No. Marriage was tied to economics - a husband or his family had to pay the bride price, which was not a small amount. Additionally, most didn't marry before having their own home to raise a family in.

The average marriage age didn't change all that much over the years, it was mid-early 20s then.

  Henry III
#+end_quote

A king. I say this with full confidence and knowledge: Kings and queens were in those days were all degenerates, as a result of no law applying to them. (and some say they are still)

#+begin_quote
  Pretend they're older
#+end_quote

This is just another variation of "it's not real". This is an ideological thing - I can't pretend they're older, because they aren't. Because the author didn't intend them to be.
