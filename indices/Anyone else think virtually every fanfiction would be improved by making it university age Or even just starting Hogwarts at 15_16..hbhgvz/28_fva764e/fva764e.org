Personally, I don't have a problem with the realisticness of the tropes you've mentioned.

You're trying to apply modern views based on modern child rearing to fanfiction. However, the world of most fanfictions, especially the political ones, are not based on the modern world. They're based on medieval Europe, where children were “little adults” and aristocrats were trained in politics as soon as they could walk and talk.

Harry getting married at 14, while incredibly young by our standards, would not raise an eyebrow in a society where people were eligible for marriage as soon as they hit puberty and peasants regularly married at 12. Likewise, Harry claiming his inheritance and taking over Britain a year after the tri-wizard tournament shouldn't be unrealistic given that Henry III did the exact same thing (minus the tournament) in real life.

However, if the historical perspective doesn't help, you can just pretend that they're older. After all, most fics never explicitly mention their age. They're always "first years" or "third years," and it's only through outside knowledge that you know Hogwarts starts at 11.
