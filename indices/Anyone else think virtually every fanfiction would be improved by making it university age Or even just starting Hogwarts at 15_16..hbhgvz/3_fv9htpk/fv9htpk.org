Not at all. Not all fanfiction focuses on politics or romance. It's still possible to have meaningful relationships and a great story regardless if they are 10, 15, 20, or 40. No one forces an author to start their story in the first year at Hogwarts. They can write it at whatever point they want.

As for Hogwarts starting at around high school, I really don't have a hard stance. I personally like that the kids get immersed in magic and start learning at an early age. But if you want more... “grown up” topics, I don't think there's any problem with starting at age 15/16. It just depends on what kind of story you want to tell.
