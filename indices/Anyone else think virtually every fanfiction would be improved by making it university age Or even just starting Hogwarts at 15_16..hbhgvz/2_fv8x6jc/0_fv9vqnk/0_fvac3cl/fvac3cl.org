A lot of stuff can be dealt with a few paragraphs.

Example : Harry been raised by Sirius since he was 8. This story started summer before 4th year.

"Harry was furius. He couldn't go to diagon alley, as he had planned. But he needed too get there. He needed to find a gift for Sirius.

6 years ago, Sirius had finally had a trial. This was thanks to his then-fianc√© Marlene who fought teeth and nails for real justice. Even if she didn't believe him innoncent, as a magical lawyer, she believed in true justice, and that everyone deserved a fair trial, no matter what they had done.

It took 2 minutes for Sirius to be cleared of all wrong-doing, thanks to veritaserum. Pettigrew was caught, judge and sentenced not even two weeks later.

His Godfather immediatly asked for Harry's custody. Weirdley, Dumbledore's fought against it. Marlene worked her legal magic again, and Harry got to leave the Dursleys two weeks before his 8th Birthdays.

Harry had planned to celebrate that anniversary with a cake he made, and a gift for both Sirius and Marlene. However, Pettigrew had escaped Azkaban at the beginning of the summer. And now, Harry was confined to their house until he could go to Hogwarts.

He couldn't even go to the Quidditch World Cup Finale !!! All of that because everyone thought Pettigrew would try to kill him. And treated Harry like a defenseless kid.

He wasn't defenseless when he fought against a possessed Quirrel in first year. Even if he only got away because Voldemort seems unable to touch him. And he certainly wasn't defenless when he killed a basilic in second year."

The three books covered in a few sentences, the most meaningful change in Harry's life showed and explained. I can go into whatever story you want to tell from that, and how Sirius raising Harry make a difference in GoT, from now.

You can expand at will on other changed in the third book during the story. For example, at some point between the tasks, Harry to Ron : "I miss 3rd year. Nothing happened in 3rd year."
