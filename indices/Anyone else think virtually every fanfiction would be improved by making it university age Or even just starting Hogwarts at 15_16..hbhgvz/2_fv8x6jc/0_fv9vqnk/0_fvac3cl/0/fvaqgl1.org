It depends on the story kinda.

If Harry is raised by Sirius from age 3, then he's realistically not gonna be like canon Harry. If he needs to overcome issues from being raised with Sirius, then it would sorta be required to detail what the issue is and what it was caused by.

Canon got away with no childhood Harry because his childhood had almost no significant impact. He could have been a shy kid of Tony Stark and Batman, and everything would be pretty much the same. If there is an issue that needs to be overcome, then the issue needs more than a paragraph for us to be emotionally involved.
