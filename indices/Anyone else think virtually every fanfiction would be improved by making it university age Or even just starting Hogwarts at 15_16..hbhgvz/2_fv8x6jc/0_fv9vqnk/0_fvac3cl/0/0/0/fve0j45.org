The consequences of an issue is still about the issue. If Harry is having difficulties with personal boundaries or similar because of his treatment as a child, then we should see the origin of that type of thinking even if he deals with it when he's 150 years old.

A story that has /elements/ of dealing with past abuse needs a different approach than a story about those issues. Writing a story about child abuse while never showing child abuse isn't really possible, but you can write a story about someone dealing with low self-worth without focusing on the abuse. Mostly. There's no single way to write about something.
