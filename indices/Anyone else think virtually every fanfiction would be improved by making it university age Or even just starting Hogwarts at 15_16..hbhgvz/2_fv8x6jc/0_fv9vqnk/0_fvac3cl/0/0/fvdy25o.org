But what if the narrative focus is not on the issue but on the consequences 7 years down the road?

For example, let's say that Harry was rescued from the Dursleys by Andromeda Tonks at age 7 or 8. You could write half a million words dealing with the abuse, nightmares, Harry building trust and so on. Or you could simply start the story at the start of the 4th year, with Harry being clingy (long hug, not wanting to go) despite his age. That shows you that Harry has build trust to Andromeda, that he has overcome the Dursleys, sees her as a family but is perhaps more desperate for familiar love than the average 14yo.
