Your point being?

If the main action of the plot is somewhere in book 6, why exactly do we need to sit through all previous books if we already know what happened in canon, and can easily be brought up to speed on changes relevant to plot?

Sure it may not work for some (or even most) fics, like if it's "Harry goes back in time to fix things" then starting somewhere in year 5 when by this point most redo fics are already done with changes is stupid, BUT imagine you're writing a Warrior!Harry with mentor Dumbledore - then you can start at the end of year 6 and intermix action scenes of Harry kicking Death Eater's ass (or getting his kicked in) with Harry reminiscing about training and school days and mourning Dumbledore's passing.

Also, I'm not an author, I may just sound like I know what I'm talking about.
