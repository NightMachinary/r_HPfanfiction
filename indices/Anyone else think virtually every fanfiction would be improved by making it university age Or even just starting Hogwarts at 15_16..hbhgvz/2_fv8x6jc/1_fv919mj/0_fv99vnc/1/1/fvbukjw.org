  Right but that's still 4 full years of school time just gone.

That's not really important if nothing significant (or significantly different from canon) happened during those years. I'm sure there are fics where Harry has a very interesting time and incidents even before he starts Hogwarts but we don't really feel the lack of the details of those years in other fics.

Similarly there are so many fics that start after Hogwarts where all 7 years might be mentioned here and there but that doesn't stop those fics from being interesting and captivating.

There's no compulsion in mentioning all of Harry's years if you don't want to. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12855052/1/][Riot and Wonder]] is a sweet one-shot that touches all of Harry's years in merely a few sentences and that doesn't make it any less pleasant to read.
