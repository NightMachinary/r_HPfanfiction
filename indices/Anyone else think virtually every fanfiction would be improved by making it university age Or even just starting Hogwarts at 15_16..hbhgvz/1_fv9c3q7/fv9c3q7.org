One of [[https://writing.stackexchange.com/questions/48189/how-to-start-as-close-to-the-end-as-possible-and-why-to-do-so][Kurt Vonnegut's rules of writing]] is "Start as close to the end as possible." HP fans already know what happened in canon - why include more of it in your fanfic than you have to? If you want to write about the characters as teenagers or adults, just start there. Not every story has to be hundreds of thousands of words long, and if you find yourself writing things you're not really interested in, odds are good that readers will feel the same way.
