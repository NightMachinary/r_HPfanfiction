Tes. I love this advice from Vonegut and I wish more writers would take this. Recently I was drafting a trope revert of the Time Travel when I realized there is literally no reason for ghost Harry and Fred Weasley to go all the way back to 1991. the story works so much better with them arriving in either 95 or 96.
