I think it's better to start from the beginning if your divergence point is there. However, there is no reason you have to do a novel out of the first few years if you just want to focus on, say, 5th year. I've seen some fics like this where like 1-2 chapters is dedicated for the first few years as a sort of prologue. I think this is fine myself.
