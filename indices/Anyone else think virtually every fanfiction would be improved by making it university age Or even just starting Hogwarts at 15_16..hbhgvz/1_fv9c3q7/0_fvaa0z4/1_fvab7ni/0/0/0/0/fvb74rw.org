That would make later years seen silly. 17 year old Harry would be just a third year, which mean no body couls force him to go back to the Dursleys. A cause of tension in the books is people trying to shelter Harry because he's too young, he would be 19 during the order if the Phoenix. The battle in the graveyard feels scary because Harry is just a 14yo kid. Voldemort fighting a 18 yo wouldn't give the same impact in thst scenario. Harry would be way more wary of pretty much everyone if he spend 14 years in that cupboard, he would not open up to Ron and Hermione so quickly.

It could work like most ideas, but it would take way more effort than the writers that gain the most out of it put in .
