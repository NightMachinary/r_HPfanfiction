Honestly, I just mentally age them up anyway. Most fanfic authors don't write children well, and canon doesn't exactly do a great job of it either. Either that or I just read fics that start around 5th year. Authors are also usually less good at deviating from canon early in the series. We don't always need a rehash of the first year sorting or the chamber of secrets.
