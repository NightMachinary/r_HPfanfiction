i couldn't agree more with you . they portray 11 year old child playing with politics or getting into soulbond or something weard like that I just scartch my head . Man in real world 11 year old would feel sleepy if you talk politics with him and they are at the phase where they think girls are sticky and they don't even interact with girls unless they are related
