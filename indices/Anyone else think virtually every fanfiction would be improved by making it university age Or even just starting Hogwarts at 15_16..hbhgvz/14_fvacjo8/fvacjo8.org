I agree, I would love to see one where Hogwarts starts at 16 but then there are things that change because of this, like Harry living with the Dursley's for an additional 5 years, Hermione being a Bully victim for another 5 years, Draco being brain washed for 5 years.

I would love to see it where the Wizarding World is expected some cool, smart Gary Stu Harry and they get a Hot headed pot head and part time mechanic. Hell my vision is that Gryffindor in Harry's year are almost the antithesis of what it usually is, rather than all the 'Cool' Kids it's this hodgepodge of characters, like Seamus at 16 is a minor criminal, Dean as a passionate Artist, Neville is a introverted mess who sticks himself to Harry's side, Harry is a hot head, Hermione is a homely book work and all around "good girl", Lavender highly stand offish, Parvati doing her best Trelawny impersonation 24/7. Now imagine the fate of the school and eventually the wizarding and world in general left in their hands if they can't stop Voldemort in time
