*Harry and a Vampire* *-* Crossover with Rosario+Vampire linkffn(13150962)\\
Harry gets expelled and exiled in the fifth year trial. Harry goes to the Goblins and gets shipped over into Japan. Harry's personality slowly changes over the course of the novel since he is in a literal school of monsters. Heavy bashing of the Magical World. Harem.

*A Bad Week at the Wizengamot* Parody/Crack linkffn(3639659)\\
Harry gets expelled at the trial. Things collapse in a hilarious way. Fudge sucks at being a Dark Lord.

*The Cupboard Series* linkffn(10449375) (first entry)\\
Harry gets expelled in book three for stuff outside of his control. Dumbledore bash-y.
