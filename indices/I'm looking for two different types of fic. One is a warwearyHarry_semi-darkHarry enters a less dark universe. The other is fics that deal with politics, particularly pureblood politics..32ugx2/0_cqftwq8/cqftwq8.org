For the first request: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]] is a short one-shot, and I don't really buy the premise as to how universe travelling works, but at the same time I really, really like it. It definitely fits the 'war-weary' criterion.

Edit: um, oops. I think I accidentally upvoted this. So now I'm going to downvote, to balance it out. (Can you tell I'm new?)
