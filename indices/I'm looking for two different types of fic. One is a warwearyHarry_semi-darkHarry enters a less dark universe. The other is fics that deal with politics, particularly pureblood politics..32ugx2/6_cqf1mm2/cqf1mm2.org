(spoilers, obv) One of the AUs presented in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] fits your first request in the sense that Harry enters a world that looks rather idyllic and naive, defenceless. Unfortunately this happens way deep into the story, which often takes its time to progress.

If you want I can try finding the specific place where the relevant part starts.
