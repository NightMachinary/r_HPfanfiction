For war-weary Harry running amok in another universe there's both

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm still here]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est la Vie]]

Sadly both are still WIP and Cest's author has one of the worst cases of author ADD... but what is there is fantastic. In each case Harry ends up in a universe that's still in his fourth year. His interactions with his alternate self in Cest are quite amusing.
