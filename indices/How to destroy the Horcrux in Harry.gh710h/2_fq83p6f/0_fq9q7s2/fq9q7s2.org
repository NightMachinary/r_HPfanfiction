But is it all of Harry, or just the scar part of Harry? And possibly there's a way to transfer the horcrux without destroying it, and then destroy the thing it is transferred into, instead of Harry. We see this with the diary horcrux, which is preparing to move from the diary to its own body created by the soul or life-energy of Ginny. Is it possible with other horcruxes?

These are the questions to OP is asking, which I've seen solutions to in numerous other fics. Of course we can never know if the solutions are fully canon-compliant, but we can certainly provide fics where we've seen them done.
