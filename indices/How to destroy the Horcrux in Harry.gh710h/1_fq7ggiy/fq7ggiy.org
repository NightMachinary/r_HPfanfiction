I think that, as a general principle, any proposal to dehorcrux Harry needs to answer a very important question: Why didn't Dumbledore use it, as opposed to the convoluted Hail Mary that he had ended up using in canon?

For example, in a fic that I had outlined but never wrote, Hermione had gone Dark to the point of making a horcrux of her own. In doing so, she learned enough about the process to understand how to move a soul fragment between vessels, which allowed her to remove the hocrux from Harry. Why couldn't have Dumbledore done it? Because while he knows the steps of how to make a horcrux, but he has never observed one being made, so he doesn't have the knowledge needed.
