Anything that isn't just as mad, bad and dangerous as the canon solution always feels inauthentic.

I have a certain amount of affection for the idea that a Dementor could suck out a horcrux but that's merely because this would also result in Harry's soul being sucked out. But if you're willing to take that risk and then do a "Book Eight" fic (Harry Potter and the Soul Gate or something) where everyone tries to recover Harry's soul and stick it back in the bottle, as it were, I guess I'd read that and find it appropriate.
