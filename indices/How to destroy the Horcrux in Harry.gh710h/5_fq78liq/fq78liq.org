I have always ascribed to the belief that the scar is a representation of the Horcrux, but the Horcrux itself isn`t actually there.

As for ways, well, perhaps calling a curse breaker, or using magic not available in England, perhaps calling upon deities? A Temple of Osiris where he would remove it and cast it at the bad part of the Duat/

One fic had Harry accidentally go to a temple in Egypt that was designed to remove them, he almost died too.

The way JKR did was so convoluted it basically doesn`t matter, it was done for plot reasons not due to any internal logic.
