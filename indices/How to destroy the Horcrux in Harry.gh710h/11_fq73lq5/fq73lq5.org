- linkffn(7392700) has something very very different from dying to fight Horcruxes, albeit La petite mort is involved, if you get the meaning. And yes, it is RobSt, so all warnings related to him apply.

- I have always wondered why when fighting super Dark curse, Dumbledore somehow forgot to call into action one professional cursebreaker he knows, and how is actually a member of his Order of Phoenix, Bill Weasley. Isn't it weird? So, yes, I am just writing my own story, where Bill is responsible for getting rid of the seventh horcrux.
