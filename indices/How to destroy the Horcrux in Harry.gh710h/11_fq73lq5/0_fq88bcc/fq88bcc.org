  Dumbledore somehow forgot to call into action one professional cursebreaker he knows, and how is actually a member of his Order of Phoenix, Bill Weasley. Isn't it weird?

I think it's pretty safe to assume that Dumbledore's abilities and knowledge exceed Bill's. It probably wasn't worth the risk of bringing him in on the secret. I think you have to bring in bigger guns than Bill to sell a Horcrux removal method. That's way too easy.
