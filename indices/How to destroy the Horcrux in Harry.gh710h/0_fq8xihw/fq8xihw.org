I think the most believable way to do it is to use Lily's protection magic pre-GoF, in the period when Voldemort remains vulnerable to it.

I don't like any kind of easy "extraction" magic - this undermines the very concept of the horcrux, which is that the soul fragment and the container become one such that the fate of the soul fragment is tied to the fate of the container.

However, Harry is in the unique situation of being a container with other stuff inside it as well: namely Harry's own soul, and Lily's protection magic. I think this creates an interesting angle in that there are different magical forces at play inside of Harry and they are hostile to each other.

In canon, Lily's protective magic only seems to respond to Voldemort when he is an external, physically present, threat. However, you could perhaps come up with a series of events which ends up turning Lily's magic inward and destroying the soul fragment.

Given the known rarity and power of Lily's protective magic, I think you could get away with using it without undermining the seriousness of horcruxes. But the events which led to the magic being turned inwards would have to be sufficiently weighty to make it feel earned, still - it couldn't be just a case of chatting to a healer who redirects the magic with a simple spell.
