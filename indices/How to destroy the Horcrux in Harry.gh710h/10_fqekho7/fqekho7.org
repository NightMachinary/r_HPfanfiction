There are actually thousands of different ways proposed of doing just that. The fact is that the whole Horcrux premise is so open ended that you could believably have it removed in any way ranging from taking off the scar, throwing a finite at it or just not removing and making the whole thing fall apart for any reason you can think to more complex ways, such as arkane rituals forgotten by humanity, new magiks made with years of study, having Harry make a Horcrux and having Voldemort's be taken away with his soul-bit, fiding a way of making Harry and the Horcrux merge or even using the link to force-feed Voldemort with enough regret to make him re-merge with all his Horcruxi including the one in Harry.

The real trick is to make it in some way as to go well in hand with the other elements of the story, such as, if it could have been done by Harry why didn't Dumbledore (who has much more knowledgeable about the matter) do it sooner? Or falling that maybe the DoM? How did Harry discover the method when he is basically a standard teenager? Would the method work on the other Horcruxi?

I've seen it done many different ways and all of them more or less make sense by what little cannon shows of magic in general and Horcruxi in particular, it's only a question of knowing how to work it inside your story.
