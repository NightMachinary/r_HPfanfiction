I'm pretty sure I've read a fic where Hermione's parents did a surgery on him and removed the skin and a bit of skull. Alternatively, rituals seem to be popular- african, indian and goblin shamans seem to be pretty good at it. If you're going for humor/ parody sex is also another way to do a ritual. Particularly group sex. I remember another one where Harry wasn't actually the horcrux, but it was a very small splinter that lodged itself in his face in the explosion so they just removed it.
