[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1048010/chapters/2096059][HOLLY AT HOGWARTS!]] Sorry, a little excited because I rarely get to recommend it. And it's slowly become one of my favorite series. The series (last I checked) was incomplete, but the author posts regularly and is on Holly's seventh year.

Things I love about it: The writer adds quite a bit to the magical world (spells/curses/abilities) but none of them feel inorganic and the addition of them keeps the magical world from being stale. It also helps that Holly is learning different things than Harry did, so it has that same feeling of new discovery that the original series had. Dudley has grown a bit, but isn't like "oh yay my daughter is a witch".
