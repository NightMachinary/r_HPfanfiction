Ya know, ever since I first watched this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Tc7MH5ZXbg][amv]] (I would like to thank whomever posted it here a few weeks ago as that was the first time I had seen it, but I can't remember who it was. So ummmm thanks. . . ) it's the only thing I can think of in any shipping thread where the ships are more important than the stories.

So maybe that should have been an option:

I care about the story more than my fetishes/fantasies/sad hopes.
