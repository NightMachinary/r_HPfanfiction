It would be interesting to see a story in which Harry becomes dependent of summoning the dead for advice and while at first most of them are happy to help him, they gradually get annoyed with him constantly disturbing their peace so, while they have to come when summoned, they deliberately sabotage Harry at every step in hopes that he would die and stop bothering them. When their plan is successful, the resurrection stone ends up in Colin Creevey's hands and he keeps summoning Harry to sign autographs or take pictures with him. And that's how the universe punishes Harry for playing with death.
