Harry uses it to summon the Founders and learns each of their own specialty techniques.

Slytherin teaches him to be a master of the mind arts.

Gryffindor teaches Harry the process of creating his own sword.

Ravenclaw I imagine teaches Harry how to 'see and feel' magic. Give him kind of a sixth sense on the battlefield.

Hufflepuff I see as a pet master, using animation charms to swarm her enemies. If you've read Wind Shear, thing that.
