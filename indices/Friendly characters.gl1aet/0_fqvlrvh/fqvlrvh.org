For some reason this is seen as a controversial rec in this sub, but Tracey Davis in linkffn(HPMOR) is a bubbly character and really friendly. A lot of people take issue with the Harry in the fic but I'd say that HPMOR has the best written Voldemort and Tracey Davis in all of fanfiction. That said, while she has quite a lot of really good lines in the work, it should be noted that she isn't a major character.

What's her name in Hufflepuff had a lot of friendly characters too. Probably my favorite SI fic. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]])
