dear god yes! whenever im reading an evil/dark character and they do some kind of feral, cruel smirk i always try to do it myself or when its some roasting scene and the character is winning while they talk about his expressions i talk out loud while narrowing my eyes or what else i imagine they would be doing while talking.. overall yes i do that a lot
