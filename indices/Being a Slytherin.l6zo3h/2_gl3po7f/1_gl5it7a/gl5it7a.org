But that was at least consequent. They stayed true to their principles, and this time, not even just the "show" part of what Slytherins are, but the "tell" one, too -- there just is zero self-preservation in joining a rag-tag resistance group that only isn't crushed because no one can find them. Indeed, it would be very /courageous/ to join -- and that's the same as saying, Slytherins would be good, if only they were Gryffindors.

The most Slytherin thing anyone ever did was Pansy's grand entrance -- selling out Harry to save her own skin.
