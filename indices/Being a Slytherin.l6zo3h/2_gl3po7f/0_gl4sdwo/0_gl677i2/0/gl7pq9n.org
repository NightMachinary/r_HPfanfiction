Ehh ... Slytherins shouldn't make up more than one quarter of the population, if it was just about that. You wonder where all the courageous Gryffindors were ...

Alternatively, you'd have to posit everyone just didn't care because it didn't matter to /them/. 20% Muggleborns and 40% half and pureblood each leaves the vast majority in theory unaffected. This has been my hypothesis, but it is contradicted by the Battle of Hogwarts, where "everyone" is said to come to fight Voldemort. Then again, maybe this is the difference between fighting /Voldemort/ and fighting /the Ministry/?

Because yeah, I dunno that he won the first time round. He did, the second time, because he kept in place the existing power structure, instead of trying to overthrow it. And there had been conservative Ministers before, names you would expect; e.g. Flint or Rowle (who was only forced out by a censure from the ICW) -- so maybe we can conclude that Britain /does/ tilt conservative, and while they don't stand for someone declaring themselves Evil Overlord, if you take care not cross obvious lines (pointless terror, getting censured by the ICW), and keep in place the bureaucracy people rely on, they (or: /enough/ of them) are willing to let things be.
