Is this about what you would like, or wondering what is, in the books?

For what /is/, there is a disparity between show and tell. We are told what Slytherins are -- resourceful, ambitious, cunning, winning at all costs etc. But what we are shown is something else -- no one we see is particularly cunning, but basically everyone we see is either an asshole, a blood-racist, or both.

But tbh, for me, that's fine. I don't mind having a house full of self-interested assholes. That's /interesting/. What's more of a pity is that the poster-child of Slytherin, Draco, isn't particularly cunning. Throwing around his name is fine. But it's also quite one-dimensional. There should have been more plays like the midnight duel in PS. That was reasonably clever for an 11 year old.

The actual /issue/ is the moral values assigned to all of this. Loyalty == good, self-interest == evil. We are mostly shown Harry's POV, granted, so it's sort of expected, but it'd sure have been nice if Rowling had expanded on the different view that Slytherins must have, in the few instances where we had different POVs, because clearly, if you had such values as the above, you wouldn't consider /yourself/ as evil.

But I guess this'd kinda run counter to the theme of the series, so eh. What we got FF for, then.
