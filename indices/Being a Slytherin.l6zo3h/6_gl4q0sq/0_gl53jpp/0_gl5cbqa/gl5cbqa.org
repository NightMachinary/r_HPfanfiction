I mean, that's one way; it's coherent, and arguably also what most people would say. But precisely for that reason, the opposite is interesting.

So what kind of mindset regards bravery and loyalty as wrong, as negative things? This is what I'd have liked Slytherin to explore. So that the difference between the Houses isn't "Good" vs. "Evil", but entirely different definitions of what "Good" /in itself means/.

In Slytherin, what is good is power (as you say, and also along the lines of Voldemort's motto), self-interest, doing anything to win, and what is bad selflessness, fairness, loyalty. And for Gryffindor it's exactly the reverse. Building up the Houses along those lines would have had a dramatic impact when reading, I think.

Sometimes I think that's what Rowling intended, but then she got derailed halfway through. It just fits with so many things we see in Canon, not least that it'd decisively explain the antipathy between Gryffindor and Slytherin. They are opposites; within their moral framework, the other side is "evil" (or, for a less sensational term, morally wrong), and there truly is no way to bridge that, because either side is operating with entirely different premises.

It's a literal speechlessness, like two different languages; an impossibility in understanding, because the mindsets are utterly alien.

But in the end, Canon never quite got there, and what we were left with was the usual Good vs. Evil.
