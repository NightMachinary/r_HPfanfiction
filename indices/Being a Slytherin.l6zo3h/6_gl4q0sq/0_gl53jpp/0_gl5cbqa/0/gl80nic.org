I don't get why you think that tis is difficult to write or whatever. Slytherins don't think they're evil - they think discrimianting against muggleborns is good. They think just thinking of yourslf and maybe your family first and foremost is good. They consider the brave and selfless idiots, maybe useful idiots, for not thinking of themselves first.

And that's a stance that's really common in our world, as politics prove time and again. So, why would've JKR had to write a special viewpoint when you already know that viewpoint?
