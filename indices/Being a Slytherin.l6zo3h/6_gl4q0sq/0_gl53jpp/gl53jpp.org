Yeah, I think the defining trait of Slytherins in the canon is actually Power. Some value the power they already have, others value being close to power. For eleven year olds power can just be being a bully, or being a popular mean girl. You could value power in a nice way, like Slughorn, but it still aligns you with enforcers of power structures. I don't think it is Good to value Power in itself.

Knowledge above all else is mostly neutral.

Loyalty/Justice above all else is probably the goodest you can get.

Bravery above all else is good because good is usually aligned with the underdog (there aren't many cases where people try to do something bad even when it is difficult, though there are definitely cases).
