Lazy.

You're making a common mistake. Simply because it is popular doesn't mean it's well written. Note that I'm not saying lack of popularity means something is well written either.

Rowling's work is popular because it 'struck gold' at a particular time in history. And I don't see how I said she wasn't successful or had an impact.

However, to try to say that the books have no flaws, that characterization in the books is not lacking, that characters in the books do not act in whatever way Rowling needed to for the plot to happen? And that is lazy writing.
