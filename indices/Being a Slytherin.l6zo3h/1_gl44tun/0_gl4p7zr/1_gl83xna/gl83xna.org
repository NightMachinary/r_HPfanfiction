Lazy?

Rowling wrote one of the most influential series of literature of all time. Hours and hours and hours--years of her life--devoted to this, and she was tremendously successful.

She influenced two generations of school children, encouraging millions of students to read for leisure. And pulled it off better than any other author of her generation, tenfold.

I dare anyone to do better.
