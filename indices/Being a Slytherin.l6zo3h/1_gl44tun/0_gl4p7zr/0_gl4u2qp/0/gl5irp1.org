See, I disagree with that, simply because I find it really creepy trying to apologize for the sort of things Death Eaters did.

I can see trying to point out that there are some things to support in Wizarding society that some new folks don't like, but not ... Voldemort/Death Eaters. I'd also not make Draco and Co the voice of that as again, they are wayyy too up Voldemort's arse.
