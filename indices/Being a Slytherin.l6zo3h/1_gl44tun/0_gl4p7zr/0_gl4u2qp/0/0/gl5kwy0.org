It wouldn't be apologising, because it would be presented as if there was nothing wrong in the first place.

But yes, I get what you mean. It's challenging to endure as a reader, but then, that's just why the impact is so great. Reading only from Harry's POV, everyone would be Harry IRL, certainly, easily, brain-skips-right-past, no-further-thoughts. But reading Malfoy's mindset, would some of us be them? If we were raised that way? It's a small, uncomfortable hook that doesn't let you go, and I like that in books.
