Eh. Rather than keeping views of what is "evil" and simply introduce characters that aren't, I'd have much preferred if she kept the characters, and introduced a different notion of what is "evil" (from their POVs, naturally). A mindset where discrimination is fine, selfishness isn't bad, and Voldemort isn't evil. /That/ would have been interesting. But it's obviously harder to write.

Maybe the series could have done with different POVs ... aside from Harry's & co, the best we get is two narrated chapters about Narcissa, where we are more observer than anything. I feel there was more potential there, to get into her (or someone else's) head more. Nowadays, people go overboard with POV changes, but HP could have actually done with just a little more diverse POVs.
