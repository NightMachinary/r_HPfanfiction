At heart, Rowling was lazy.

She's said many times that all Slytherins were not evil, but all we SEE are Draco, Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy, plus one or two from the Quidditch Team. All on Team Evil.

She really should've had one or two year mates who interacted with Hermione in Runes now and then, or helped Harry in minor ways on the sly, to show it. I could think of a few places it could work.

But nope.
