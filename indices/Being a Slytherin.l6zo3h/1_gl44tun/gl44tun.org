Good Slytherin - Andromeda Tonks (went against her family's bigoted beliefs)

Neutral Slytherin - Horace Slughorn (guy just wants to be important and live in comfort)

I wish Rowling expanded on these characters more to give Slytherins more depth than just the "Evil house" but she instead tried (and failed imo) to make Malfoy and Snape sympathetic and force fed a shitty redemption arc for both of them down our throats. So not only do we not get good Slytherins, we have a bunch of crazy Snape and Malfoy fans that blame these characters being shitty bigoted people all on external circumstances.
