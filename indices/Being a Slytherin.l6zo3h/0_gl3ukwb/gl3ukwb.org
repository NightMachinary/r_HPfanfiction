My understanding was that it's less that Slytherin selects for 'Evil' and more that the house has been a breeding pit for racists for the last fifty-ish years.

Imagine if whoever is leading ISIS these days joined a country club in the Hamptons and somehow turned a majority of its members into sympathisers and outright allies of ISIS. Those beliefs then propagate through the group (we naturally realign ourselves to mimic our chosen social groups) and become part of the institutional culture and then new people joining that group are taught those beliefs. It's called 'Canteen Culture' and was a really big thing back in the days when people were first trying to work out why the Metropolitan Police was so rife with racism, homophobia, and general dickbag behaviour. It was so called because they found a strong influence there was when the officers got together in the canteen and talked about their experiences and beliefs and thus displayed a morality for newer officers to move towards.

Whether Slytherin House is like that or not is debateable (not by me - I don't know enough about canon to have a personal opinion here and am just repeating what I've read on this sub) but that kind of dynamic is a studied and evidenced thing that happens.
