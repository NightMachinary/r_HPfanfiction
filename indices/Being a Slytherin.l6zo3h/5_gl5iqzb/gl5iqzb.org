Slytherin in a nutshell:

1. Take children who are already predisposed to value or at least tolerate dishonesty and ruthlessness (euphemistically called "cunning") and self-aggrandisement (i.e., "ambition") over other things.
2. Teach them that these traits are virtues and that everyone else is against them.
3. Also teach them to admire a founder who was considered to be xenophobic /in his own time, a thousand years ago/.
4. Appoint heads of house who alternate between corrupt wheelers-and-dealers (Slughorn) and former Death Eaters who never outgrew their childhood rivalries (Snape).
5. Let them stew in this environment for 7 years.

What would you expect to get out this kind of environment?
