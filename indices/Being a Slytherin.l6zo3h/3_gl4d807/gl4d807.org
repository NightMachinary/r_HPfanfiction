I think that JK's thought was to create a house of bad people so we can clearly differentiate them from the good guys. If you want to use it in a fic, you can always play it off as the damage that Voldemort had done to even three generations after him. The boys in Harry's year, other than Blaise (who also didn't think too fondly of Muggleborns from the one scene in which he appears), were all associated with Death Eaters and Pansy tried to get people to give Harry to Voldemort.

I can get behind the fan trope that they were all acting like Machiavellian members of a Royal court but, overall, they were divided and were quickly losing power to a more progressive society, so they needed to rally behind someone like Voldemort who was powerful, charismatic and ambitious. However I really don't understand how they could accept to be Voldemort's slaves if they were so proud and cunning, especially some people like Malfoy or the Blacks who had more gold than ten generations from them could spend and were in positions of power already. Maybe some of the lower families.
