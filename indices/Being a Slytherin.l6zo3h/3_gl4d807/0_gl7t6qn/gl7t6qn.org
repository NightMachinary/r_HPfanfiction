This curious thing about power and desiring it, I think.

Part of it is having an excellent nose for where the most power lies. And if your mind works that way, then basking in the power of someone else is only slightly below having such power yourself -- especially if you are also clear-eyed enough to see you can't beat that person. The next best thing to being the biggest bully on the block is being the biggest bully on the block's right hand.

Another part of it may be looking at /who/ joined. Regulus did. Bella, and Lucius -- those were youths, right out of school. Young and determined to change the world. Abraxas Malfoy didn't join, or Cygnus Black. They stayed well away from that. And later in life, as we know, Lucius came to regret this arrangement very much, and Regulus even gave his life, trying to escape.

So I think there is that hesitance you're looking for. A less charismatic Voldemort likely wouldn't even have gotten as far as he did.
