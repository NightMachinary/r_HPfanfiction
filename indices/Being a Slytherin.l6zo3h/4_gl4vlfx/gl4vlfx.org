To be honest I don't know that that is true of Slytherins in general. I think it's rather one of those squeaky wheel things. Rowling names a bunch of characters but only a limited few have any real characteristics at all. Out of the whole house we know of about six students who we would be able to say were evil (I guess the rest didn't particularly matter to the story) and most of not all of them were the kids or death eaters. We don't know (because it wasn't particularly important to the story) if there were any on Voldemort's side from the other houses just like we don't know if there were any from Slytherin who weren't.
