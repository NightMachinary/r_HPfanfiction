My favourite of this type (not soulmate, but Harry must love Draco or Draco would die) is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22431970/chapters/53596558][The Bucket List]] - it's absolutely delightful. I actually found you're the antidote for me through this fic, which the writer said inspired them. I also just finished [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13826685][A Hag, a Hex, a Tale of Redemption]], which has a similar premise and is also fantastic. There's also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4230765][Somebody to Love]], but it seems like it's hidden right now because of a challenge.

There was also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/g8tc9w/fics_similar_to_the_bucket_list/][a post]] from [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] (where you're better off posting slash requests) with similar fics recced that you can check out!
