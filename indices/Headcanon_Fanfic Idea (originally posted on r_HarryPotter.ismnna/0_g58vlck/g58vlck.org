  Anyways, the main story is about how they are basically the real Golden Trio, who find out the information Harry, Ron, and Hermione (HRH) need (examples, find out what's under Quirell's turban, what the meaning of the blood on the wall in CoS, etc) and feed it to them (or sometimes HRH eavesdrops on their plans) and then do the MiSsiOn and take all the clout. Possibly HRH would manipulate them into keeping it a secret because I can imagine Hermione being great at that ngl.

So they find this information out, for some reason do nothing about it except hand it over to the Trio and are /surprised/ when the three people who actually did something about things get the credit for doing something about things?

Shockingly that's...not going to come off well. Because you're not pointing out actual flaws that Harry, Ron or Hermione have, you're giving them new ones for the sole purpose of making your original characters look better. Why would Harry, Ron and Hermione refuse to share the spotlight? Why would they try and make your OC's keep it a secret?

Write what you want by all means but you might get negative responses and not for the reasons you think.
