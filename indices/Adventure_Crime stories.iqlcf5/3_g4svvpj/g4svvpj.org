I usually suggest stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] (start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on; you can return later to the earlier stories) to be great introduction to the Harry Potter fanfiction world. And yes, there are plenty of non-Romantic stories, or at least they happen after the book story is finished, so they just have to be original.
