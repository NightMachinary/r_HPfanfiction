But if I give you two unlabeled stag carcasses, can you pick out the one that used to be an animagus? If it's completely indistinguishable from venison, I'd argue that it's now venison, regardless of what it was before hunting season.

It's a bit like if you eat corn that grew over a site which is later found to have paleolithic bone fragments. Sure, some of the molecules involved used to belong to a different human, but that doesn't mean you're eating people meat. It's all corn now.
