Not really a disguise if the physical transformation goes all the way. That's what an animagus transformation is. Everything but the soul changes into an animal that represents the nature of the soul.

The soul's what makes James the Stag technically human. If a dementor were to somehow suck out the soul of James Potter from his stag body /(something canon seemed to imply was highly unlikely if at all even possible, because dementors probably don't sense or care about souls in animals)/, what's left is just Mr Brain-Dead Stag. There's no James anymore.

Similarly, if you shoot James the Stag in the head, he's not James the Stag anymore. His soul's gone, he's not alive enough to be sapient. He's just Dead-Stag-That's-Now-Dinner.

The issue I think you're having with this is that implicitly, you have to kill James the Stag in order to eat Dead Stag's venison /(because it is venison at that point, there's no life in that carcass, and any sign of James's soul being in there left the moment he died)/. It becomes a moral issue about murder, and that's an entirely different debate.
