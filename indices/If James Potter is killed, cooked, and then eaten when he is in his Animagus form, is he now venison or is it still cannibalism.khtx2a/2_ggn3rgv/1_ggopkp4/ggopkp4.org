So with so many stories in and out of the HP universe where shifters revert to original form upon death I tend to lean that way too.

I read this post and I instantly picture a Muggle hunter out in the woods, merely trying to provide for his or her family. (S)he sees this great stag; good meat, thick healthy coat, huge rack. Food and clothing, plus a little bragging on the side. Inhale, exhale, hold, aim, squeeze, ka-BLAM! Right in the sweet spot.

Track the critter's trail and finds a dead man at the end of it. Oh /explicative/!

Calls up the DNR, "hey, Jim? I need you to get out here. Yeah, uh, you ain't going to believe this. Bring Sheriff Bob with you, would you? Thanks, see you in a bit."
