This is a really interesting point. At first when I read it I thought "na, no way, it doesn't matter if it's intent or not, you're still eating a human therefore committing cannibalism."

Then I thought about it a bit and it reminded me of some urban legends I've heard about cannibals, mainly one story about a guy who cut up his victims and made soups and BBQs with them and would feed his community/neighborhood.

When he got caught he was the only charged cannibal in this and everyone else was treated as a victim. Even though they took part in the consumption of a human body they had zero awareness of it and no intention and were therefore not considered cannibals.

It's kind of crazy but I think you're 100% right when it comes to intent. Cannibalism isn't like killing someone where one can still go away for manslaughter when there was no intent. I think there has to be intent for someone to be a cannibal.
