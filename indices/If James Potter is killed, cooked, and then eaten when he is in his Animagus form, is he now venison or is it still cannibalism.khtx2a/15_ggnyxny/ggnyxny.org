I guess it would depend on if animagus are made out of human meat or their animal form meat. And if they retain their animal shape after death. If he was made out of venison and not human meat and stayed in animal form after death I would say it wasnt cannibalism.

Now I would still classify it as murder and wrong if the person knew he was an animagus. And while not technically cannibalism I would say intent wise and legally it would be cannibalism. Because while not actually consuming human meat the person did consume the animal knowing it was actually a person.
