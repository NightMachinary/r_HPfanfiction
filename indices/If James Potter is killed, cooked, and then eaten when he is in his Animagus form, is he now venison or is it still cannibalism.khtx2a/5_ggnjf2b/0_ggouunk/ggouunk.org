Oh, there are a great many such questions in the setting that make your brain turn to goo.

Such as, if the spell you cast bestows sapience on an inanimate object that subsequently develops a personality over time, is cancelling out the spell murder or not?

If you fall pregnant whilst under the effects of the polyjuice potion, can you actually carry the baby to term? What happens if you're normally a man?

Where did house elves come from?

Can werewolf ladies have children? If they can, so the children transform with them at night in utero?

Vampires exist in the Wizarding World. What powers do they have though?

If you raise an inferius for the purpose of manual labour, could that be considered slavery?

Are love potions rape or enslavement?

With potions capable of imposing emotions on their imbibers existing, what happens to someone drugging themselves to be able to cast the Avada Kedavra at will? Are they turning themselves into a Berserker or a sociopath?

What substance would be considered a narcotic in the Wizarding World anyway?
