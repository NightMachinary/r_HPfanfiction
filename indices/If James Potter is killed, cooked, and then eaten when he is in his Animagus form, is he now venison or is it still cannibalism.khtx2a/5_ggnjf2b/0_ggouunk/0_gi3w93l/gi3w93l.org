  If you fall pregnant whilst under the effects of the polyjuice potion, can you actually carry the baby to term? What happens if you're normally a man?
#+end_quote

Shit, that's interesting. So if I recall correctly, pollyjuice potion not only makes you look like someone but completely transforms you into the person, internal organs and all. So if our subject is pollyjuiced into a fertile woman, obviously the conception itself should be possible. Here I begin to wonder whether the expiration of the potion reverts the consumer to the pre-pollyjuice state or transforms them into the person they are, with added effects of time and whatever may have affected them while pollyjuiced, like an injury or pregnancy. Former would leave us pregnancy-free. The latter, in theory, could have the fertilised egg remain in the uterus, given that our subject has one in their original body and the embryo survives the stress of its surroundings transforming.

So our female subjects is now basically a surrogate mother! Or is she? I'd assume the genetic material would belong to the person she'd pollyjuiced into. Assuming the baby, biologically speaking, belongs to the person they're imitating, we are left with some interesting implications of Pollyjuice misuse (as if any use of it wasn't morally ambiguous at best already...)

As for a male-to-female pollyjuicing, I'd say either the embryo would get stuck somewhere in the organism (I won't even begin to speculate what that would imply for our subject, medically speaking.) or his magic would magically magic it away.

  Where did house elves come from?

I've seen some fanon explanations, but I can't recall any in detail on top of my head.

  Can werewolf ladies have children? If they can, so the children transform with them at night in utero?
#+end_quote

Assuming they can get pregnant, in order for them to carry the child to term, I think it would /need/ to transform in utero. Seeing as werewolves aren't above maiming themselves if lacking prey to hunt + have a taste for human flesh + have excellent sense of smell, I think a werewolf with a human baby in its belly would sooner claw its own gut out to get to the baby then ignore it. If the baby is also a little werewolf, then she-wolf might have the expected mother instincts to keep it safe.

Or the fetus could just not survive the transformation, which I think may be more likely.

  Vampires exist in the Wizarding World. What powers do they have though
#+end_quote

Love it when fanfics explore this! As for the canon, I'd assume JKR meant for vampirism to be akin to lycanthropy in that it is un undesirable condition. I imagine she didn't/wouldn't ascribe them special abilities. Feeds on blood, can't be exposed to daylight, the like. Immortal but unable to /live/ kind of thing. (Why didn't Voldie just become a vampire? Would he lose magical power? Or is it just bigotry?)

  If you raise an inferius for the purpose of manual labour, could that be considered slavery?
#+end_quote

I'd need a refresher on the inferi. I wouldn't be hard-pressed to call it slavery if they have no will to begin with ã…¡ They are created in a way where they can only act upon the will of their creator, if memory serves. Of course that isn't to say that raising an inferius for manual labour in itself isn't unethical, but I'd say a ^{soft} no for the slavery label.

  Are love potions rape or enslavement?
#+end_quote

Both? Sexual slavery. (And some emotional rape, if that could be a thing.)

  With potions capable of imposing emotions on their imbibers existing, what happens to someone drugging themselves to be able to cast the Avada Kedavra at will? Are they turning themselves into a Berserker or a sociopath?
#+end_quote

Berserker would imply that not only they cast it at will, but that they cast it furiously and indiscriminately, no? Casting "at will" should still leave you with control to cast only at whom and when you wish, not make you go on a green-lit killing frenzy. So I'll say b) sociopath.

#+begin_quote
  What substance would be considered a narcotic in the Wizarding World anyway?
#+end_quote

Any potion with narcotic effects really, but probably without negative connotations. There doesn't seem to be many things you're /not/ allowed to do. Maybe because it's easier to reverse with magic an' all.
