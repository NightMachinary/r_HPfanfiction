Would it though? I mean, it's no longer connected to his magic. Who's to say that the transformation isn't just temporary, and it takes a conscious effort to switch between?

Sirius spent weeks to months in his dog form to conserve energy in 3rd year (I'm pretty sure, but don't @ me if I'm wrong), as well as years in a prison with dementors to keep his sanity, which means it's more than just a /human/ brain in a /human/ body that is /shaped like an animal's body./ The process of becoming an animagus does seem to be carefully monitored because of the dangers (and probably also the possibility of it going wrong and someone gets stuck).

If it were just a temporary body transformation that could be reversed later, then it'd be like Krum's shark-head transformation: easy to undo, and you could choose any animal to do it with, */choose/* and */any/* being the key words there. The fact that canonically, it seems like people only get one animagus form ties it closer to the soul, with magic making it possible to change the body to match the nature of said soul.

To kinda go deep with it without really going into it, it's the unchanging permanence of the physical body conflicting with the fluidity of the soul and its susceptibility to change. The only reason they're able to transform their body at all is because of magic bridging the gap.

Sirius did mention how the dementors didn't affect him as strongly in his dog form, hence why he stayed in it during his imprisonment. The body---and therefore the brain---itself is different, animalistic.

So if an animagus died in their animal form, I don't think they'd change back. They're in their most basic, soul-defined form. It'd take conscious thought and exertion of will to change back. Dead people don't have that.
