Chapter 2, Spinner's End when Bellatrix kills a fox thinking it was an Auror.

“There was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the ground, dead. The second figure turned over the animal with its toe. "Just a fox," said a woman's voice dismissively from under the hood. "I thought perhaps an Auror...””

My understanding of the wording is that if it were a human, it would have transformed back into one.
