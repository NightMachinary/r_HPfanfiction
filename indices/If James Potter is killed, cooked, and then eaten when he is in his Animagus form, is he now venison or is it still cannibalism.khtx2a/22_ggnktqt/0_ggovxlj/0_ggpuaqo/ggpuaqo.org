It isn't necessarily stated either way in canon. Alchemy is a transformation magic that is permanent and actually changes something from one thing to another. But transfiguration only changes what something looks like. It stands to reason that it's not permanent.

I'd also like to reference Gamp's law from the books. There was a reason they couldn't just transfigure rocks into chickens, kill them, and eat them. "Food is the first of five Principle Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration." That said, he can't become food of a different kind for someone else because not all of him is edible and able to just be made into food. Especially if his magic is what was sustaining the stag form.
