Based on what was written, yes. We don't know for sure about these things since it's an unreliable narrator in Harry's perspective. But J.K. Rowling didn't just come up with all these terms. She based it off of a lot of pre-existing lore (such as the philosopher's stone) and whatnot. To transfigure (the actual word), means to transform into something more beautiful or elevated. That's fairly superficial, pointing towards it being only in looks like I stated previously. To transmute (the act of performing alchemy), means to change the substance or nature of something. That points towards it being deeper and more substantial than that of transfiguration. These words exist outside of Harry Potter and there's only so much that can be changed about their meaning before one would have to use a different word.
