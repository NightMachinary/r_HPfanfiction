If it's intentional on the part of the hunter, it's cannibalism. Type of meat aside, if you're eating deer flesh you know was a person, then you are still eating a person.

If, however, it was an unwitting yet tasty accident and the hunter has no idea, then it's not cannibalism.

The caveat to that one is that, should the meat revert to human flesh, then the person eating it has just performed accidental cannibalism and likely now has a cut up human corpse in their fridge.

Oh, and good luck explaining James Potter's head mounted on a wall buddy. You'll need it when Lily finds out.

Severus's new career as Park Ranger sure came with an unexpected early payoff alright. Pity that the dude who asked him for tips earlier turned out to be a cannibalistic killer, but Snape couldn't exactly fault him for his choice of target, though he did criticise the man's sense of taste.

EDIT: These are the questions that make this fandom so interesting.
