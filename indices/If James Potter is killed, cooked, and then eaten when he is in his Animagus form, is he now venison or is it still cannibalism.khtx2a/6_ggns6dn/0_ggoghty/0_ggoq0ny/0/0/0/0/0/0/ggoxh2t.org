Thank you.

I loved Archimedes. As far as Skeeter goes, in GoF, imagine if Krum had inadvertently crushed her while removing her from Hermione's hair. With the assumption that shifters revert to their original form upon death, that scene would have taken a rather different turn.

Along the same line as the OP, if someone is cruising on a motorbike and swallowed Sweeter in bug form... Is that vehicular manslaughter or cannibalism?
