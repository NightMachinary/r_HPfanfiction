Spelling is Hasenpfeffer.

And no, I don't remember any bunny animagus being mentioned, though that could be because using that form anywhere near a dog or a sufficiently chonky house cat would be considered an elaborate form of suicide.

And shout out to Skeeter too. Using a beetle form means that she's got balls of purified steel alloy to use it, what with how many things could kill her whilst she's transformed.

I was always partial to Owl animagus forms-also due to Archimedes from Sword in the Stone.
