Technically? No As far as I'm aware an animagus will stay an animagus as long as they don't transform. There is the spell, of course, but I doubt someone would use it on the meat. So, at the time it is eaten that piece of James Potter is a piece of venison that was butchered of a deer that happened to have James Potters consciousness. Of course, I mean if a another deer were to eat him, then yes. That would definitely be cannibalism.

MORALLY, though? Well it depends on intent. If it was a muggle hunter, then no, but like, if you were informed of the person that was a deer that you ate, then yes. Ignorance is bliss and all that.

Though this does remind me of a fanfic I read a while ago. It MOD Time-travel-fixit fic where every time Harry died he would revert back to his seventeen year old self when he walked into the forest, though that part isn't that important. The important hit is that whenever he dies, /whatever / state he was in, he will always reform. You can probably guess where this is going. I don't remember the name of the fic but it was described in detail. Every detail.

(basically he reformed in a guys stomach, if that needed clearing up)
