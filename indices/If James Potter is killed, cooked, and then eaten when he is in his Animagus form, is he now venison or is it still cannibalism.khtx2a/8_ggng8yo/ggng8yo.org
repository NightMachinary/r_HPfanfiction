Cannibalism is specifically a matter of what type of meat you're eating, bad has nothing to do with morality. So eating animagus meat is not cannibalism. But if those scientists making lab-grown meat decided to grow some human meat, eating it would still be cannibalism, even though it never belonged to a person.

Eating animagus meat is basically the same as eating a goblin pie: it's not cannibalism, but I also wouldn't exactly trust anyone who knowingly does it.
