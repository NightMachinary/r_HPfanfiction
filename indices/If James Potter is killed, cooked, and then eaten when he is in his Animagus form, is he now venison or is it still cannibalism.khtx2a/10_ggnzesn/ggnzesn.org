Wouldn't it be a little similar to eating transfigured flesh? In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/68543/chapters/90504][The Innocence of Wolves]], Lupin accidentally kills Snape in Hogwarts (i.e., James doesn't save Snape in time). The Marauders transfigure a bit of Snape and each eat some (so Mooney isn't the only cannibal). Even though the flesh is transfigured into cake, it's still cannibalism. I think the same principle applies here. Also, as others have said, intent and foreknowledge defines whether or not it's cannibalism.
