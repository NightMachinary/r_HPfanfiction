It's still cannibalism. If you eat a pulled pork sandwich that was actually a pulled human sandwich you're a cannibal. Even if you didn't know, you still ate human. It was an accident but it still happened.

I won't be cannibalism if: A vampire ate him A Veela ate him A goblin ate him Any sapient magical being eating a human is not cannibalism. You could also argue that muggles eating wizards is also not cannibalism.
