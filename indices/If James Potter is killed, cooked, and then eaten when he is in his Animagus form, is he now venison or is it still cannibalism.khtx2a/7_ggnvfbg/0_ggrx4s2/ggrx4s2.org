Cannibalism only refers to species eating other members of that same species. So by the definition of cannibalism it wouldn't be. The fact that James is human most of the time is a technicality in his stag form, because his body, at that point in time, is entirely stag with a human mind controlling it. I think that would also entail a stag brain, reflexes, and unconscious urges.

So it probably isn't cannibalism unless his body somehow reverts back, which I highly doubt it would since magic is what allowed his body to change and magic is heavily dependent on exertion of will, not only to change things, but also to change them back.
