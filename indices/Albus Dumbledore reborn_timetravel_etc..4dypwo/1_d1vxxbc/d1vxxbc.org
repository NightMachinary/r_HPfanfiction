There is [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-next-great-adventure-dresden-files-harry-potter.22941/][The Next Great Adventure]], which is a Dresden Files/Harry Potter crossover.

/Summary: Albus Dumbledore came to the end of his story in his world. Fortunately, or maybe less fortunate for him, fate decides he wasn't quite done and whisked him away to world filled with monsters, magic and other miracles. How does a tired old man deal with everything the Dresden Verse can throw at him?/
