i've read Wastelands of Time, but honestly the first fic that popped into my is from another fandom entirely: Fallout 3: Aqua Vitae By commandocucumber, which is obviously part of a series of stories that's a novelization of Fallout 3. including a section where a Brotherhood of Steel group journeys to Point Lookout. where they encounter problems with Ug-Qualtoth (think Cthulu) and it's followers. it's honestly pretty damn creepy. and pretty much a straight up horror novel.
