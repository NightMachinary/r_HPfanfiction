Oh, I know. In the game it's only mentioned, never actually seen, but I was more asking if it was a proper Lovecraftian Horror fic or just cosmetically so than whether 'ole Ug-Qually was actually present or not. Which I suppose is Lovecraftian in and of itself, since a Great Old One actually being present would mean the end of human reality.
