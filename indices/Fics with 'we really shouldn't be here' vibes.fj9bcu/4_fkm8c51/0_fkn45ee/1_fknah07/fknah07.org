and i actually misspoke. it's actually set after the events of FO3. and when the Lone Wanderer (an established badass at this point)) hears that they sent an expedition to Point Look Out, he freaks the fuck out because he's been there, and refuses to ever go back.

of the expedition sent there, three survive, with one of those three staying behind to distract the creature while the other two flee. and they only survived due to help from Obadiah Blackhall, who the LW makes a deal with in order to ensure their safe return. he returns the book he stole while on the island. he'd planned on destroying it, but after getting it, he was so traumatized and scared he just wanted to get the hell off the island and never come back.

the series also ties into the other fallout games in the main series, including appearances from the Vault Dweller and the Chosen One, and making the Legion a much bigger threat than in the games, with Sallow just being the "Western" Emperor, and the "Eastern" one being very much into advanced technology, though i won't go into any more detail than that to avoid spoilers.

overall, while the story isn't quite on the level of New California Dreaming by Hotpoint; the basics of which is a current NCR Ranger, former 1st Recon soldier, is sent on a long term, long distance recon mission to find out what the hell the brotherhood is doing on the east coast. said Ranger is a relative of the Chosen One. named Cassidy (after the FO2 Character) Nagor (his uncle) Coyle. he arrives in the capital wasteland shortly before the events of FO3; at least Commando Cucumber's series isn't abandoned like Hotpoint's is.
