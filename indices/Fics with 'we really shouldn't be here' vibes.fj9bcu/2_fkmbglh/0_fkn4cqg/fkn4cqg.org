I've only read the first on that list, but I loved it - as you say, a nice slow descent into creepy-horror. Slow, insidious, non-jumpscare/gore-and-torture-porn horror is best horror.

The summaries and first chapters of the rest look interesting! I've added them to the to-read list, so thanks for the recs!

Also, I love that the summary of Diablerie answer to 'what year is it' is 'september' first and the year second. Nice contrary detail there. :D
