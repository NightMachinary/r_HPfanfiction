In linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19437019][Ten Tips to Tranquility]] by bking4) there's a point where there's a real oh-no-don't-continue-this-will-not-end-well. Dumbledore has this realization but it's too late. It's fun and tiny bit creepy, all though it seems quite normal at first.

The entirety of linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279][Still Life with Skull]] by TheDivineComedian) has an intense feeling of wrongness, with everything being /just/ off. It's more of a slow realization of how not right the situation is.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16697380][Diablerie]] by Oceanbreeze7) is quite dark and there are some pretty uncomfortable moments where the entire vibe is jesus-tom-get-out-of-there. There's some points where Riddle realizes he needs to get out /now/, but it's always too late.
