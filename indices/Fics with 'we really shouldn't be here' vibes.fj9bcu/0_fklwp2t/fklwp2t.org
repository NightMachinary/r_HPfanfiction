linkffn(To Play the Devil by The Wayland Smith) has quite a bit of that with the Extremely Spooky Forest, and is generally frickin' awesome.

If "getting along quite well" is sarcastic and involves buckshot, I believe you're thinking of linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure). It's old and it's pretty great. It was also one of the early examples of a characterization of Luna that some sneer at today. "OH JOHN RINGO NO!" readers should stay away, but "OH JOHN RINGO YES!" people will probably love it.
