I'd go with historical reasons. Witches and wizards were burned by muggles before they went into hiding. That'd be a pretty good reason for me to want to keep it a secret. Humans fear what they don't know and I wouldn't be too surprised if we started burning witches and wizards again. There's also a cultural aspect of muggle borns not knowing (and not caring to learn) about wizarding traditions. They often try to force their muggle views into this new world without understanding this world first. House elves might really be slaves, but they might just as well really be a magical race that gets their powers from servitude and values serving others above anything else (just like it might seem weird to Americans how non confrontational many Asian countries are as there's a difference in values - personal freedom vs community).
