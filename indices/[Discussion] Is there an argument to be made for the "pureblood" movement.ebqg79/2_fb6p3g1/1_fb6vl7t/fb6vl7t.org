Harry liking a pureblood with different ideology is the whole reason I posed this question. I wanna write a flawed relationship built on stepping outside their comfort zones. Honestly, canon's post DH ending is rather boring; I wanna see what the two arguments that is subtly hinted at in the HP universe looks like between two people falling for each other.

Grindelwald and Dumbledore fought against each other with the exact same idealogies; and yet were canon lovers. So.. is it that far of a stretch for a muggle-raised wizard with pureblood family ties to try to understand the pureblood ideology, without disrespecting his muggleborn friend?
