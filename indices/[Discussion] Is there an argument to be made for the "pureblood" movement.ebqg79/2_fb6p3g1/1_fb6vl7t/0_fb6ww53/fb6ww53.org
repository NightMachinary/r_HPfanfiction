I totally get the intent...I just don't know how you can have an in character Harry falling for someone who thinks his mother and best friend shouldn't have been allowed in Hogwarts. Different ideologies is one thing...what you are proposing would be two people on entire opposite ends of the spectrum. It would be tantamount to someone's best friend being black and then dating someone in the KKK. I'm not sure the best friend would buy that you are just trying to understand the white supremacist ideology.

If you are going for a somewhat in character Harry than your Grindelwald/Dumbledore analogy doesn't work. Dumbledore as a young man was seduced by glory and power...that was a big reason he was attracted to Grindelwald. Canon Harry wants nothing to do with those things. Besides, Grindelwald and Dumbledore's differing philosophical ideologies are what drove them apart.

If the pureblood ideology is about being separate from muggles and thinking muggleborns should respect and integrate into wizarding tradition I could see it working.
