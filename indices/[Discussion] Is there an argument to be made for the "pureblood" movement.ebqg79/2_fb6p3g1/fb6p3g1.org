1. Wizards have just as many wars as muggles. The pureblood movement is the specific cause of the last two wars. Wizards are just as bad as muggles as far as abusing power. I think it would be a pretty hard sell for Harry to agree that muggles are war mongers hungry for power when a Wizard obsessed with power killed his parents and was on another killing spree presently.
2. This doesn't make sense based on your premise that Daphne wants to push out muggleborns. If magic is an expression of your soul muggleborns with magic would have that same presence in their soul. This logic would be the argument FOR muggleborns to be more included in wizarding society, not less.
3. Without any proof of such a thing this is nothing a reasoned, logical person could accept. I can see Harry walking out of the room as soon as this idea was posited.

Honestly, unless you make Harry very OOC I can't see any scenario where he would be romantically involved with anyone who want to push out muggleborn. His mother was a muggleborn. His best friend is a muggleborn. As soon as Daphne told Harry "muggleborns couldn't be trusted" Harry would nope out immediately. It would be plausible if she was simply arguing that Wizarding society should continue to be kepts separate from Muggle society but pushing out muggleborns would be tough to pull off.
