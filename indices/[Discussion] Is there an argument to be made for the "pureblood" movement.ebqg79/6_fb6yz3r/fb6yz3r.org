There's also the belief that they wouldn't contribute anything to society. Or be able to bring anything into marriages.

​

Besides the blood bigots, I would wager that quite a few Traditional Pureblood families would fight among themselves if a muggleborn/half-blood was an up and coming potion master/spellcrafter/warder/etc with a boatload of inventions under their belt and tons of potential for more.

​

In Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!, Narcissa saw Hermione's jinxed contract, found out they were spells she invented and called their marriage a "proper pureblood marriage". Of course, in that fic, family magic and spells were everything. Potters were good for warding, Weasleys were good for fertility magic, Fudge was good for sewage systems, Malfoy for hair tonics and getting out of contracts, and Luna's Grandmother's family was good for soul flaying magic.

​

In He's Not Dead Yet, there's family magic, where if a family does a trade for so long, it becomes "in their blood" and future decedents are born with an affinity for it. Sometimes it skips generations because of different families marrying into others and whatnot. One generation could get the MAIN family magic, and the next could get something from a family that joined in generations ago.
