There's that thing that happened in Wizarding America. A dumb as a stump witch fell for a Magic hating Muggle. He took her wand and came close to exposing Magic to the world in the late 1800s. Pottermore/Wizarding World goes more indepth about it.

I read a fanfic about Daphne being forced into a contract with Harry at birth and him trying to get to understand her and her side, see what the other is like before wands have to be drawn, to paraphrase the fic. Called Contractual Invalidation. Maybe that can give you some inspiration.
