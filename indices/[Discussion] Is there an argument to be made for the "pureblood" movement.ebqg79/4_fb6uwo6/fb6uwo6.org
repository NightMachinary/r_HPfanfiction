If you're obsessed with heritability of magic you could have some pseudo-science of tracking and combining family lines to produce powerful wizards. Muggleborns could legitimately upset such schemes due to their lack of magical history and their status as wild cards could disincentivize marrying them.

The cultural tensions between Wizarding and Muggle raised people living in the same society are notable, as is mentioned above, but furthermore the Magical Economy would likely be tilted in favor of Purebloods and Half-Bloods who have been there for generations and control crucial assets and magical resources. Muggleborns would be overwhelmingly poorer immigrants who would have difficulty acculturating and assimilating and could resent the people in power- the same people who lean towards blood supremacy.

The split loyalty of Muggleborns between the two worlds is a noteworthy reason. Wizards are not underground for the Muggle's benefit- Muggles were and are an existential threat to them. The potential breach to the Statute of Secrecy a rogue or careless Muggleborn could cause is massive, and even cooperative Muggleborns raise the risk of exposure by living in close proximity to their Muggle families and communities.

Also, as Wizards live longer lives than Muggles and have longer memories, there could be a lot of distaste towards all things Muggle as a result of the witch-burnings that killed many of their brethren, disproportionately their children. Note that Hogwarts is a hidden, magically defended castle- castle's are defensive military structures. Putting all the magic using kids there and then hiding it BEFORE THE STATUTE OF SECRECY should illustrate how serious of a problem that was. (I don't know if it's obscure canon or fanon but I've heard it said that Slytherin's objection to Muggleborn students was that they might lead their muggle families and armies right to Hogwarts and help destroy it because of their own religious or personal convictions against witchcraft. If it's not canon it should be- I love it).
