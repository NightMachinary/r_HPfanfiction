As presented in canon by JK Rowling, blood prejudice is plain, unadorned bigotry. It's possible that she chose not to explain any pureblood arguments in order to make it clear that their bigoty is unbiased, or it could be for another reason.

In fanfiction, where options can be explored I think it is better to maintain that pureblood bigotry is still bigotry and is rooted in ignorance at best and blind hatred at worst. Reasons and explanations should be superfluous or overcomable, but blown out of proportion by bigotry.

My favorite examples for "moral high ground" pureblood ideology.

- They don't have anything against mudbloods as a concept, but they don't trust muggles because muggles are violent towards things they don't understand. Obscuri, Harry, and other abused children are eveidence that muggles shouldn't raise magical children. Efforts to establish policies that remove muggleborn from their parents are rejected as horrible and inhumane. Pureblood efforts are villified, which raises contention as purebloods consider leaving any magical child in the care of muggles to be cruel and unfeeling. Muggleborn adults get caught up in this fight as they defend their parents and families and continue to fight against this, building up a general feeling of resentment for muggleborn.

- Muggleborn are like immigrants in the eyes of Purebloods, they are leaving the muggle world to join the magical world without making any effort to learn the culture, the quirks of the language, or anything. Something they consider highly rude. Muggleborn demand political concessions and revolutionary changes without understanding what they are asking for or why things are the way they are. They also don't like the idea of muggleborn's habits of maintaining "dual citizenship" and think that they should abandon the muggle world.

- Muggleborn children are the biggest threat to the statute of secrecy. They are immersed in the magical world for most of the year and then thrown back into the muggle one every summer with all the filters of a preteen/teen.

- They are afraid of muggles, their technology, and their capacity for warfare, both on a weaponry and manpower basis. Every muggleborn is a risk that they will reject the statute of secrecy and try to tell the muggle world about magic in a way that can't be fixed. Unprecedented chaos is expected.

These ideas work well as pureblood "talking points." Concepts that more well educated pureblood supremists might believe and feel strongly about as justification for their learned bigotry growing up around other pureblood supremesists. Blurbs that more heavily bigoted people will drop without ever thinking about them as proof that their bigotry is right. The best way to work it in my mind is that for any kernel of truth a pureblood talking point has, it contributes to a general sense of bigotry that is more than the sum of any arguments for the pureblood movement.
