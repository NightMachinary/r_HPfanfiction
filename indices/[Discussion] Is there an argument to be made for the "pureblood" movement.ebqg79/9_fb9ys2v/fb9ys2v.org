Magical ability should have its own selection pressure on the human genome. Muggleborns and halfbloods are usually very dangerous, erratic, combustive individuals, that aren't adapted to long term exposure to magic. And hey, look at Dumbledore, Riddle, Potter, Granger, all these reckless people causing mayhem. Better to be a well-bred individual of known provenance, sane, avoiding deadly novelty.
