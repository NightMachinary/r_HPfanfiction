Reasons to keep out muggleborns:

1) They, muggleborn, are foreigners who keep pushing their culture onto the existing one claiming their is better.

2) Purebloods have more in common with other purebloods around the world than muggleborn from their own country.

3) Why should the purebloods change? If the muggleborn don't like it move and start your own country. Further on this, they are a few centuries behind, Colonialism was absolutely still a thing. So go forth and bother someone else.

4) Magic is a gift not to be squandered, it must be treated with respect as it is alive, and muggleborn treat it like it's just some unknown fancy science.

I could maybe hammer out a few more but those seem to fit the style you seem to be looking for. Culture, Incompatibility, Forced Integration when Alternatives exist, and Magic Religous slant. Hope they help!
