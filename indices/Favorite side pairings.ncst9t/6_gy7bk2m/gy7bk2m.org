By side pairing you mean one that isn't the focus of the fic?

It can depend, as writers can come up with some interesting combinations or can write ships I don't particularly like well, but here are a few: Bill/Fleur, Theo/Daphne, Draco/Astoria, Ron/Pansy, Ron/Luna, Theo/Harry, Theo/Luna, Blaise/Ginny, Ginny/Luna, Victor/Hermione.
