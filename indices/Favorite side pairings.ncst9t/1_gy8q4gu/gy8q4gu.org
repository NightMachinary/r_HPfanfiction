I love pretty much any background wlw or mlm. Dean/Seamus is a classic of course, and I always love seeing Parvati/Lavender as well. Luna/Ginny will always be one of my favorites.

If Ron's not in the main pairing I do like to see him in a side one, cause he's underappreciated and he deserves love.

I'm pretty happy with most pairings if they're done well, I'm not the sort to hate ships just for conflicting with my faves, it's just another way things could go. Then again, my favorite "pairings" are big complicated webs of polyamorous relationships, so maybe I'm the outlier lol
