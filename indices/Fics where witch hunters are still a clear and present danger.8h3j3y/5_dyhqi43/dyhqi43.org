A way you could deal with some of the problems inherent with this idea is make an AU where some people are born (even if non-magical) completely immune or resistant to mind-altering affects. Maybe this witch-hunter organization is really big on tracking down and recruiting them as memebers and they act as a sort of elite assassin. It wohld be a cool idea. Someone should write it.
