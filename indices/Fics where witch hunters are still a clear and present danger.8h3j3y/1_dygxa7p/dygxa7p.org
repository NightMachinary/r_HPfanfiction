Not quite what you seem to be looking for, but, consider checking out With Strength of Steel Wings. It has a private group of muggles who are somewhat aware of he wizarding world and are up to some fairly devious shit. Don't want to say more and give too much away. All in all an excellent read

You could also try the firebird trilogy, again, certain muggles are aware of wizards and get up to devious shit

This is an excellent read too
