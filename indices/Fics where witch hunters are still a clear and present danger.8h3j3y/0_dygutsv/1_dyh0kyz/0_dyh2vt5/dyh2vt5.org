That's a movie only affect. In the books, at most they're shown to snuff out the visibility of local light sources, including starlight. But even in the movies, there's not so much a cold spot as there is just a 360 degree frost effect. I still think the Muggles would fail to find anything. They're invisible and if they go to an Unplottable or otherwise magically hidden location, they won't find it.
