Hmm...I wonder...what if you had a story where a dementor attack was caught on camera?

They're invisible to normal light, of course, only witches and wizards can see them (whether other magical creatures can, I'm not sure). But they have an extremely blatant effect of freezing up the nearby surroundings, messing with the weather and putting out the lights.

So, what if one were caught on a thermal-imaging camera? A vaguely humanoid cold spot that's seen swooping towards several people in turn, leaving them in a seemingly-incurable vegetative state? Or, if they disrupt electronics (like Hogwarts supposedly does), that would be suspicious in itself, a sudden unusual winter storm followed by all electronics going static-y and gutting out.

Imagine it; a livestreaming hitchhiker, talking to his YouTube fans as he goes, when the weather unexpectedly goes cold, clouds come from nowhere to block out the skies, nearby plants start wilting and little puddles left over from the rain turn to ice.

The hitchhiker guy starts to tremble, right as the livestream starts to turn to static. Confusion follows for the viewing audience; some are worried, some think it's a prank, the hiker's family tries desperately to ring him. Search parties are eventually sent out to his last known position, and there they find him, in a cold, vegetative state.

He's immediately taken for medical care, but the doctors can't find what's wrong; no evidence of external, or internal injuries, can explain why he won't wake up. Their only option is to go back to where he was found and follow the trail of ice and wilted plants, in hopes of perhaps finding the cause...
