I guess either they do have some kind of weapon to even the playing field, the witch hunters aren't entirely human, or they have ingenuity in spades.

Ideas on your points:

- complex verification measures and hidden archives to combat memory/imperious
- stick to crowded areas to use statute against the wizards (they can hardly release dementors in the middle of a crowded city) or employ secrecy - if they don't know who to kill, they can't.
- turning muggle governments is interesting, but how would they do this without further endangering the statute?
- I think defences against this are covered by the first few, and the use of heightened security/long range weapons and/or communication.
