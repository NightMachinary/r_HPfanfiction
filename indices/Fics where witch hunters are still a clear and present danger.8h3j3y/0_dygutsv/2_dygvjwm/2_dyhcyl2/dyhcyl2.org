How's this:

Hunters were created by Wizards themselves to kill their enemies. Hunters were made by ripping half of a wizards magic out (this kills the wizard) and placing it within the belly of a pregnant muggle. The half-magic that was removed is completely defensive in nature. The child that is born is anti-magical.

What the wizards of old did not know is that this counter magic was also self-preserving. When a Hunter dies a new Hunter is born somewhere else. Many of them do not know they have this anti-power within them but there are always X number of Hunters in the world.

Wizards themselves have an odd relationship with Hunters.

In Africa they are considered to be a more useful Squib and usually inducted into the magical world and raised for various things from farming dangerous magical plants that they are immune too to taking care of magic creatures that just do not affect them.

In Europe they are killed on discovery. This creates a common situation where young Hunters start becoming aware of magic that affects crowds but not them. They survive one or more attempts on their life and learn to avoid wizards. Hunter groups will investigate and often find these people and invite them to join their militia. Thus the wizards own actions perpetuate an on-going militarization of people who are immune to magic.

Transfiguration is the primary method of killing a Hunter, usually by making a golem that hits them over the head with non-magical objects laying around. Basically make a golem from the asphalt of a road and have it brain them with a street lamp or throw a dumpster at them.
