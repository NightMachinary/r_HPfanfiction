  complex verification measures and hidden archives to combat memory/imperious

These are already present in a world with no (one hopes) hidden magical threat. Accountability and record-keeping have been an ongoing thing from the year dot, rising to their current committees-for-everything and audit-trails-everywhere level as absolutism and dictatorship died out.

  turning muggle governments is interesting, but how would they do this without further endangering the statute?
#+end_quote

Modern government in developed countries is sufficiently non-autocratic and distributed that your hypothetical wizard wouldn't just have to enthrall the decision-maker, but all of his colleagues and everyone they're accountable to /and/ cover up the paper trail and hide everything from the internal audit department to boot. It'd be a full-time job for a whole team of wizards per each government department they wanted control of and at least a few watchers in the departments they /didn't/ want control of. And every point of interaction is a potential mistake that blows the statute and makes future control harder by reason of everyone being on their guard...
