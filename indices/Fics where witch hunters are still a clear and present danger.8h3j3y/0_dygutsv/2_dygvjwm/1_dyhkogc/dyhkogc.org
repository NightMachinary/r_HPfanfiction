  complex verification measures and hidden archives to combat memory/imperious
#+end_quote

These would have absolutely no effect at combating Imperius. One can simply compel the victim to perform normally to fool such procedures.

#+begin_quote
  stick to crowded areas to use statute against the wizards (they can hardly release dementors in the middle of a crowded city)
#+end_quote

...But Muggles can't see Dementors. Voldemort literally released them into London and no one had any inkling it was anything supernatural.

#+begin_quote
  turning muggle governments is interesting, but how would they do this without further endangering the statute?
#+end_quote

Simply turn the appropriate people into sleeper agents via Imperius. I don't know why this would endanger the SoS at all.
