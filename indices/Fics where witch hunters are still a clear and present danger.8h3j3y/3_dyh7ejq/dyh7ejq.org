I agree that without magic of their own, muggle witch hunters won't be a threat to wizards. If they get bothersome, the Minister of Magic informs the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has the "religious, delusional fanatics" taken care of by the police.

I've written "Uncle Quentin's Spy", a crossover with Buffy, where the Watcher's Council hunts some dark wizards and witches (and is quite feared among the general population of Wizarding Britain) but they recruit muggleborn witches and wizards, and their reputation is at least partially based on a bluff. And, as mentioned, they hunt dark wizards once they attack muggles, not all wizards.
