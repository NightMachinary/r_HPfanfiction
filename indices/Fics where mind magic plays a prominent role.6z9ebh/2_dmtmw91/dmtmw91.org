From what I remember [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][Harry Dursely and the Chronicles of the King]] is drowning in mind magic. You'll probably want to jot down notes on important plot twists if you're planning on stretching it out over a few weeks because it's easily one of the most complicated and confusing fics I've ever read.

Edit: I just realized that this might not fit your request entirely, most of the magic is being used on him. I still recommend you read it though.
