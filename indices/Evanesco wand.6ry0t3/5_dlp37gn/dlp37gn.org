I'd say Ollivander makes sure his wands are warded against that kind of munchkinism. (Maybe that's one of the ways Gregorovitch wands sucked compared to his.) As for vanishing /people/, we're shown in canon that vanishing living beings gets exponentially more difficult the more complex and more magical the creature is. Vanishing humans seems to be like something probably only someone like Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort or Merlin could have done in a diuel, and with more concentration needed than for any other curse.
