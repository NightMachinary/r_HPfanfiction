Snapped because it was also damaged, and a good part of that damage was inflicted by the Whomping Willow, a pretty magical...creature? Thing. I'd like to think a wand is pretty resilient to mundane accidents. Neville's pretty classically clumsy, but even his wand lasted til Dolohov snapped it.

Wands are described as being kinda alive - choosing a wizard, switching allegiances, and acting on their own, like Harry's did against Voldemort. So I'd think they'd be more resilient, just like wizards and witches are.
