Second lesson as I recall. Possibly even later

They started on snails as the first animate objects they vanish. Then they moved on to mice. And Hermione is mentioned to be able to vanish a kitten.

So I'm guessing a variety of factors is at play. Size, state of matter, and degree of sapience all seem to be factors.
