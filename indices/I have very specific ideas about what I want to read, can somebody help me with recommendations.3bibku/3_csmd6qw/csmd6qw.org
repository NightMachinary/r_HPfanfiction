I could rec some stuff to you, but honestly? Just check the HP stuff in my favorites on my fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3049623/thelegendarysupernerd][profile page]]. If you want something specific, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]. Don't let the summary stop you, it's one of my favorites. If you still don't like it after the first 3-5 chapters then don't bother, but I think it's well worth the read.
