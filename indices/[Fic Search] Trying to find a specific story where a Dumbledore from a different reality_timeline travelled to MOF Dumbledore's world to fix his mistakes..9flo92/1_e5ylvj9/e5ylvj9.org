Hmm...very fix-fic, upgrading the light side without raising corresponding challenges. There were a few interesting plot points, though, that I don't think I've seen elsewhere, like adding a new station for the Hogwarts Express to let parents visit regularly.

A somewhat interesting read, but would need some more substantial conflict to make it great.
