I always thought that was pretty dangerous for something you really don't want broken like your leg bumps the edge of a desk and snap there goes the wand or you squat down and snap there goes the wand. Idk always confused me. Edit: it's also like what 11inchs so it's gotta stick out the top of the pocket quite a bit and if anything that increases its chance of shaping doing something as simp as squatting down if you weren't careful.
