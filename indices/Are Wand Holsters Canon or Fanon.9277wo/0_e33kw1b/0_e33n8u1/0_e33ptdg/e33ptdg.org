In book 4, during the Quidditch World Cup, Barty Crouch Jr steals Harry's wand because it was sticking out of his back pocket.

Harry's wand is 11 inches.

Until now I have never really considered the logistics of wand sizes and storage.

Even if the pocket was big enough, with Harry being skinny and the pocket being on the rear, sitting down with even most of it inside would snap it.

So either Harry's an idiot, risking snapping his want and losing a buttock, or he's an idiot who's wand sticks out more than it sticks in.

And in both cases, Rowling probably did not think about wand storage.
