If Harry is wearing Dudley's way way too big jeans like in the beginning, then I could buy it. I've worn men's jeans that could swallow some pretty big things, and if they were even baggier, I'd believe it.

But properly fitted clothing? No.

Personally? I like the idea of long but narrow pockets in robes that hold the wands. I came across that idea in /The Fairy Godmother/ by Merdedes Lacky (it's a good book, see if your library has it), and when a character gets her wand, there's a pocket in her dress for it and I /love love love/ that idea!
