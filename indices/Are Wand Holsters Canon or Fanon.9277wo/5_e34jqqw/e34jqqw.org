After a brief search, I've found only one mention of the word "holster" on the whole of pottermore, and it's a behind-the-scenes about the last movies:

  And even though he still sports the cane, Lucius was given a wand holster that incorporates snake heads in its design for battle scenes. For /Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1/ and /Part 2/, after Lucius returns from a stint in Azkaban, his costumes were distressed and his hair is dishevelled as he had been beaten down from his experience.

Pretty much a fan and movie addition, then. But a very sensible one I think.
