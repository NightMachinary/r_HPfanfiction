I don't see how this is such a big deal. Wand holsters make perfect sense, as could any number of alternatives that work exactly in the same manner, the purpose being storing the wand and offering easy access. So it doesn't really matter whether they kept it in their pockets or in holsters or somehow else, so far as it wasn't that big of a problem and there was a solution, which clearly there was, or Rowling would have pointed out these "accidents" a lot more(as opposed to never). So use whatever you want in your fanfic if you're that worried about sticking to canon in cases like this, as long as it makes sense in conjunction with it. And if you're not worried about that, the more reason not to care.
