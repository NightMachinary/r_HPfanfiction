I've seen one Fanfiction explain wands as being actually really strong, due to their magical nature, making it actually difficult to accidentally snap them. I think Ron's wand was explained by the whomping willow being actually a fairly powerful magical...thing, and hence was strong enough to break an already damaged wand.

But yeah, on the whole, I prefer holsters and special pockets. Makes more sense.
