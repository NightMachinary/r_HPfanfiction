The closest is Lucius keeping his wand inside his cane in the movies. Otherwise it's just pockets, like in the PoA film where Harry reaches behind Hermione's back and takes her wand from her pocket.

Still kinda stupid though, people would be snapping their wands all the time. This is an instance where the fanfic solution actually makes sense.
