I've seen plenty fics where the Goblins teach Harry various things, but from the top of my head the only one I can suggest right now is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2141337/chapters/4677915][Gringott's lesser known branch]] . In which Harry grows up in Gringott before attending Hogwarts. It's a bit clich√© with Harry being all cunning and political at 11 etc. There is a bit of bashing, I think. But the Goblin aspect is very interesting from what I remember.
