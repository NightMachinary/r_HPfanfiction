There is linkffn(Harry Potter, Heir of Gryffindor by Brent Braten). If I recall correctly, the created spell focuses on the common principles of different religious thoughts (Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism). Which may have been "the power of love, but also may have been more complex than that. This was written after OotP and before HBP and tropes abound though I remember reading it as it was being written and enjoying it. Not sure how well it has aged, though, so YMMV.
