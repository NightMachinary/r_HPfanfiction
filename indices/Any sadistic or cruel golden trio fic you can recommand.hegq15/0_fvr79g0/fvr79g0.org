[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/][Chapter 16, The Damned]], of "The random craziness File" by darklooshkin is exactly that.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), the Trio can be seen getting increasingly dark and cruel.

I won't say sadistic, but Harry and Hermione are really into killing in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005). Ron is more into combat strategies and tactics.
