We know potions work on muggles from cannon, so imagine they abandoned their child in an orphanage and later found he/she died to a disease easily cured by a potion ... Decent people don't abandon their children if they have any disabilities, even a sheltered pureblood without exposure to muggle world if they are decent can try to make sure their squib children are accommodated(house elves, enchanted objects, hire caretakers) as much as possible in magical world and provide options for them to live off comfortably in muggle world if they want later in life .. it's parents responsibility to care for their children to adulthood and provide as many options as possible.

I think the abandonment of children is wrong, taking care of them in muggle world is not.
