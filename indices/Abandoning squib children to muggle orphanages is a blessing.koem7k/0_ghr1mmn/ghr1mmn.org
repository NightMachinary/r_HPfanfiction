I seriously object to the whole idea that magic is so all-consuming that children without it should just be cut off to avoid disappointing them.

Sure, it would feel like a serious disability. So are blindness, deafness, and cerebral palsy. But children are born with those things, or develop them early, and their families still love them and care for them, and that's as it should be. Because the love of a family is more important than whether all family members are equally capable and employable.

Sure, it would be hard to grow up seeing magic and not having it. It would be hard to be the parent of such a child, too, and work through both your own disappointment and your child's. But any kind of rejection does nothing but make it harder.
