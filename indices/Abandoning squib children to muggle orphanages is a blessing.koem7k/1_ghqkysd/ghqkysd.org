Still, being abandoned by your family at age 11 isn't good either. It would be better to stay part of the magical family, but have them help by sending the kid to a muggle school, etc. Maybe they could have an arrangement with the parents of a muggleborn to help out each other's kids, shop for school supplies and stuff. They don't need to cut all ties to their own families though.
