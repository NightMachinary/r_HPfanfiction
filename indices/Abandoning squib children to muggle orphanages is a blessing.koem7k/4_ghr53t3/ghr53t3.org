I disagree, since there's more to the wizarding world than just being able to perform magic. If Squibs are forced to live as Muggles, they don't get to use magical objects, benefit from healing potions, follow Quidditch, and participate the culture they were raised in.

Furthermore, if we accept the fanon theory that Muggle-Borns descend from Squibs, by expelling Squibs you're increasing the odds that a magical child will be born to non-magical parents, which we know is problematic (e.g., the Evans sisters, persecution of Muggle-Borns, etc.).

I'm sure there are plenty of jobs within wizarding society that a Squib could perform (e.g. barrister, psychologist, primary school teacher, etc.). Or they could help bridge the divide between the Muggle and magical worlds, to the extent secrecy allows.

And yes, it would be cruel to essentially kick someone out of their family for having a disability, but other commenters have made that point already.
