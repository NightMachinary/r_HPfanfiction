Its all about cause and effect. More often than not the change in character happens in an instant due to some threat or even realization. Think about that happening in real life, especially something as massive as oh im a cinic or workoholic now. Not a small thing and not something that would happen like just like that, more likely slow and deliberate stages. How often do you see realistic stages of grief? And even then if the actions feel like they exist for the change in character rather than the other way around your fucked. A great tip is the but/therefore rule from the south park guys. "If you can put and then between all the beats of your story your fucked. Change the story so that those points inbetween are but or therefore and everything will feel more natural and flowing.
