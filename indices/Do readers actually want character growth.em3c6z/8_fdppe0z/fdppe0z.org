One of the best ways I've found to cut down on comments like that is to post the entire story, all at once. It's easier to stay engaged with a completed story than a story that you have to come back to every week (or month, or year) and reread to remember what's happening.

But to answer your question: it depends on the time frame of the story, how likable the character is, and what length. A story spanning a few hours won't get much character development; a story spanning a few years should have it as a primary focus. A character determined to do bad things for bad reasons will have people leaving the fic, no matter how much the character is developed later on. A 2k-word story won't develop a character the way a 200k-word story does.

The thing is, I'm reading (and writing) fic for fun. I'm not going to read a story that isn't compelling. That's not necessarily the same as "has traits I don't like". If a fic starts out with seven pages of "Harry was having the worst summer of his life and here's why", before we even get to the opening scene of him lying on his bed and staring at the wall before getting up to make breakfast for the Dursleys, I'm going to back out by page 4. If a story starts with Harry lying on his bed, staring at the wall, and thinking of how he can change something before getting up to make breakfast and, say, poisoning the food because he's decided murder-suicide is the way to go, I'm probably going to keep reading barring grammar/spelling/formatting errors making things unreadable. A great example of this is the Vahan Saga - Harry's learns weapons and how to lead his own gang of street rats before he even gets his Hogwarts letter. He's cold, ruthless, and overall a pretty awful person. I don't like that version of Harry as a person. But as a character, it's interesting to see how things play out, and to see how he grows into the role of a prepubescent mobster. Last I checked, his first year at Hogwarts was still being written.

I also prefer long, fluid character growth, and if there's a massive change (like, say, Snape deciding to adopt Harry in chapter 2 and Harry going along with it with no reservations), I'll back out, because it doesn't make sense. Even if it's the opening scene with flashbacks, I'll still back out - do the character development BEFORE you hit the never-gonna-happen scenes.

Don't worry about being impatient. It's not worth slogging through something you don't like on the off chance it might get better if you stick with it long enough. If you don't like it, back out.
