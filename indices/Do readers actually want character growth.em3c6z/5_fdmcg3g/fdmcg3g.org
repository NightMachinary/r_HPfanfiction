I like character growth quite a bit, but my tastes are pretty unusual.

I'm currently writing a fic where Lavender is overdramatic, can't really talk about her feelings, kinda careless, and judgmental. The fic is partially about the issues those traits cause her and how she learns as time goes on, but also how she can be all those things and still be a "good" person. I want her to be a dynamic character, like you talked about. It's harder to write, especially as a guy, but it feels rewarding.
