It depends on how it is done.

For example, the web novel Overgeared starts the protagonist out as an worthless, stupid, unlikable person - all in the name of character development. If you read the reviews of the story, many people say “Sure, he's pretty bad, but he gets a lot better after chapter 100.” So I am expected to slog through 100 chapters of unlikable main character because the author wanted a lot of character development. Fuck that...

Whereas A Practical Guide to Evil shows a lot of development in the protagonist, but she's interesting/likeable the whole time, not after hundreds of pages of “character development”.
