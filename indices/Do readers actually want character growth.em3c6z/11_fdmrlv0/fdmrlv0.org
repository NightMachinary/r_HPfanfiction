It is just the opposite: the character development is everything. I have wrote this [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][blog post]] which originated in the discussion here on Reddit about what I think about the development of a story.

Having said that, there are just some character developments where readers may disagree. Either because they are missed the point of what the author wanted to say, or perhaps because the author just wrote something bad.

I don't want to name any, but all those stories where Harry gets snapped by somebody (Andromeda Tonks, Amelia Bones, Grangers) and suddenly he completely changes into spoiled superhuman prat, who forgets all above his former friends and is now super!Harry, indy!Harry, lord!Harry, who cares about his new friends/girlfriends Heiress Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones (she is at least usually not that obnoxious) or Hermione, and kicks off as a dirt anybody who socialized with him in the past as just a childish nonsense. Yeah, that is just unbelievable and badly written character development, because that is just not the person JKR wrote about (if you need to explain why, you are a lost cause).

So, other possibility than the hasty judgement over the stupid readers who don't like character development may be that the author just made a shoddy work with it.
