I think it's true in most cases. Fanfiction is mostly read by people who want to read about their favorite characters. They want something familiar. And character growth is mostly not on the menu unless it's similar to how canon developed those characters.

The number of threads/posts criticizing authors for things that they decide to do different than canon, long essays telling how things went down in canon and insistence on keeping it same are far too common.

I think people, in fandom, prefer it more if characters stays same in story (preferably similar to canon - the only exception being Harry Potter but even that is accepted barely on this subreddit), and goes through different situations.
