Short answer: fanfiction is mostly made for (and by) people seeking rapid wish fulfillment, so of course the majority is exactly that, which is not good story unless done ironically (can be turned into hilarity that way).

Long answer:

Most people (generally) get into fanfiction to see their insert character(s) be amazing or spectacular at whatever they do. To this end, the changes are almost always immediate or hand-waved and often used as a poor man's diatribe about "what is wrong in the canon story." Now, practically everyone starts in ff for exactly that - its popular because its what most people get into this pseudo-apocrypha for.

However, when people stick around for a time, have read enough fics to see the same tropes/styles/poor writing done ad infinitum, they start looking for something more. They mellow out, if you will. To that end they start looking for more realistic portrayals or more canon-like styles or something that truly stands out amidst the carbon copies.

Or more succinctly: most readers and writers of fanfiction don't care about character growth so much as character /empowerment/. But once they have grown tired of the rehashed characterizations, they either a) leave the fandom or fanfiction entirely or b) start looking for the needles in the hay stack.

So yes and no basically.
