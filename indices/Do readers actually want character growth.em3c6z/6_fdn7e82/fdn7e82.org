I think if you start off as drastically different from canon personality, and in a seemingly lazy way, people will be disappointed. Now, some people have their headcanon that will make even a canon personality for your characters seem like an issue.

For instance, if you start your fic with character bashing and making Ron completely useless, I don't particularly care if you've got him growing a lot throughout the next 30+ chapters - it's still something that makes it likelier I'll drop it early. A non-lazy one, though, is much more fun.

It all comes down to the writing quality for me - but I think most people find it easier to see character growth from a starting point they believe in, and the easiest there is to have the characters similar to how they are at that point in canon.
