In my experience - Yes, but not most readers.

I'm writing a trilogy of Harry/Daphne fics, the first two are published now (Reddit app is being a b*tch and won't let me link, but they're called Living Dangerously and Living in Secret on FF . Net) and they focus their relationship from a real world point of view - aka Harry and Daphne are dumb, self destructive and horny teenagers - and a lot of readers have gotten very annoyed at me in the reviews for this portrayal of them. For context it's written to be Daphne's story more than it is Harry's, and sees her dealing with her emotionally abusive family in realistic ways; she's constantly the victim of gaslighting, is sheltered from the real world and sports more than a few prejudice/racist feelings of her own because of these. These issues and others aren't immediately addressed as problems (because shocker, character development takes time to happen) and the story has been labelled problematic and Daphne a Nazi as a result. There was even one instance toward the end of the first book where Daphne makes good progress becoming more independent from her Death Eater father but then relapses through fear - which anyone who has been addicted to something or has tried deliberately to change their ways will know is a very common thing to happen. But that was instantly declared “a waste of character development” and many abandoned the story, for me that was when I realised I was writing mostly for myself and not for others.

If I was just a bad author then I could completely understand the critique of this portrayal as I know what it's like to read a story that has characters acting nonsensical and dumb, but there's still a decent amount of the reviewers (usually ones who actually sound like they know what they're talking about) who absolutely love the story, understand completely what I'm doing with it and praise the realistic approach.

So - and I acknowledge that I may just be speaking from the point of view of a sour author - in my experience there is genuinely a large amount of FF readers that DO want realistic/good quality character development in their story, but sadly there is a larger amount who just want a fairytale version of their character filled with enough average fluff to feed their fandom appetite for a few more days.

That's my bit of rant/free advertising done, anyone else have similar experiences to me? Would love to feel some validation
