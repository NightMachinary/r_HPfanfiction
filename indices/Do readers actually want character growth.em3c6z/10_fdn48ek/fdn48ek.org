I think it depends on the story and the reader.

some stories don't need character development, but people often act as if they do. An action story or one where a mystery is solved, don't need to change a character, if the plot and actions are the focus that can be enough.

now other stories need character development to be interesting. Those stories focus on characters and relationships and how and why those change.

And there are of course one-shots that just focus on a small moment and only present a moment in time without any changes or the need for a deep plot.

â€‹

All those are different and one is not better than the others on principle, but readers and writers prefer different things.

I personally I'm more of a character-driven writer and I need the decisions of the characters to make sense and they can't take a backseat to the plot, but that means that I sometimes kind of lose the plot and focus to much on the character development. At the moment I write a story about Lily Evans time in school and I know that it is not everybody's cup of tea
