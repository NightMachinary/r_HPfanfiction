One of my less popular fics has young Tonks starting out as an anti-werewolf bigot, which I think is to be expected considering the culture she grew up in. She only comes around later, after she falls for Lupin. A reader flounced off in a huff, commenting that Tonks was one of the good guys, therefore it was OOC for her to have any flaws. I just laughed and kept writing what I like. I don't write for readers like that.
