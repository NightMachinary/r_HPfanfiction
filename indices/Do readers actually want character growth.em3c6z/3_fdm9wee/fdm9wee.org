I never go off of the most recent comments/reviews on a fic. I go for the middle of the list or when the last chapter was made.

I tend to go look for warnings of bad grammar, "written by a middle school student", major character death out of goddamn nowhere.

But I agree. Any kind of character growth, or movement away from canon and it's "OMFWTFBBQ, THAT'S BASHING! BASHING IS EVIL!!!1 FUCK YOU AND YOUR MOTHER'S COUCH!"

I can stand wild character growth or movement from canon as long as the writing supports it.

Like this one: The Power, linkffn(5422914)

It /looks/ like your run of the mill bashing fic *at first glance*. But, as you go in you find out all sorts of stuff. Yeah, Dumbledore is an asshole in this fic, but you can't win everything. Ron looks bad too for a while until it's revealed that it is because of Dumbledore's meddling AND birth defects from potions while Molly was pregnant (Every sibling is brilliant in their own way except for him?). It really went deep into backstory and lore of the planet, magic, and society.

Back to the character growth of this fic: Harry makes a different decision and things start changing. He picked up a runes book at the start of summer and instead of putting it back down, started devouring it, wanting to be able to do magic during the summer. More stuff happens and his character starts to diverge from canon. Then all of a sudden he's snapped back to canon for reasons. Then the growth happens again, in a different direction.

Quite a few other characters have growth too, and it fits with canon in a weird way. Even with the background tweaking. Hell, even CRABBE and freaking GOYLE have character growth. Crazy, right? But it happens.
