This fic has some interesting elements, but I didn't really feel like Harry was a fluid character the way OP was talking about. His growth seemed kinda forced imo.

And sure, some fics develop past the bashing. I agree this fic does. Most fics don't and I understand why some people drop them instantly. I do if it seems particularly forced (or if it has bad H/Hr, which this fic does).

I tried reading a time traveling Harry fic and the old Harry said Ron was a no good drop out in the first chapter. Okay, fine. The next chapter talked about how he was going to ensure idiot Ron's destruction, how he never regarded him as a friend in the first place, and literally described Hermione as an angel. No thanks.
