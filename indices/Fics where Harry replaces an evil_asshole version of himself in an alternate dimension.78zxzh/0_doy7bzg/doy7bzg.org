Hmm...funny thing, a while ago I was planning to make a request where Harry swaps places with a dark!Harry alternate when they time travel, but I never got around to it.

Like, the idea being that a good!Harry, for whatever reason, tries going back in time after the final battle, but a dark!Harry also goes back in time after the final battle, so they end up in opposite universes somehow.

So good!Harry has no idea why Dumbledore is trying to obliviate him and/or flee the country, while dark!Harry is having trouble finding proof that Dumbledore is evil, and yeah.
