I can recall a fanfic where there's an AU!Harry who's a massive prick (similiar plot to Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived fanfics), and AU!Prick!Harry has a younger sister who he constantly taunts and looks down upon. but then good!Harry wakes up in the former's body and he's actually nice to said younger sister, which makes her initially suspicious it's just a ruse.
