Ok, there is one that kind of fits your request but it will take you awhile to get there. linkffn(darkness within by kurinoone)

I linked you the first part. The premise is that Harry grew up with Voldemort as a father and hated his real parents. There is absolutely no bashing, at all, so don't run away. The story is very emotionally complex.

But back to your request, in the 3rd part of this fic, AU dark!Harry swaps places with canon!Harry. Au!Harry is definitely an asshole, but not exactly evil. No one in this story really is and that is what I like about it, there are only shades of gray. The author can make you relate to any character, because they are not as cartoonish as in most fics. All three parts are complete and the rewrite of the 1st part is currently in progress.
