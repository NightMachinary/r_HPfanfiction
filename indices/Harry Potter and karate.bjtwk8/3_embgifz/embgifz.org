Ah I understand that logically in the context of the fanfic, such as the one you suggested make a logical attempt at its use. There are a number of fanfics that use it as means of defining or some cases redefining a character on the basis of a plot change. Again this is fine, but when this defining trait is used as padding and is wasted after the point. It is at this point that the inclusion of the plot point become useless, becoming something is harmful to progression of the story.

In the example you gave, the answer is logical and if I am remembering correctly; the characters use it as a progressive plot point.

Sorry about the rant in all honesty I see your point.
