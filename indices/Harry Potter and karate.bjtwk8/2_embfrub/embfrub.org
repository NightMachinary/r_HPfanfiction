Karate is actually not wrong. When reading linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) it seems completely logical that Muggle parents of kids who now are in danger, but cannot defend themselves magically (yet), will make these kids to train in karate to improve their reflexes, stamina, etc. What's wrong with it?
