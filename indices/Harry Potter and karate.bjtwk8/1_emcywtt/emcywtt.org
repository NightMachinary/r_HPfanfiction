One thing that took me out of a fic once was when the author gave Hermione a FREAKING PONTIAC GRAND AM, a car that:

1. Wasn't sold in the UK
2. Was from a brand that never sold cars in the UK
3. Would of been one of only 2000 Pontiac's in the UK at the time
4. Isn't even on the [[https://www.howmanyleft.co.uk/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=pontiac&commit=Search#][list of Pontiac's imported into the UK]] (though it might be in the "missing" category)
