Anachronisms: characters using things that weren't spread during the time the fic is taking place (mobile phone).

Characters using electronic devices in Hogwarts or any magical places. I mean, I'd read it if during the fic, they do something to solve that problem but when it's just there like the author forgot that's a thing, it's annoying.

Things that shows the author hasn't done any research. I remember reading a thing where Harry ended up at the hospital and was worried about the cost and that's a thing that's so typically American (and doesn't happen in most other developed countries, certainly not in Europe) it threw me out.
