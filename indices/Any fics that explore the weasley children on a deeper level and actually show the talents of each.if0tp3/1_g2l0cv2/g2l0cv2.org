There is one fic that I'm currently reading called The Chess Master. It's on FFN (I forget the author), and this fic really showcases Ron's skills at chess in it. It's still in progress, but it's my favorite Ron-centric fic as it really show him as a strong character..

Edit: I just looked up the fic that I was referring to, and I got the name completely wrong. The specific fic I was thinking of is called Fate by TheTrueSpartan.
