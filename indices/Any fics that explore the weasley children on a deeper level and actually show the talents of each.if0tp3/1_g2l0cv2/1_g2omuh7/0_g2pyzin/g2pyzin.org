Fate is an amazing Fic. Very long, nearly 3mil words, and while it does have it's complicated bits it's not so hard to keep track of. There is a bit of mindscrew in there, a bit of Chessmaster Ron, and a nice deepdive into some of the dynamics of the Weasley family that is frankly more accurate than what the books series touches on. It's a realistic look into the workings of Family Dynamics and shows good motivation for individual members of the family even outside of the world of this particular fanfic.

I have a MUCH better understanding of that particular family after reading this. I wonder if the author works in the field of Psychology?
