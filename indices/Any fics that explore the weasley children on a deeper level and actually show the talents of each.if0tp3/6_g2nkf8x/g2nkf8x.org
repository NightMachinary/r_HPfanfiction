the Prince of Slytherin series. not so much in the first book, but the second and third delve into Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, and on a lesser level Percy. it's a trope subversion fic, and most of the first book appears to be very trope-y, but most of that gets overturned later. there's more of a focus on Ron than the others, but Ginny and the twins get quite a bit of screen time and i've really enjoyed reading their interactions.
