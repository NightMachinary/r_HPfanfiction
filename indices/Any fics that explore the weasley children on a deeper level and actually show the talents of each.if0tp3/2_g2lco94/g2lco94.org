linkffn(Harry Is A Dragon And That's Okay)

We get to see Charlie do his job, to start, Ron gains an interest to be the first wizard to go to space, Fred and George are on peak form, Percy pulls off some really cool moments that come out of nowhere, Ginny gets to show off in quidditch, and Bill... is same as canon, cool as heck.

Secondly, there's [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54][my flair]], where Ginny becomes the secondary protagonist, Ron shows some great loyalty, Fred and George are again in peak form, and Percy gets a lot more exploration. And the story's premise of a Hinny soul-bond creates a lot of Weasley family conflict, and it is really well written and allows characters to grow and change.
