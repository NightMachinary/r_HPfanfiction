One of my favorite fics that I'm re-reading at the moment, although it's still ongoing, is called 'Percy Take the Wheel' by Kitty Smith on ffn. It's the only fic that I've read that really goes into depth into Percy's psyche, and makes him an incredibly sympathetic character that he often is not in fanfiction. I love this story, as it really explores the familial relationships between the Weasley siblings, in addition to exploring and developing magic in new and inventive ways. I really cannot recommend enough. Must warn you of major character death right from the get-go though. It's what sets up the premise for the whole story.
