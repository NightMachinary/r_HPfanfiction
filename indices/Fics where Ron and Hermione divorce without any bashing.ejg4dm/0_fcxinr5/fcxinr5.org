Unfortunately I have not come across a divorce fic for Hermione and Ron where the divorce is mutual, nonviolent, or anything other than an excuse for Draco and Hermione to get together. Most of the time, Ron is heavily bashed, called an alcoholic and abusive. If there are any nontoxic and mutual divorce fanfics for Ron and Hermione, I'd very much like to see it too.
