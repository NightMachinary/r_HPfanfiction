I've got a method for you: Dumbledore recognises that Harry's kinda evil, and takes him on as an evil apprentice. Eventually, as you'd expect, Harry betrays him - except Dumbledore has a failsafe, because he's not incompetent - and then Harry flees as a somewhat trained, but cut off from most of his resources, wannabe evil opponent.

It sounds pretty cliche, because it is, but it avoids the issue of 'I somehow took two years to catch up to an ancient and terrible sorcerer' by making said ancient and terrible sorcerer Harry's mentor.
