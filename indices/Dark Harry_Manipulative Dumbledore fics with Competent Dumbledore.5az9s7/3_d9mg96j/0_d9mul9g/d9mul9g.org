I'm writing one not with Evil!Dumbledore but dark(ish)!Harry, and he makes a lot of sacrifices. I'm also trying to figure out why Dumbledore doesn't believe the prophecy, knows Harry is a horcrux and doesn't just kill him and say there were no survivors. Because if he does believe in the prophecy, my writing partner and I decides Harry wouldn't be able to sneeze without Dumbledore knowing why.
