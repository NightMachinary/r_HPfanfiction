I started a highly competent and evil Dumbledore fic once. I may yet finish it, but the key problem was this: in the face of a really competent and evil opponent who has strong access to you and everyone around you, and exists in a world with things like memory alteration and compulsion magic, it's really hard figure out a plot that ends with the teenager with no experience surviving, let alone winning.. I couldn't get over that hurdle to a satisfying ending. I may yet figure out a mechanism to make it work that doesn't involve an inexplicably powered up teenager, but it isn't easy.
