This is true. I also realized I was thinking of Dumbledore in general. Thinking now, I must change my answer. Alone, Harry could never even start stopping evil/manipulative Dumbledore, I think. And no Sirius's letter to be sent after his death would work either. At the least I think Voldemort or someone of equal power/maneuverability would be the only kind of person to be able to "free" Harry. Keeping him free though is a whole different matter. I don't think Harry could "hide under his nose" once he's free. It would have to turn to straight up Harry/Allies vs Dumbledore guerrilla campaign.
