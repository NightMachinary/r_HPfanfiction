Gratz! I'm writing a fic similar, where Harry pits a not evil Dumbledore and a reasonably sane Voldemort against each other by playing both sides. Of course he's playing his own side too, since he wants to eradicate the parasites that prey on the weak and the weak that don't dare raise a hand against their oppressors (completely ignoring any hypocrisy in the process, mind you).
