Ah, now here you have an interesting notion. A plot in which Harry is cunning but weak and gets Voldemort and Evil!Dumbledore to destroy or at least radically weaken each other might work. The problem would be getting Harry into a position where he would even realize Dumbledore was manipulating him, which would likely need to be either some sort of accident or the result of Dumbledore making a mistake. A rational Evil!Dumbledore might still be too cunning to let anything slip. Perhaps Dumbledore (and Voldemort for that matter) aren't entirely sane --- after all, people who aren't entirely sane make mistakes, and one good reason for being dangerously evil is being somewhat off your rocker. Indeed, perhaps there might be a common cause to all of this.

(/Eureka!/)

And given all of that, I think I've worked through a set of major changes to a plot I've had percolating for years now in my "someday" bucket that I could never get to work before. Perhaps now it really will appear someday.
