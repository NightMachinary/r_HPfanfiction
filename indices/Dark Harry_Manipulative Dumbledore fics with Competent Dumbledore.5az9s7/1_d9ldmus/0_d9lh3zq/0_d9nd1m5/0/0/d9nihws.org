Well, this /is/ fiction we're talking about. Solutions, even somewhat implausible ones that the author manages to convince you of through skillful writing, are always possible. The point is that it is a harder thing to do and keep the reader from finding the plot implausible. However, a sufficiently good writer can probably pull almost anything off.
