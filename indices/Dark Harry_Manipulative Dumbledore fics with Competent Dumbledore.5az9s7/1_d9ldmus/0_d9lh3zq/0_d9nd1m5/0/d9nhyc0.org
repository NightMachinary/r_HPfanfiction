I don't think that's necessarily true. Can Dumbledore be beaten? Yes. Can it be done without major sacrifice, enormous risk and long term plans? No. Can it be done on a whim one summer? Absolutely not. It's basically luck and unpredictability and a lot more luck that would get Harry the win, and even then it could very well be a pyrrhic victory.
