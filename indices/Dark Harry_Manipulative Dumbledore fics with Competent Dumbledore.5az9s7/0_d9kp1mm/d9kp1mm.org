Now that you mention it, I really want to read fics like this as well. Quite a while ago, I read a (then unfinished, at least) fic where Evil Dumbledore, together with his bestest friend Evil Snape, spent at least a dozen chapters being killed continuously by Harry and friends (who also got super fairy powers along the way). They didn't figure out who was killing them by the time I lost interest and dropped the fic, but the reason they kept being killed so often was because they had Horcruxes. I remember Dumbledore being rather competent in this fic, such as having multiple (even one completely autonomous) ways of resurrection, bound by Unbreakable Oaths to force people to revive him. The setting was more in the light of Riddle rising up as a new Dark Lord (described as a 'Dark Slytherin') and wanting to depose Dumbledore (a 'Dark Ravenclaw') as Britains #1 Dark Lord, but got offed by Harry. Harry and crew are basically complete unknowns in the great game between Riddle and Dumbles, but both are cottoning on rather quick. If anyone knows the name of this fic, please link it as I want to see if it's finished yet.
