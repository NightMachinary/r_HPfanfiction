*The Katarn Side* - linkffn(11576387)\\
Kyle Katarn tries to retire, comes across Harry in the middle of a Harry Hunting session. Things evolve from there. Harry becomes his padawan.

Let's make this clear, Kyle Katarn is the Chuck Norris of Star Wars. People get kicked a lot. He doesn't like funny business.

On a side note, things are different back home. Harry doesn't return until fourth year.
