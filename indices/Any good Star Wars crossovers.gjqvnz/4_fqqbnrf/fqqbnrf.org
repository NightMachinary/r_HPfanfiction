There is also one I don't remember the name of in which Harry and Hermione are trained and have SW creature Animagus forms (Hermione has one that can travel through hyperspace lanes). I don't remember if it's the same one but there is also one where they go to help Hogwarts for a time and one of the Jedi die there and they find that Voldemort is in fact Pettigrew in disguise (not sure about this last bit). The Jedi are also worried because Harry uses Lightning but it's not the Sith version.
