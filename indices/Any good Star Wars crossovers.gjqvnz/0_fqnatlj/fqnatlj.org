I've got two that roughly match what your looking for, and one that is kinda what you're after but it's more so/so.

First - linkffn(10912355) *Revenge of a Wizard*. Earth is taken by the Empire for more slave labor and Harry finds himself alone, adrift in the galaxy, trying to find his way home and save his people. A really excellent Harry Potter meets Star wars fic that takes place within the original trilogy but quickly goes AU.

Second - linkffn(13569941) *What's a Gungan?* Harry falls through the Veil of Death while chasing after Sirius only to reappear about 50 meters in the air directly over Jar-Jar Binks. Harry then steps into the Star Wars Universe during the Prequels as he searches for Sirius and deals Jedi and Sith who are all curious about his origins.

Third, and this one only barely matches what your after - linkffn(7718942) *Broken Chains*. This story takes place mostly in the Harry Potter universe but it does make a short stop in Star Wars. Harry falls through the veil and is assumed dead until, nearly a month later, his body is shot out like a cannon ball. It's quickly realized that this person is no longer Harry Potter at all, but a sith named Darth Shaddix who's mind has been completely overwritten by the Emperor. Hermione is the only one that seems to be able to reach past the Shaddix personality and reach to Harry Potter hidden underneath

Personally the third one is my favorite of the bunch but it just happens to hit all the buttons in a story I like.
