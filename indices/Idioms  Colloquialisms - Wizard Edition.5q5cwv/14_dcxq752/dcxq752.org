I don't know about specific colloquialism, but the HP world definitely use a very old-fashioned, Enid Blyton-esque kind of language, certainly not how most children here speak. I mean, I've never used the term 'fellow' in my life (unless speaking about a don), or bloke, or chap... and those are just the terms that get used for a 'guy'! So tbh I'd expect wizarding language to become a mixture of old-fashioned English and odd wizarding sayings.
