For Voldemort and Valor. Magic is Might. May your magical core never empty.

Haha, RIP. In all seriousness, though, I don't think that particular phrase would have been adopted so early on into wizarding language. In the time of its conception, muggleborns being taken into the wizarding world probably wouldn't have wanted to embrace their persecution, what made them different from wizard-born, etc. If there was a wizard version, I don't believe it would be such a direct translation.
