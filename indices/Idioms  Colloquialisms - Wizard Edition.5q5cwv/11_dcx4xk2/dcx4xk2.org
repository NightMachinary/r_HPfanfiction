I googled a list of idioms and I translated a few:

A knut for your thoughts (A penny for your thoughts)

Best thing since self inking quills (Best thing since sliced bread)

No use crying over spilt potion (Cry over spilt milk)

Curiosity killed the kneezle (Curiosity killed the cat)

A Snidget in Hand is worth two in the bush (A bird in hand is worth two in the bush)

He is playing Morgana's Advocate (Devil's Advocate)

Don't put all your Ingredients in one Cauldron (Don't put all your eggs in one basket)

Kill two doxies with one spell (Kill two birds with one stone)

Miss the Portkey (Miss the boat)

Taste of your own potion (Taste of your own medicine)

My apologies if a few seem a little forced.
