Agreed. Wizards wouldn't be taking the muggle version and adapting it to themselves, I wouldn't think. They'd create and develop their own over time. Just like some English phrases don't make sense to non-native speakers. In my college Spanish class we discussed this and it was mentioned that something as simple as "I'll pick you up at five." just doesn't translate to Spanish if you do a literal translation. My teacher was from Spain and he said you would be telling someone that you would /physically/ pick someone up at five, because English has more than one meaning for "pick up" and Spanish does not. And there were examples that went the other way around, Spanish phrases that did not have an exact English translation.

So why wouldn't there be things like that with wizards?
