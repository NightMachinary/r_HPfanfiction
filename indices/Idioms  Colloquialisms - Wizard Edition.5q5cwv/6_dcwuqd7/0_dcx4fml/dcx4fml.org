I kind of disagree. The reason so many people use blatant reworks of muggle idioms is because JK Rowling does that a ton in canon. It's part of the humor and whimsy of the series- we get the references, and they are made glaringly apparent by their differences to what we expect, which makes us realize how strange the idioms we use really are.

Plus the origins of many English idioms are so old that it is plausible they would share a common ancestor with the wizarding versions, before the Statute of Secrecy.
