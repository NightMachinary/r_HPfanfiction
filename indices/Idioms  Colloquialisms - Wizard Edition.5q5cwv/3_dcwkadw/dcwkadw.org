Man, I've read so many in fanfiction that I regret not writing down. There is a list of ones used in canon [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Wizarding_idioms][here]]. My favorite is Skeeter quoting someone describing Bathilda Bagshot with, "The fire's lit, but the cauldron's empty."

And here are some I'm sure I've seen in fics or else am just making up:

-Boy who cried werewolf

-Beating a dead hippogriff

-It's all Mermish/Gobbledegook to me

-Taste of your own potion

-A Nundu can't change his spots

-A drop in the cauldron

-He's got his wand up his arse

-Falling arse over wand

-Falling arse over cauldron

-Don't count your dragons before they're hatched

-The quill is mightier than the wand

-Gringotts wasn't built in a day

-Dung-for-brains

-Wear your heart on your robes
