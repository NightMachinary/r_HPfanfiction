Colloquialisms are fine, but it's weird to me when Hermione, Harry or other muggle-raised kids use them exclusively as soon as they set foot into Hogwarts. Wizard-raised kids grew up with them, but Harry & co have to learn them first. It's believable for a 21 year old Harry to use "Merlin's beard!", but not for 11 year old Harry seeing ghosts for the first time.
