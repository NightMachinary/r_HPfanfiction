  Though I'd like to add that the wizarding world isn't completely separate from the muggle, mostly due to the influx of muggleborn

I agree, but I think the number would be pretty small. There is significant discrimination against things that are "Muggle" and this is reflected in the political and economic institutions of Wizarding Britain.

If Rowling was a linguist (which she clearly isn't lol but if she was) then we'd expect to see Pureblodd speech diverge significantly from Muggle speech. Additionally, most Muggleborns would end up becoming bilingual between "Muggle speech" and "Wizard Speech", as the inability to speak "Wizard Speech" would signal that someone was overly Muggle.

This is what happens pretty much anytime there is institutional discrimination or significant economic power behind a small subset of a culture, from black people in the US (African American English vs Standard English), to the Chinese Languages (Wu vs Mandarin), to Swahili (Kenyan Swahili vs Tanzanian Swahili). This is one of the key reasons prejudice is so hard to overcome; people literally speak a different language than their oppressors.

Obviously Rowling didn't want this to happen (a combination of wanting the Wizarding World to feel familiar, her not deciding blood purism would be significant until later on in the series, a lack of linguistic knowledge, and simply because it would overcomplicate the plot), but in doing so she sacrifices a significant amount of realism. But hey, it's a young adult story about magic wands lol. Realism can be sacrificed.
