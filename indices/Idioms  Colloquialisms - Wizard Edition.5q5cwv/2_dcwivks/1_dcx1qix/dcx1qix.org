Great post. Though I'd like to add that the wizarding world isn't completely separate from the muggle, mostly due to the influx of muggleborn. So while there would be significant differences we should also expect a few newer muggle sayings to have slipped in occasionally or at least have been appropriated or merely understood if not actually used.
