Oh, definitely. George R.R. Martin is a master of his craft in this regard. I think this might be why I like high fantasy as much as I do - there are so many ways for development to occur. Some read for character development, some for plot, and others to experience the myriad of lore information.

As there are obviously a lot of things that vary between cultures, it's also interesting to slip between the lines there and see similarities instead. We all grow from one place. /It's all just so cool./
