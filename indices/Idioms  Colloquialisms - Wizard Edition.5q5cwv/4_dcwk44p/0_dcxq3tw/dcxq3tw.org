Although I will note the caveat that when it's “the gods”, it probably shouldn't be capitalised unless one crafts their story's mythology really well; because, you know, if it's neither a name nor a proper title then no capitalisation.

Not that it matters to me since I have a word-replace filter that automatically changes it within stories to something silly instead, but yeah.
