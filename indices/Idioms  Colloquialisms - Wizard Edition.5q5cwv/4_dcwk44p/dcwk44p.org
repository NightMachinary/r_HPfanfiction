I've seen 'Merlin, Maeve, and Morgana!' which led to the derivative exclamation 'Sweet Baby Maeve!'. There have been fics where some characters 'swear on the Founders Four' or 'by Salazar'. It's a bad habit to pick up but I've seen a number of stories where instead of 'God' it's 'the Gods'.

'a few Bludgers short of a Quidditch set'

'the Kneazle's out of the bag'- that might even be canon.
