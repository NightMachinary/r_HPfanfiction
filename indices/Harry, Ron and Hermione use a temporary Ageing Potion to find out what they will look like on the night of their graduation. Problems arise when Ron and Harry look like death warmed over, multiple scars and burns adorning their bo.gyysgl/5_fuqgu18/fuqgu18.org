The problem with a such an aging potion is that it means there is no free will. Things will happen no matter what you do. You are a train on a railroad track, no deviations allowed. This also means you can do anything you want, because if you succeed, then that is what fate ordained.

Want to know when something happens? Make different ageing potions for different spans of time.You can't change them, but it's nice to know, maybe.
