"Why aren't you changing, Hermione?" Ron asked in the middle of his transformation.

Harry nodded. "Are you sure you made the potion properly?" He asked.

Hermione glared at him." Of course I did, Harry! I went over each instruction thrice! I even plucked the bogswallop directly from a - " she stopped abruptly and stared at her two friends. Her eyes widened in horror and her lips parted in a vague, relaxing distress. Her hands started to tremble; the sight in front of her was horrendous.

Harry and Ron's transformation was complete and they looked like death warmed over in their 18 year old bodies. They were both covered in a multitude of scars, many still fresh and bleeding. Ron's left eye was squashed, so much that Hermione knew that he wouldn't be able to use the eye again even with the aid of magic.

Harry's left arm was bent in an odd angle and bruises were littered all across the exposed skin. His eyes had lost that mischievous glow that Hermione had grown used to, and was replaced with cold, flat and expressionless pupils. His eyes spoke of pain, of suffering and of a grim resolve.

But Harry's look was nothing compared to what was etched across Ron's face. If looks could kill, it would have been a massacre at Hogwarts. Hermione had never ever imagined that such rage and rightful anger existed, and seeing it on the face of her best friend who she secretly was in love with was heartbreaking.

Harry and Ron had rightfully interpreted Hermione's initially expression and were inspecting each other. A venomous silence filled the air for what felt like eternity.

And as soon as it had begun, it ended. The two boys reverted to their original, 16 year old bodies. It was a far cry from what Hermione had seen before, in a positive way.

"What does this mean, Hermione?" Harry asked silently, though Hermione knew such a thing was impossible. How could someone speak silently? The concept was absurd. But that was the best and probably only way to describe Harry's tone. Silent. Deadly. Fearful.

"I... I... " Words failed Hermione Granger for the first time in her life.

"The potion is supposed to transform us into /exactly/ how we will look in the future, right?" Ron asked. If it were a different circumstance, Hermione would have been impressed with Ron's smartness.

"Yes" she said.

"So that means... Sometime in the future, we'll end up like this?" Harry asked

"Yes" her voice trembled. She vaguely registered that tears were streaming down her cheeks and falling on the stone floor of the abandoned classroom.

Silence embraced them yet again. But this time, it was different. It was tense.

"Hermione didn't transform. What does that mean" Ron asked. His voice was as emotionless, or more, than Snape's face had ever been.

And the reality hit her like a herd of elephants, crashing into her as if she had been in the middle of a rampage. It felt like millions of gallons of water had suddenly been dumped on her. The tense silence seemed to have solidified and was crushing her from all sides. She felt it difficult to breath.

"I died" the voice which left her mouth was unrecognisable. In fact, she would have sworn that it wasn't hers if it hadn't been for the fact that she was the one that had spoken.

She felt two pairs of arms engulf her. Both of the arms were gripping at her and held her tightly as if she was their tether to this world, and not gravity. Perhaps she was.

Ron and Harry were sobbing. Harry kept saying "No, No" over and over again. Ron was hysterical. She didn't know what to do, or how to react. All three of them sunk to the hard, cold stone floor. It felt like an eternity before the sound of the sobs reduced to slight gasps here and there. In another few moments, the sounds ceased entirely. The two boys had fallen asleep, still clutching Hermione tightly. Not knowing what else to do, she too rested here head on the stone wall and fell asleep.

Her fate was sealed. All her hopes and dreams were crushed. But she would deal with the bitter truth tomorrow. For now, she was content with the present. She slept, unaware of the slow acting poison coursing through her body.

Hope you liked it. Sorry for the abrupt ending, had a dearth of free time.
