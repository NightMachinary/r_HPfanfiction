How long will she live? My theory is a few years, until the day this battle takes place or another theory; she dies before then but those who attack take the credit.

Why slow acting? To avoid being caught. That way nobody knows who was responsible and if the plan is to use it as a distraction in the right moment (shortly before a fight to take your opponent off their game) it gives you a fighting advantage.

Also, why Hermione? If the target is Harry, it could be assumed that he is only as good as he is by the help of Hermione. She is the smartest in the class, everyone knows that. She is one of his best friends. It could even be mistakenly assumed they are closer in a relationship type of way, without it being known that Ron and Hermione like each other on this story.

Either way, if Harry is the mark, target his strongest ally. Kill her, use poison to make it slow and go unnoticed.

Another theory, women's choice of killing is poison, it's not usually a man's method. It would also be hard for someone she is suspicious of to get close enough to her to poison a drink or gift her something edible that she would accept. So, does this mean someone close enough was turned, or always has been? Maybe, maybe not. It could also have been a man who used the poison but that seems unlikely because they wouldn't have bothered using slow acting poison, since it would be almost automatically assumed to be a woman who did it because the method was poison. Not impossible, just unlikely. Another scenario for how she got poisoned was faking a gift from someone she did know and trust. Example: Malfoy sends her a box of poisoned chocolates from Luna. When Hermione thanks her she answers in her normal dreamy sort of odd way that nobody really fully understands and it's assumed to just be her being her normal self while she really did not give it to her.

Lots of questions. Lots of theory and guessing. It's a fun prompt of sorts for sure. I wish someone would write it, I cba to do it despite the many ways I can think of to write this murder mystery with the promise of an epic battle. It would be fun to do it tho, so someone really should.
