Oh man all good thoughts. I have to wonder if someone was able to get close enough to kill Hermione, why not just take out Harry? Is it more about his suffering rather than advantage? It also makes me wonder if Hermione would have started to test all of their food that wasn't right from the kitchen or made themselves at some point during canon.

Then I wonder if Hermione would consider that she may be poisoned and would try and figure out what she may be dying of and if she could avoid it. If she figures it out and realizes there's nothing she can do, does she tell Ron and Harry or does she think it would only be a distraction from the greater purpose. I can definitely imagine symptoms showing at some point and she tries her best to hide them.

Man this could be so good. I love the prompts in this sub but man does it make me sad when there is a really good one with no actual full fic haha.
