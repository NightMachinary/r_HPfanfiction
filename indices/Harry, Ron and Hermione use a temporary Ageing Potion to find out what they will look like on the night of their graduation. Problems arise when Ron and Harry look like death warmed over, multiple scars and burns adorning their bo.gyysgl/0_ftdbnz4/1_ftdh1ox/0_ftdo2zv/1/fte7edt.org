I think she will die right before like a day or so before the final battle or during it. If she was murdered way before the battle it would give the WW another person to martyr. She would be canonized by the wizarding press. Now if she was killed within days of the battle her death would distract Harry and company and maybe give Moldy an edge. Plus right before the battle everything would be bedlam so no real chance for her to become St. Hermione.
