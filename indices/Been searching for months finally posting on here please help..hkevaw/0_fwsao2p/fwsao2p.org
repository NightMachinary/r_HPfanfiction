Sorry mate. I know that Twins: A different life (I can't link right now, but you should find it on ao3) is like that but it's James being abusive to Lilly and Harry doesn't beat him up, but he can flameport. Maybe that's what your looking for? It's wildly popular though, so I'd be suprised if you haven't ran across it before. Sad to say that I can't be of much help, but good luck!
