In my sketches of it, Bellatrix is very pragmatic when joining the Death Eaters. Its what her family wants, she really doesn't like mudbloods and its a way to power within a hierarchy that is mostly made up of skill and usefulness. Plus she does have a sadistic streak, combined with a certain ruthlessness. I assumed Azkaban just twisted that pragmatism into fanaticism.

So, she isn't innocent - but she also isn't quite as fucked up as we see her in later books.
