My thoughts were along similar lines as well.

I do think canon Bellatrix was far saner before being put into Azkaban. But also, she didn't renounce Voldemort when on trial in 1981. She didn't cry Imperius. This indicates that she either wasn't sane, even then, or has a bravery streak. I've seen some stories say it's a bravery streak, and then use it to argue she could also be brave - in a /good/ way. Then that slave bond marriage contract comes into play in those stories.

JK actually left Bellatrix fairly open ended. She doesn't have much of a backstory, and what little she does have leaves many interpretations of /how/ she got there open for debate. I think Bellatrix, even canon Bellatrix, is one of the few batshit crazy characters that has any potential for being redeemed.

Of course, it's far easier to write a Bellatrix that is similar to canon Bellatrix. By using her canon characterization, you don't need to make up a fairly detailed backstory on how exactly she was good, and then turned Dark involuntarily. I enjoy reading both characterizations, even more poorly written ones.
