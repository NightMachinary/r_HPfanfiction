Bellatrix was obviously a fanatic, and like Ginny, were willing to do pretty much everything for their 'hero'.

Both were aggressive and powerful warriors who were reasonably intelligent.

The key differences were their upbringings and the cause they decided to follow.

The Blacks might be more prone to mental instability, while the Weasleys were more prone to temper tantrums.

Ginny's Wand had Yew wood (same as Voldemort's) and highly likely Dragon Heartstring core (not confirmed). That was a dangerous combination.
