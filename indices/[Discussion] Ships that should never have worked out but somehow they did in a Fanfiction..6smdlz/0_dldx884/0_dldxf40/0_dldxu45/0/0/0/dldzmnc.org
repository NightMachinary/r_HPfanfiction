  Bellatrix was obviously a fanatic, and like Ginny, were willing to do pretty much everything for their 'hero'.

It does leave /how/ exactly they became so fanatical open to one's own favored interpretation.

I think the Bad!Molly/Ginny trope came from this idea. If Bellatrix could be magically compelled to follow Voldemort, than could Ginny be magically compelled to like Harry? I wouldn't be surprised if both tropes originated around the same time.

I actually hope JK never really expands on this. The nature vs nurture debate when it comes to Bellatrix and Ginny is a very interesting and compelling one.
