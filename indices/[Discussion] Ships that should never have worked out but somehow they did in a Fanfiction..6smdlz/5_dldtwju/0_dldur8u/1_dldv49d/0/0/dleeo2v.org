He killed his /father/. Unless you consider a mother's death in childbirth to be murder on the part of the newborn, he had nothing to do with Merope's death.

And when killing his father, you could argue he was trying to avenge his mother. That's how I look at it. Remember, Voldy was convinced that this was a Tobias Snape situation where Riddle Sr. abandoned the pregnant Merope to die in the gutter upon learning she was a witch. (Plus, although Riddle Sr. was more justified than Voldemort knew, Rowling stated in interviews that Riddle Sr. was /still/ a hard-headed bigot, from whom Voldemort may actually have inherited some of his sociopathic tendancies)
