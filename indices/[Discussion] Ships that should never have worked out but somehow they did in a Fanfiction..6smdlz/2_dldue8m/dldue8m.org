I will just list some of the popular ones, Harry/Dobby, Lily/Giant Squid, and Umbridge/Dementor are too few to matter:

Harry/Bellatrix

Harry/Draco

Harry/Snape

Harry/Voldemort

Hermione/Draco

Hermione/Snape

Ginny/Draco

Oddly enough, no Ginny/Snape despite so many claim she looked like Lily

I also think harems are NOT possible in the Canon world, as witches were far too powerful to accept this very patriarchal system. However, if witches were allowed to have MULTIPLE male partners/concubines, then...

--------------

On the other hand, I think following non-canon ships are definitely plausible:

Harry/Hermione

Harry/Luna

Harry/Greengrass sisters

Harry/Susan

Harry/Fleur

Hermione/Neville

Hermione/Victor

Ron/Lavender

Ron/Luna

Ginny/Neville

Ginny/Victor

Luna/Neville

Lily/Snape
