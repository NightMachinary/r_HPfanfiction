Not necessarily.

We actually knew something about Astoria Greengrass and Susan Bones. Astoria was not a pureblood elitist, and could be characterized as a second Sirius. Her rebellious streak came later and she was still sorted into Slytherin though. Susan Bones was a CORE DA member, her family suffered deeply under Voldemort, and these two facts alone could give writers a lot to work with.

Daphne was the only OC in that pack. Even then, of the Slytherins in Harry's Year, she appeared to be the ONLY ONE who had never attacked the Trio verbally or physically. If my impression was true, then this fact alone would be quite indicative.
