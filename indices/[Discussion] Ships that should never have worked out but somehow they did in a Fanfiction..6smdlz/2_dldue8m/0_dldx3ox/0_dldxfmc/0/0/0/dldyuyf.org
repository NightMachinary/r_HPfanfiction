  He was so INFURIATINGLY passive.
#+end_quote

That is my biggest grievance as well. There were moments when I was reading the books where I actually stopped reading and asked myself - /how can Harry be so passive?/ The lives of him and his friends are on the line throughout the story, yet his actions are solely /reactionary/. He doesn't have any form of initiative until the later books.

I believe things could have gone better for the canon characters had they just stopped being reactionary, and took the initiative.
