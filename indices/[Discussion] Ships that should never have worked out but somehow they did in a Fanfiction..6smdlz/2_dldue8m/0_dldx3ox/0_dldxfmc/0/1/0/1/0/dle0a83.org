The books are just the baseline everyone can kinda agree on. As in, those are things I need not explain, because everybody who reads HP Fanfiction probably read the books.

After that some read an article, some didn't. Some give a shit what Rowling says, some don't.

The books are the only reliable baseline for canon that you can expect everybody to know. Hence why I consider Pottermore lore-guidelines, at best.
