I have no idea where that with Astoria comes from. I'm just guessing Pottermore. Susan Bones got a bit of backstory, true, but far from anything that I would describe as anything but a stand-up display-character. Daphne is a complete OC with a fixed name.

In the end, all three of them can be written almost completely how an author wants without breaking canon.

So for all the things that actually /make/ a character, they are OCs.
