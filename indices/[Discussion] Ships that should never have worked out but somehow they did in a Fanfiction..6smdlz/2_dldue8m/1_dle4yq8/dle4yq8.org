Harems aren't primarily bad for the women in them in the context in which they exist, but for the men who don't have the power and wealth to entice women, and because lonely young men get uppity, it's bad for the society in the long run.

Would you want to be the wife of a dirt poor tenant sheep farmer or subsistence farmer who has to work constantly to barely feed the family or a wife of a rich dude who eats delicacies, sleeps in real beds, and maybe has to occasionally put out?

The alternative to harems isn't hippy utopia abundance freedom, it's destitution in a society thusly organised.
