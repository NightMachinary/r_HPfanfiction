It's not so much the explaining. I read about half of one in which women (of pureblood families) are actually purely commodities for the purpose of forming alliances or earning money, and the women affected "flee" into Harry's harem, which they at least can do by their own choice.

Another one had preternaturally mighty wizards and witches, and harems (here in the proper sense of "household", rather than "sex commune") were how witches who weren't mighty in this way could find protection of a mighty wizard, while men had to fend for themselves, or, like the Weasleys, act as a sort of clan. That story was much better but I can't remember either title.
