Well, the point is that in this society, much like in modern society, very few women are /just/ 'the wife of X'.

That wife of a dirt poor tenant sheep farmer could be a world-class lawyer or doctor or artist or scientist in her own right, while her husband pursued his career just out of passion, or as an aside while being a house husband. Or, they could both be poor, and in love, and happy - this is a universe where magic is possible, and some of our happiest canon characters have no money or social standing to speak of.
