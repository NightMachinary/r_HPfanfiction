No, I could see Luna and Vernon. Vernon was pretty much the most mugglest muggle that ever did mug. It's the classic story where the extremely prosaic old bore meets the whimsical, delicate, romantic, odd, child like adult who teaches him how to be a child again and helps him heal, and to see the magic in everything, and to not be afraid of the unnatural, but to find and appreciate beauty in the oddities and the abnormal.

Then of course she, being so delicate, uses up all her strength giving life to their child, and dies. He either turns back into a curmudgeon, leaving the child to be raised by servants until it reaches a certain age and manages to reignite the spark in him, and he becomes a proper father and learns to smile again.

Or he raises it to be just like Luna, and takes it on Nargle hunts.
