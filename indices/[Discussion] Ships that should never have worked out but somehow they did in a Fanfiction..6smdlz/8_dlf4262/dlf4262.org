Harry/ any male Slytherin

How anyone can see that working I do not know. Every single one of them who is not basically an OC (like Greengrass and Davis) joins Voldemort. You know, the guy that killed Harry's parents, wants him dead and used the holocaust as an inspiration what to do with muggleborns.

Shipping any of the lot with Harry would be like shipping Anne Frank with the Waffen SS.
