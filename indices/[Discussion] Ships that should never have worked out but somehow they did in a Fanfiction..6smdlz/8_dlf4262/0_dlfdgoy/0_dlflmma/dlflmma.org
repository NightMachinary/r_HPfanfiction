Actually, there is one way I see Hermione/Draco working.

Imagine Draco actually thinking about blood purity between years 1 and 2 and he comes to the conclusion that it is wrong because a muggleborn is outscoring every pureblood and that is nothing unusual. His halfblood, bloodtraitor cousin actually has an increadibly rare magical talent (metamorph) while half of the purebloods are rather stupid (Pansy, Crabbe, Goyle).

So therefore instead of calling Hermione a mudblood second year he befriends her (maybe in secret to keep his family at bay). That friendship slowly grows into more (maybe by the Yule Ball).

In the end Draco goes against his father and blood purity when they come out (and I can see Narcissa liking or disliking it, that could go both ways).
