Ron wasn't nearly that bad in the Books. Especially in the last Book, he barely fought with Hermione.

Movie!Ron on the other hand, even Rupert Grint was of the opinion he would be divorced and unemployed 20 years later. And I agree.

Book Hermione was a difficult person to get along with. She probably knew that and greatly appreciated that Ron only had one major fight (Year 6) with her since they started noticing each other. Ron also fully acknowledged her intellectual superiority and had no trouble dealing with her argumentativeness.
