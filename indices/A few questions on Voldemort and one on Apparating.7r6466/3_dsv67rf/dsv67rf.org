1. They were generally realistic, although maybe a little less stringently styled. (Hair products of the era didn't allowed for much of a tousled look.) Hairstyles for men were generally static for the first half of the 1900s, with little change from one decade to the next, and teenage boys generally followed the same fashion trends. Even when extreme looks (like pompadours, postwar) got fashionable, not every guy would be wearing them. Male youths of the 1940s also seemed to keep their hair a little longer than men did, and didn't really wear hats until around college age.

2. I don't recall anything from the books, but using movie canon here couldn't hurt -- barefoot Voldemort is pretty creepy.

3. I like to imagine Voldemort having his various vassals having the honor of hosting him, an act which, like royalty of the past, would be more of a curse since it would bankrupt his hosts, or at least put them at extreme disadvantages.

As far as Apparition goes, it's been a while since I've re-read /GoF/, but I always had the impression that the students were stuck in place when they splinched during lessons because of safeguards in place. That's probably just my own headcanon justifications, though.
