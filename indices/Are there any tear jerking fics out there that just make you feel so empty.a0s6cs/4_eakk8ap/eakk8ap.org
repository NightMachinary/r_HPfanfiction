My personal policy is to avoid fics that runs the risk of doing this, /especially/ if it ends that way, and thus leaves on a sad ending. Not because they're bad fics, but because I don't like feeling sad. It's especially bad if the fic is long, because then I get engrossed, and thus feel bad for much longer than if, say, an oneshot leaves on a sad note. Heartbreak endings are particularly bad.

This has lead me to, on occasions, spoiling the ending of a fic for myself.
