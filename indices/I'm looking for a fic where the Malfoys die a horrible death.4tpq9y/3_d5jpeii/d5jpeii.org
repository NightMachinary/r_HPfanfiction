If you are talking about horrific death for Lucius, *Spectrum*, linkffn(9561455), tops the list.

Draco had it very rough in *Screams Part Two: The Smiling Man*, linkffn(3568551).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] kills off the Malfoys in every one of his fics, too.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761312/1/Heart-and-Soul][Philosophize]]'s *Heart and Soul*, linkffn(11761312), the Malfoys are not dead yet, but they are being used by Voldemort as spell practice dummies for repeated failures.

If you like killing Lucius in an 'innovative' way, *Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), is the fic to read.

Narcissa was a serious bad guy in *Unspeakable Things*, linkffn(6473434), and thus died horribly. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]] generally doesn't spare the Malfoys, and all of them suffered ugly deaths in *The Bonds of Blood*, linkffn(5435295).

Finally, Draco's death in *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), is the most interesting one: [[/spoiler][it was a highly political assassination with the goal of sowing distrusts between Dumbledore and the Ministry. Harry framed Neville for the murder, but broke Neville out of Azkaban and into his service.]]
