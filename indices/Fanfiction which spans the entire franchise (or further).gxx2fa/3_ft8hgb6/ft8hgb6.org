linkffn(Backward with Purpose: Always and Always) covers all seven years, though in just a few hundred thousand words, and has a sequel (which I actually enjoyed much more than book 1).

The Innocent series looks to be heading in that direction (and already has a higher word count than canon) but has only reached year 4 thus far.
