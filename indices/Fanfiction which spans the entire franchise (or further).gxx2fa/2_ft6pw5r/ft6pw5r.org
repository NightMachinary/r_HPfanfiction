I'm reading through [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/896895][The Cupboard series by Stargon]] right now, and it's complete. Avoids most stations of canon, but I have no idea if it goes til year seven (as I'm reading through year five at the moment).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/945579][Hermione Granger and the Child Protection Movement by LadyWinterknight and NerdyKat]] is another complete one.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/338101][Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven by Bakenandeggs]] - Warning: goblin tropes at the very least. It's been a long time since I've read this though. Complete.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590][Leo Inter Serpentes by Aeternum]] goes to sixth year. I remember absolutely nothing about this series lol. Incomplete. I think.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/309447][Mischief's Heir by Mad_fairy]] is a fun read that starts off over-the-top cracky and then evens out later. The bashing goes away, I promise. Begins during the summer of second year and ends when... well... That's a spoiler. Some crossover elements with marvel, but its minimal and knowledge via osmosis is perfectly fine. My favourite of the bunch, even if its not to everyone's taste.

Part one of each is here: linkao3(13054572; 13695783; 4762385; 922767; 4629198)
