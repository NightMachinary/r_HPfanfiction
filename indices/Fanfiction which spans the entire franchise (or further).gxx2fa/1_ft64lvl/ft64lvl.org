Many, not all of them finished:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977214][Animagus-Verse by White_Squirrel]] starting with linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) is now somewhere in the sixth [?] year, but it is heavily AU right now.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/993900][Arithmancer-Verse by White_Squirrel]] starting with linkao3(The Arithmancer by White_Squirrel) has been finished
- I am just in the middle of the Dangerverse series, linkffn(Living with Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow) and its sequels (unfortunately, FFN doesn't allow good grouping in to series, so you have to pick it up from the authors profile)
- The same problems of FFN are with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter by Sorcerer's Muse) and its sequels, which is WIP (right now publishing the seventh book of the series covering the sixth year of Harry at Hogwarts)
- linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox) covers all seven years of the next-generation in itself
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] starting with linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts: Now and Forever by Forest_of_Holly) is also the next-generation series covering all seven years of the Dudley's daughter (not that well known, but really good)
