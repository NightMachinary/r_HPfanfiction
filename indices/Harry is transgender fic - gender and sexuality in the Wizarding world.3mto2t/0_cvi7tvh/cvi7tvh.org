This is an a la carte topic: canon made little mention of sexuality, even neglecting to specify the nature of Albus' relationship with Gellert, but the attack press and scandal-mongers never suggested anything about Dumbledore having too 'close' a relationship to Harry. No taunting about Crabbe and Goyle being polyjuiced into firstie witches while acting lookout for Draco was even mentioned. About the only thing they seem bothered by was the lack of consent involved with Aberforth and his goats. On the far edge of morality we have Hagrid breeding a reptile and mammal together to create a Lovercraftian horror that, despite being direct evidence of illegal breeding, was proudly included in the Tournament maze.

There are many fics that talk about sexuality, usually as a precursor to angst or sex or both. Fanfiction exists for us to explore the issues, but canon basically shrugs.

I had a few things to say about it in linkffn(Holly Evans and the Spiral Path), if you're curious... and brave.
