My main fic and its prequel deal with FemHarry (who's long known her attraction to girls) and Hermione (who just recently realized it) but who can't come out of the closet (except to a couple of carefully chosen confidants) due to the wizarding world being less tolerant than muggles in the 90s.

It's also about a lot more - that's just one strand of quite a few plot threads being woven together. Veela culture is fleshed out. Magical ritual holiday ceremonies (like Beltane, Yule, Imbolc) play important roles. The appropriateness of using violence and especially the intent to cause harm is debated. And more!
