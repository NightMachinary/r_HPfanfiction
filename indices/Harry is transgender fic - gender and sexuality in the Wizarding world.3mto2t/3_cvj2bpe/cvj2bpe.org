Personally I think Dumbledore WAS "out" (those outfits, c'mon)- but any kind of sexuality is not really appropriate to discuss with students under your care. And Harry didn't have any kind of links to Wizarding families besides the Weasleys so he wouldn't have heard any wizarding gossip at all. And anyway DD hasn't been with anyone in ages so there's no real gossip anyway.
