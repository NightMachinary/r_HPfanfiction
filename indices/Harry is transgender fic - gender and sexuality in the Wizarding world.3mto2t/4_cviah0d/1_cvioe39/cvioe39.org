Interesting points! Like I said in an earlier reply, I wonder though if magical/temporary gender change is accepted, but permanent change is just an unknown or taboo in the Wizarding World. The community JK presents does seem sort of conservative and not as up to speed as the muggle world.

Mmm, I see your point there, thanks. The story is about Harry being transgender and transitioning into a woman. It is more focused on the emotional transition rather than the standard stereotypical clothes! makeup! feminine things! that we see atm (although some of that is lightly included).
