Just an FYI if your not sure which label to use but are sure that it falls under the transgender umbrella you can just use the term 'Trans*' rather than trans-whatever.

Edit: One more nitpick.

In general our society uses the term gender and sex interchangeably because for 99.7% of the population one is the other. Having Harry come to the realization he isn't male isn't wrong, so much as an awkward choice of wording. What's more important is the implications behind the words. "I'm not male" is strictly false but in the given context couldn't be more true.
