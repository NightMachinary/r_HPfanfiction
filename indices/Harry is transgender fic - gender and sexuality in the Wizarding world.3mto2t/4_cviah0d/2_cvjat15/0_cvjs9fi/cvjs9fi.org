Honestly, as far as the latter nitpick goes ... well, I won't say that you are wrong or anything, but strictly speaking it was not really necessary. Because in this case Harry would be male, but a girl, so whatever the general populace's assumptions are, “not male” isn't really the case. Regardless of the intent of the person thinking it or their wishes. Because “male” and “female” are terms used in biology, not in studies on society.

And thanks for the comment about adding the asterisk; I generally add “-whatever” or “-ish” or things like that to words when it's not an exact match and I don't know what to add exactly, so I went with this route here too, but I shall remember from now on. Though I generally try to avoid using asterisks on this site because they are used for formatting.
