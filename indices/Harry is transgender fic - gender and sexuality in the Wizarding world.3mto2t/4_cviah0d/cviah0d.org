Considering they have metamorphmagi, who can change their bodies completely (yes, they can walk all over the rainbow if they so desire), I don't think one's gender identification is /that much/ of an issue for them. And with Dumbledore, it may very well be that it was a case of single-target sexuality for Gellert only (assuming the thing between them was actually sexual in nature) which means there would not be much of a chance for him to be “found out” (heck, even the rumour about him being in love with the guy might be scandalous not because of the homosexuality but because they were enemies).

So really, I don't there would be quite that much of a problem if Harry were trans-whatever (not meaning to insult here, I just acknowledge that there is more than one word that begins with “trans-” that people can, and will, use). That is, in general; on the other hand we have the whole “Boy-Who-Lived” thing which means that some people might accept that Harry Potter is a girl but no accept that the “Boy-Who-Lived” is and doing some weird mental dance with this equation, and people like Snape with their issues and penchant for not listening to others.

That being said, “male” refers to one's sex, not gender. So your summary kind of is wrong there, unless it's a “Harry got magically changed into a girl but is a man mentally” story in which case the term “isn't male” would be accurate.
