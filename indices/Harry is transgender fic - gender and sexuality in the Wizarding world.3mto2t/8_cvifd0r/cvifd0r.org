I can't help you with British history, but the "priests" (probable trans folk in history always seem to be assumed crossdressers, so who knows) of Freyr wore women's clothes and makeup, spoke softly, and walked with a feminine gait. In the middle east and central Asia, you have the transsexual priestesses of Cybele, Ishtar, and Ashteroth. Among some of the circumpolar peoples, particularly in Siberia, transgender behavior is seen as a clear sign of a very powerful shaman. There was also a cult of Scythian priestesses who reportedly produced a "female poison" (estrogen) from the urine of pregnant mares that could turn a man into a woman.

Hope that helps!
