Well, there was a very heavy Norse influence before and during the time Hogwarts was founded, but the feminine priests (Im convinced that they were priestesses, but theres no proof they werent just ritualistic crossdressers) of Freyr were only known to be at Uppsala, so far as I'm aware. So... yeah. On the other hand, wherever transgender individuals or behavior are seen in antiquity, they're almost always connected to the spiritual, magical, and divine, so you wouldnt be stretching the truth to far by borrowing from other places and using them in Britain. Of course, none of these positive associations survived Christianity which was firmly entrenched in Britain well before the 8th century.
