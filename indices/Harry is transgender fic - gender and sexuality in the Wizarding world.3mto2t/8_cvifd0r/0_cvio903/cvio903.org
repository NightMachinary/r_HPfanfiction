I knew of some of the Asian transgender figures, but not of the Freyr priests. It helps to know some cool history, thanks!

Personally in terms of my fic and worldbuilding, I was trying to find mythology that could be tied to Wizarding Britain (eg. how Merlin is a figure in canon) but there really seems to be nothing. Come on, Beowulf, Chaucer, give me something to work with! Haha.
