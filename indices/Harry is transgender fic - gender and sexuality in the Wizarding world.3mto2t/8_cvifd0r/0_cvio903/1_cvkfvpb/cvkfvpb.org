The Norse bit is a little... harsh on theses points. While it is true that there were practitioners of seidr (loosely translates to "sorcery") and that there are strong indications that they were also reviled, to an extent, for doing so. The practice of seidr was considered ergi ("unmanly") for two reasons, lots of it was tied in with feminine sexuality and sorcery was considered feminine in itself on account of being guileful, secretive and non confrontational. Basically a dagger in the back of an enemy rather than a challenge to ritual combat. Contemporary sources also seem to suggest that practitioners were more feared than respected due to the harm they could cause if affronted.

This is all a bit contrary though, as Odin himself was a practitioner of seidr (in fact, Loki taunts him about it in one of the sagas, basically the Norse way of calling him a pussy or a fag)
