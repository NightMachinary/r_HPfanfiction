Well, I'd be in hufflepuff. I like it when everyone gets along. Usually pretty boring to read about in fanfiction, though.

I hate how Slytherin gets shafted in everything, including canon. Being ambitious and cunning doesn't mean you're evil. Remember when you were a kid, and you always said "I'm gonna be a fireman/police officer/astronaut"? And then when you get older, you said "I'm gonna be the /best/ fireman/police officer/astronaut"? That's ambition. Wanting to be the best isn't a bad thing. And being cunning in getting what you want doesn't mean you have to be a racist cunt about it. Harry's an unreliable narrator, and we never hear about the older students, or even the younger ones later in the series. Half the house is probably looking at the other half and wondering who dropped them on their heads as children.

Slytherin house wouldn't exist as it was for the past thousand years if everybody in it was a despicable person, like canon implies.
