I find I must agree with Dumbledore (my sworn enemy (hehe)) on that we sort too soon. Years ago I was a Griffindor, when pottermore changed I was forced to create a new account, and was sorted into Slytherin.

House preferences change and I find myself rooting for Slytherin now.

I think it all depends on your position in life and so, what qualities you most value at the present moment.

I wanted Griffindor back then because I wanted to be a hero in a fairytale and knew nothing of cruelty or unfairness. I was 10.
