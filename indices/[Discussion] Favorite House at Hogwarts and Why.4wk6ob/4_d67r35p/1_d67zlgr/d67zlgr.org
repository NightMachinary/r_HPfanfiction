Perhaps. And you are right in that sense. I always thought that Dumbledore meant by what he said was that Snape is a good guy and brave and so he might have been sorted wrong and perhaps that they 'sort too soon.' As if being in Slytherin makes you evil.

What he said wasn't wrong and I agree with him. But the context is wrong.
