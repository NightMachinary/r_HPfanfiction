Canon Slytherin is unfortunately kind of my thing, minus the fantastic racism; in all honesty though I'd stall and then end up in Ravenclaw (because who wants to be grouped in with the "bad guys"?).

Fanon Slytherin is a giant hot mess in my opinion. If I hear politics one more time I might scream.
