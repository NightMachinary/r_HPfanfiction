Yeah, I'm speaking of canon Slytherin. Politics isn't necessarily Ministry politics / Wizengamot stuff, politics is a generic term for me, verbally interaction with each other to archieve goals, etc. I agree, that fanon Slytherin is messed up. A lot of fics equal Slytherin = rich purebloods, evil, racism, you get the meaning.
