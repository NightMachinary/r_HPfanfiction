About the Slytherin part, wouldn't the sorting hat be responsible for putting you in Slytherin? I agree, that a cunning person shouldn't mark himself like that, but does he have a choice? It's not like everybody gets to choose which House he gets in, like Harry, otherwise the Sorting Hat would be pretty pointless, wouldn't it?
