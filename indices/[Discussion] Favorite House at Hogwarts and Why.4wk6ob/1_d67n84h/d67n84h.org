Hufflepuff. Loyal and hard working are two traits I prefer over anything else. Gryffindors are too loud for me, Ravenclaws too much of an ivory tower society and Slytherin... well, Slytherin is Slytherin. Basically, if you are a true Slytherin, you wouldn't be /in/ Slytherin, as it is like a branding on you saying in big bold letters "*DO NOT TRUST THIS PERSON*".
