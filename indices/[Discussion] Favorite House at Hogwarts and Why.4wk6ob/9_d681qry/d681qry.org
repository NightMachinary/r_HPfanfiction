I'm very much not a Hufflepuff, but I do think they're seriously underrated. In real life, I'd try to convince the hat to put me there, but I suspect I'd fail, as my reasoning would be all wrong. I'd certainly try to network with them though. The house of the loyal and hardworking? Those are people you really want to know.

That said, I do very much love reading about Slytherin. But I think it's rarely done well, as a lot of classical villian tropes are over applied to Slytherins, and really, what good Slytherin overshares that much?

In particular, I see pride more as a Gryffindor trait. Not that a Slytherin would never be prideful, but more that they would be encouraged to set that aside when necessary. Claiming to be Imperioused does not make Lucius Malfoy look strong, but it makes him look innocent. I wish I saw more of that behavior, really. The idea in fanon that Slytherin house status is all about looking strong is silly to me.
