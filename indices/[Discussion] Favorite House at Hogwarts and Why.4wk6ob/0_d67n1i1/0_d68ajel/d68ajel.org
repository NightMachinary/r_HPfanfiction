Hufflepuffs seem the most likely to embody "your house will be like your family". That seems like a real stretch for Slytherin, and Ravenclaw also seems like it would be too competitive (academically) for that to work. Plus, we saw how they treated Luna. And the books clearly showed how willing Gryffindor was to ostracize one of their own.

So Hufflepuff: where they'll help you with your homework even if you might end up doing better than them, where someone will cuddle you on a bad day and bring you ice cream after a breakup. And everyone will cheer when you get a good grade or nice news from home.
