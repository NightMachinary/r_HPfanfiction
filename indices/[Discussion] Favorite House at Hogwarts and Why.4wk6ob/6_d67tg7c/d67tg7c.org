I'd go with Slytherin. Because of the bias against it which even Dumbledore was prone to. Anyone remember the line, 'perhaps we sort too soon...'. forgive me if the quote is not word for word as it is off the top of my head.

Harry was also exposed to this bias eventhough he sorting hat wanted him in Slytherin.

'You could be great, you know, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that.' 'Or perhaps in Slytherin, You'll make your real friends,...'

It was just sad to see in the end how everyone stood against them, in the seventh book. I don't remember if they were or weren't given a choice to stay and fight.

That's why I really enjoy reading Slytherin!Harry and well I haven't really read something that focuses mainly on the prejudice.
