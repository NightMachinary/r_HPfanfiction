I would fit anywhere probably (ok: Not with the 'puffs probably...I like fair play, but I am not above playing dirty if my opponent does so as well and hard work? Something to be avoided if possible!), but I'd probably either be Ravenclaw or Slytherin...if I could decide I'd go with the Ravenclaws probably (No one would bother me when I want to be alone with a book), but I guess the hat would still put me in Slytherin (why? Because I don't like knowledge for knowledge's sake, I prefer stuff that has practical applications and I am not above lying if doing so is really advantageous (not about petty little things, but important stuff))

My over all favorite? Slytherin, because the students there (past and present (present being Harry's time)) are the most interesting and the opportunity to network with the rich and powerful would be appreciated by me (something I only ever had the chance to once and I squandered it because I was young and stupid!))

My least favorite would be Gryffindor - loudmouths and not half as honorable (or noble) as they should be (they ostracize Harry, just like the other houses, despite probably knowing him way better than they do!) and they never have a battle plan (courageousness is great, but being able to back that up with a sound plan is way better - otherwise you might be brave, but dead! Sometimes discretion (and planning) is the better part of valor after all!)

ps: Hufflepuff isn't great and I kind of agree with Draco (while it might be nice because they love fair play and probably help each other out a lot etc. (so it might be the house you constantly feel welcome in, it also doesn't push you to be better than you already are etc.), it's also kind of mediocre - we only know one Hufflepuff who was great and he died (Cedric)) here...don't think any really famous wizard came from there :( while the other houses have shining examples IMHO (and not so shiny ones, too...Voldemort and Peter to name a few!)

pps: The world must be ending...I agreed with Malfoy :( (need to bleach my brain right NOW!)
