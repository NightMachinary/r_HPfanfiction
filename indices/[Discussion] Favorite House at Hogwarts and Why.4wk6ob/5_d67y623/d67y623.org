While I have little to no Hufflepuff in me, I think it is the best house overall. Hufflepuffs aren't arrogant big brassy toerags like Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs don't have OCD like Ravenclaws do, and Hufflepuffs don't manipulate every good thing that happens to their liking like Slytherins do. (pardon me for the stereotypes)

I agree with Dumbledore. Sometimes people, like Snape, are sorted too soon. People can change. James Potter toned down his arrogant buffonism, and Severus Snape spied for Dumbledore at great personal risk.

Slytherins have gotten shafted in both canon and fanon. Being ambitious does not mean you are a slimy, evil junior Death Eater. It's self fufilling. People believe Slytherins are evil, bully them, Slytherins get resentful of their treatment, and then they lash out. (ex. Death Eaters)

I enjoy reading Slytherin!Harry. Overcoming the amount of prejudice some people in fanon Slytherin isn't an easy or quick thing in any of the fics I have read.
