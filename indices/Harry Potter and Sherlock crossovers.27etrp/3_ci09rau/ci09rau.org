Answering my own question- sorta- I did find something digging through the sherlock fanfiction subreddit [which is grossly disorganized but at least they have a wiki proper set up with some recs].

[[http://one-windiga.livejournal.com/4785.html][C/O 221B Baker Street, Muggle London]]. The authoress has meclimbing a wall because she says she has an AO3 account with all her stories on it BUT I can't find a story with that name and I HATE dealing with places that I can't download offline versions of ficts from and dammit it's a novel length Sherlock and John raising Harry story and AUGH.

anywhoo. The Game is still on.
