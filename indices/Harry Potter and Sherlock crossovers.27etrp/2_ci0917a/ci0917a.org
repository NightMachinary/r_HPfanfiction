This is probably not exactly what you are looking for since there is little interaction between the actual worlds, but [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1115333][Friend]] by esama is a very well written oneshot that fits most of your criteria.

Also, if you can bare with a Harry/Mycroft pair (very off screen) you will most likely love [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113600][Magnificent]], also by esama.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9640595/1/A-Scandal-at-Hogwarts][A Scandal at Hogwarts]] mixes the two worlds beautifully. Also, it balances the casework and the (johnlock) romance very well.

Those are all I can think of for now. I hope you'll have fun reading!
