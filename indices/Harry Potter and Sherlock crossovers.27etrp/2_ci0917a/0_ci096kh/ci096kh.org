I need to look over esama more. I know her for YGO [and having the bad habit of putting her ficts in place undownloadable and deleting them] and I did read this one really short Harry Potter fict of hers that was excellent but...whep I have some digging to do.

I was going to overlook magnificent since it has that odd pairing but esama so....

Scandal looks good if kind of short [Damn you study of magic for setting the bar oh so very high] but I have a weakness for Johnlock and Sherlock in Hogwarts.

Thanks for the recs. :)
