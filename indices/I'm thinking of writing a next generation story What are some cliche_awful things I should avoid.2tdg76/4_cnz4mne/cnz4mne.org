Albus in Slytherin. Seriously. /He didn't want to be in Slytherin./

We know so little about this character, and yet people just decide that he had a personality transplant on the train.

He freaks out at the idea of maybe being put in Slytherin. Harry tells him that there's nothing wrong with being a Slytherin, he's still freaked out. The idea that Harry wouldn't mind him being in Slytherin doesn't seem make a difference. He doesn't calm down until Harry tells him that the sorting hat takes his choice into account (i.e., the sorting hat wouldn't arbitrarily put him in Slytherin).

I have no clue why people constantly put him in Slytherin. And part of me thinks that Ron wouldn't have made the joke about them being disinherited if it didn't seem as though both of them would land in Gryffindor anyway. I honestly think it would be hard /not/ to be a Gryffindor after growing up in that family.

As for Rose, I imagine Rose to be who Hermione would have been if Hermione had:

a) been raised in a family that valued bravery, outspokenness, and a certain amount of disrespect for authority.

b) learned from a young age that she had to be loud in order to be heard.

c) had her poor social skills minimized by the fact that she always had built-in friends in the form of blood relatives.

d) been hailed as "just as clever as her mother" by a number of people.
