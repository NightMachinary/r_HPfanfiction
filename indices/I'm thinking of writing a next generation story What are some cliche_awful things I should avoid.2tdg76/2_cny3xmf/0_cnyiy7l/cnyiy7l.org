No, thank you! That was excellent. I like what you mentioned about Harry probably spoiling his kids. I don't know if you've ever seen the Avatar: The Last Airbender and the sequel series Korra, but one of things that really struck me (and it's not really a spoiler) was that the main cast in the first story turned out to be pretty bad parents. And just that nod to the illusion of perfection really made me think. I kind of want to get into that with this story...series, if I'm honest with myself.

I do have a strong draw to Albus, because of his horrible name and being the middle child in a famous family. But I want to include more of the cousins and other "new" characters as well. We shall see. Nothing's set in stone. I'm still brain-storming.
