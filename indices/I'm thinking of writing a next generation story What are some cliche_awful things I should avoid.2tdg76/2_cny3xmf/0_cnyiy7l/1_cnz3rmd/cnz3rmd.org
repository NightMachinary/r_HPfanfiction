I could see them spoiling their kids because neither of them had much as kids. But on the other hand, Harry knows what happens when you spoil kids, and Ginny had a perfectly happy childhood without those things. I tend to think of Harry as someone who enjoys spoiling his kids but who has very zero tolerance for "but I wanted the red oneeeee" behavior.

If you want to distract yourself with some reading, check out loveadubdub's take on the next gen, especially [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4260581/1/Lessons-Learned][Lessons Learned]]. It's next gen but it's like the anti-thesis of fluffy next gen. Everyone is imperfect, none of the kids are well-adjusted, all of them need a good shake, and yet it's so freaking realistic that it's almost depressing. You can totally see how they ended up where they were and why they're making the choices they make.
