I love Korra! I love the unglamorous takes on the old and new cast; it was rougher but more ambitious than A:tla in characterization--Toph's family is the pinnacle. They stole the whole show.

I'm glad I could help! I write and read a lot of next gen, just usually not ones that star Al and Rose as mains. If you make any headway, feel free to message me if you have any questions or need an initial read through :) I would love to see more next gen authors here.
