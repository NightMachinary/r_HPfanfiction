According to JKR, Harry and Dudley are on "Christmas card terms."

That does not imply that Harry still speaks to Vernon/Petunia. Actually it doesn't even imply that Harry's children have met Dudley's children.

To be honest, I doubt that Harry would be interested in continuing a relationship with Dudley if Dudley hadn't semi-removed himself from his parents' clutches.
