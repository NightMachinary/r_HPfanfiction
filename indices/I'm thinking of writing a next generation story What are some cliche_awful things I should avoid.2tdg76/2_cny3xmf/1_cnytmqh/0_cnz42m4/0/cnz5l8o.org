  Actually it doesn't even imply that Harry's children have met Dudley's children.

You have somehow forgotten the rest of those quotes from JKR.

However, I know that after Dudley's brave attempt at reconciliation at the start of Deathly Hallows, the two cousins would have remained on â€˜Christmas Card' terms for the rest of their lives, and that Harry would have taken his family to *visit Dudley's when they were in the neighbourhood* (occasions dreaded by James, Albus and Lily). (Src: jkrowling.com)

Harry and Dudley would still see each other enough to be on Christmas-card terms, but they would visit more out of a sense of duty and *sit in silence so that their children could see their cousins.* (src: J.K. Rowling's comments at Carnegie Hall)*
