Fics that stand out to me think beyond the fanon; that holds true to any era, any genre. Many fics assume that readers already know what the characters are supposed to be like because of canon or how they're portrayed in other fics, and the shallow characterization is very obvious. It's this---not the cliche itself---that makes a bad story.

So I'd say that you should always question your initial ideas and headcanon, because I think many people miss out on much more interesting stories by blindly accepting assumptions. Al and Rose are often best friends; more than that, the Weasley-Potter clan is often extremely close and harmonious---why? All families are a bit dysfunctional, disagree, have black sheep, etc. Which kids would actually take after their parents? Which take after an uncle? Who were bad parents?---it doesn't have to be intentional. Harry was probably very busy and with his childhood, probably spoiled his kids too much; maybe they're brats. What about the other side of the family, the not-so-famous sides? Hermione's cousins, the Dursleys? What does Albus know of Vernon? Is there a reason why you'd like to write Al and Rose and not Hugo and Roxanne? Once, I thought I wanted to write Rose and Scorpius heist fic and made the girl Cho's daughter instead---less people in the cast were related to each other and it felt better in my head; many next gen Hogwarts seem to only host two families or only Gryffindors and Slytherins. Are the trio kids talented? What if they struggled with mediocrity?

Anyway, I could go on and on :) Hopefully that gave you some ideas?
