I haven't read THAT much Next Gen, but I do see a lot of of what you mentioned. I do like Albus in Slytherin, but maybe I can twist it up a bit. Thanks for warning me about the Scorpius/Rose. Nothing's set in stone, but thank you for input. What's your favorite Next Gen story that you mentioned?

Another thing, I do see some of the "famous" tropes, but they either overshoot it or miss it completely. I'll have to think about how to do that correctly.
