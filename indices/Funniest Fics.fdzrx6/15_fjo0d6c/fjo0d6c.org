A few from off the beaten path (i.e., not on ffn or ao3).

[[http://occlumency.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=3006][The Owl Chronicles]] by mouse (epistolary; gen but contains unrequited homosexual advances). /A Muggle Studies field trip is forced upon Snape and his associates. No matter how daunting the Muggle world might be for the teachers, it isn't capable of being worse than the students themselves!/

[[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/sansa/NakedTruth.html][The Naked Truth]] by Sansa (non-explicit slash relationships). /Our boys tell the Ministry what they really think./

Back on the path, I'm also rather fond of The Horror! The Horror! by Disobedience Writer. linkffn(4145459)

Thanks for asking this question. I found a few new titles to check out.
