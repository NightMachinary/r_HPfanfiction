  he doesn't even turn spy until the tail end of the war in '81

What makes you think that? I always thought he turned spy sometime during the winter of 1980-1981, judging by the "leafless trees" present in his meeting with Dumbledore and the fact he already knows the Potters' child is a boy.

  He demonstrably does nothing in books 5-7 to aid the Order
#+end_quote

Factually incorrect. He was a spy for the Order in books 5&6, in book 5 he told the Order Harry and his friends were missing and probably in the Department of Mysteries, and in book 7 he gave the Order the idea of the Seven Potters through Mundungus Fletcher, he protected the Hogwarts students as best he could from the Carrow twins, and he left Harry the Sword of Gryffindor, under Dumbledore's instruction, in a place where it would be taken "under conditions of need and valour". And that's only what was said explicitly.

Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night: he was accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George... a Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin's back- /"Sectumsempra!"/ shouted Snape. But the spell, intended for the Death Eater's wand hand, missed and hit George's ear instead-

"And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part convincingly... I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort's good books, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows..."

If he ever had prejudice against Muggleborns (which I doubt, it was more likely Muggles he had a problem with, given his father) it is long gone:

"Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood-" "Do not use that word!" "-the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!"

He agreed readily to take up the task of protecting Harry once it was explained to him that Harry would actually /need/ protection. He saved Harry's life in his first year, there's no way he would heve survived that fall without Dumbledore there.

"I have spied for you, and lied for you, and put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe."

To reply to anyone who tries to say that Snape wasn't in love with Lily because "it's not stated in the books what sharing a Patronus means", it /is/ stated on Pottermore. Sorry. He did love her.

All this does nothing to make up for his actions during the first war or at Hogwarts, but you write it as though he did nothing good whatsoever.
