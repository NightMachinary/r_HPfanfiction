My thought about house elves was always that they were domesticated at some point in the past (kind of like dogs). They craved the affection of humans and in return they would help around the house. Seems consistent with the fact that if you mistreat a hose-elf they will find loopholes in your orders so as to bring your downfall. Happened with Dobby, happened with Kreacher.

Edit: also seems that Dobby's lack of confidence actually comes from years of mistreatment (that's why he stutters and is so subservient even when freed) - kind of like how an abuse victim would behave. Kreacher who experienced love from the Blacks (except for Sirius) and house elves that appear in FB seem far more confident and talk to people that are not their masters as with equals.
