Ohh Ohh,

Hand up.

I know the answer to this one.

Dobby, like all house elves is a homonculus animated by a bound brownie. The brownie is a spirit of place but far too flighty and unreliable to use directly. The homonculus acts as a container, and stops the brownie evaporating. Being bound to humans generates their human-like personalities, as 'user interfaces' if you will to the brownie. Without being bound to family, Bobby's personality will slowly evaporate, becoming more and more brownie-like. Still bound by the Homonculus, but not capable of thought. (Arguing whether brownies think or not is a bit esoteric. They're autogenous spirits, and spirits in general are almost all weird like that. Demontors, as spirits of suffering are the least weird spirits.)

Just like unbreakable vows, the spells use to make the House-elf personality 'borrow' brain-cells from the bound humans. After all, magic's not sentient, and a homonculus is just a flesh golem). (Which is alos why you don't cast too many of unbreakable vows. And why house-elves get weird if they have weird masters.) ((And Hogwarts house-elves are a bit quiet and retiring (nice-20) because otherwise poor old Dumbledore is even more gaga than usual.))
