Neat. I remember musing before (in my house-elves and prestige) thread that dementors might be house-elves; the idea being that elves might work in households in the first place to draw emotional energy (satisfaction, comfort, etc) off humans, and dementors are those elves twisted by being starved of everything except anger and despair.
