I used something similar in my stories, even though I detest the concept of a FIXED base form. While I agree that there has to be a base form the metamorph reverts to when dead or knocked out, I say it shifts to represent the personality of the metamorph. So Tonks base in book 5 would be the pink hair and the heart-shaped face, while after Sirius' death it would be the downtrodden version.

We know that Tonks morphs a little when she gets mad about her name, so I decided to take that a step further and made her shift into a Bellatrix-lookalike whenever she is protective or wants to come across as menacing. And she more consciously does the shifts to scare people or have fun at their expense.
