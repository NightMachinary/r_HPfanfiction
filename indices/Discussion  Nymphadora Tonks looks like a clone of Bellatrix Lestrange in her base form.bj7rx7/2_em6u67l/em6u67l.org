I am not convinced Metamorphagus have a base form. I mean Teddy Lupin became to change appareance the moment he was born, and apparently Nymphadora was exactly the same. And I always considered this talent to be more "permanent", like resistant to Thief Downfall permanent.

Since Harry didn't make any special comment when her dead in the Great Hall, I believe that her body kept her last appareance after her death.

Also, considering Andromeda already looks a lot like Bellatrix (enough for Harry to make the mistake when waking up) as a nicer and not ex convict version, she seems more in danger to be arrested than her daughter (and her age is closer too).
