Nothing in itself. However, when at least some of the stuff has a “hmm, I see you have theories, I will now write it so that they are all incorrect just because I can” feel to it and at the same time Madame Rowling wasn't above declaring Cursed Child to be canon when it went against some of the information the was on Pottermore at the time of its release, not to mention the general feel that Cursed Child causes ... well, that's that.

You can probably see why some people feel a distaste at that kind of approach, and consequently at Pottermore itself and anything placed there.
