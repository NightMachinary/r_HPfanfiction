It just doesn't matter if it isn't some core part of your story. Its just not important. The only importance of wands would come if you delve deeper into the lore and make it important for your story.

As everything in HP, its all about the symbolism. Holly and Phoenix and Yew and Phoenix. Holly is a tree and wood used for protection, while Yew often symbolises immortality or death. Both character who wield famous phoenix feather wands are ressurected - defeat death in one way or another.

Frankly, wand lore makes for a great bit of unexplored worldbuilding, but its just not important for any story that doesn't deal with its implications.
