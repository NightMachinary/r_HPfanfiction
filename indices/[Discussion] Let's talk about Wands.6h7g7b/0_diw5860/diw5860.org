Am I the only one who LIKES the extra stuff on Pottermore? I think it's really cool!

When it comes to wandlore, I find it an interesting characterization quirk, and adhering to it a sign that the author has bothered to think a bit more about different wands other than "this wand is so Super Special Awesome POWERFUL, you getting it means you're clearly a Super Special Awesome POWERFUL wizard!"
