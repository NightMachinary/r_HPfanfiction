  You can say whatever you like about her writing skills, but JK Rowling is one of the greatest world/lore builders I've ever come across.

Not complaining because the lack of information spurred fanfic which is one of my biggest hobbies but I have to call that statement out.

Her being great at fleshing out a world is a stretch, she has had many years with no pressure of any kind to do so. The books themselves contain impressively few details on the wizarding world.
