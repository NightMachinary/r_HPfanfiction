My fic features Hermione as Salazar Slytherin reincarnated, and I included the Ollivander spiel for her canon wand because it suited her new personality ridiculously well.

I don't think it matters, but I think canon wands are a great way of highlighting the similarities between the AU personality and the original personality. In the case of the level-headed trust-no-one Slytherin Harry, maybe he doesn't get close to people easily, but at his core he'll still defend the few people he really care about with his life? Maybe his calm demeanor takes a lot of effort and self-control to maintain, and inside he's actually raging at the injustice/threat to him and his?

Besides, you can always spin the wand description so that it still works out (i.e. emphasize traits that fit, leave out details that don't. Not very scientific but this is fiction after all...)
