Harry watched as a grin spread across Mr Poole's face. "I have a Holly and Phoenix feather wand."

It was a plain utilitarian wand, without an apparent direction to hold. Significantly, insignificant, in the plainness of a wood traditionally used for decoration. A tool without the need of additional refinement, or perhaps awaiting the decoration to come. Future adornment to be added. Perhaps by the ravages of time, use and adventure. Space for each scratch, scuff and mark to tell the story of the wand and its wielder.

And the core, a feather from a juvenile phoenix. The feather itself already frayed. Worn around the edges from the journey it had already traveled. "It was given to me by a friend." Mr Poole explained. "Traded for the repair on an antique chair he wished to use. He inherited from his grandfather, who had been given it in part of a trade for ships clock of the coast of Africa. His grandfather claimed that the ship had been given the feather in lieu of the gold and gems typically used in the spice trade. Old already then."

Harry examined the wand in his hand. He felt a warmth. Not the coil of energy he had once felt with his Ollivander made wand.

Mr Poole continued."Yes, I liked the juxtaposition. A blemished feather from a young phoenix, and an unblemished frame from an old wood."

Harry felt Mr Poole's hand touch his shoulder and tuned to face him.

With stern eyes Mr Poole gave some advice. "Harry, a wand it a tool. Sometimes a tool breaks, or becomes different. We may simply grow taller and need a more appropriate item. People grow and adapt and our wands requirements may change. I can use a blunted saw, the job will still be done, but a sharp saw is a wonder to work with and makes my craft easier."

Harry smiled.

"Now give the yonder target a spell, see how it feels. Ollivander gets to be all mystic with the firsties, but I build the reinforced wands for the Aurors."
