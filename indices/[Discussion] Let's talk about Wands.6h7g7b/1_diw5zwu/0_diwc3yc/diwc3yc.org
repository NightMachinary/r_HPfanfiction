On a random note, holly wands are supposed to be suited for people whose lives are most defined by some kind of spiritual quest, people who are fairly close to capital-D Destiny. That's a rather heavy thing to get through, and while I can understand when a writer takes a look at it and decides that for some reason some other wood suits him better, most of the time it seems that the decision to change is directed not by Harry being changed but by his usual wand being seen as not hax enough and not dark enough by the writer in question.

It's kind of sad, really.
