I think it depends if hes the boy who lived. if yes, then he should get the holly wand just because its the brother to voldemorts wand and harry is marked as his equal and has a piece of his soul in him. its also interesting that both harry and voldemort both have phoenix core wands and both came back to life after dying.

if he isnt the boy who lived i dont really care what kind of wand he gets.

but I dislike it , if the new wand is used as a lazy way to make harry more powerful
