I think there can be good reason to change a character's wand, but it needs to be well-explored, and wands need to fundamentally 'behave' in a certain way.

For instance, in /Circular Reasoning/, Harry is a mildly-deranged, extremely violent and irrational person, and it seems that through embracing his darker nature to the point that he enjoys killing and the Dark Arts (or at least did for a time), the Holly wand stops working for him almost entirely. I really enjoyed the way Swimdraconian examined the way that wands /feel/ to the characters, and in a way gives the wands personality.

If a wand is just treated as a focus, a means to project magic, that doesn't have any deeper characteristics, then there's bugger all reason to change it.

However, to counter that point, sometimes the stakes in a story can be raised by the main character's wand being snapped or otherwise destroyed, and examining how they then have to learn and adapt to a new wand, or a stolen one, or without one at all (like escaping capture whilst unarmed, for example).

If you feel that wands have deeper personalities /a la Pottermore/, then by all means, you can have a wand reflect its owner's personality, and through those means deviate from the canon allocations.
