Oh, I have no doubts that Olivander can make those wands (I might be wrong, but I think Fleur's wand had a veela hair core, so at least this one is a genuine wand core material), the thing is he doesn't.

If you really need Harry to have an unusual wand core, how hard is it to have him buy his wand elsewhere?
