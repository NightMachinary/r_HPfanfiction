If there is obvious symbolism that explicates your character, or if it provides good exposition, or something... then definitely.

For example, the HP I'm building will get an... odd wand that reflects the unintended consequences of my AU's "Lily's Protection". It won't be inherently more powerful, it is more that standard wands will fail to work, spectacularly. The problem won't be obvious at all, either. /cackles/
