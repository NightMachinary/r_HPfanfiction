well, really for me, I won't necessarily say I have a favourite pairing, though I do tend to gravitate towards Harry/Hermione.

for the most part, the main thing I keep in mind, is that a huge majority of the canon characters, we have little more than their name and perhaps 1 or 2 little facts about them (I mean come on, Lavender and Parvati are Hermione's dorm mates and share all the core classes with the trio, but we know next to nothing about them other than their names, and that they generally fit the "girly girl" archetype that cares at least as much about fashion and boys than anything else), so most pairings can work quite well if they're well-written.

pairings that I tend to favor generally are just well-written with plenty of character development.... Harry/Hermione and Harry/Tonks are probably the 2 I read the most, but there's been plenty of fics with Susan, Daphne, or one of the various other essentially OC females that were fantastic, gives an excuse to develop a bunch of characters outside of the core group in canon, and lets the story be "different" than just a canon re-hash.

but in general I try to keep an open mind about pairings, just about any pairing can work well if it's written well, but I tend to prefer the ones that have a good spot in canon to launch it from, whether it's Harry and Hermione when they spend all the time together without Ron training for the TWT, Tonks spending time with him at Grimmauld or talking to him while she's on "guard" duty at Privet drive or whatever.
