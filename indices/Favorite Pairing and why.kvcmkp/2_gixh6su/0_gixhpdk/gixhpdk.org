I like the idea of Ronarry if you have recommended fics please provide them.

As much as I love Luna, I never enjoyed Colin much. I think he has the same problem as Ginny, that being he was originally underdeveloped and I haven't read anything that makes him a more developed character. So personally I ship Luna with Hermione, it'd be cute to see Luna expanding Hermione's world view and helping her destress.
