basically I love all sorts of pairings. Honks can be good. dogstar, is good. hell I love almost all the pairing. luna is cute with hermione and I am I luna harry or harry hermoine fan

I mostly find the main canon pairings need improvement when written.

I hate drarry snarry snamoine and dramoine myself.

most of those just based on the movies lol.

I basically love most pairings if age appropriate but just the above four often not my fav
