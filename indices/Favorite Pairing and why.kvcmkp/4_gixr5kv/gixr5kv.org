Pretty much any Harry centric ship, with the exception of Harry/Hermione or any m/m slash. I couldn't tell you exactly why I don't like harmony, maybe its because I identify too much with both characters that it feels weird, maybe i just like the platonic dynamic they have in canon. I think for the most part its reactionary to Harmony zealots, e.g. the number of times I've read ‘Harry had always been in love with Hermione' coming out of left field in a non harmony story is frankly weird.

I like Harry/OC ships best because you can be really creative with the characters you make, though good ones are really few and far between. Favourites include Daphne Greengrass, for all intents and purposes an OC, Kalliandra Kaylens in ‘Eclipse of the Sky' and Abigail in ‘Grow Young with Me'

Not a ship per se, but I found the ‘romance' subplot in ‘Inspected by No. 13' to be kind of cute and charming in its own way, I've kind of waned more of it ever since
