Harry/Hermione all the way. I just think if JK hadn't dumbed Harry down a bit to make Hermione seem smarter, the two of them could have been a great couple.

Hermione is fiercely loyal to Harry, and even that one time she went behind his back, she did it out of concern for her best friend.

Harry/Tonks is another of my favourites. The way she's usually written in the fandom, as a bubbly, happy go lucky girl with a free spirit, is a perfect foil to Harry's more brooding nature.

Harry/Fleur is yet another. I think they might relate very well to one another, and things might pick up from there.
