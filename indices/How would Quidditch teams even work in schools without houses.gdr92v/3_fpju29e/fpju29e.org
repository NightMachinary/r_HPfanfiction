I find the Hogwarts method of intra-school teams that only play 3 games a year to be extremely unrealistic to then immediately jump into a professional season with weekly games. My headcanon is that there exists some kind of inter-school conference since there's no issue with distance. In the summers there could be a league as well made from local clubs and each pro team would have a youth developmental academy.
