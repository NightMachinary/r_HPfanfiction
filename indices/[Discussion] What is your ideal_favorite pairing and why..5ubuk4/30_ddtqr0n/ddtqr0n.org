Harmony because it 'seems obvious', mostly because of the staging in the movies (Hermione is usually right next to Harry with Ron in the background - I think they overdid appeasing Harmony shippers.)

Next to that, Harry can be paired with Luna, Daphne or Fleur without causing me heartburn. Hermione can pair with one of the twins, but I don't like her with Ron. Neville can pair with Luna or Ginny, but I don't really care.

Everybody else can match up on their own.
