When I started reading the books to my kids, Hermione seemed the obvious choice for Harry, but that changed when GoF came out. My wife said from the off that Ginny was meant for Harry,

So Harry & Ginny is my fav. Along with others, I think she gets seriously short changed in the books; as for the films....I'm also beginning to despair of the state of H&G fanfic as there are precious few writers left who write anything other than tooth rotting fluff. (not a cue for a list of recs btw). I have started to read a lot of Gen fics.

My least favourite? Its basically H&G with anyone else, but Ginny/Draco has to be the worst. Snape/Lily gets a special mention as does Scorpius/anyone.
