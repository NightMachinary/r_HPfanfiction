I love post Hogwarts pairings, and usually ones that couldn't take place until then.

HP/GD once she's an adult and Harry has decided what he wants to do with his life is nice.

HP/AT would be cool. I picture them both being rather devastated after the war and independently dedicating their lives to making Teddy's life great. They would share this, Harry would date around and not find anyone that really understands him or how much he values Teddy. Then the ship would happen. Haven't seen it yet, but it seems like a reasonable progression to me.
