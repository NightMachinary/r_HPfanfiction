One that I'm a fan of seeing explored is Harry/Colin. I would like to see a dynamic where Colin learns that Harry isn't just some famous person, but an actual hero that indirectly saved his life. This causes Colin to reflect on his stalker ways and helps him discover who he really is (3rd year goes by largely like in canon) and finally, in a stroke of faith and that famous Gryffindor courage, stands up for what Harry says when everyone else doubts him about placing his name in the Goblet. It is in that moment when Harry reciprocates that courage and lays himself bare (not physically) in front of Colin and tells all.

A couple correspondence notes later, and the Dursleys start to get curdled milk from the milkman, and the story goes on from there. Sirius would (maybe) get exonerated early, Colin has a knowledge-seeking bone in his body and gets an Occlumency book out of the library while Snape administers Harry's lessons, and a few more alterations afterward.

If someone could write a fic like this, I'd appreciate it. Putting the Horcrxes in play or not and, if so, killing Colin off at the end is up to you.
