I like unconventional pairs, be they dysfunctional or just generally unprecedented in some way. I lean heavily towards reading AU despite the fact that I love canon.

Only, I don't know if it's me or JK Rowling, but the endgame pairings came off to me as rather lacklustre. I don't think I read pairings for the romance, really, even if it's a romantic pair, but instead more for the dance of it. Character interaction like this was more shallow in the books, somehow. Maybe. I second guess myself because I'm pretty sure I'm aro or ace or both and am not a Good Authority on healthy relationships or how they should be presented. RIP.

Anyway, I'm rambling. I like these:

Lucius&Severus

Tom&Harry^{1}

George&Hermione

Charlie&Nymphadora

Charlie&Harry^{2}

Severus&Harry

Gellert&Albus

All first names, because consistency is important.

^{1} I don't see enough 'Tom, Dick, and Harry' jokes. Do better, TRHP authors.

^{2} Honestly... Charlie and everyone. I'll stand by this.
