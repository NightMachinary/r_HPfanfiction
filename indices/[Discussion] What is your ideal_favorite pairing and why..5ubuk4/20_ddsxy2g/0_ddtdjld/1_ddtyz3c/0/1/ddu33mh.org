Hrm, can't find it. But to be honest, it was basically PWP if I remember right. I /think/ it was a "Harry comes back to teach at Hogwarts" fic. I /think/ there was a previous Harry/Charlie relationship, but they broke up. I /think/ it ended up as a Snarry, with Charlie/Draco on the side. I could, however, be mixing two or more fics together...
