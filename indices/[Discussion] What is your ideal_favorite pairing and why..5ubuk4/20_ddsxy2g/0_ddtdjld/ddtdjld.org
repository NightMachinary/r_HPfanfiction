Charlie and Draco. With all of the name symbolism JKR put into her books, the fact that we have a dragon tamer and a dragon just completely swoops by everyone.

I still haven't found a decent fic for these two....linkffn(Saving Draco by You're All So Vacant) had this adorable chapter where Charlie takes Draco to a mall and he's scared of the escalators, but it was a bonding fic and that doesn't really appeal to me on principle....99% of the Draco/Charlie fics I've found are just...not believable. Draco is either too whiny, Charlie is not fully developed as a character, the plot is unbelievable (I just can't with the mpreg) and....yeah. Charlie and Draco. I hold out hope that I will one day find a fic to satisfy this.
