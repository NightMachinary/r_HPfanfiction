  I really wanted to try a bonding/marriage fic, and I haven't written a Charlie/Draco one before, so I figured I'd have a go. As Draco has the dark mark, he can only be taken into the order- and protected- if he has someone to take credit for his actions, someone to look after him. A spouse. His only option is Charlie Weasley, the 'attractive, intimidating one'. R&R
