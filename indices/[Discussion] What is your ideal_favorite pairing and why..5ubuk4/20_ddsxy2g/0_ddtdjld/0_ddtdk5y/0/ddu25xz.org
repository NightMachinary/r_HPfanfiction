/Yes./ I forgot to add that one, tbh. ♡ Beautiful messes, all of them. Love.

If I ever get the motivation, I might try writing a Charlie&Draco centric story. I'd probably make them both adults though. It'd be fun.

Thanks for your recs! I'll look into them. I'm always looking for interesting stories. ☆
