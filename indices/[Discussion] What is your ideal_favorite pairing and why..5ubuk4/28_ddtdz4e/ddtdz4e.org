Harry/Daphne or Harry/Gabi Delacour. Least favourite, Snape/lily Potter, I would rather drink bleach than read that and have stopped reading some stories when it cropped up in the back ground.

The why, Harry is a sarcastic, smart but not academically inclined person who always tries to do the right thing. I despise the epilogue for its happily ever after tone. I want more post Hogwarts stories where things aren't so great, where Harry struggles to adapt to life without Voldemort. His whole life was dictated by that fight and he had no real plan for an after. Ginny is fine but she's almost non-existent and I really didn't like how she treated Fleur. I feel Harry would either find someone a bit more cynical, a Slytherin who like him is a little bitter with the world. I really want more stories (Or any good ones at all) with a Harry/Daphne pairing that explore the dynamics of Draco and Harry being brothers in law. Without the death eaters, some of the richest people in soceity how does the magical world survive? Hermione is a prat, read books 1 and 6 if you've forgotten. She means well but doesn't play nice with others so she would likely create more problems than she fixes in her moral crusades.

Post Hogwarts with a more jaded world weary Harry, I love the idea of injecting the little ball of innocence that is Gabbi Delcaour. A bright spark in a dark world, something to pull Harry out of his slumber. Basically post hogwarts I can't see things being nearly as happy and simple as JKR does. I would love to see more of a struggling Harry who either pairs with a cunning Slytherin or an innocent person with whom he can escape the memories of the war.

Whilst in Hogwarts my favourite pairing is still Daphne. Why? Because I want to learn more about the wizarding world. We know about the muggle world, we're from it, show me more cool magical stuff. Moving past the ridiculous notion that muggle world=good and civilized whereas magical=barbaric then we don't really know much. A slytherin pureblood provides a perfect window to explore the magical world through. I can't say much about personality since she's basically a blank slate but her position in the world and a more objective, cynical mindset befitting someone of Slytherin I believe would mesh well with Harry. I think that with Ginny, I always question if Harry is in love with her or the idea of being in love. I know JKR says they're perfect for each other but if so she did Ginny a disservice in the books.
