Canon pairings are ideal for me as well. I think JKR's intentions were spelled out pretty clearly even in the earlier books, and I enjoy reading fic that explores those relationships further. I'm always on the hunt for good post-DH Ron/Hermione, my favorite pairing. Most likely to steer clear of Harry/Hermione and Draco/Hermione.
