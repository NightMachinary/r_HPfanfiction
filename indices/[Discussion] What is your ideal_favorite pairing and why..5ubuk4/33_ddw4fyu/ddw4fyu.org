I love Harry/Luna, also Hermione/Luna, tho I don't like Hermione/Luna when Hermione acts like she does when they are in school. In school Hermione js rude when she disbelieves Luna's ideas, and I feel like she would have grown out of that if they were going to start a relationship. I also enjoy Harry/Daphne (Ice Queen Usually, but doesn't have to be), and Harry/Fleur. I would enjoy a Harry/Myrtle fic but all I've seen is 2 fics that are smut (I wish there was more smut of it too). I still haven't seen a Harry/Lily Evans (preferably marauders era), that isn't smut, or is not just a crush (like in Delenda Est). I also have a soft spot for Harry/Bellatrix, but there is so few fics with that.

My least favorite would have to be Severus/Anyone, Voldemort/Anyone (except Bella, but I can see a pairing when he is younger and not become a dark lord yet.) I also dislike Hermione/Harry, and Ginny/Harry.
