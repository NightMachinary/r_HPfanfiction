If I had to work with canon and change as small amount of things as possible, my favorites would be Harry/Fleur or Harry/Luna, Hermione/Ginny, maybe Hermione/Bill, and Ron the professional Quiddich player living the bachelor lifestyle.

Without any downright massive changes, I'd say Hermione/Fleur (if it wasn't for the unnecessary animosity between them), or Hermione/Draco (if he got a decent redemption arc).

That said I pretty much only read femslash because I'm gay as fuck, and my all around favorites are Hermione/Bellatrix or Narcissa (or both). I just love how many different possible conficts and drama you can create from those pairings, unfortunately it takes a lot of work and a good author to get it right without a timetravel-ex machina.
