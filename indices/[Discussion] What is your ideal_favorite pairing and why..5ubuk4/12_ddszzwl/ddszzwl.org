/One that's believable./

But if I'm not answering OP's question like a dick, I'd say ...

*Ideal:* Luna/Harry or Luna/Hermione. Luna provides an interesting counterbalance to both characters but in different ways -- for Harry, a friendly (if weird) soul interested in him for his own sake; for Hermione, an utter challenge. I've never found a fic that's entirely convinced me of those pairings, though; Luna is devilishly hard to characterize correctly. So, basically, those two pairings get me nothing but tumbleweeds.

Runner-ups are Padma/Harry or Cho/Harry -- they're strangely rare.

*Favorite:* When I'm in the (infrequent) mood to actually read pairings, I used to go straight for the trash. Usually Tom Riddle or Voldemort paired up with some chick. It still makes me slightly nostalgic, but it's kind of boring now -- always the same in-Hogwarts melodrama (if Riddle) or some really creepy slave-type shit (if Voldemort). Eugh, no thanks.

Every once in a while though, I'll hit on something with Riddle or Voldemort that's actually decent /and/ lacking the usual creepiness -- like the abandoned and very offbeat linkffn(Ad Infinitum by Speechwriter).

*Least Favorite:* Most of the canon pairings that form as the books go along. Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny do absolutely nothing for me; I've tried to like them, but I just /can't/. Tonks/Lupin is possibly the only one that might be interesting to me, but the fics I've seen left me cold.

Fluff just isn't my thing, I guess.

Also, most m/m fics in this fandom are too yaoi-y and cliche to be bearable, so I generally pass on them. But I pass on most pairings-centric fics anyway for similar reasons -- cliches, unskilled writing -- regardless of the genders involved.

Edit: Downvoted on an opinion post? Well then, I'll just upvote everyone else here purely in the name of friendly disagreement and letting people have their own tastes.
