I'm a fan of HPLV/HPTMR, not because I like thinking about Voldemort's naked body (ew), but because I tend to enjoy the kinds of stories that include it. They tend to be dark and twisted and full of inner conflict, which is just what I like reading about. I don't actually care if Harry and Tom get it on or anything, as long as they're main characters and become close in some way. I've seen romance between them done excellently, and done so badly I felt slightly sick. The only thing I won't read is Voldemort raising Harry or grooming him. Childhood friend, sure, but father figure...ewwwwww...

Least favorite would be Harry/multi or Harry/random minor female character from another house. Like, why should I care about Daphne or Astoria or whatever? It's basically Harry/OC, which I'm not interested in. Harry/multi is just obnoxious, imo.

edit: linkffn(11972693) is a perfect example of HPLV that's done well. Slow burn, very dark, lots of inner conflict, not romantic in the least.
