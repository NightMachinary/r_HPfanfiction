Unfortunately there are very few:

"Finding a Place to Call Home", linkffn(9885609): Harry ran away with Astoria after being abandoned by everyone before the First Task. The story is OK, but not great.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3084182?view_adult=true][The Minister's Affair]] is quite the tragedy and only an one-shot, but very well written.

"Heterochromic", linkffn(10938984): Although Astoria is listed as a character, it's not really her.

--------------

The reason I like Astoria so much is because from the little tidbits JKR gave us, she appeared to be a great woman who fixed up Draco and taught Scorpius to become such a great kid. Her unfortunate early death added more mystery. I really want to see more fics exploring this character in greater depth.
