Given how the characters are written in the Books, I'm fine with canon pairings. After all, JKR wrote the Epilogue even before PS was finished.

However, I'm not happy at all with how Ginny was portrayed in the Books. JKR said several times Harry and Ginny were soulmates, and yet refused to give her a bigger role. It was a contradiction in itself. Hermione and Ron each appeared roughly 7000 times in the series, Ginny only about 800 times. This discrepancy for such an important character was simply too big. Ginny especially got short changed in Book 7, 100 more pages (would still be shorter than OoTP) about what happened at Hogwarts would go a long way to improve her standing among readers.

My favorite non-canon pairing is Harry/Hermione/Ron. The Trio friendship and relationship is a fundamental theme in the Series, and I love seeing them getting together. Also, I'm not bothered by the unconventional M/F/M relationship. Given how many writers push M/Multis, why can't I support my favorite female character have both her beloved boys?

Other pairings I like are:

Harry/Astoria

Harry/Luna

Hermione/Victor

Ginny/Luna

But overall, I'm pretty pairing neutral as long as the story is convincingly written, although I won't read male slash fics with the exception of Harry/Ron in the context of a romantic Trio.
