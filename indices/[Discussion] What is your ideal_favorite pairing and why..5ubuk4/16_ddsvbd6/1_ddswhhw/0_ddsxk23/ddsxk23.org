...i was joking, lol. i just think it's a funny crack!ship to imagine, what with one of them being known for their outstanding and iconic looks, and the other being fleur.

Among the inferi were Hermione's parents, Viktor Krum, and Luna. It was only a matter of seconds before they all were surrounded and killed.
