Ideal pairings:

- Anything femslash, because I am a massive dyke will and will forgive basically any story of anything if it has girl kissing.

- Harry/Hermione/Ron, because it's always been well written in my experience.

Least favorites:

- Just about anything with a large age gap (teacher/student, etc). Not on principle, just because it usually comes off as creepy.

- Voldemort/anyone
