Favorite: Harry/Hermione probably for a serious ship. For less serious ships, I like Harry/older woman, e.g. Tonks, Fleur, Andromeda, Bella, Narcissa

Least favorite: canon ships actually. Ginny is a footnote in the story and has next to no screen time, and the sum total of the ship is basically "Harry notices Ginny has grown boobs." Also not a fan of Snape or Draco with Harry or Hermione.
