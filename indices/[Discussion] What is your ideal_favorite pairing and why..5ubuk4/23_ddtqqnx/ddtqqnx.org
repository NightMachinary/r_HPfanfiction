Hermione/Luna has possibilities that I'd like to explore. Unfortunately, my works in progress feature time travel, effective time travel, and 1945 respectively, so I won't be writing that any time soon.

It's a tough pairing. You have the hardest character to write, and you have a lot of exasperation to work through or around with their vastly different worldviews.
