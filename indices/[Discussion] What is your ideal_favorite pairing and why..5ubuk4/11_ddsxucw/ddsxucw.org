I've shipped Harry and Hermione together since before I even started reading fanfic. Think it was around the time POA came out that I started really shipping them. So that's my ideal and favorite pairing.

My absolute least favorite pairings are Harry/Ginny, Hermione/Ron, Snape/Anyone, and pretty much all slashfic. (Got nothing against slash, I'm LGBT irl, I just dislike reading it in my fics.)

Finally, I have A LOT of guilty pleasure favorites that are odd pairings. Harry/Luna and Harry/Tonks are among the top.
