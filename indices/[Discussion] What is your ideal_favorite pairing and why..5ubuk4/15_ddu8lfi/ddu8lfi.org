I prefer canon pairings (I rarely ship non-canon pairings, and if I do it's either a former pairing that worked well or something that is plausible in canon)

Ron/Hermione, Harry/Ginny, Tonks/Lupin, James/Lily, Fleur/Bill etc...

Least favourite: Villain/Hero ships, Bully/Victim ships, rivalry(?*) ships, Teacher/Student ships etc...

*Is rivalry the correct term? I'm thinking Harry/Draco, or James/Severus.
