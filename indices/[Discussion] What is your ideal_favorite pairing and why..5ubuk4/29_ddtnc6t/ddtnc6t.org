I like Bellatrix/Voldemort because I can alllllmost see that in canon, except Bellatrix would be her obsessive, desperate self and Voldemort would use it to his advantage. Not much romance and touchy-feely (which I don't like in general).

Or Bellatrix with like, anyone else sexually, because she's hot.
