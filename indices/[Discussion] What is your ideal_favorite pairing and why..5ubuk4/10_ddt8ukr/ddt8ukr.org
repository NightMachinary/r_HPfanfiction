I must be an outlier here, but my favorite pairing is no pairing. I prefer to read stories with a focus on story and plot, or great friendship, mentorship or parent relationships rather than romance. I do read romance when the story or characters are compelling enough, which mostly includes canon pairings or more darker pairings since conflict is quite fun to read. I do try to avoid slash if possible though, or at least when it's not in the background.

My least favorite pairings is any femslash pairing, or harry/multi. I am also not really a fan of Harry/Fleur or Harry/Tonks either since I do not really care for either of them and found Fleur kind of annoying. Have not really read any Harry/slytherin girl fics and don't really have an interest in those.
