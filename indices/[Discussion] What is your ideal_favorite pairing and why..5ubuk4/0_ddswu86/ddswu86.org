I always thought it'd end up Harry/Fleur in canon before book 6. I mean you've got your protagonist, you've got the insanely hot woman, you've got the meet cute(the whole bouillabaisse thing where Harry's all awkward and shy), you've got your tension(Harry being picked as champion) then you've got your resolution and a way for them to become close friends(Harry rescuing Gabrielle). So yeah Harry/Fleur is my fave
