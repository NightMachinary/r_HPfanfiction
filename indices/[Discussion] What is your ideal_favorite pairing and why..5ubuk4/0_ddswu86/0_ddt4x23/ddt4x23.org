I think Fleur is done a huge disservice in canon as well. In some ways she goes from being a Champion to becoming rather strangely hamfisted arm candy. I think her inclusion back into the books later actually harms her character.

I try not to inspect too forcefully into how canon pairings got set up, and they are okay. Really, the canon pairings are okay, but they don't inspire me. Rowling even admits that the pairings weren't inspiring. That's fair, she wasn't writing a romance novel, and she stuck to her plan, which as a writer I know can be incredibly frustrating when your characters derail your plot, sometimes you just beat them back into place instead of examining, and sometimes we just want to finish writing the story.

Harry/Fleur would have been inspiring, Harry/OtherStudent would have been interesting in stretching the cast of characters, of giving Harry perspective outside his rather constrained world.

I think what was ultimately missing is Harry never really had an equal. Or at least it never feels like he did. And given this is the story of a severely neglected and traumatized boy, forming connections was incredibly hard for him, but that I think is the problem. Even right up until the end of the series it never feels like Harry really formed that deep abiding connection with someone. He's never free from his hell. It feels sad. Ginny seems like a consolation prize, and that does neither Harry nor Ginny credit from a storytelling perspective.

I think that's what makes me like Harry/Fleur so much, Fleur is literally mythological beauty, Helen of Troy levels of beauty. Harry is a serious and conflicted teenager, he literally lives hell every year and its still better than his home life, because at least when he's facing Voldemort he has friends. If my first year of high school had been anything like Harry's first year of Hogwarts I would have bought a boat and lived on it, never to see land again. You'd have to have a REALLY compelling reason for me to come back to shore, especially after second year.

I think Fleur is compelling enough. Or at least I think she could be.

A young neglected man carries a burden, and for a moment he is swept away by a truly magical woman. I think this idea is what makes fics like A Cadmean Victory popular even in spite of some of their deep flaws. Harry has something to fight for that the reader can actually grasp for a moment.

What irritates me about most Fleur fanfics is that she is treated as just arm candy. She's pretty hooray! Hell even canon doesn't really show properly that she is a formidable witch. It leaves Ginny in the same lurch too of course, powerful women that aren't in some sort of mothering role are rather absent in Harry Potter, or they get killed offscreen (poor Amelia).

I think I've rambled enough. Basically, I think Harry/Fleur done right is one of the best, but its so easy to just be lazy about it, in fact you could take almost all Harry/Fleur fics and turn them into Harry/Daphne fics and you'd barely notice. What's worse is how useless the female character is as anything but a romantic interest for Harry, which is a shame.

In other words, I want more Battle Couple stories.
