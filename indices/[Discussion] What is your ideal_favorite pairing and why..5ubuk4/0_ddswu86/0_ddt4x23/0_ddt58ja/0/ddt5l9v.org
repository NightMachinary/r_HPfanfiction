Its hard to say.

- Allure Immune Harry is actually REALLY good even if its a short one shot and mostly tongue in cheek, I think it captures the essence of what makes Harry/Fleur a magical pairing.
- Euphoria is a good 4th year rehash version.
- How Fleur Delacour Seduced me is a wonderfully entertaining smutventure.
- Cadmean Victory sells Harry's obsession with her quite well, before the plot kind of derails into Harry The Edge Lord. (As a side note, some scenes in this fic are amazing and some are just so bad it gave me emotional whiplash)
