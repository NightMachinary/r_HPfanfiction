Also, Wastelands of Time/Heartlands of Time, if that counts. I guess most people read it for the action though.

I also have a rule of listening to Hey Jude whenever Wastelands of Time is mentioned, so I'm gonna go do that.

I started reading God Amongst Men not too long ago, but I'm juggling several fics right now, so I've only gotten like 200k words into it.
