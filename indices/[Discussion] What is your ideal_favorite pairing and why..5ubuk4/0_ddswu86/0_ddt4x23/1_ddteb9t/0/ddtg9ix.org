Fleur isn't my favorite character. Harry is.

I grew up without a real mentor, I really identify with the floundering and difficulties and the angst that Harry suffers from as a result.

When I say a character was done a disservice part of it is the style of narrative. We only gets things from Harry's perspective really. But even then I think Fleur is odd.

In the Goblet of Fire we really only know a touch about Fleur, but we know she finds Hogwarts dismal, and Britain by extension. We know she is incredibly proud. Out of all the things that could be taken from her, it was not anyone at school, no they had to import a family member. And she cares so much she goes from being best described as a stick in the mud to incredibly demonstrative towards Harry. Then she abandons her family in France to work with Goblins of all people and in Britain a place she already said she disliked. That is dissonance to me. When she re-appeared later I was so shocked I actually set the book down, and re-read portions of GoF to make sure I didn't miss anything and still was incredibly confused. I had been expecting to never see her character again, just like Krum.

Then we get to spend all the time around Harry with the Weasley's watching her get insulted. Valueless interactions in my mind other than painting Ginny as incredibly petty, which I never really got from anywhere else.

But I don't mind canon Harry/Ginny at all like I said. For what little we see of her, Ginny is a strong and determined witch with just a touch of insecurities, which from a big family like hers ins't surprising, and she's pretty, and she likes Harry, and she spends a lot of time with him at the very least through osmosis. She works as a romantic interest without much need to justify it, so I can't really complain.
