I really want to see a crack fic where time traveling Luna tries to seduce Dumbledore, for the greater good, of course. I love the idea of Dumbledore having none of it and Luna getting increasingly persistent as ever twinkly Dumbledore casually undercuts undermines all of her attempts. Basically I don't actually care about the ship going anywhere I just want to read the chase. Two highly skilled highly insane magic users from different eras puling out every trick and skill thy have to stay a step ahead of the other. And if the ship also happens and it's done well then great.
