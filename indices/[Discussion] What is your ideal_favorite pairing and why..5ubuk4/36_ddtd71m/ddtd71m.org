I admit I'm a big fan of Harry/Hermione, especially as to me up until the end of Order of the Phoenix it was leaning towards them. When Half Blood Prince came out, I was really annoyed as Madam Rowling turned Hermione into a complete bitch.

When Deathly Hallows came out there were times when I thought that maybe, just maybe, Harry would end up with Hermione, especially in scenes like Godrics Hollow. Alas the Battle and Hermione started snogging the village idiot, leaving Harry to be with the fan girl.

Recently though thanks to fan fiction I've been on a bit of a Harry/Daphne (or Susan, Pansy or Delphini*) kick, with no end in sight.

*-Delphini for me is interesting as I usually put her birth back in my fics to be Halloween '79 (significant as it seems to be fates way of screwing Harry over!). The thought of the Boy-Who-Lived getting with the daughter of his parents killer is quite...interesting...

*On the other hand,* the thought of a certain Potions Master or Bearded One even considering reproduction is nausea inducing
