Ignoring Harry/x pairings. I really like Hermione/Fred or George.

The reason it appeals to me is not that Hermione is stiff and Fred is relaxed. Its that's they are both extremely clever and motivated people. The twins have always appealed to me because they are such good natured people, friendly, relaxed, relatively unprejudiced. They just love having fun and being magical and spreading their insanity.

Hermione is actually similar. She's incredibly good natured, incredibly passionate, focused and driven, and insanely clever. Inside of it all though Hermione loves being a witch, its part of why she's so driven I think. I think somewhere in the back of her mind, the child of two dentists, the most average girl in the world (at least in her own mind) has been given this incredible gift of magic. She never spurns it.

I think that dynamic of passion is interesting when its explored. Hermione clearly wants to make something of her magic, and Fred/George do too, even if its not expressed in the same way, I think there is a unique connection to be made there, to find that same love in someone else.
