Harry/Ron/Hermione is definitely my favorite. Harry/Neville and Hermione/Neville are also up there.

Least favorite pairing is hard, because there are a decent number of deal breaker ships for me. Some of the ones I've been most out off by include Ron/Luna, Harry/Orion Black, and Harry/Voldemort.

Not my least favorite pairing necessarily, but I'll generally not read Ron/Hermione fics unless there's something else about the fic I really like.
