I don't find it realistic tbh. Without Harry I just don't seem them thriving. So the ship is either abusive or OOC for me generally. I also really hate the 'Ron is a drunk and Hermione is shrill and bossy' archetype. Adding Harry gives both of them something to focus on, which I think does them both well.
