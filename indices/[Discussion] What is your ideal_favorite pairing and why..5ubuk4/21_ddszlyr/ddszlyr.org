I love George/Lee because there is so much room for ANGST and all I want are my boys in utter pain lol.

I'm also into some random rare-pairs, for no real reason. Harry/Charlie. Ron/Dean. I guess because there's more of a clean slate so there's a lot of different things to explore.

My first ever forever home OTP was Harry/Ron. I still love their friendship. I watched them falling in love over and over and over again for years. It's not my go-to anymore but it still gives me happy feels :)

And Sirius/Remus... again because of the angst possibilities.
