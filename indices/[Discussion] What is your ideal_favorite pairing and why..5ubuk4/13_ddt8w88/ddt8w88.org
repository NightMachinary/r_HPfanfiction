I've always liked Harry/Luna and Harry/Hermione, probably because some of the first fics I read were Harry/Luna/Hermione.

I don't do any main character slash, aka Harry/any guy, since most of the fics I read have him as the main character. I don't care if it's in the background, something like Sirius/Renus, for instance. Following from that, I'm not a fan of Fem!Harry, since it inevitably pairs a character that I'll always consider to be male with a guy.

I've read a bit of Harry/Fleur and Harry/Tonks recently, so that's on my mind. Not my preferred pairings, but I'm not against it by any means.

I don't really like canon!Snape paired with anyone, or Voldemort paired with anyone. I could see Voldemort using someone like Bellatrix as a source of pleasure, but I can't see him having any real emotional attachment, unless he's been written to be not insane/justified, etc. If he's going to be paired with someone seriously I'd rather they be an OC.

For the same reasons I don't like stuff like Draco/Hermione, or Draco/Ginny.

Harry/Ginny seems pretty bland to me, but it's fine in stories that have romance on the back burner.

There really aren't that many characters in the HP universe to choose from, are there? I read a lot of crossovers, which tend to pair Harry with someone in whatever universe he falls/hops/is pulled/is born into. But the same general rules apply.
