Very interesting idea! Although Oxford is a university aimed at older students - but perhaps hogwarts could have been a feeder school into it at a time when wizards were more integrated and university was a thing they did.

Oxford also looks very magical- many of the colleges look wizardy and various parts of it were used in filming for the first two films.
