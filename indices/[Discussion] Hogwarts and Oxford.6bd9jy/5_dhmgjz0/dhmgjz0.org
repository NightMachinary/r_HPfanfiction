A big part of my canon is that it's possible for Hogwarts students to go to University, but it's a rarely-picked option only taken by those who want to pursue a non-magical field of study, such as Astronomy, or those who fancy making a career in the Muggle world, such as my main character. Here's a snippet that more-or-less explains it......

  Last term's career discussion with Snape had gone about as well as I expected. Being in his house, yet no bloody use at his subject meant I was never going to win much esteem from him. But I'm sure I managed to even lower his opinion by meekly voicing an interest in going on to a Muggle university. I'd somehow latched onto the idea that a degree might give me more interesting options then the usual wizard jobs, which struck me as either boring or terrifying.

  However, Wizardry in general views all Muggle education as worthless. If you ever found yourself facing the interview panel for some prestigious Ministry job, and you proudly mentioned your three /summa cum laude/ degrees from Oxford, Harvard and the Sorbonne, they'd look at you like you'd just relieved yourself on the carpet. So spending three years at university carried the reputation of being an option only picked by a small handful of academically-obsessed oddballs -- the sort that are considered a bit peculiar even by their Ravenclaw housemates. Despite this, I assumed one or two Slytherins were bound to have made that choice in recent memory -- we are more of a mixed bunch than outsiders generally assume.

  Apparently not. Snape reluctantly admitted that such a thing was possible for those who wanted to take this “eccentric route” and the rest of the short interview was spent in him rummaging around in his desk drawer for the appropriate leaflet and the name of the person at the Department of Magical Education I had to write to. He signed off on my choices of NEWT subjects, only commenting that they were a challenging selection, but well within my abilities and would serve me well when I eventually came to my senses. Then he dismissed me.
