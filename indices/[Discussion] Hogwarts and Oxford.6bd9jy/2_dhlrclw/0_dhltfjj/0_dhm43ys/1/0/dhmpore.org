Yes, the POV will switch to whomever is most relevant to drive the plot, but primarily the POV will be either Luna or Harry. One of the themes of the fic is that everybody in Harry's life seems be thriving and has moved on from the conflicts from their youth, but Harry seems to be stuck there.

That's where this fic kind of differs from many fics in the Hurt/Comfort category, because it's set in peace time where everyone has already started to move on. Harry's really good at living during war. It's all he's ever known. He needs learn how to live in peace.
