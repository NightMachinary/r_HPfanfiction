I, for one, think that's an absolutely fascinating idea and you should totally go for it.

Edit: Just spent a little while thinking about this. Here's what I came up with.

The University of Oxford has had a long association with Hogwarts, occasionally offering higher-level magical education, but primarily as a means of furthering one's mundane education after graduating Hogwarts as well as for seeking magical apprenticeships. Though it operates separately since the SoS and offers no classes these days, the Oxford College of Magic remains the premier British academic association for higher-level magical scholars, provides help for recent Hogwarts graduates searching for apprenticeships, and aides in publication of mastery research.
