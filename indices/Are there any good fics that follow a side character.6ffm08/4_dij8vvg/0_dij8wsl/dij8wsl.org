  COMPLETE. AU. Canon-inspired. Nearly eleven-year-old Percy's attempts to run away from home gets him far more than he'd ever bargained for. Encountering an Azkaban escapee, procuring an illness that brands him as dangerous by Ministry standards and being sorted into Slytherin, he tries to find his way back home again. DARK. Percy/Audrey endgame.
