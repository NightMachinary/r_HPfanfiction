Check out this story that covers Percy and Audrey, along with some Bill and Fleur, a few others, canon compliant during the 7th year: linkffn(12181042). I think it's borderline crazy that it has so few follows and reviews, it's been a favorite of mine.

I think it's a great story with a clever explanation of how Percy may have been working on his redemption story all through 7th year. It's a WIP but gets pretty consistently updated, usually once a week, sometimes you get an extra chapter in the week.
