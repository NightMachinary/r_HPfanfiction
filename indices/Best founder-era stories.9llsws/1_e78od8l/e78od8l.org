My favorite founders fic is a crossover containing the movie versions of Thor and Loki:

*[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/224284][Hogwarts: A (Marvelous) History, or: Thor and Loki's Excellent Adventure]]*

The brothers visit Midgard and, thanks to Loki, they are mistaken for wizards. Under the aliases of Godric Gryffindor (Thor) and Salazar Slytherin (Loki) they each help Helga and Rowena build their dream of a safe school for young magical children.
