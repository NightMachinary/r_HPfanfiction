[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494/chapters/25241499][Of a Linear Circle]] by flamethrower has a character from the Founders Era coming to the modern one and romancing Severus Snape. (It seems more resaonable in context.)

I'd recommend reading it for the character and world building, including Founders Era world building, but you could skip to [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11631114?view_full_work=true][Part III]] which is set in the Founders Era (except the first chapter) or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13769718/chapters/31647636][Part V - Ravenclaw]], which is some pretty great stand-alone backstory for Rowena.

/Godric Gryffindor has been called too daring for his own good, but even HE is starting to think that charging into a swamp in search of a wizard known only as "Serpent-Tongue" is not the brightest move..../

Fairly short and fun.

([[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/andrea13_and_persephone_kore/MAS01.html][Moon and Stone]] is in the same era, if you like the author.)
