I'd recommend A Curse of Truth

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth]]

By: butalearner

An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

Rated: Fiction M - English - Drama/Humor - Harry P., Hermione G., OC, Daphne G. - Chapters: 28 - Words: 198,847 - Reviews: 680 - Favs: 1,046 - Follows: 502 - Updated: Mar 3, 2013 - Published: Oct 6, 2012 - Status: Complete - id: 8586147

It's a self-insert but it's good, I promise, and has a love triangle between the OC/Hermione/Harry.

But I'm not sure about the romance part.
