- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][The Natural 20]] has an OC who has been summoned from a universe that functions on a RPG mechanics (so it's the default trio+OC). 265,512 Words, WiP.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]] --- IIRC, this one fits your criteria also, but I'm not sure. You can check it for yourself and see if it's relevant here or not, but I'd not recommend reading further than Ch 11-12, because the quality considerable worsens after that. 251,803 Words, Complete.
