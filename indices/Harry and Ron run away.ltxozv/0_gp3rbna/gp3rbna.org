I like this idea a lot! After all, Ron's place in the trio was designed to give them the cultural knowledge. Hermione's was for /Hogwarts, A History\/* and general research purposes.

*JKR even said that the boys never read it. I like stories that touch on this: sometimes they have a bet as to who can go the longest without reading it, sometimes Harry reads it but won't admit to it.
