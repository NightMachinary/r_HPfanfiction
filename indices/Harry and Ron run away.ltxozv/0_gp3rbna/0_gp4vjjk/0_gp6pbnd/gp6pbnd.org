I don't really see this. Ron may not be an idiot, like some people like to portray him, but he's no intellectual. I like to imagine that he, in fact, hides some of his knowledge and "plays dumb" a bit in their arguments. She likes to show off her knowledge and he, growing up with the twins and Molly, possibly sees the arguments as normal familial communication.
