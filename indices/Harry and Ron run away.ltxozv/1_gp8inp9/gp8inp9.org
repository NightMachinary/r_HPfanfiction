  Can be a trio fic I suppose, as long as Ron is part of the drive for leaving.

One thing to note is that unlike the rest of the Trio, Ron is tied to Britain. His family is there, and much of their sustenance comes from the land they own and the patriarch's job at the Ministry. It's not something they can afford to just drop - they are rooted there, and Ron leaving could have negative repercussions on his family.

We see a small glimpse of that in DH: Ron has to be replaced by a disguised Ghoul and said to suffer from a virulent illness in order to avoid overt repercussions of being associated with Undesirable Number One.

Which is why I'd like for Ron to provide direction, but remain behind, using the 'falling out' to be clear of suspicion. After all, compartively, Harry and Hermione can move much easier. Hermione's parents can get a job anywhere with people, Harry has nothing to tie him down.

One of the fics I've been trying to track down for some time had a scene where Dumbledore'sSpy!Ron came across HHr duo preparing to leg it, and siggested Hermione obliviate him, knowing she'd never tried it before and that he'd probably end up with leaky brains. He did it, because he wanted to help them, but Manipulative Dumbledore would read his memories and withdraw support the Weasleys were depending on to survive if he did- and his role was Dumbledore calling that favor in.
