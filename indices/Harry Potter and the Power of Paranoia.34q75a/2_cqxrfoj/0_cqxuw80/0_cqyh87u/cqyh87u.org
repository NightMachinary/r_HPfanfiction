*Some spoilers here.*

--------------

In /Power of Paranoia/, Harry isn't a horcrux at all. That's just the trope, that his curse scar is easily medically treated and Dumbledore was too evil/stupid to get Harry a magical medical checkup to take care of it.

--------------

Magical Britain is Stupid is another dumb trope this story uses. It needs a lot of support to make any sense and we don't get it here. A reason is needed that other, better ways of doing things don't get adopted in Magical Britain. Especially when the fic shows intercontinental travel as being so trivial for rich and powerful people.

Non-magical Great Britain is a world power, top of the stack for hundreds of years, multicultural and internationally entwined. Why would their magical world be so backward and crapsack compared to everywhere else? It /could/ be explained why the magical US of A is so much better (along with Magical Australia, which is suggested as being still not quite as good as the US), maybe something involving WWII. But it isn't really explained in this fic, as it usually isn't.

Magical Britain is declared as worse and other places are declared as better. The only hint as to why is that Magical Britain's Hogwarts is a crappy school, which is solely because Dumbledore is evil/stupid, and that's destroyed their entire society. Which almost works, I guess. But I've made it sound more reasonable than it is usually presented simply because /Power of Paranoia/ tries at least a little to explain. The story never actually comes out and says that, and it isn't even directly implied. I'm reading into things a bit to explain possible author rationales*.
