When the healer removed the horcrux, he did not think or know it was a horcrux, he thought it was a simple case of bad possesion by ghost. Which seems more common and mundane , and probably touched upon in medical training. It was just Harrys luck that it worked.

Yes the Dumbledore bashing is there, as is Britain is stupid, but I don't agree with the Maximum Fun USA. It's different, different practices, different modus operandi. I can see how it would be different and more modern then the European counterpart as it is a younger country.

Sadly the Fidelius is central part of the story so it seems clichéd(blame Harry Potter and the Power of Time) but without it the fic wouldn't work.

Many people say that the first half of the story where Harry runs away is riddled with the usual clichés, but it's not true. That is the point of the fic. Harry seas many things and in his heightened paranoid state thinks the worst possible things. So from his point of view, everything is out to get him and big conspiracy against him while from the other view a bunch of determined adults trying to protect a kids innocence.

The best part of the story is the H/L pairing , there are not enough of them and the ending. It was pretty unique ending for Dumbledore the only thing missing for me is an epilogue of what happened to Harry.

In conclusion I wouldn't call it a genius of a fic, but it's a nice read.
