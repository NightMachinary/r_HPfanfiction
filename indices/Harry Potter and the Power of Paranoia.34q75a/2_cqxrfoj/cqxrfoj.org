Ignore the "characters are canon" and "no bashing" thing. That just means they aren't Martians wearing people's name tags on their skin suits, and no one shits themselves in the Great Hall. The thing is pretty Dumbledore bashy as well. The paranoid turn is very well done, though.

But there's a lot of bad or overused tropes. Modified magical vow schlock*, Fidelius conceptual abuse, the Maximum Fun USA where everything is better, and "silly Dumbledore, horcruxes are studied in first year magical medicine."

Still. Last month was slow for good new fics. This is very readable and well enough written not to offend even my rarefied tastes. Certainly isn't overly macho blah like a lot of Harry breaks away fics turn out. Well worth a read.
