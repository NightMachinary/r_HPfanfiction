It's a really nice premise, that runs out of narrative steam almost immediately. It gets a lot of goodwill back with the wonderful central pairing, but throws it right back in the reader's face by making one of fandoms most brainless ideas (I.e. wards, warding) central to the plot.

Here's my impressionistic review:

“THIS IS FUCKING STUPID... i can't wait to see what happens next ... FUCK YOU.... hey, great, there's another chapter.”
