linkffn(6792771) This fic falls short in a lot of places that Harry Potter and the boy who lives excels and I can only imagine it would be rather disappointing to read immediately after that fic. A daphne that goes to Durmstrang (for a reason that is actually explained in the story) is the main love interest but is incredibly one dimensional when compared to Calypso Rosier. Though considering that OC is probably one of the best in all HPFF that isn't saying much. Worth a read if you've got nothing else to.
