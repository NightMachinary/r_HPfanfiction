I think another great way of looking at the skill of conjuring items is when Arabella Figg came into Harry's trial, Fudge was like, “Percy go find a chair” (paraphrasing), which means not even all fully qualified wizards can conjure one piece of furniture. Dumbledore conjured hundreds of sleeping bags!

Also, props to Arthur Weasley for being able to conjure more chairs than the Minister of Magic in Order of the Phoenix. (Arthur's abilities are also underrated.)
