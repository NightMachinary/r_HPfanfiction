It doesn't happen in the Books, because it's mostly from Harry's perspective. Everyone was focused on Harry, from that height he likely would have died, and a spell that slows the fall is likely the best thing to do in that situation. If Harry did know that Dumbledore saved him, he would've tried to thank him, not to mention it would take away from the big reveal about the Woman screaming. We all know the Movies and Books have Divergence in the Cannon, but it doesn't mean there can't be a context for stuff like this.
