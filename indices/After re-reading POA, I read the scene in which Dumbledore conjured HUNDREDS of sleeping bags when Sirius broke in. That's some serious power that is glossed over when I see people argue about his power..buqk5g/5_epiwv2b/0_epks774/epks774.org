Except that doesn't happen in the books. It cuts out from Harry's dementor nightmare to him in the Infirmary.

  At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again. ... Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head ... a woman ...

  ....

  “Lucky the ground was so soft.”

  “I thought he was dead for sure.”

  “But he didn't even break his glasses.”

  Harry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there, or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.

  “That was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.”

  Scariest ... the scariest thing ... hooded black figures ... cold ... screaming ...
