  Why did he die again. There is no way that Dumbledore shouldn't have noticed, and resisted the curse.

How could he resist the ring curse? If you are poisoned you can't resist the poison. If you are stabbed you can't suddently invalidate the stabing by sheer force of will. Ring was likely enchanted with compultion charm like say a confundus charm. Voldemort was highly knowledgable in many areas of magic, some even ancient and long lost like Harry's protection.

  "His mother left upon him the traces other sacrifice. . . . This is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it... but no matter. I can touch him now."

Or like the ritual he used to come back to life

  "I knew that to achieve this - it is an old piece of Dark Magic, the potion that revived me tonight"

He is very knowledable in many areas and since Dumbledoor does not practice Dark Magic, it is far to say that he could have lacked knowledge about some spells or simply had no way of fighting them off. Remember, he needed Snape, a practisioner of the Dark Arts, to delay Voldemorts curse.

Anyway, what kind of compulsion magic could Voldemort have used? Maybe something similar to that potion he used to protect that Horcrux(The locket) in that cave. Just instead of causing you to remember terrible memories it could instead force you to remember good ones. The magic could make Dumbledoor believe his sister is still alive and he needs to put on the ring to get her or something like that.
