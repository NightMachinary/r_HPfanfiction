Yeah. I kind of wish Dumbledore went out in a duel with Voldemort injuring him greatly. It would explain why Voldemort waited so long to get back in the action, you could argue that Dumbledore lost due to a weak body instead of dying due to a weak mind. Seriously, as you age, your mind gets stronger, so dying to a faulty body at over a hundred is more believable than someone who has always been gifted, and intelligent with 100 years of experience, dying to a brain fart basically.
