I meant resisted the compulsion to the curse. My fault there for poor english. Also while those theories are all well, and good, that's all they are, theories. Until JKR says something on the subject(and it better be believable to trick someoneof his age, and power), i'm going to continue believing it was "plot." Which we know it was, we know the trope this story runs on.
