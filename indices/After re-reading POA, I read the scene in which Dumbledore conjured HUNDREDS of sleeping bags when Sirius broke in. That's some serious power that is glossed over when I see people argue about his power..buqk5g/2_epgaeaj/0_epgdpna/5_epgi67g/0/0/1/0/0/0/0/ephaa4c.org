Firstly,I never said Voldemort was weak, only that he's not as strong as Dumbledore. This is backed up multiple times in the book, especially the whole Dumbledore being the only wizard Voldemort feared. Yes Voldemort is a powerful, and impressive wizard, but I don't think he quite stacks up to Dumbledore, but I never said he was weak, so please don't put words in my mouth.

Secondly, there's plot, and then there's "plot". One of them is used to help move the story along, the other is used as an excuse so that you don't have to explain how it worked/happened. Plot, Harry successfully using the Patronus out of desperation, and fear after learning it for months. "Plot," Dumbledore being cursed by Voldemort's Hocrux, because reasons, when someone of his age, and experience should mean differently. You see what I mean.

Thirdly, i'd love to see stuff from an adult DE perspective, and i'd love to see more of Voldemorts power, and genius in general. Sadly though we can only work with what we've got, and that's all i'm doing.

Lastly, the difference(as i've said earlier in this post already, although not this chain) between his summoning of the food, and his conjuring of the sleeping bags is in the way he does it. He uses his hands to summon the food(which i'm assuming is meant for a signal, if not that's an impressive feat of wandless magic), where as he waved his wand to conjure the sleeping bags. Both feats were done differently, so it would make sense that how they come into existance is seperate from each other as well. Just using common sense here.
