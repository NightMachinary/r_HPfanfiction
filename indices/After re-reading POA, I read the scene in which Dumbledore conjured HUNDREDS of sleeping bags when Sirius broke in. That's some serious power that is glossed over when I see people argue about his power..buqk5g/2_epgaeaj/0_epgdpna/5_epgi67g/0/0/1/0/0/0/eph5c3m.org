So first off, I have no idea why you're being downvoted, everyone has a right to their opinion. Anyways, why do you expect me to ‘have something?' I'm just bringing up a theory to explain why your argument could be invalid, if you agree, great. If not, oh well. It's a theory. Not a scientific report essay. Your argument is already based on opinion, facts won't really help. Any argument that is made can easily be explained by ‘oh, it's plot.' Harry was apparating before he even knew what magic was, he learnt a highly advanced patronus charm in his third year... why aren't you calling /him/ powerful? Everyone was more powerful in the earlier books, and that most likely includes Voldemort. There's ‘nothing' to support this (except all of the evidence to the contrary, such as how Voldemort was able to duel Dumbledore, how he was able to fly broomless, how his name is still really feared, how he was able to implement an isle-wide taboo, etc.) but there's nothing to contradict this either. All you have is ‘I know Dumbledore is strong and I think Voldemort was weak,' and sorry if I don't think that wins you the debate by default. I can say the Dumbledore conjuring those sleeping bags was for ‘plot' too. (And P.S. how do we know the elves didn't do it? He waves his hand and food appears in the welcoming feast but we know that /that/ is done by the elves...)
