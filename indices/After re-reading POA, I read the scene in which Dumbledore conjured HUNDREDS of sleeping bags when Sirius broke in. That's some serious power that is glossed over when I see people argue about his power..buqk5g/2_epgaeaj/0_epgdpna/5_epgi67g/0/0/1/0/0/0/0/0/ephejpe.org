Sorry, didn't mean to put words in you mouth. When I said ‘weak,' I meant exactly what you meant, which is ‘weaker than Dumbledore.'

I'd argue that Harry's Patronus was part of the “plot” as well. Really, the entire time-turner thing was quite “plot”-like, but I digress, that's not really the point.

All of those are good points, and what I was hoping for instead of the “so still nothing” comments. I hope we can discuss like this instead of with one-liners. :)
