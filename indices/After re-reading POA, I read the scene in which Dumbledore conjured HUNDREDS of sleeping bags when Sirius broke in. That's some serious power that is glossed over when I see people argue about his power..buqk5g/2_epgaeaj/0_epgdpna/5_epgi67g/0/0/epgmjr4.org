You don't exactly get to see Voldemort do stuff do you? Imagine if the book was told from an adult Death Eater's perspective. You'd be seeing Voldemort do amazing things while only hearing about and never seeing how Dumbledore is powerful. And Voldemort is almost certainly much worse than Grindelwald---you don't hear /him/ being called by ridiculous titles do you?
