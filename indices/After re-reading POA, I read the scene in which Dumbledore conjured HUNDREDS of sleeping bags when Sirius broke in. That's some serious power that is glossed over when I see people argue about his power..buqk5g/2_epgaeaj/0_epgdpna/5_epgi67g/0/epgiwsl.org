Exactly, plot. Prophecy=plot. Dumbledore is more powerful than Voldemort. Please show me a scene where Voldemort shows more power than Dumbledore? Please show me Voldemort beating something that is literaly defined as unbeatable. I'm gonna say that Dumbledore even before death was more powerful than Voldemort.
