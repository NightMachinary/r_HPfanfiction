I'm not arguing that the old coot is strong and "powerful". I just wouldn't add /"...can beat Voldemort who used the dark arts.../" when the whole plot of the story was that they made Harry + Co into child soldiers. I can't and won't give him that. Yes, he was detrimental to keeping Voldemort in check throughout the second War, but it wasn't Dumbledore the prophecy warned about - doesn't take away his magical ability, but it was the Potter's/Longbottom's that he had feared the most because of that damn prophecy. He only wants Dumbledore dead because he's a nuisance to his cause and because he's mentoring Harry.

Just so everyone who reads this is clear, this isn't me /"hating"/ on the eccentric Headmaster, I'm only giving him credit for the things he did. He didn't - but more importantly, *couldn't* kill Voldemort otherwise a lot of people would still be alive. Was the magic he used impressive? Yeah. But he's way past his prime and Vlody went up against him and the order enough times for the Potter's and Longbottom's to go up against him thrice.

...Anyway, that's just my opinion on the matter. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
