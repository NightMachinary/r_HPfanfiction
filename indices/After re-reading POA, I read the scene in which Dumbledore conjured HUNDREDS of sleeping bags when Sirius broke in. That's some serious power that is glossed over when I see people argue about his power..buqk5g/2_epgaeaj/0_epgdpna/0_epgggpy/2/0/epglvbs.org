Compulsions aren't based on power, they're based on mental strength. You could be the most powerful thing in the universe, and still fall to a compulsion. Obviously, Dumbledore isn't a slacker about mental strength at all, but

a) he's been looking for that ring all his life, and he can't have been thinking clearly. (Imagine finding something that you've dreamed of for years and have thought impossible..)

b) who knows what he faced to reach that point. Think mind-potion in the cave. That was one Dumbledore was willing to bring a /sixth year/ on... I'm fairly certain the shack would have been a hundred times worse.
