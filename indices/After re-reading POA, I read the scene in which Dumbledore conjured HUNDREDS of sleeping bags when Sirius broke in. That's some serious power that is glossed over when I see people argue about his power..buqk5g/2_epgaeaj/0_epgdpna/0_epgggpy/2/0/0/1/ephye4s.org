Of course it's due to plot, everything in the book is due to plot.

- 3 first year should not be able to win against a troll, or pass the protection meant to stop a Dark Lord.
- Even with a Phoenix and a shiny sword, a 12 years old boy should not be able to kill one of the most dangerous monster known to wizards.
- Same boy should not be able to repel one hundred dementor alone, especially when one was enough to knock him out just weeks before, and with a spell he "mastered" for the first time.
- The dark lord should just kill his "nemesis" once in his power, not make a long ass monologue before giving him a chance to "duel", where some bullshit story about brother wand will give the hero an opportunity to escape.
- 6 barely trained teens should not be able to sneak into the best guarded department of the ministry, neither should be able to resist the team of highly trained terrorist who waited for him there.

Without the plot, Harry Potter would have died when Voldemort struck him.

But even by accepting that "it's for the plot", Voldemort death is acceptable. The man did say that, being more intelligent than most, he does least mistakes, but the one he does tend to have worst consequences. You can't be perfect all the time, he found an item he thought he would never see, carrying the answer to a question he wondered most of his life, and probably enchanted to entice people coming near it, and lowered his guard.

The Elder Wand is not just a magic stick making someone invincible, it may be stronger than a normal wand but it doesn't mean that any spell cast with it will be invincible. It's just a bonus, not a god mode.

And even if Dumbledore could have theorically survived (I don't see why amputating the cursed limb would not have worked), he chose to die in a way that ensure his pawn was in place for the final act (and this plan really only worked "because the author said so" compared to his death).
