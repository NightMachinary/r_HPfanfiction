Again I gotta call bull. Dumbledore while he may have been vulnerable, did not get to his age through merit alone. He is quite intelligent, and wise. Someone of that age, wisdom, and power should not have fallen too such a curse. Even with the knowledge of how he's been looking for it his whole life, he was still in a place that Voldemort trapped holding what he believed to be a Hocrux. The impression I got of Dumbledore tells me that he would never have fallen for that. I guess until JK releases a statement one way, or the other, we gotta agree to disagree. Not that I disagree, I just think it was due to the plot more than anything else.
