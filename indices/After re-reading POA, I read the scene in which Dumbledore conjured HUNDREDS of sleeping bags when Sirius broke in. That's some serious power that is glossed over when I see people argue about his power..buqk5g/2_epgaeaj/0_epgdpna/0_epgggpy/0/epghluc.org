If there was one person likely to resist and notice a curse "powerful as fuck" it's Dumbledore. The reason why he was vulnerable to it, I think, was his emotions. He probablt yearned for an opportunity to see his sister and apologize or something like that, and thus the curse was affecting him much more than it would someone else.
