Harry Potter is basically full of that. I still love HP but I've come to accept the fact that HP's rule,plot and lore isn't as fleshed out as others. It's just amazing despite those flaws and really an easy and relaxing read.

I mean just the Goblet of Fire doesn't make any fucking sense. No matter how people twist it. There wasn't any reason why Voldemort & co needed Harry to go through all those bullshit just to touch a portkey, especially once Crouch has gotten a hold of the Marauder's Map

Another is why no one, not a single fucking person, especially Dumbledore & Lupin (no matter what plot excuse they give) tried to ask Sirius why he betrayed Jamie in 13 years.
