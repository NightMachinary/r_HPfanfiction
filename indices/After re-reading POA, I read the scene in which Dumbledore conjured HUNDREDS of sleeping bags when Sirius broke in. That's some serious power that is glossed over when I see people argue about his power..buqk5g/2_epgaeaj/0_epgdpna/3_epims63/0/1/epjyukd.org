There is at least one other instance of voldemorts spellcasting that dumbledore could not overcome - the DADA post curse

I also don't see how Dumbledores inability to undo a curse means his knowledge is insufficient, even merlin probably couldn't revive an AK victim and this curse seems to work by spreading death so it likely bears some resemblance to an AK in which case the fact that he managed to even get it contained is extremely impressive
