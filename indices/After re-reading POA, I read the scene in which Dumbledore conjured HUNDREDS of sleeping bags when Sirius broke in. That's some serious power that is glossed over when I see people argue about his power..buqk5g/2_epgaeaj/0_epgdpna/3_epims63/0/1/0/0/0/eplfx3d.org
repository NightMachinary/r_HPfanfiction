I consider a curse to be, well a curse. Something that causes suffering, not instant death. So in the strictist sense, the AK is not a curse. In relation to Dumbledore, while I may be willing to believe that he could "bow" to a curse due to his emotions regarding certain things(like his sister), I don't believe he'd bow to one when he is looking for a Horcrux, in a place that Riddle himself placed traps in. I honestly think that Dumbledore would have a strong enough sense of mind to resist any compulsions, because of his knowledgeon how insidious Riddle can be. It seems OOC that he'd not. That's just the way I see it though.
