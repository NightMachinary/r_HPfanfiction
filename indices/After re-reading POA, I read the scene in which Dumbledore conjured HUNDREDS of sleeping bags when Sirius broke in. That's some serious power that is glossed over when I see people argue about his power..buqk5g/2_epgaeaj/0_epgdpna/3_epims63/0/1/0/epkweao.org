I don't personally consider the AK a curse. Also while i'm fine with Dumbledore not being knowledgeable enough to undo a curse, I refuse to believe that his will is weak enough to bow to a compulsion. Tat's what I really hate. Think of everything you know of Dumbledore, does him actually doing such seem to fit his character?
