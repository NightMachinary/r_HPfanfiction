  I refuse to believe that his will is weak enough to bow to a compulsion. Tat's what I really hate. Think of everything you know of Dumbledore, does him actually doing such seem to fit his character?

Honestly if it relied on brute force then no, but if it was sneaky enough ala the many deaths of Harry Potter once you combine it with the fact that he has wanted it independently to deal with some regrets that he has had for his entire adult life, then while I wouldn't automatically assume he'd bow to it I would say that it would not be OOC to do so
