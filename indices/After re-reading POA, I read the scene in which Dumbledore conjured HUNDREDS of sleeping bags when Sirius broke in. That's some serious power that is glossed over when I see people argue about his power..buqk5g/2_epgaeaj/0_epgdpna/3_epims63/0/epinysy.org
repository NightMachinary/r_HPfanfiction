I'd say his mind, power, and knowledge of magic outstrips Voldemorts own, but his bod is weak, he's over 100 years old. I'd have been fine if he died fighting Voldemort, but that he died to a curse seems like a bit of a cop-out. While he may physically be weak, and slow, his mind should be the strogest it's ever been, that he lost to a...we don't even know is a big let down.
