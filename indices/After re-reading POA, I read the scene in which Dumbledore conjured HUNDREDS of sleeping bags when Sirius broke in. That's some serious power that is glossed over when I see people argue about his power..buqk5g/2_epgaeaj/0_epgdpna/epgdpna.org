So currently Dumbledore is powerful enough to create hundreds of sleeping bags out of nothing, can beat Voldemort who used the dark arts, and also rituals to strengthen himself(I think, fanon or canon?). He beat Gellart who was using the Elder Wand, a wand famous for being unbeatable. Don't forget that the Dark Arts are naturally stronger since their designed to kill people.

Why did he die again. There is no way that Dumbledore shouldn't have noticed, and resisted the curse. Again the plot comes out the strongest.
