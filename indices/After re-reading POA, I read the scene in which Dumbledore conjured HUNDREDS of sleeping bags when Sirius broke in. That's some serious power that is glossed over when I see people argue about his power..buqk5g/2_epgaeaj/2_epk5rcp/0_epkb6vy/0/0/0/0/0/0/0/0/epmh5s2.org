Reread the Kings Cross chapter of DH, my dude. Dumbledore clearly says that he beat the piss out of Grindelwald despite the other wielding the Elder Wand.

“Durr, if it's not literally handed down by a god, it's worthless”

The wand is pretty clearly a unique and extremely powerful magical artefact. Nobody is denying that. The notion that it has a narrative-editing power to ensure that its owner could never be defeated in battle under any circumstances is infinitely more of a stretch than “it just makes your spells way stronger”
