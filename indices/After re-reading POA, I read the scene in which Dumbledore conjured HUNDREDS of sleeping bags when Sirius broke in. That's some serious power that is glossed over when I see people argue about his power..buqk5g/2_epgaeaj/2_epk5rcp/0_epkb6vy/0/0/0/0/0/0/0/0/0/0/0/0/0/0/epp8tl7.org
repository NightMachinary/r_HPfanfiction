Colosseum story is from the Wonderbook game.

Alleged, sure. In the same book that claims the wand is unbeatable (Tales of Beedle the Bard). Thus, those two claims cancel each other out, and therefore Dumbledore beating Grindelwald in spite of the Elder wand tips the scales towards “just a powerful-ass wand”.
