Mate, the reparo spell was invented to repair the Colosseum after it was /razed/. Pretty sure the only reason you wouldn't be able to use it to fix a fucking stick would be due to the stick's magical properties.

Reparo is simply an example that proves that the Elder Wand is special. In terms of what we have /proof/ of, which does not count the who-knows-how-diluted-by-time fairy tale, we know it makes spells more effective. There is no /proof/ that it magically makes you immune to defeat. There is direct counter-evidence to that. Dumbledore isn't even the only one alleged to have defeated it in open battle; Egbert the Egregious did it defeating Emeric the Evil.
