I do know where - the part where Dumbledore beat Grindelwald.

Dumbledore himself points out that the tale was probably made up after the fact and the Peverells made their trinkets by themselves. It's just a really strong wand.

This obsession with "nuh uh, death is a person and he was really mad about these three dudes doing the kind of thing wizards do every day so he came up with a clever ruse instead of just making a tree fall on them or some shit" is fanon, my dude.
