I'm not inclined to believe Dumbledore 's word personally, especially after he's dead and Harry is 'go into the white light' hallucinating, But it is actually from the books so you're not wrong. We just have different interpretations of canon, my dude.

"Durr." If the wand's powers are not what they were sated to be in the book (no defeat in a duel) then we literally don't know what (if any) powers the wand has.

It's not narrative-editing power. It's just like Harry's blood wards, or the brother wand thing.
