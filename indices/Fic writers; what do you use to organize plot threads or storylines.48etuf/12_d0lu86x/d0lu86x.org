It depends on how your narration is organized. For a fix where the narration is as messy as...let's say...Pulp fiction, good old excel is a must, because you need to keep track os the chronological order of events (this is from personal experience). For something more linear, you don't need anything overly complex, a simple writing software should do the trick. Then again, excel might be useful to keep track of the progress in the sub-plots.
