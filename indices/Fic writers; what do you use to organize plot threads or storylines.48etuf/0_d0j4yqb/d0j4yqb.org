I use two methods to keep track of my shifting POV story.

My plot arcs are organised by POV in a Word doc by bullet points outlining the broad strokes as each. A (generic) example:

- *Harry*

- Leaves Privet Dr

- Boards HE at KCS

- Etc

This method isn't great for keeping track of things chronologically, so I use Excel for that. Here's a highly redacted [[http://imgur.com/7ucjpzs][image]] showing how that works. It also lets me keep track of where I've left off editing, which goes a long way toward saving my sanity.

Great topic. I look forward to seeing what other methods people use to stay organised.
