Well, I just use word. I have two documents about the fic I'm working on right now. The first is "notes" where I keep the basic summary, important twists and turns, explanations for things happening that are intentionally vague, etc. The second is "outline" where I've outlined the name of each chapter and the basic events that take place. Once I've finished the outline and notes, I'll actually write the story on a third word document. I don't know if this is the best way to do it, but it's how I always have.
