I sorta don't. I'm a very go-with-the-flow kind of writer and run around haphazardly writing things that come to mind. I have a bunch of unfinished stories across multiple fandoms (only one I have up on ffnet now is a ASOIAF one) where often, I'll write a prologue, then a chapter midway through, then somewhere way later, then fill in the blanks, hopping around a lot.

Sometimes I have to backtrack when I stray too far - one of my OC fics went pure Mary Sue self-insert - but generally that's me.

That said, Google Drive could be good. And Scrivener, which I used once then forgot about because of my writing style.
