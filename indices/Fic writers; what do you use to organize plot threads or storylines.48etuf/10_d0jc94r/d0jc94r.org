I use Scrivener a lot. I have different documents, one for the text itself, one for character development and one for plot lines.

Most of it is in my head, though. I only use those extra documents for snippets and sudden ideas I need to write down. I have a certain idea of what I want to achieve with a certain scene, and then I write it down and see where it takes me.
