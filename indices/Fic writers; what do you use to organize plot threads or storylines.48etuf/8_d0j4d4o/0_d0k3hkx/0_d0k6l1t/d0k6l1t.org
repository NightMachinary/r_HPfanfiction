Dramatica (there is a free trial version you can have a play with to see if it will suit you, but is frustrating as you cannot save anything) is a tool which essentially helps you develop and outline by asking you a series of questions (You can set it at 3 different depth levels of questioning, with the highest being several hundred questions long.)

As you answer the various questions (Or leave them, it will allow you to come back when you have a clearer idea) regarding the synopsis, your characters, their relationships and motives it assists you by telling you what archetypal model your story is drawn from or most resembles. So you can decide to subvert that archetype or use it to ensure your story hits all the beats to be fulfilling to the reader.

Periodically it generates reports with all the information you have given it regarding character and plot so you can see how it all fits together.

Its a great place to start if you have only a vague idea or plot bunny as the questioning will challenge you and get you to examine your idea and what your true premise is. I find it particularly useful for outlining. It can be daunting and a little overwhelming at first, but ultimately I find it useful for more complex and nuanced pieces where their are a lot of moving parts. I'd say have a good play around (allow yourself a few hours) with the free trial. I know there is a version of Dramatica Pro (the full version) available as a torrent ... (Umm pirate bay I think) is the $70 odd price tag is a deal breaker.

The Robert Marshall Plan for novel writing began as a book, which has been a staple for many years. There are a lot of free versions of the book around which will convey Marshall's ideas.

I use it to shape an outline into a draft by making it run practically and logically and see where there are gaps in the narrative.

It uses a series of tried and true formulas for writing to keep you on track. Some people find it too prescriptive and think it stifles you. (It will do things like tell you if the model it thinks you story is most like would have X scene or Y scene written from a different character POV for example). I quite like the nudges, I find them useful to keep moving forward and know I don't have to take its advice.

It is a lot more pricey about $120 US and I haven't found a free version of the software anywhere so it might be one for down the track unless you are looking to make an investment - but even so, I'd suggest reading the book first.
