That's semantics. They haven't "experienced death" in the sense that they haven't done the whole thing and gone to the Afterlife, but they're dead in the sense that their bodies ceased functioning and are currently rotting somewhere while their soul is going along its merry way. Ghosts aren't "properly" dead, but that doesn't mean you can kill them.
