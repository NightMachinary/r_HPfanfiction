A basilisk can kill pretty much anything if the victim directly stares into its eyes. The victims only get petrified if they see the basilisk's eyes through something like in the case of Colin's camera in COS.

The above is based on JKR's story, idk about actual mythology (like if it's different or has extra mythos)
