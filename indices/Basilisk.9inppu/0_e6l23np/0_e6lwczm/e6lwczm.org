The actual mythology is basically what is shown in the books; a snake with a crown-like growth atop it's head (hence it being called the King of Serpents), and with deadly vision and venom. It should be noted that it was often confused with the Cockatrice in stories, due to similarly deadly abilities and methods of creation: the Basilisk is hatched by a cockerel sat atop a serpent's egg, the Cockatrice hatched by a serpent atop a cokerel's egg.
