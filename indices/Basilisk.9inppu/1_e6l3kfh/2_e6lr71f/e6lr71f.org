I'm pretty sure that lots of spells work on dementors, it just isn't very useful to knock it back a few feet or set it on fire. A stunner would not stun it but it might knock it back, setting it on fire should work at least for a short time but do it no harm, and most household spells would probably have some ridiculous and completely useless effect. Not that anyone would ever try that, because most people have better things to do when confronted by a dementor, like running away or trying to cast a patronus.

On another note, can dementors go through physical barriers? Could a wizard conjure walls around them and a ceiling above them to prevent dementors from getting to him?
