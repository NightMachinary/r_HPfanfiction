Alright, a stunner has no effect at all. That doesn't mean other spells don't though. It is not very believable that fiendfyre or a killing curse will have no effect at all. And then there are spells that have physical effects. If a wall stops a dementor, then one should be able to trap it inside a cage, or drive it back by propelling debris at it, if only for a short time.

And erecting a dome around oneself and then digging a tunnle seems a viable alternative, if one is strong enough to withstand the dementors aura long enough.
