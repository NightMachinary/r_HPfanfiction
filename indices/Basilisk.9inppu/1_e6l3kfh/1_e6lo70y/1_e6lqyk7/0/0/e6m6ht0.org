If anything, it's corrosive. Whether it is acidic is not clear at all.

Furthermore, I think it is pretty clear that there is a magical aspect to the destruction of a horcrux, not just a physical one. It is quite possible that basilisk venom can destroy horcruxes because it is a powerful magical venom, not because it is corrosive. The Killing Curse can destroy horcruxes because it is the Killing Curse, not because one of its side effects is that it makes stuff explode.
