it didn't kill the diary with acid though, it killed it because of metaphorical something and souls and stuff

Edit: because apparently this is not clear at all: My point is not that the diary wasn't destroyed by basilisk venom, it is that I see no indication for the basilisk venom to be acidic. If JKR explicitly said that basilisk venom is an extremely strong magical acid, please tell me so.
