I literally said that it's a magically powerful venom. But the magic makes it so destructive that no magic besides phoenix tears can undo the damage. And Harry was damaged by the venom, when it touched him. But with the diary, it was next to him when he stabbed it, it's not like it was sitting on his lap. And just because it doesn't say the floor was damaged doesn't mean it wasn't. It just wasn't an important detail to JKR.
