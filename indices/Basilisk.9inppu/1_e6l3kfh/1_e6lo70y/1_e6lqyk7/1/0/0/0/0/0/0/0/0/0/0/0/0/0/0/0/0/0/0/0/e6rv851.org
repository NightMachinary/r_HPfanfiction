I am pretty sure that the /only/ reason the sword was able to damage the locket was because it had absorbed the basilisk venom and it's properties. And since, as you said, touching the cup with the sword didn't destroy the former, it should be assumed that the property of the venom (which the sword absorbed) that is capable of destroying horcruxes is /not/ its corrosiveness.
