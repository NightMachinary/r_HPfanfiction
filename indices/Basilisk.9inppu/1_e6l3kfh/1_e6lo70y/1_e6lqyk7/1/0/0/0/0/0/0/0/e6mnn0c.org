But /why/ would it be the corrosiveness? There is nothing to suggest that basilisk venom is any more (in the mundane sense) corrosive than normal snake venom. It's a /magical/ snake venom, it's more likely that it has a /magical/ destructive property that destroys the horcrux. The fact that horcruxes (which are inhibited by soul pieces) specifically are easily destroyed by the venom while there is no mention of the floor or anything else touched by the venom being destroyed (except for Harry who is, similar to the horcrux in a way, alive) suggests that it is indeed the "magical killing" property of the venom that destroys the horcrux, and not the fact that it is acidic to some degree.
