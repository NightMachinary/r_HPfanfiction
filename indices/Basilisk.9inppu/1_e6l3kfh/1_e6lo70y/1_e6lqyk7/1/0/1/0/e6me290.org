My whole point isn't about whether or not the horcrux was destroyed by the basilisk venom, everyone knows that it was.

My point is that I personally don't believe that the destruction has anything to do with /acid/. Perhaps I am forgetting something that was mentioned in canon, but to me it seems pretty clear that the diary was destroyed by the basilisk /venom/ and that happened because basilisk venom happens to be the strongest magical venom, or because it has certain horcrux-destroying magic, or whatever else but not because it is /acidic/.
