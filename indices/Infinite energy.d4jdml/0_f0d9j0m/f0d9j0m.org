The most obvious solution is Gubraithian Fire, which creates an everlasting flame, just using it on few coal power plants would solve it.

Another obvious solution would be casting refilling charms on oil wells.

And another obvious solution would be to simply enchant turbines inside power plants themselves to move indefinitely and to generate energy forever.
