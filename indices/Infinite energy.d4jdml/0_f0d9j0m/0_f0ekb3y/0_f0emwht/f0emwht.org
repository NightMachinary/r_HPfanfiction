  Though you could probably just do away with electricity entirely and just make everything run off magic instead, like Colin's camera.

I was under the impression that Colin's camera running on magic was a result of it being exposed to Hogwarts highly magical environment, I dont really think it would be possible to mass produce the effect for the majority of muggle items, at least not with how small the magical population is.
