Ah, I seem to have forgotten the last part of the quote where she attributes it to Colin's initiative.

  Contrary to common fanon, getting "magitech" appears to be so simple than even a first year can do it (either that or it's a common thing you can have done in Diagon Alley). Which the existence of magical radios should have told us anyway.

I still dont think you could really use it on the majority of muggle item though, unless the majority of wizards start spending all their time making items for muggle use. There just arent enough wizards.

  So much for Mugglwank!Harry's magitech empire blowing wizards' minds.

Yeah, I never really understood that, it seemed quite clear in canon that when wizard didn't use much technology because of a lack of need, not because its impossible, I mean we see that even when wizards want to have some muggle technology like cars, they just get them.
