Short term, quick and dirty method: Magic fires in existing power plants.

Long term, proper method: Research how magic and electricity interact and create an easily mass producable enchantment that makes a wire produce a constant voltage. Solution can be implemented to power virtually any device.

Secretive method if you don't want to reveal magic: Develop magic wire and create muggle startup funded by some millionaire guy that's researching nuclear fusion reactors. There's already one doing rocket science, so people will accept that explanation. Once the electricity enchantment works, implement it to make the reactor prototype super energy efficient and start building tons of reactors all over the place. Magic government will get the normal government to accept the new power plants without asking too many questions, the normal government will do most of the job of providing security and assisting with mass deployment of reactors, eventually globally. Within a decade or two you could have most of the world running on magic without knowing it. Then use the money from selling energy cheaper than anyone else to hire more wizards and scientists sworn to secrecy and develop other cool things like magic CO2 air filters, warp drives, mass producable magic cures for various diseases that seem to be normal medicine, maybe 'fusion' powered cars, and mass produce anything that you can pass off as sufficiently advanced technology.
