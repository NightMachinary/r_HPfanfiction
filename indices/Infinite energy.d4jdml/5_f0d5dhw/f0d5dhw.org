Conjuring (or duplicating) infinite fuel of any sort seems like the obvious trick. You could, of course, create Lumos-based solar panels, but why? At the end of the day, though, I'm not even sure trying to power Muggle energy methods through magic is the way to go. Just give the Muggles magical items.

(All that being said, your "infinite" energy may not be quite so infinite. There is no real reason magical energy couldn't be as subject to entropy as any other form of energy.)
