This is why I always sort by favorites on ffn. Number of reviews is just not a reliable metric. With faves, one reader gives their input once per story and its a binary good/bad. With reviews, one reader can comment every chapter and number of chapters can vary wildly, and reviews aren't necessarily an indicator of a fic being good as their content can consist of anything.
