I follow stories that I have a passing interest in, but I only favorite those that meet the highest standards. It's not a matter of hiding my favorites (Is that even an option?); I just don't think a lot of what I follow is worth recommending to others. That's certainly better than people whose favorites lists hit four figures. (How does that even happen?)
