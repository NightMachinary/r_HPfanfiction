Just had a lovely encounter with 'Dear Fanfiction Writers' which averages at 50 words per chapter through 180 chapters, and 'Rebuilding' which averages at 500 words per chapter through 300 chapters. They have 2,400 and 34,000 reviews respectively, and the first one could have been written /entirely/ as a oneshot and the second one is almost forcibly cut into chunks so that it'll last for a large number of chapters.
