Hi. :). Rebuilding was written and published daily, without missing a single day, for 9 months. It was very much written to be read episodically by the people who enjoyed the experience of getting a short addition to the story every day. There's an author's note on the first chapter explaining the structure, and I still get messages from people almost weekly telling me they miss the daily updates. The structure certainly doesn't appeal to everyone but one of the beautiful things about fanfiction is there is something for everyone.
