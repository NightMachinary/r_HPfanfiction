I like 10000 or 15000. Generaly a lot happens in each chapter and it also usually means that the author is really comitted to his fanfic, to the point that he has trouble stoping his chapters. I like it when a fic updates often, but as long as it does update, I don't care much if I have to wait a month or two between each instalment.
