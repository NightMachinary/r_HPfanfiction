I didn't meant I didn't care what people have to say about my writing, I just meant I wasn't writing purely to get lots of reviews. I do care about people's opinions to a certain degree, because I'm writing for other people's enjoyment, to a certain degree. For my enjoyment, yes, but also for others.
