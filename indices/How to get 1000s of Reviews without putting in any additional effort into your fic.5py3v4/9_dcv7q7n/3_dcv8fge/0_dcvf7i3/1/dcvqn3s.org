Depending on what you write, 1200 might be quite appropriate a word count. In books you /generally/ get 3k--6k per chapter, but there are always exceptions and there are novellas that only have a few pages per chapter (which might very well be 1,2k--1,5k words per chapter). Also, “a bit higher than a thousand” word count per chapter is well-accepted in NaNoWriMo.

So really, look at your chapters and think about it. If you think that bundling them together into longer chapters is in some way justified when sure, go for it; if you don't or if they are simply too thematically different to work as parts of a single chapter, though, then don't bother.
