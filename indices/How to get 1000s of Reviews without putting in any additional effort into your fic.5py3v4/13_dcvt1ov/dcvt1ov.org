Back in the day when I was first posting stories and depressed at getting no reviews, I did contemplate doing something like this just to see if it was actually true. But as I am the kiss of death when it comes to fanfiction, it's a fair bet (I'll have a tenner on it anyway) that I could post 100 x 500word chapters and include manipulative!Dumbledore, babemagnet!Harry, sexgoddess!Hermione/Luna/Tonks/Daphne, noble!Snape, misunderstood!Tom Riddle, Draco in leather pants, and masses of Weasley bashing and still get no reviews.

Life is too short.
