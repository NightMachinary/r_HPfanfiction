Tens of thousands of people may use reviews to find fanfic, it's not less a bad way to find fanfics.

The number of reviews don't give you much insight on the quality of a fanfic. I've seen uninteresting fanfics with no coflict whatsoever, no idea that wasn't in the books or already used the exact same way in hundreds of other fics getting a fair amount of good reviews. And you don't even look if those reviews are good, you're just looking at the number.
