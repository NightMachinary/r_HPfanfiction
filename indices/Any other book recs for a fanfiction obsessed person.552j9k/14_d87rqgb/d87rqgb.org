The Name of the Wind is a good book for fanfic readers. It has excellent worldbuilding, plenty of familiar but well-written tropes, and it's a standard Hero Journey that excels at character quirks and just being a whole lot of fun. If you like Indy!Harry fanfiction that doesn't take itself too seriously, you'll like it.
