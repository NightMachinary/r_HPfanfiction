I thought the premise of Altered Carbon (the first Takeshi Kovacs novel) was interesting:

#+begin_quote
  In the twenty-fifth century, humankind has spread throughout the galaxy, monitored by the watchful eye of the U.N. While divisions in race, religion, and class still exist, advances in technology have redefined life itself. Now, assuming one can afford the expensive procedure, a person's consciousness can be stored in a cortical stack at the base of the brain and easily downloaded into a new body (or “sleeve”) making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen.

Be warned: this series has smut scenes (usually one easily skippable passage per novel) that make Fifty Shades seem like Thackeray or Dickens.
