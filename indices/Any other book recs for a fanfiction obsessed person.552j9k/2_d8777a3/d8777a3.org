If you want some published Fanfiction Cinder (Marissa Meyer) is Sailor Moon, Carry On is Harry Potter, and anything by Rainbow Rowell is amazing. If you haven't read Fangirl by her I would highly recommend it, it's a must for fanfiction readers. I'm currently reading The Handmaid's Tale and it is lovely if you like books like 1984 or Brave New World. If you like poems and cats then I Could Pee on This: And Other Poems by Cats (Francesco Marciuliano) is a very good quick read.
