I've been struggling to find decent fanfiction I haven't already read, so I've turned back to actual published work. As already mentioned, American Gods by Neil Gaiman is well worth checking out. TV show coming out next year has a lot of potential as well. I'd also recommend 1Q84 (Haruki Murakami) and Look Who's Back (Timur Vermes).

Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is good if you're just looking for something to kill time reading, but is more of a young adult novel than the previous three mentioned.
