After fanfiction entered my life, I stopped reading original works altogether it seems, and I used to be considered a bookworm.

Literally I racked my brain for at least ten minutes and the only thing I came up with was when I read the Da Vinci Code wayyyy back in the day. And that was because I had no internet and was on an international flight.
