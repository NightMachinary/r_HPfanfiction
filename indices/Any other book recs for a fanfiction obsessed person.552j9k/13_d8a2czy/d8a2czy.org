If you want something similar to fanfiction, the author of the lie I've lived, jbern, has written some original fiction as well.

This one and its sequels are pretty decent. Haven't read his other series.

Not on the level of Martin, Rothfuss, Sanderson, etc. But a good break from fanfiction that still has a similar easy to readness to it. Also it's basically superhero fanfiction just with original characters instead of the established ones.
