I like biographies of famous people a lot.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Augustus-Life-Romes-First-Emperor/dp/0812970586/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1475165531&sr=1-3&keywords=augustus][Augustus, by Anthony Everitt]]: I find Augustus fascinating because his rise to power was one of the very very few examples in history where a Trio of teenagers defeated their enemies against overwhelming odds and succeeded creating an order lasting for more than two centuries. (The Principate stopped working after Septimius Severus took power in 193AD)

[[https://www.amazon.com/FDR-Jean-Edward-Smith/dp/0812970497/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1475165764&sr=1-1&keywords=fdr][FDR, by Jean Edward Smith]]: FDR is simply my favorite US president.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1475166050&sr=1-1&keywords=titan+the+life+of+john+d.+rockefeller+sr][Titan, The Life of John D. Rockefeller, by Ron Chernow]]: Rockefeller was born in a very poor family, never had an university education, and became a billionaire by the end of 19th century. Regardless how you view him today, his rise made an excellent story.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1501127624/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1475165456&sr=1-1&keywords=steve+jobs][Steve Jobs, by Walter Isaacson]]: He was a jerk, but also a genius. His love/hate relationship with Bill Gates is story for the ages. This book also shines some good insight into the tech industry. I have to say this book helped me making lots of money in stocks.
