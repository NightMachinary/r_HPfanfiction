I think it's so difficult reading books now, at least for me. When I first started reading fanfic, I could still read published books. Now, I only reread books I've liked. There are a few authors that I will read regardless. I really love [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6294.Howl_s_Moving_Castle][Howl's Moving Castle]] by Diana Wynne Jones. The Miyazaki [[http://www.veoh.com/watch/v208113346GkK6deZ][film]] was based on this novel. There are two books that follow "Howl's". Her other books, though I haven't read many, are lovely as well. I love her descriptive writing.

I'll post more recs when I'm done with classes for the day.
