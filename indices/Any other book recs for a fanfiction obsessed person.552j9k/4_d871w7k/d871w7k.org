While her work does have a lot of flaws, I find Mercedes Lackey satisfies similar desires to fanfic. Many of her series all take place in the same world, with different characters, at different times. /Arrows of the Queen/ is the best place to start. If you find a favourite character in that book, odds are Lackey has written at least one other book about the character you liked most.
