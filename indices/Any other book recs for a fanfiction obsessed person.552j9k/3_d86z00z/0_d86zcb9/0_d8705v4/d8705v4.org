I would imagine /Catch-22/ fits under that description, if you haven't read it already. /Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas/ is absolutely hilarious once you get past the initial surprise of it being mostly Hunter S. Thompson's insane cocaine-addled fever dream. /A Confederacy of Dunces/ goes without saying. /Trainspotting/ is also incredibly funny, but not even remotely lighthearted and it can be difficult for people who aren't familiar with the Scots dialect to understand, so YMMV on that one.
