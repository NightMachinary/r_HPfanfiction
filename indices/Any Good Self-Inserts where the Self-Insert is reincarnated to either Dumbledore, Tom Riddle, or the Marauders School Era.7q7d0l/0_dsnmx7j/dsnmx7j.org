To be honest, I usually stay away from self-inserts. But if I had to pick a good one, I'll say read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10356239/1/Disenchanted][Disenchanted]] by Yuuki no Yuki. It's a surprisingly good self-insert fic that I was invested when I found the story. The author actually made a decent plot with excellent an writing style even though the fic is from a first person POV. The author really did a number on my emotions with this story as well, which says something about the quality of the fic.
