I'm assuming you're talking about SilentlyWatchesOut's Black Queen series. It seems like quite a few people on reddit were really fond of that story, so I gave it a go. After 6 chapters or so, I have regrets.

I'm not even all that disturbed that child prostitution existed in the fic, so much as how it was completely glazed over and Narcissa completely exonerated of child rape, but other characters who committed far less upsetting crimes are treated as the scum of the earth. I mean the author states that what they write doesn't mean this is how they view child prostitution, but that isn't how it comes across in the fic at all.
