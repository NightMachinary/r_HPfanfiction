I'm the only Harry/Cho fan on the internet here :P but I will happily read Harry with other pairings. Back in the 3 year gap between books 4 and 5, Cho was looking like Harry's main love interest, so most fanfic writers who wanted Harry's eyes to go elsewhere had to first get rid of Cho. This was usually done by turning her into Regina George from Mean Girls, which made absolutely no sense to me, because Cho never once behaved that way. Even today, when I see Cho bashed like this in a fanfic it turns me off almost straight away.
