There's a list of shit in the Harry Potter stories that really is awful. You want to crap on Dumbles for putting Harry in the most dangerous place he could be in, and letting the Dursleys raise him in that place? Go ahead.

You want to shit on Ron or Hermione for not being "Good enough" friends, so your story turns them into backstabbing rapey bastards? Screw that.
