I actually don't mind when stories tilt characters personalities. It can be fun, even if it makes a villain out of a Hero.

What is annoying when when they try to draw inferences back onto Canon. "Look, My version of Ron cheated! You should have seen that coming because he abandoned Harry during the Triwizard Tournament!"

"My version of Molly is really evil", Fine, potentially interesting "Canon Molly is obviously evil and my version just exposes it" ehh...
