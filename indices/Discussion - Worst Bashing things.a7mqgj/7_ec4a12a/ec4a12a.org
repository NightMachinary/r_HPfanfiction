I forget what fic it was, think it might of been 'Not the Only Redhead', but it turned the bashing up to 12. Going off of memory the order of events was as followed. Harry and Ginny get together in year 4, and things look good for Harry despite how that year ends. For some reason the Dursleys lock Harry in his room for the summer with no food, and essentially falls into a coma almost dying. Ginny, Ron, and Hermione get pissed at Harry for this because he never responded to their letters; I think Ginny then breaks up with Harry for being "inconsiderate". Harry then blows up at them all, cue general bashing of them. Molly then tries to make Harry apologize; cue Molly bashing.

Now I know what you're thinking, that sounds pretty standard how does this get up to a 12? Well as Harry refuses to get back with Ginny, and starts dating Susan Bones. Charlie, Percy, and Bill all try and kill Harry for shaming Ginny. I think the Twins try and get revenge as well. The only saving grace of the Weasly bashing fest the story becomes is Ginny is basically a non entity for a long time.
