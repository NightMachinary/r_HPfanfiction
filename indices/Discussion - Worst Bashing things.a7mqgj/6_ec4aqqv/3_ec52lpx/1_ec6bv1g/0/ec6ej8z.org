Link please? I wouldn't mind reading it. Maybe I read it before and forgot? Is it the one where the Muggle-Borns turn out to be related to the Pure-Bloods and at the end Hermione inherits the Parkinson wealth?

Edit:

She also ends up vacationing on an island.

Let me see if I can find this one. I remember Umbridge played a big role in it.
