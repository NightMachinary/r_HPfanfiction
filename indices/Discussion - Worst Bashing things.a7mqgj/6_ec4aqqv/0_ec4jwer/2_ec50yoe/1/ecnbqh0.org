I told you when you wrote it, but no. The Nuremberg trials tried top leadership in pursuit of justice, left most of the rank and file alone in the service of keeping a workable country afterward.

Meanwhile, you very specifically note that Hermione wishes to wipe purebloods, and then had Hermione put "everyone in the Ministry' on trial. Everyone means everyone from the Minister down to the tea lady and the mail boy. And then you went out of your way to state that the punishment for support of the regime was death (not actual actions mind you, but mere support of the regime) and that "'support' was defined broadly," quotations around support and all, meaning that's it's direct meaning is in question. So we learn the following facts:

- Hermione wishes to wipe out the Purebloods.

- Hermione puts everyone in the Ministry on trial for 'supporting' the previous regime.

- 'Support' is defined quite broadly.

- The penalty for support is death, the penalty for being innocent is: you're not innocent, have some magically binding oaths.

This doers not paint a picture of Nuremberg in anyone's mind. This is why people keep coming back to Stalinist Hermione interpretation despite your repeated protests that it isn't what you wrote.
