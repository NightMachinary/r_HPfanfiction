Yeah, keep lying. About the war criminal trials - they didn't go solely after the leaders, that was just the first trial. People as low as guards were executed. Please read up on WW2 before posting next time, your ignorance is painful.

About the story - Hermione says that she would wipe out the purebloods if it were necessary to stop the persecution and oppression, not because she wants to.

About the trials in the story - it's stated that those who /willingly/ supported the rape and genocide were executed, and that "I was only following orders" didn't cut it as an excuse.
