They tried the guards at the camps, yes, in other trials, not Nuremberg. So you're still not evoking Nuremberg. They also tried /the guards at the camps/ not the mail boy at the Fuherbunker.

  She wanted to crush and destroy Magical Britain's bigotry - even if she had to wipe out the purebloods to accomplish that.

I'm not seeing a modicum of restraint here. We don't even see her reasoning because you consider it self-evident, and she manages to convince Harry of her view in two sentences and no elucidation for the reader. You paint with such minimalist strokes that the reader is forced to make interpretations and the way you have written Hermoine is deliberately invoking hard men making hard decisions while hard. You literally have her smiling while Harry gives a speech surrounded by corpses.

This is the whole paragraph that covers the trials:

  The last few weeks had been a stressful time. The Wizengamot members who had voted for the law had all been interrogated with veritaserum to ferret out further crimes, tried, and pushed through the Veil of Death. Then the Tribunals had started. Any employee in the ministry they had captured was dosed with veritaserum, and interrogated about their role in the war. Everyone among them who had supported Voldemort or his extermination of muggleborns was sent through the veil - and since Hermione had prepared the questions, "support" was defined quite generously. Those not implicated were forced to swear a magical oath that prevented them from supporting any pureblood supremacy or hurting muggles or muggleborns except in self-defense. Hermione had made sure there were no loopholes in the oath that would allow anyone to "defend traditional lives" or such. At the end of the Tribunals, the majority of the pureblood aristocracy was wiped out and most of the survivors were hunted or under oath. Hermione and the new Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Harry Potter, were kept busy reorganizing the Ministry and keeping the basic functions of a government running - or, most often, getting them started since the pureblood regime hadn't really been concerned with much beyond making sure the purebloods in power stayed in power and got rich.

No mention of 'only those willingly supporting rape/genocide.' Only 'supported Voldemort' with a very specific callout that support is defined quite broadly, and support is in quotations, bringing it's standard meaning into question.

I understand what you wanted to say, but what you wanted to convey and what your writing actually conveys are two different things.
