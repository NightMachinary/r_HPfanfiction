That "Summary" was done by someone who hasn't even read the story since he claims I hate Ron, while Ron is actually /the/ war hero of the story.

Although there is actually a communist revolt, with soviet songs, in the story - when the muggleborns in Magical Russia rise up against their oppressors. But it wasn't started or aided by Harry and Hermione. Which is another thing the "summary" misses: In the story, Magical Europe is a worse place for muggleborns than Britain was, and when war shakes the regimes, the muggleborns start to rise. As do the purebloods in some countries "closely allied" with Magical Russia, such a Poland and Bulgaria, who don't like serving as Russia's cannon fodder.
