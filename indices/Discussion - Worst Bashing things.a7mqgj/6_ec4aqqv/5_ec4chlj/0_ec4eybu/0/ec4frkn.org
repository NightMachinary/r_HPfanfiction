The fic was written after reading one too many "a marriage law is so romantic; the government forcefully marrying people will let them find true love" stories, and explores what would be a (IMHO) more fitting response of the very people who just defeated Voldemort and his Death Eaters when subjected to what is essentially legalised rape. If you've never read a marriage law story you're quite lucky - they are a very common method to ship two people who wouldn't give each other the time of the day, and the fact that it's rape is generally ignored in the stories.

With regards to "these people are OOC", Harry used or tried to use the Torture Curse in canon and Hermione is as ruthless as they come. Add the trauma from the war, and they're not in a forgiving mood. But then, that's also addressed - they realise in the story just how far they've gone down that particular slope, and get therapy.

And yes, the tirade about pens is meant to be surreal. I can very well imagine Hermione being just that petty. And Harry did rant in canon quite often as well, at his friends, his teachers, Dumbledore, for real or perceived insults and hurts.
