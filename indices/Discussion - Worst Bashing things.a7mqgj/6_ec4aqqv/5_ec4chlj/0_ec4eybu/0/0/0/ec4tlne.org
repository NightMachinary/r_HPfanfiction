"Hate for Ron"? Have you actually read the story? Or skimmed a few scenes, and made up your mind? He is /the/ big war hero of the story with him saving Hogwarts, saving the Delacours, saving Berlin and fighting off an assassin. I don't get how you can think I hate him.

Hatred for the silly little things? That's the character, not me. Heck, Percy's POV pretty much states that Harry and Hermione are overdoing it, and there'll be a backlash against all the muggle things because you can't simply use muggle solutions and laws for the magical world. And since he becomes the Minister for Magic at the end of the story, I would say his views were validated in that part.

Yes, I can understand that it's not for everyone - I wouldn't write the story without changing more of the canon past these days - but claiming I hate Ron and everyone else and the whole world simply has no base in the story. (Heck, Neville, Ginny, Percy, Viktor Krum - they all get to shine in the story. I'll grant you that Draco doesn't get to shine, though.)
