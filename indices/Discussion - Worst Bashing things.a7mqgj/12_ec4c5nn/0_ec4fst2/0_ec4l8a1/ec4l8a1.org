  If Hermione and Harry had gotten together after that freakout would the bashing be any worse or more inappropriate?

No.

My comments is just observation from this fandom and others that the a lot of bashing is done by salty shippers who thinks that their ship is perfect and author is dumb because s/he didn't see what "amazing chemistry" these characters have/would have together. Gen fanfics in my opinion have a lot less bashing than romantic stories.

And in canon while characters have flaws they also have a lot of positive traits. In fanfics bashed characters are caricatures.
