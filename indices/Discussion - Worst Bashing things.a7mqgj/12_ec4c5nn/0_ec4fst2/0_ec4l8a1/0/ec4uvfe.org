  And in canon while characters have flaws they also have a lot of positive traits. In fanfics bashed characters are caricatures.

I don't think "a character having some positive traits" is an exclusionary criteria for bashing and making such a distinction is not as easy as you think. Often what some people perceive as positive traits for Ron, I perceive as negative traits. "He's relatable" vs. "He's an annoying teen". "He's easy going" vs. "He's lazy and stupid".

Or Snape: "Oh, he's so brave for switching sides" vs. "Why did he have to switch sides in the first place?"

Or Lupin: "He has been delt a terrible hand by fate and strives to be a better man" vs. "He's a self-involved coward who can't get over himself"

It's not just about taking all the goods things away and replacing it by made up bad stuff ("Ron stole Harry's money"). That bottom of the barrel bashing definitely exists too (that's what the thread is about), but it's not the norm and I wouldn't defend it
