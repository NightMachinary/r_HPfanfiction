That makes no sense. There's plenty of scenes *in canon* that (rightfully) would be seen as bashing if I put them in a fanfiction. Like Molly yelling at Sirius in his own house and treating him like trash or Ron running away in the tent. If Hermione and Harry had gotten together after that freakout would the bashing be any worse or more inappropriate?
