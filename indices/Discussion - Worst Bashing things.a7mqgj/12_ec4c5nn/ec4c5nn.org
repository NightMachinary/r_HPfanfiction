Bashing mostly occur in romantic stories. I despise ships which fandoms bash some character. There is no fucking possibility that their pairing would happen without OOC and trashing some characters so they make obstacle for their ship into scumbag to justify why these two characters who aren't attracted to each other would suddenly madly fell in love. Many of these fanfics also contains Deus ex Machina like arranged marriage/marriage law.
