  Also, another thing I dislike is when in pro-Slytherin fics, Ron is usually portrayed as going out of his way to bully and mock Slytherins. In reality, it was actually the Slytherins, like Malfoy, who went out of their way to mock Ron. In almost all of the confrontations between the trio and Malfoy, it was Malfoy who started it.

Draco Malfoy was humbly traversing the fourth-floor corridor, collecting money in a tin can to fund his soup kitchen for disenfranchised kneazle kittens, when suddenly:

/BANG/!

"AHA!" shouted fat, ugly, lazy bully Ronald Weasley, stepping out from an abandoned classroom and slamming the door behind him. "SLIMY SLYTHERIN! GRYFFINDORS RULE!" He had greasy food stains all over his ghastly, almost-brown-from-dirt hand me down robes, making him look like a deformed, red toupee-wearing mountain troll. His red hair was so intensely red that it burned into Malfoy's retina, temporarily blinding him. Then he kicked Malfoy like a muggle - since he was too incompetent to use any hexes. (Unlike the Malfoy scion, who always got straight O***Triple stars with smiley stickers.)

Immediately the biased Professor Dumbledore came out from another abandoned classroom and said "100 points to Gryffindor for exceptional bravery, Mr. Weasley."

Ronald Weasley, who didn't know how to eat properly in the great hall and was therefore evil, then said "Headmaster, the slimy snake stole my money! It's right there in the tin can!"

"Tsk tsk," twinkled Dumbledore, "200 points from Slytherin and detention with Filch for 2 months Mr. Malfoy. You must reform yourself for you are /dark/," Dumbledore intoned, putting extra stress on the word /dark/. Even his twinkling stopped (only to resume at full force a second later). Then he stole all of Draco's money.

"But-" Draco tried to interrupt, but instead the evil Ministry came out from another abandoned classroom and told him "No, you're NOT allowed to do any fancy hocus-pocus rituals at Halloween/Samhain! The old ways must be repressed! (whatever they are). Muggleborns rule!"

Then the goblins came and took all of Malfoy's galleons. Then the arrogant evil brat Harry Potter (who always tried to prevent Draco from talking to his secret veela-bonded girlfriend Hermione Dagworth-Merlin-Granger) came out from another abandoned classroom and accused Draco of being dark, even though he wasn't dark at all - and if he was, then being dark was actually perfectly reasonable and the REAL baddies were the 'light' side, who embezzled and used love potions and evil mind magic; and Voldemort was actually a really cool dude who taught destitute orphans how to read and write, and organized the local choir every Sunday evening.
