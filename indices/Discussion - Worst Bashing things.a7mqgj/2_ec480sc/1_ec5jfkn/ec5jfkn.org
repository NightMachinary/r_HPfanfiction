  some people seem to think that the Weasleys only wanted Harry's money. It makes no sense

It comes from the rich boy falls for the poor girl trope, especially with dubious way which he gets those feelings regarding Ginny. There's a raging monster in his chest every time he thinks of Ginny in sixth year, and only sixth year, which is really, really weird. He had nothing of the sort when Cho was with Cedric, or when Cho was on the outs with him in previous years. I've been jealous of other guys for being with girls I liked, but trust me, there were no roaring chest monsters (or anything remotely similar) for me. Ginny and Hermione are also shown giggling at love potions when they visit Fred and George's shop. Molly does admit to dosing Arthur with a love potion to get him to ask her out or something, and Ginny+Hermione giggle along when they hear that.

Not saying that HP gets doesd with love potions, but it isn't an unreasonable assumption to make.
