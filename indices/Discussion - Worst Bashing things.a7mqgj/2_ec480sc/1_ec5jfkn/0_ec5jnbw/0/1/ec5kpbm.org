  Canon HP has no idea what love is, just a horribly warped perversion of it. He thought that fucking Snape loved his mother, he was that deluded.

I think that Rowling intended for Snape to love Lily. Yes, it was weird, but love is supposed to be what defeats evil in HP, love is the main theme of the series, so I'm sure that Rowling meant for it to be love.

You can blame her for how she wrote it if you want, but I believe that this was her intention.
