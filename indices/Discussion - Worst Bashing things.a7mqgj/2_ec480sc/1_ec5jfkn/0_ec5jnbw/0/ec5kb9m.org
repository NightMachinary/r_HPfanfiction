  Harry was still in love in Ginny when he was hiding in the tent in DH

Looking at her dot moving around in her school, while you were hiding in a tent half-starved, half-frozen while you were supposed to be finding out ways to destroy horcruxes felt like stalkerish and escapist behaviour to me.

Canon HP has no idea what love is, just a horribly warped perversion of it. He thought that fucking Snape loved his mother, he was that deluded.

Besides, as I said, the chest monster is noticeably absent in his fourth and fifth year, and seventh year. What is it, something all sixteen year olds have between the day they turn 16 and wanders off when they turn 17? That shit is NOT normal.

I told you where the idea comes from - the rich boy falls for poor girl trope. I didn't say that the Weasleys were after his money.
