I really dislike how some people seem to think that the Weasleys only wanted Harry's money. It makes no sense. If they had such selfish motivations, they wouldn't have risked their lives multiple times for him.

Also, another thing I dislike is when in pro-Slytherin fics, Ron is usually portrayed as going out of his way to bully and mock Slytherins. In reality, it was actually the Slytherins, like Malfoy, who went out of their way to mock Ron. In almost all of the confrontations between the trio and Malfoy, it was Malfoy who started it.
