It's all about storytelling. If you give enough backstory and sound reasoning for why a character would do something that seems sort of ludicrous, have at it. My least favorite by far are the bashes of the Weasleys/Hermione/Gryffindors in general just to make Harry's relationship with someone else acceptable (usually a Slytherin like Daphne Greengrass). It's perfectly plausible for Ginny to not be put out by never getting with Harry. It's perfectly fine for everyone being fine with him getting with a Slytherin because you can just establish that character however you want, we literally only see her mentioned once in canon. The bashing is unnecessary. A lot of the Harry in Slytherin stories have to bash his Gryffindor friends from canon as some sort of explanation for why they aren't best friends when that's unnecessary. They aren't best friends because their lives are completely different, you already set that up with the House switch. Ron doesn't have to get rapey or ultraviolent or an asshole to all the Slytherins to break off their friendship.
