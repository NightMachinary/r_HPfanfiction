Agreed. Another aspect of this I absolutely loathe is gloryhound!Ron who tries to steal or profit off Harry's achievements and uses them to brag to others.

In canon we never see Ron brag, even about things that would be worth bragging about, like his chess match in book one, or his flawless quiddicht match in book 6.

Ron wants to prove himself, yes, but mostly to himself, not to others. He is definetly not the type to take credits for the achievements of other people.
