He brags when around Fleur. And he exaggerates wildly about his experiences being held hostage under the lake until Hermione calls him on it. Plus, his whole snit with Harry in book 4 was about Harry getting all the attention. Not saying this is at all gloryhound territory, just that it's not never. Pardon the nitpick. That whole arc is pretty contained within the 4th book, too - he starts bragging, is dumb, and learns better.

That said, I don't actually mind at all when people change personalities for their fics.
