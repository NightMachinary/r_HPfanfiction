As everybody here knows, I'm not exactly the biggest fan of Ron, but I really really hate one thing about Ron bashing:

/Ron stealing Harry's money./

It makes no sense. It's completely out of character even in my "this guy is a douche" interpretation of Ron. As someone who really doesn't like Ron it seems like a distraction from his actual shortcomings and is a pretty lazy way to make him evil. There's more than enough wrong with the guy. I don't think the sad & pathetic jealousy I see in Ron is the kind of jealousy that transfers into "I want to take your stuff" as that would require a high level of self awareness - one that Ron doesn't possess in this circumstance.

Same shit if Hermione betrays them for books (ridiculous) or money (lol).
