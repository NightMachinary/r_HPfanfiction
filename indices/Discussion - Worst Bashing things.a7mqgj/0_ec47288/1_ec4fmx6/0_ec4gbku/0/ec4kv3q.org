It is referring to the authors toolbox. The point is, human suffering is a topic of interest and is varied and as subjective as any of these things can be. I don't think authors should feel limited simply because some of their readers may have suffered similar traumas in the past. That kind of censorship is not really appropriate any more, especially given that something like rape is an act based desired power imbalance and a perversion of human sexuality, which are both fundamental themes in war and coming of age stories respectively.

I think dancing around the issue might be acceptable if your target audience is immature, but if you are writing to an older audience, then pulling the punches is likely going to lead to a less effective story.

Downvotes are not going to change my mind people. Conversation might.
