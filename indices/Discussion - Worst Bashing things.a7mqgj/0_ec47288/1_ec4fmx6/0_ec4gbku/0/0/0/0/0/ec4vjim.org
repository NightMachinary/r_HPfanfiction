Yeah I was never saying anyone shouldn't be allowed to write these fics. Just the other day on this sub I was telling someone off for insisting a fic involving rape should be taken down because his neice had stumbled across it.

I just think that the vast majority of fanfic writers that think they are being oh so brave in writing a rape scene are actually just lazy and bad at writing.
