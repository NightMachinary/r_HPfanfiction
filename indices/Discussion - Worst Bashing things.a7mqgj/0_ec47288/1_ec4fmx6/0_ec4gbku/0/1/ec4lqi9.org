I don't think saying rape in fics is bad and should be tip-toed around is because of an audience issue. OP put it best. Rape is used as a tool...really, really badly.

It's not that an audience is mature or not mature. Rape is constantly written badly in fanfic and I would say it's even kind of lazy. People can be super fucked up by things that don't have to do with sex if you just use your imagination. Happens IRL all the time :)
