I'm not sure what this is referring to, but, Yeah? I suppose so. Rape is a sensitive issue that actually happens to a hell of a lot of people (though not usually in the ridiculously over the top ways we see in fanfic), which is why authors should either have the decency to treat it with sincerity and responsible realism, or be open and honest if it's just a rape fantasy. I think very few people reading fanfic will find their entrails suddenly expelled.
