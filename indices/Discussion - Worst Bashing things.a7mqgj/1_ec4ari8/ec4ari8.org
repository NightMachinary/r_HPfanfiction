Hermione is one of my favourite characters, but not many people do her justice. Yes, she's an insufferable nagging brat with a compulsion to spew forth facts about the most obscure things in canon some of the time, but other times she's caring, or loyal, or vindictive, or sarcastic, or just a teenage girl. The problem lies herein: people tend to not want to write multi-dimensional characters with believable flaws. So nagging is amplified to uber-mega-bitch level, and everything else is lost. Or she's an infallible goddess. I don't know which oversimplification is more boring.
