100% on board with Hermione kicking ass. I personally like seeing her in difficult situations that cause her to grow and the growth is realistic. Not like, Ron raped her for some reasons????? And then she decided she'd join Voldemort and wipe out the Weasley's. Or other similar leaps that don't make sense for someone as logical and usually-by-the-book as Hermione. (That being said, she's fairly pick-and-choose about what she'll obey, so I also don't like fics that have her as a rule-abiding-stickler with no flexibility).
