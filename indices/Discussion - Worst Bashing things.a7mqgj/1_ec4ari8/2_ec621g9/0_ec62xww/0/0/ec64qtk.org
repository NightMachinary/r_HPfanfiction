Another trope I hate: /I'm a fighter for the light, but oops, turns out I'm the bastard child of Bellatrix and Voldemort so I'm off to the dark side with moms and pops! Hope we don't have to kill each other in the field! Ta!/

And then two days later she's torturing innocent muggles for fun with the Cruciatus. And gets a dark mark tramp stamp.

Ugh, no. You are right when you say that Hermione's morals are kind of selective, but this would also never happen.
