No bashing Lily and James!! I refuse to read any story which suggests that they weren't really in love, or that they were terrible parents to Harry. I'm fine with a modicum of bashing in their teens (particularly James, who was a known jerk), but the beauty of their story for me has always been about how much they mature and how beautiful their relationship is.
