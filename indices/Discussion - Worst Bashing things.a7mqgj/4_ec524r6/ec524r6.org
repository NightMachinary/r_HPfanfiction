Here's the issue I have with most attempts at bashing: nearly all of them are lazy writing, and if there is any innovation it's in the depravity of the bashed character.

Yawn.

Wake me when you actually decide to be creative.

That said, the one that always annoys me as it's one of two pieces most commonly used to set up Weasley bashing is the "Why did Molly ask where platform 9 3/4 is?" argument. That's as flimsy as wet toilet paper. Parents occasionally play dumb. Emphasis on play. She was messing with, and including Ginny, on a day when Ginny was feeling left out.
