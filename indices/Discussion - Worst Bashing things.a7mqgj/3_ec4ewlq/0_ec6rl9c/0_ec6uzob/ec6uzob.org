You hit the nail on the head, lol. Canon Dumbledore is actually my favorite character so that Evil!Dumbledore trope is just the bane of my existence. It's so prevalent that I can't even stomach it in my guilty pleasure reads anymore.

I think bashing is lazy writing in general. It creates easy conflict without needing to come up with a plot (i.e. escaping evil clutches), or removes inconvenient complicated conflict. Like want to ship H/Hr? Ok, let's make Ron a jerk instead of dealing with his and Hermione's feelings.

I know some people want that, but I am kinda over it, I want the real deal.
