If there's one thing I appreciate about the Harry Potter fandom, it's that people are generally good about tagging their bashing. Bashing of characters who are not Dumbledore, that is. The Dumbledore bashing is basically omnipresent. Half the time, you'll get three chapters into a fic that has fuck-all to do with Dumbledore when Harry will suddenly go 'oh, and by the way, it's finally time for me to extricate myself from Dumbledore's evil clutches'. Then he'll go on with his business, because Dumbledore being evil is a foregone conclusion.

It just baffles me. We /know/ what it looks like when he's upset with Dumbledore. It featured pretty prominently in the fifth and seventh books. And why is Manipulative Dumbledore so much worse at being manipulative than he is in canon?
