I can stomach a lot of bashing, but one thing I will never like is Hermione bashing. I identified a lot with her “unsociable bookworm girl” character when I first read the books, so seeing her bashed kinda makes me feel like a shitty person for having that personality type. Also, stories where they murder Malfoy for literally no reason other than ‘he's a death eater kid'. Its not his fault he was born into a bad family and raised that way, its not a valid reason to kill a teenager.
