I gotta agree. I absolutely love TE7's stuff, but when I first read the description of Limpieza de Sangre, I took a pass. A female Voldemort just seemed really strange to me. Found it discussed a few months ago and was a bit of a slow day so I decided to give it a shot. Holy shit, I could not put down my phone until I was finished reading.\\
Thanks TE7
