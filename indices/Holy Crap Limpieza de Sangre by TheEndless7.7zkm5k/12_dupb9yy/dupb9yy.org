Read the latest chapter this morning in bed. Absolutely fantastic way to start the day! The pacing is excellent and the characters he's created are very intriguing. What I find particularly nice about this story is he isn't afraid to leave things a little subtle. I can't be certain it's on purpose or not, but Harry's relationship with Ron and Hermione is this strange mix of unspoken closeness and increasing distance at the same time that reallly draws me in when a scene with them all together pops up. There's no reliance on outright stating changes in mood or tone, and even conversations generally break down to “he said, she said” instead of “he shouted /passionately/” or some other nonsense. You have to intuit to tone in a lot of dialogue and I find that helps a lot in getting the reader invested in the story while they read. (Although it does sometimes leads to issues where I'm not sure exactly how a conversation is supposed to be read.)

Honestly, it's my favorite story this year by far.
