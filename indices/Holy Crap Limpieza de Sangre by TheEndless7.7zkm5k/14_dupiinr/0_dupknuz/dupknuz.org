There isn't a H/Hr Pairing. Emily was swaying him toward that so he'd stop thinking about putting his dick in her. Every time he fantasizes about Hermione it slowly changes to Emily.

Some of the light flirting is just Harry being Harry. But when it gets more serious it's Emily pushing him toward that. Hence why he always stops and argues with 'himself' when it becomes anything remotely serious.
