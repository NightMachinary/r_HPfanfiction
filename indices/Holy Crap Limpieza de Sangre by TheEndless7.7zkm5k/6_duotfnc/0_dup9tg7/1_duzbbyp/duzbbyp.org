I know what you mean but I feel it fits the story. The main theme of the story is perspective. You know the facts (LV is evil, did evil things) but seeing the perspective changes how the characters are seen and muddies the morals. Ultimatly you know Dumbledore is the good guy and Snape is his spy looking for redemption (and is a supreme asshole). But from the perspective of the story these actions get twisted by how the pov sees it.

But thats just my take on it.
