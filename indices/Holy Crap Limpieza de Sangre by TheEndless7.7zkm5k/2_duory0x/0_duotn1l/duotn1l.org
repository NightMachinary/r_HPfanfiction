I don't think he has actually been given a full explanation for horcruxes. I know he saw their creations and has come into contact with them, but has Emily ever explained to him what they will do? And even if he does understand [[/spoiler][He just successfully used a killing curse which probably wasn't good for his mental state. He used it on someone he care's about which has to be traumatic (ask Snape). Last time her resurrection took 13 years so her being 'alive' isn't much of a comfort to him at the moment... but I still think he is an idiot for showing his feeling about it openly]]
