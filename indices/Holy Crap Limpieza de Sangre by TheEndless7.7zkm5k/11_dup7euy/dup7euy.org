Still waiting for it to be complete. I've read it once and was /hooked/, but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't read it a third time if I once again end up hitting the end in the middle of the story.

But it's a good wait. I'll gladly wait for it to be complete and it's always nice to see it updated in my alerts. It has pretty much the /only/ good fem!Voldemort in the entirety of HP fanfiction, it seems. I like the Harry of the story a lot. Overall its well paced and well written. I'm pretty sure that once it's complete it will be a often reoccuring recommendation, not just on this sub.
