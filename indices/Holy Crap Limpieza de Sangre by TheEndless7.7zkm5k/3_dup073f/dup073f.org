Ahhh... today's update made me sad even though it was a really good chapter.

I see two ways that this is going to proceed. [[/spoiler][Either Harry is going to take up her mantle---Emily already has Avery referring to Harry as 'My Lord' and possibly other Death Eaters as well---though he may bring about a magical revolution in a slightly less bloody manner because he is respected among most wizards for being the Boy-Who-Lived and re-vanquisher of LV as of this chapter. Or Harry is going to be depressed and mope about for 20 chapters while everyone around him trods all over him and his feelings.]]

[[/spoiler][At some point, he's going to realize that he can resurrect her and her popping out of the cauldron, wrapping him in a hug will probably be the end of the story.]]

Whatever the case, there may also be a time skip to the above ending.
