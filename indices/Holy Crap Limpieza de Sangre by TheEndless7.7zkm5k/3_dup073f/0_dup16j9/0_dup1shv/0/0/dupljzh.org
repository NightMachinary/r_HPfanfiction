I know! Do I count?

Ironically enough I didn't really intend for Dumbledore to come off as manipulative. He's just framed as the villain because the story is told more from Emily's perspective.

I personally don't think he's wrong in like, not offering a job to someone who he's pretty sure murdered at least five people by that point. The blacklisting was compounded more by the fact that Emily didn't really try that hard to find a job outside of the few specific areas she was looking for.

He does things that hindsight can tell us is wrong. Had he listened to her earlier on, had he paid more attention to her, had he called her by her damn name, a lot would have been different.

But while I'm pointing that out. He also didn't make her choices for her. Yes, she had a lot of bad shit happen to her, but she still chose to do what she did.

Dumbledore is still a hero who ended a massive war. And yes, he screwed up with Emily. But that was also during the 1940s when he was pretty obviously worried about something else.
