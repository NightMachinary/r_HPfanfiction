The premise of the story throws up so many red flags that it's almost ridiculous. Female Voldemort, angsty Harry, manipulative Dumbledore, etc. But it's just so well written. [[/u/TE7]] has a habit of taking concepts that are seemingly impossible to write well and then absolutely smashing them.

[[/spoiler][If I was a betting man, I reckon Harry's going to realise he can resurrect her. But he'll use the Stone to talk with Emily's shade and find out that she'd much rather stay dead. Then he could carry on building on her work alongside Hermione and the others. But this is TE7, so who the fuck really knows where this is going. :P]]
