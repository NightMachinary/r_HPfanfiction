It only matters if it matters to /you/. I would say if people are enjoying your work and telling you so, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. However if your long term aim is to improve as a writer then fanfiction can only take you so far. It is, as you say, an echo chamber; and although a well received story is probably not terrible, it isn't necessarily very good either in terms of the writing. It just means that it's scratching an itch for the readers.

There are places you can get serious critiques if that's what you want, but you have to look for them and work for them. If you make it clear in your profile and author's notes that you welcome concrit, you might get the odd unsolicited concrit review though they are few and far between.
