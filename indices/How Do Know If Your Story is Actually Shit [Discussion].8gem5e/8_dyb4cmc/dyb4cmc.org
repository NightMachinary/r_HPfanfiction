Really there's no way of knowing, because as a writer you'll always think your story is either complete shit or a literary masterpiece. By my experience, reviews on FFN, are always some twelve year-old praising your story to the ends of oblivion or the sort of person that belongs on [[/r/iamverysmart]]. You'll see this trend by looking at the reviews of stories like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/r/9474009/][this.]] If you're really interested in improving your own writing or having somebody judge your work starting a WBA thread on [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][DLP]] will help you.
