If it's only the nice ones responding, you're doing pretty damn good. Or you're not being very polarizing, but "not polarizing" doesn't mean "bad" in any way.

And yes, FFN reviews are hardly the peak of literature critique, but unless you're going to pay a professional editor, I really wouldn't worry about it. Average is on the higher end of quality when it comes to fanfiction. And people will let you know if it's shitty.

You good, fam.
