  And people will let you know if it's shitty.

This is true for FanFiction.net but /only/ to an extent. I think it depends on the story itself and who the story is targeting. I've come across quite a few Draco/Hermione stories where the writing is truly atrocious, meaning poor spelling, bad grammar, run-on sentences, and the like yet all of its reviews (of which there are many of them) heap praises on it. And I ask myself: Did they read what I just did? And then you have the other reviewers who only post negativity in terms of nit-picking particular items in your story. (/I can't believe you made Hermione so stupid! She's the brightest witch of her age!/) Lastly, and this is a bit off topic, but what does "You good, fam" mean?
