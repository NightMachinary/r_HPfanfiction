If there is one thing I've learned on the internet it's that someone is always willing to tell you your work is shit. But that doesn't mean a lot. If you have a fragile or delicate ego, fanfiction isn't the realm to get into. Do it for fun, and don't worry if you suck. Sucking is the only way to get better.
