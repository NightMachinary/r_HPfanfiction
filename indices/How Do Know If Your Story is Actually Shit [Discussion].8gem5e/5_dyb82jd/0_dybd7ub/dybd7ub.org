  If you have a fragile or delicate ego, fanfiction isn't the realm to get into.

That is really true. There should be something of a health warning. But then I don't think you necessarily know how fragile you are until it's too late. And once you've posted something, you can't unpost it. You can delete it but it will still be there somewhere.
