Just keep writing and stop worrying too much about quality. It's a common enough insecurity, even amongst professional writers. You just have to persist; do it because you love it, do it because you need to write, but don't let your inner voice overwhelm you. Maybe it'll always be in the background but just push past it.

Though if you're concerned about the quality of your writing at all, you're probably on the right track. It means you're thinking about ways to improve your writing. It means you're not stuck on a delusional island where you're convinced your work is the greatest thing out there and as close to perfection as anyone will ever see. It means that you can and will get better.
