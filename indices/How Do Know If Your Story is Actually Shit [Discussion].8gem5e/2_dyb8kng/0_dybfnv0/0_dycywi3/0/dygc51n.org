Good to see I wrote something at least a little better when I was 16 (and a virgin).

Now (22) I'm just disappointed that there's warnings about porn being unrealistic everywhere, yet no-one warns about sex in written fiction.

All those drawn out worshippings of bodies? Oral sex where a man seems to read his partner's thoughts (or, er, her appreciative moans) and vice versa?

I must have lovers that suck, or lack imagination, or maybe I can fix it by shoving my most beloved romances underneath their noses.

(Huh, if they're attentive enough, maybe that last one actually has a shot of working.)
