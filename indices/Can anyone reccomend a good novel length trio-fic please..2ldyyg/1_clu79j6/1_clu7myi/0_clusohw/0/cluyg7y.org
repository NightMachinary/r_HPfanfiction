I think the pairings were the main point of pain for me. The only stories I really like are the H/G ones.

There was something about the writing that turned me off a little. It just gave me an overall gloomy sort of feeling that is hard to explain. It was still good enough that I got through about 80% of the story before I decided I just couldn't anymore. YMMV.
