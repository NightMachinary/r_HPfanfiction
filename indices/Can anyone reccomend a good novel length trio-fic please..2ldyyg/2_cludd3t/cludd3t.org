If you're good with the silver trio rather than the golden trio, Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is a really fantastic one about what happened back at hogwarts while Harry, Hermione, and Ron are out searching for horcruxes. It focuses on Neville, and it really fleshes out how he went from the Neville before DH, to the Neville who stands up to Voldemort. It's really true to character, and it also fleshes out many other characters like Ginny and Hannah Abbot.
