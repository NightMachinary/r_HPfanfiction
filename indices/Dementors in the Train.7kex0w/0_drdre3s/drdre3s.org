Who are you going to sue, though, exactly? I'm not sure the wizarding world's legal system has a concept of suing the legal system itself. I don't think so. Or are you going to sue the Dementors? Good luck with that --- inasmuch as the Ministry treats them as people at all (and they're really more like attack dogs to them), they're more of a different people in a treaty of subservience than they are citiziens that you could actually sue.

All this being said, I do see where you're coming from.
