Uh huh, and what exactly is your point, here? You realize that there's a reason suing is a good reason for negligence, yes? It dissuades others from repeating the same mistake for whoever the fool let out the Dementors in the first place.

Student Liam Allan sued after rape trial collapse, where he was accused of rape which fell apart after evidence came to light. Problem is, the police hid the evidence for a long time, causing psychological and emotional problems for the kid, his family, and his personal and public life.

This kid is British and he sued the court and crown in London. There isn't anything 'American' about it. Whoever thought so is a fool with not an ounce of common sense in them.
