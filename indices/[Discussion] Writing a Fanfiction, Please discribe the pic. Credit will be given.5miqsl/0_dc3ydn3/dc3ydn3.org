"...The first thing he thought when he saw it was, "Surely this architect was part spider." On closer inspection, he realised that it had only six "legs", but the illusion persisted nonetheless. From the main body of the castle extended a spire, but it was dwarfed by the towers that surrounded it. Six pathways connected the building to the towers, which went on seemingly for ever. But pulling his attention back to the main building, he noticed the giant purple...something, on the opposite end of the keep. Despite his initial reaction, he could not deny that the castle was pleasing to the eye; even though the towers seemed to reach the sky, they were themselves dwarfed by the mountains behind the castle, not to mention the effect created by the massive castle in what appeared to be a frozen wasteland otherwise. The more tactical part of his brain considered the difficulty- or perhaps the sheer impossibility - of taking the castle by storm; surrounded by mountains, a moat, six massive towers for archers to have field days, and then you would have to scale the main castle itself. The architect may or may not have been part spider, he thought to himself, but he certainly knew how to design castles."
