It's a busy picture. Not sure what about it is specifically important to your story (like the type trees or that purple orb), but i wrote up something quick that you're free to use if you want. Also, I'm typing this out on my phone, so please excuse any errors or weird formatting.

  Twin moats surrounded the palatial, eclaire-shaped complex, separated only by a thin buffer of emerald forest. Six bronze-tipped towers stood along the cobblestone rim of the outer moat, three on one side of the building and three on the other, each seemingly taller than the peaks of the mountain range behind -- tall enough to kiss the sun, maybe, but not so wide as to block its rays from washing the complex in a bright glow, or from nourishing the terraces that rested on its roof.
