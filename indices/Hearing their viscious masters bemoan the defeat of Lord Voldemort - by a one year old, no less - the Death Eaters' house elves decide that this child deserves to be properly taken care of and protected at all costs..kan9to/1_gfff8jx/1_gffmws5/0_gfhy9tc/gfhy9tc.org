Following the strands, two lead the elves to what was once the Stately Home of All Potters, left a charred ruin when Harry's Grandparents died suddenly during a Death Eater Attack 'Of Dragonpox.' (Saying that they had disagreed with a dark lord and died agonizing deaths just wouldn't do in polite company.)

Harry's Grandparents were old and not afraid of death when it came for them, ordering their elves to preserve the family legacies and themselves. One of the elves was buried under rubble, but caught himself in a stasis charm. The second is inside some vault, beyond the skills of the elves to reach. When the dying elf is awakned, an elvish oath convinces him to release the locks so the second elf can serve the last member of their house. It is his final act of service to House Potter.
