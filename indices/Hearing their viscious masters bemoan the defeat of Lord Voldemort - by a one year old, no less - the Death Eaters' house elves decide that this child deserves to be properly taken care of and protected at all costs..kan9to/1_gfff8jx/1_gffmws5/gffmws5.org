any secrets without a stringent contract. They'd sell them to the highest bidder without a thought, and the elves knew it.

So the owl went on its way. A full eight hours later, they found the child under a powerful but already weakening set of Blood Wards, in a /closet/, of all bloody things. He was dirty, hungry, cold, uncomfortable, had several adult-sized hand-shaped bruises from where the /insects/ in this house had been rough with him. They agreed to call in the oldest elf they knew (for his expertise in wizard wards).

When he got there, they explained the situation to him. He promptly stripped all the Wards off the boy except the Blood Wards, then anchored the blood wards to the beating of his heart rather than the presence of his mother's blood and their love. This way the Wards would continuously gain strength every time the boy's heartbeat. They wove together general Anti-Portkey, Anti-Apparation, Anti-Broom, and Anti-Floo wards around him, where the only ones that would work would be ones he intentionally allowed to occur. Then they added a Dueling Dome, a Stealth Suite Stripper (removes all stealth spells in range), and a Harmful Hatred Hater (to protect against those with malicious intentions, it would be like he was under Fidelius or a powerful Notice-Me-Not). Only after all this was done and blended into the Blood Wards did they tug on the strands of magic bonding him to the three remaining Potter Elves.
