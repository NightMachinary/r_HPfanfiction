The Day After Voldemort's Semi-Death (Not that they know this, of course)

After overhearing their various bad masters complain, whine, moan, and groan about the Death of their Master, a full fifteen perfectly healthy house-elves decided that Harry Potter, whoever he was, needed to be protected and cared for, especially since his parents were dead. The elves met when they were out grocery shopping for their master's homes.

In order to know what happens next, one must understand something about house-elves. House-elves, unlike wizards, are incapable of restraining their magical auras. However, their auras are on a different frequency than wizards, so wizards can't feel them, but they can feel a wizard's. Their auras allow them to act like telepaths when they are in each other's physical presence, eliminating the need for speech and creating the beautiful chaos of a place like Hogwarts Kitchens. This is also the second reason for their bad grammar, besides the lack of education.

They communicated among themselves, but none of them knew any Potter Elves, nor did they know where the Potter child had been taken or who had done the taking, so they didn't know how to find him. Then one brilliant elf had the idea to send an empty envelope with an elven-tracking spell and a mail-ward slipper (to allow the owl carrying it to find the boy through any wizard mail-wards. That wouldn't work if it was Goblin Wards, but they didn't think there would be any, because that would mean a Goblin knew his location. Goblins couldn't be ktrusted to keep.
