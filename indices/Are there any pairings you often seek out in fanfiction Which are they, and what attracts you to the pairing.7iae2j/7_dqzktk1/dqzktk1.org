Pairings that I seek out. Harry/Ginny, Harry/Luna, Luna/Ginny, Ginny/Hermione, Hermione/Ron, Harry/Hermione, with out bashing, which is a bitch to find.

Harry/Ron, Harry/Cedric, Harry/Neville, Harry/any male or female oc standin, Neville/Luna, Neville/Hermione, Neville/Ron, Neville/any male oc standin. I like to imagine Neville as bi with a gay slant.

Dumbledore/Doge, Dumbledor/Grindelwald, Colin/any male character. Cause Colin is obviously gay, his cannon crush on Harry makes him bi at the very least

Remus/Tonks, Remus/Sirius, Remus/Sirius/James. My fannon is that Remus and Sirius did some experimenting in their youth, that James might have gotten in on if I'm feeling frisky. I'm leaving out Peter, but my fannon is that he wasn't in to the homoerotic things that the other three could have gotten up to, and that's the start of how they began to drift apart in their later school years.

Draco/Pansy, Draco/Daphne, Draco/Astoria, Draco/Blaise.

The kind of pairings that I avoid, and nope out to fics if they're a surprise or even hinted at, are between characters that canonically don't get along, or are outright enemies.

Hermione/any death eater, or death eater sympathizer, Draco/any order of the phoenix or any order of the phoenix sympathizer or muggle born, Snape/anyone but Lily.
