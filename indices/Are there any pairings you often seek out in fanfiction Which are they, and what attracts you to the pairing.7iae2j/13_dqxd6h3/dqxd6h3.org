Yeah! I read just for the weird pairs! Stuff like Harry Hermione is really hard to find. I don't get why it's so hard to find genderbent Hermione slash fic. I can't stand Hermione/Tom when Tom's the barman instead of the dark lord for whatever reason. It just kinda creeps me out cus I can't help but thing that the bar dude slipped some Amorhowsitspelled into her drink and that's how they got together.
