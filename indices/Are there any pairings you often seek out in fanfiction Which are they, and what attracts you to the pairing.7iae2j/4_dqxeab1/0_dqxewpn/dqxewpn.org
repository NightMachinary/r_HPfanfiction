I was actually just speaking with my room mate about the Drarry pairing tonight, and how disappointing we find it, as a rule. I think when you look at the ships that are the most popular within their fandoms - whether under the "slash" or the "het" label - you are often going to be bombarded with very simplistic tropes and often simplistic ideas of characters. I don't actually have any objection to the ship at all, and there's going to be some Drarry as a primary ship in my long series, as well as a piece I'm currently writing as a Secret Santa gift, but I've never really found any Drarry fics that are especially compelling.

I suppose there are some issues I have with the popular fics - firstly, Draco and Harry have very defined voices and accents, and they speak very differently to one another. They also have a lot in /common/, which I think a lot of people overlook - and not in the sense that they mirror each other or represent each other, or form two sides of the same coin: in reality, the character who bests parallels Draco Malfoy in that way would likely be Ron Weasley, not Harry. Draco and Harry are each very stubborn, very sarcastic, natural leaders, prone to isolation when they're under stress, and with complex histories of trauma and emotion. They would not easily slip into a relationship with one another, even with their canonic enmity laid aside.

Even if Draco and Harry looked past their issues with each other (and I neither think they could or should, unless the book spans a decade), they would bite at each other, exchange harsh words, and likely argue often. Perhaps I should blame Tumblr for the voracious commonality of the stupid tropes children think of as clever dialogue, such as everyone at Hogwarts "knowing" Draco is interested in Harry and mocking him openly about it, or anything similar.

I don't know. It's one of those pairings I think is kind of boring in the way it's presented, but that I think /could/ be decent - I'm just often disappointed when I try to give it a go.

Especially given that every single Draco/Harry fic, it seems, needs to bash Lucius Malfoy to kingdom come, and I don't care for that sort of nonsense at all. He's a horrible man, but he's by no means an abusive father.
