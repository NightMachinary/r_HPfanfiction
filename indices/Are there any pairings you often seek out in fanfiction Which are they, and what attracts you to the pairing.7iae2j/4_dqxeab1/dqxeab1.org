I like Harry/Draco fics. I always fall for the enemy to lover-trope (no matter what fandom, it's my absolute favourite) and there are a lot of good fics out there for this pairing. It's difficult to get right but for some reason a lot of people have succeeded in making it believable. I prefer to read slash before het, too, so that's a double bonus.
