I'll take most fics that are are not cannon or Hermione. I honestly got bored of the constant Gryff/Gryff pairings even before I got so fed up with Hermione that I filter her out of the search options if I get the urge for a fic but that's rare nowadays, I dislike her to a point that even if I love the fic the moment I see them hooking up I give up on the fic. I also dislike Honks fics because the age difference seems to massive when Harry is 16 or less.

I liked Fleur a lot for a while but Harry is usually his usual wimpy self or a budding dark lord and they just don't mesh with Fleur in my opinion. I really wanted more Harry/Daphne/Susan fics but they are virtually nonexistent and I honestly can't tell what I even find appealing in that pairing. Anything that has to do with Snape with a student is dead to me, then again most things with Snape are dead to me so that's not fair. Harry harem fics is what I've been reading but a lot of them I give up because of Hermione so yeah.

Nowadays I just prefer an adult Harry crossover because the child cannon Harry makes me cringe.
