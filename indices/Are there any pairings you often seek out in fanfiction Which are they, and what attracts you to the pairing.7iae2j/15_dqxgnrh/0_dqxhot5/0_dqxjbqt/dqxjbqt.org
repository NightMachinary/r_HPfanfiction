I'm with you regarding the "cute" gay relationships. I've yet to observe one like that in real life. Most of my gay friends that are married are just like two dudes hanging out together--playing video games, riding motorcycles, going to the theater--just regular stuff. Nothing especially cute about any of it and nothing out of the ordinary except it's two dudes. I mean, if a gay couple is going to see Britney Spears, there's a likelihood that they'll /both/ be excited rather than only /one/ of them being excited if a straight couple is going to see her, but that's pretty much it from what I can tell. :D
