Yeah, I'm with you, although my actual ship preferences are a little different.

I really dislike the "slash" label 'cause it just has these connotations of a woman - usually a young, straight woman - writing it, and finding the gay relationships to be "so cute" or whatever. On [[/r/fanfiction]], a while back, there was a thread where people were talking about why they liked certain gay ships, and enough people said "well, why would I want the character I like interested in another woman?" and "I just find the idea of two men together sexy" that I ended up just not looking on the subreddit for a while, haha.

I don't claim to be a man's man - I'm an actor, and I'm flamboyant, and I /do/ like clothes and drag and pop music, so I'm pretty much a walking stereotype - but there is a difference between how men actually act toward one another and the seme/uke nonsense one sees in a lot of fanfic.
