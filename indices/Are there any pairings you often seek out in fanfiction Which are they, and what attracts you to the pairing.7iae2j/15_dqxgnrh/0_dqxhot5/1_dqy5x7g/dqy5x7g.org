I'm the same - despite being a gay male, I give slash fics a wide berth and read almost exclusively straight relationships. I think the only slash fic I genuinely love in the HP fandom is Turn by Sara's Girl, which managed to snag me with its good writing and a fun premise. But even that one is obviously written by a woman, so yeah... Slim pickings for real fags.
