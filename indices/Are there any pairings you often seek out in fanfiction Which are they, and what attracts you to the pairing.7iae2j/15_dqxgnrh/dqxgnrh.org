I've always loved a good Harry/Sirius or Harry/Sirius/Remus bromance. Dudes chilling and having fun, and if they happen to be friends with benefits too, that's even better.

It's not the most /normal/ of pairings, and I've never found a good fic that can fully satisfy my craving for it, but yeah. I've never really seen Sirius as anything approaching a father figure, or even an uncle. But a friend that would let you crash at his place for as long as you need? Totally.

The thing is, I despise /slash./ Not gay sex or relationships - I'm bisexual myself - but I loathe fics that have an overly sweet, "idealized" gay relationship. "Love triumphs," "Love redeems," and all that cuddly stuff... /blech./ I need far more testosterone and adrenaline than that.
