I'm very picky about pairings, to be honest - not because I favour ship in particular most of the time, but just because I like certain dynamics to be explored in all of their complexities, and I prefer stuff to be /character-focused/ as opposed to /ship-focus/, which I used to assume were the same thing and then became gravely disappointed.

The ships I enjoy most in the fandom are some of the most reviled, but also some of the most /terribly written/ as a result of the way characters are either romanticized or flattened out. My favourite character in the HP universe is Lucius Malfoy, and I have a lot of affection for Lucissa, which is often made a bit too saccharine for my liking, and then I do enjoy Harry/Lucius, but I think it has to be done in the nasty, slightly self-loathing way it deserves to be, on Harry's part.

And then Harry Potter/Severus Snape I would theoretically enjoy, but I think the only fics I've enjoyed enough to recommend have still fallen very flat for me in terms of Severus' characterisation, and I just can't abide by somebody making him too romantic or Darcy-esque.

The list of pairings I avoid is hideously long, though: as I said, picky.
