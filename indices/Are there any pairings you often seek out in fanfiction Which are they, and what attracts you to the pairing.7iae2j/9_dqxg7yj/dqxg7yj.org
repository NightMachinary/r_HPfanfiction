severus/tonks, because it's fun, and reminds of [[http://cokeworthcauldrons.tumblr.com/post/130406446708/thedankestmemehustler-br00taldan][this post]]. the pairing, as i envision it, is mostly entirely self-indulgent tropefic. that involves them getting up to varying shenanigans. i imagine a series of fics. titled and involving scenarios a la it's always sunny, e.g. 'severus and tonks do magic drugs', 'severus and tonks make a porno', etc.

i generally avoid snape/hermione, because it usually involves some variation of darcy!snape, which i don't care for.

what pairings do /you/ read, LD? what do you avoid?
