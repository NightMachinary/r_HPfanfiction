Harry/Tonks (I'm reading Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass) and am loving the way that Tonks is being written.

I also agree with what someone said: A Harry/Non Ice Queen Daphne story would be great to read.

A Harry/Fleur story with no character bashing, would be good as well. In a non harem setting as well.

Neville/Ginny; maybe something happens during their supposed seventh year where they fall in love under harsh times, being each other's shoulder to lean on.

Harry/Hermione/Ron, that is the only way I can read Harry/Hermione without wanting to stop. I'd like a more plot related story for them with them being as in character as possible.

A Seamus/Lavender after the war that shows the after affects of what Lavender went through with the attack of Greyback would be great to see. Admittedly a popular pairing but I've never read this idea before.

A Hermione/Ron story that deals with them having PTSD after the war, with Harry as a minor character or reoccurring character, as long as he's not a major character could be cool to see. I'd just like to see them getting along with Harry being around.

A Minerva/Severus friendship story that deals with their time at Hogwarts could be cool to see. I've always liked the idea of the two of them complaining together about people like Quirrell, Lockhart, Dumbledore, Malfoy ect extra. And I do mean friendship, not romance.

A Blaise/Parvati story involving their time during their seventh year and possibly beyond would be cool. I don't know why but I like the pairing and it's sad that it's not written a whole lot.

A Padma/Anthony story involving them after the war would be cool, like Parvati/Blaise I don't know why I ship it I just do.

A Luna/Draco story where Draco is trying to make amends to the people he hurt or was involved with during the war. I normally don't like shipping a character with a ton of other characters, but Luna is just one of those characters I can see working well with a lot of other characters.

A Luna/Severus friendship story. After reading: linkfinn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know-- Yet I Live and I Love) I want to read more Luna/Severus friendship stories.
