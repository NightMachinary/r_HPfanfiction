Harry/Luna and maybe Harry/Tonks are the only one that I'd actively seek out (because you can't get enough (non-seer!!!) Luna or Tonks), but as long as the main pairing is M/F and not Harmony (or there's no main pairing), it doesn't matter much. I don't really read many pure romance stories anyway...

Side pairings can be anything as long as they're not too squicky like Voldemort/* or Snape/*.
