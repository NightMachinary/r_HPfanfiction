I'd like to read more Trio getting together stories.

I'd like to read at least one canon compliant H/G fic in “House of Cards” and “Contractual Invalidation” style.

I'd like to read a good Hermione/Albus Severus or Hermione/Scorpius fic without Ron bashing.

I'd like to read a Harry/Fleur in a non harem setting and with Fleur taking a mentor like role.

I'd like to read Harry/non Ice Queen Daphne fics, although I really prefer Harry/Astoria.

I'd like to read at least one time-traveling Harry/Lily, in which there is a good plot and Harry is trying to deny the relationship.

I'd like to see more fics with those pairings:

Neville/Ginny/Luna (complements romantic Trio well)

Victor/Ginny

Charlie/Hermione

Tonks/someone other than Remus
