Lmao this whole "must hate ice queen Daphne" has just become a meme at this point. An ice queen persona is just fine, the problem in the fanon with it is that it's the most popular, meaning there's the most instances of just terribly written and cliche ice queen Daphne.

There's nothing wrong with the persona alone, and it's actually an interesting persona, it just gets a bad rep from the countless shittily written fics that have no idea how humans interact or work.
