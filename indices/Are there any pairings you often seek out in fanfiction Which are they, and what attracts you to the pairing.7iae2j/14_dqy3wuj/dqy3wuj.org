Harry/Fleur (if we aren't counting crossovers) has been the pairing I've been looking at the most recently. I've completed/caught up with at least three stories that feature that pairing in the last few weeks.

Hasn't always been the pairing that I've searched for, but it is currently the one that seems the most fun to read at the moment, I believe before this pairing I read quite a bit of Harry/Tonks

I only tend to avoid stuff featuring Ginny and Slash in HP fanfic. I like slash in other stuff, but I can't seem to find myself liking any of the pairings. As for Ginny I just never had enough of an interest in her character to want to explore her further.
