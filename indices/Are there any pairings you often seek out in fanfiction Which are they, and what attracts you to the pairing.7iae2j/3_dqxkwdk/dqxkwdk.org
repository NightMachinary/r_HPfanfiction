I've been out of the loop on fanfics for YEARS and a. Just starting get back into them. During my obsession (Which started about the same time as everyone else, the long wait for book 4 to be released haha) I found myself really into Draco/Ginny (s.s. fire & ice) both with a Canon feel as well as where Ginny goes kind of "rebel". And I also really enjoyed Tom/Ginny (s.s. Gin & Tonic) in darkfics mostly. Canon wise I always was a Ron/Hermione (The Good Ship) sailor though, but I didn't really go out of my way to find them.

What I loved about Draco/Ginny was that I felt like it was a non canon ship that could actually believably happen. Ginny was/is such a strong and vibrant girl. Outgoing and didn't take crap from anyone as she was growing. She could hold her own against Draco. Especially as the books progressed I believe in HBP there was a line on the train where I think even pansy says Draco found her (ginny) attractive or something. Ginny, while poor and "dirtied" still was pureblooded so you could keep Draco still a bit prejudiced and it could work out. I just figured they could complement each other in ways.

Tom/Ginny was because I was like 13 and angsty and it was just an intriguing idea that maybe when Tom possessed Ginny she actually got a taste for the "dark side" So to speak and she always tried to suppress it but after months of pouring her heart out to him she still loved him before she knew who it was etc.
