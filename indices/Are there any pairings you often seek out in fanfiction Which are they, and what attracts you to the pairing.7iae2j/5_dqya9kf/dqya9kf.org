Harry/ any Gryffindor chaser besides Ginny

I don't care if it's Angelina, Alicia, Katie or Demelza, if "they both like Quidditch" was enough explanation for the canon pairing then there ought to be stories with one of the other chasers as romantic interest as well. I'm not even looking for Quidditch career stories. But sharing a lot of time with girls and seeing them in underwear, if not outright naked should spark something.
