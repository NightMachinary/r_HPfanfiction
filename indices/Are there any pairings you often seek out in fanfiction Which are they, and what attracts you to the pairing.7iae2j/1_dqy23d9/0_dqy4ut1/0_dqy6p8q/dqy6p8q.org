The old days I was talking about was more the community of shippers than the stories. I agree we have more quality these days, but I enjoyed the discussions and whatnot :) thanks for the recs, though. I'm already following The Augurey (really enjoying post-Hogwarts H/Hr, it's a fine time for them to get together) and will look up the other ones.

What do you like to read/ship?
