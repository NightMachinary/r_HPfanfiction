The Augurey, A Leap of Faith and World Changer are currently updating Harmony fics that are worth reading. Moments of Closeness was recently finished and is a pretty good infidelity smut-filled fic.

I'm not really a Harmony shipper myself, but I find it has no lack of decent stories written in the last few years. In fact, most of the stories from pre-2010 I find to be horribly written (particularly those recommended on Portkey). with very rare exceptions.

I don't know about this great Harmony renaissance in the olden days, I've yet to find anything digestible past Vox Corporis and a couple of decent smutty oneshots.
