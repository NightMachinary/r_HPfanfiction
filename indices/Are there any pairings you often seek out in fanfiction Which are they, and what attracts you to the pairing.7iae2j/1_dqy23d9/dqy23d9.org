I've been shipping Harry/Hermione for over ten years. Ah, the good old days of SS Harmony, Delusional Pumpkin Pies... Anyway, I'm attracted to the pairing because I've always identified with Hermione the most, and what gal doesn't want to end with the hero, even if you don't much like him in canon?

But these days I find it really hard to find new Harmony stories that aren't awful. There's a few by Starfox5 and Potato19 that I'm enjoying, but I'm afraid that general interest on writing the ship is kinda dying out after all this time... Anyhow, I find myself looking for quality Gen fics the most nowadays. If it has to have a pairing, I don't really have a preference although I really dislike reading the Canon ones.
