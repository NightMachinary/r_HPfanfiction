I don't think it'd be an insult to change his name. People do it all the time (whether because of a change in gender or they just don't like it).

Also I think this was intended to be after the events of CC, since it refers to him going back to Al, and thereby accepting canon (despite the atrocity it became).

It's DEFINITELY cruel of Harry and Ginny to do that to Neville though... That was what /really/ disgusted me.
