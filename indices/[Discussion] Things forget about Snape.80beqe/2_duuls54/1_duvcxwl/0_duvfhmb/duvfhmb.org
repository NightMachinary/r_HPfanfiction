  I don't think it'd be an insult to change his name. People do it all the time (whether because of a change in gender or they just don't like it).

Sure if your name is meaningless you do. If you're named after a War Hero that - for some inexplicable reason - your parents hold in high regard then it is certainly insulting. I'd feel insulted (though I wouldn't burden my child with that name anyway; I just imagine someone more deserving).

Imagine you named your kid after your dad and kid comes to you "Yo LoverofLogic, my friend XY talked to me and told me that your dad was a huge dick. So I'm going to change my name. Kthxbye!"
