I think he keeps Albus though, just goes by Al and changes Severus. Dumbledore was highly respected but I doubt anybody but Harry liked Snape. Personally, if my child could explain their reasoning, I wouldn't feel insulted.

Alright, you seem to have edited your response... And it doesn't make sense. That wouldn't be the same situation at all if Albus changed his name from Severus.
