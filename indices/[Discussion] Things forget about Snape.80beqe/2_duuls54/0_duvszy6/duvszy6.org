Snape might have bailed Neville and Ginny out of multiple tight spots in Year 7, at considerable risk to himself.

If that were the case, then both Neville and Ginny would have very good reasons to forgive him.

I've been always saying that ignoring Hogwarts during Year 7 was one huge mistake by Rowling. Lots of what happened in Epilogue would suddenly make lot of sense.
