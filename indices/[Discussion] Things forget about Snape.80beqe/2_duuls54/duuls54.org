  My own belief is that, as Albus' godfather, Neville would eventually sit him down and tell him what Snape was really like. After that point, Albus would change his middle name to Neville. (Further down the road, he would also go back to insisting people call him Al.)

My own belief is, that after Snape is resurrected from the Dead, he kidnaps Albus, changes his name to Tom Marvolo and raises him as a carbon copy of the Dark Lord.

Sorry, couldn't resist. I agree with your opinion on Snape, but if you just want to make stuff up (which is fine, I reject the epilogue entirely) why not imagine that he isn't called Albus Severus in the first place (because that's a stupid name). More believable than Albus insulting his parents and rejecting his given name.
