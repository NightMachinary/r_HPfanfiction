In other words, if Snape had met some obnoxious pureblood Slytherins on the train first, he might have followed Lily into Gryffindor and they could have very well become a couple.

Or if Snape was given a second chance after falling to Nagini, he would certainly do things very differently. Most of the popular Snape/Lily fics are actually of the time travel type, as these authors are aware that Lily would not want a Death Eater Snivellus.

Fanfics are all about exploring alternative scenarios. Where is the fun if everything sticks to canon?
