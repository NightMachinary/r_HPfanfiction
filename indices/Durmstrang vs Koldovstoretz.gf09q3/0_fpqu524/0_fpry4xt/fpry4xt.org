Historically, Germany was united fairly recently (19th century). When you look at a map of Germany before the Napoleonic wars, it resembles a patchwork rug of small states and cities. If there wasn't a country called Germany, there wouldn't have been a wizarding school for it. In my headcanon, German wizards (and possibly other countries' wizards, as well) favoured a master-apprentice system over schools. One witch or wizard would teach at most a handful of students everything they knew. Later schools may have developed from this, but they would never be as large as Hogwarts, and therefore do not deserve a mention among the most famous wizarding schools in the world. I bet there are many small schools all over the world, they're just too unkown to be mentioned on Pottermore.
