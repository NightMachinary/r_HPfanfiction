I think there is potentially hundreds of magical schools in europe. Hogwarts, Beuxbatons and others in rowlings list are in my opinion just the larger ones compared to rest(meaning hogwarts might be the cambridge of british wizarding schools while others might be just smaller, local schools.)

Rowling says smaller schools come and go, so the ones she listed are not the only schools, they are just better.
