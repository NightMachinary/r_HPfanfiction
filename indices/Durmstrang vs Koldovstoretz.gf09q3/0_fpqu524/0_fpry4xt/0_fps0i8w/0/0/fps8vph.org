For France, French was a lingua franca of high level European nobility for centuries - but that would also include England, so it's not really an excuse. France was probably closer tied to England than to Italy or Spain during the medieval period, too.

I'm not a fan of the canon schools and their locations myself - I'd much prefer to add a lot more schools in, specifically because it doesn't make sense for there to be so few.

Just to put it into perspective, Hogwarts was canonically founded before England controlled Wales or Scotland, far less Ireland - and yet Hogwarts is in Scotland and students from all over the British isles go to Hogwarts.

Although the HRE was a loosely organized empire (particularly post interregnum) that was not abnormal - France, for instance, was very decentralized for centuries, and in terms of 'country' they'd be fairly comparable for a few centuries. Language was also a barrier - we picture France as united linguistically today due to the 19th century, really, but prior to that? It was a patchwork of various patois and languages. That's obviously not even talking about the differences with the various Spanish languages/dialects, Italian, Dutch, or Portuguese, all of which are supposedly present at Beauxbatons. I think basing wizarding schools on history doesn't work for canon, unfortunately - it'd need to create from scratch a wizarding history to justify it even for just hogwarts, let alone the pan-european ones.
