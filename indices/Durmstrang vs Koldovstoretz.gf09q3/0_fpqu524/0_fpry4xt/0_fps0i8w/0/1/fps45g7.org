  So it's possibly the most international school of all, and all that matters for admission is your blood status.

That may work as partial explanation. However, what all non-purebloods do if they don't speak French in your universe? Does most of Europe go to Koldovstoretz? That sounds weird (whole Europe+Russia having effectively three schools: one for England, one for France, one for everybody else).

I prefer the German School in the Harz mountains, and the Central European non-German school at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeƒç]]) (there is the Czech server [[http://budec.net/]] which is based around that school).
