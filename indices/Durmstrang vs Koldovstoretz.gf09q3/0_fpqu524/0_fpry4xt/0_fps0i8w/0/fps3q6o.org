The borders of magical countries seem to be roughly where the real borders are, but probably not always (e.g. tiny Liechenstein is supposed to have a large enough magical population for a national Quidditch team). I'm not very familiar with the history of France, but I'm sure there are reasons why people in other countries speak French and why Beauxbaton accepts students from these places. Ireland used to be a part of the UK for a long time, so it makes sense for them to go to Hogwarts (Irleland only became independant in the 20th century). Maybe magical Ireland isn't independant at all.

The Holy Roman Empire wasn't really a country, or even a region where people spoke the same language (Germany, Eastern Europe, Italy were all part of it). If it had wizarding schools, I imagine they didn't survive to the modern age.

Durmstrang is a pureblood/halfblood only school, and apparently it takes students from all over the world. We know Krum from Bulgaria went there, Grindelwald from Austria?, and Draco's parents from England at least considered sending him there. So it's possibly the most international school of all, and all that matters for admission is your blood status.
