  If there wasn't a country called Germany, there wouldn't have been a wizarding school for it.

Why? I don't think magical schools are organized around the states (e.g., Beauxbatons cover certainly multitude of states, and I understood there are Irish at Hogwarts, I mean from the Republic, not from NI). Why there couldn't be one school for the area of roughly The Holy Roman Empire? (And yes, I am a Czech, so I know all about those weird questions like “are we Germans or not”? After all, Czech knights were fighting at the Battle of Lechfeld ;)).

And still nobody explained to me why Bulgarians go study somewhere to Lapland, or wherever Durmstrang is.
