Because Russia is not the Eastern Europe? And no I don't mean, that Asia begins at the Landstrasse, but that there is certainly space for two schools behind the former Iron Curtain (one for what are now Central and Eastern European EU states and perhaps Ukraine, the other for Russia itself). Much more interesting question is why the hell there is no third school for Germany?
