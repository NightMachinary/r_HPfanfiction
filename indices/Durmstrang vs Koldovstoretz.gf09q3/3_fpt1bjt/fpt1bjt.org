I theorize it as Durmstrang being a private school that's targeted at witches and wizards all over the world, while Koldovdstoretz is the state school for Russia like Hogwarts is for the United Kingdom (there has to be a smaller, unknown school for Ireland because I can't imagine them being happy about needing to go to the UK).l

Or maybe Russia gets two schools because it's so much bigger than...everywhere, really. The whole country is larger than Pluto. Eastern Russia is also very poorly connected to Western Russia, as you can see [[https://maps-russia.com/img/1200/russian-highway-map.jpg][here]]. There's a whole lot of nothing that still has people living there. Durmstrang could be in the western half of the country (which would also explain the rate of international students like Krum and Gridndelwald), while Koldovdstoretz is in the east.

Or maybe she just forgot.
