I'll get to reading it.

I've avoided the Hero Trilogy it since I read in one of the author notes for /Wastelands of Time/ Joe stated that he wrote the Hero trilogy when he was much younger and it was somewhat "subpar" in comparison to his other works. But since it was written by Joe, something he considers "subpar" is better than a significant amount of other fanfiction.
