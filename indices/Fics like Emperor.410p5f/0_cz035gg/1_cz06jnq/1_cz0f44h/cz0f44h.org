Indeed. Joe was a phenomenal writer, even then, it seems. While you can identify some parts of the Hero trilogy that are less mature than the Wastelands, it's still amazing, and outdoes most existing HP fanfiction.

On top of that, I have looked hard over the past few years and not found a single fic that has the sheer scale and sense of "epic" that the Hero trilogy does. It's very well written, especially the second book.
