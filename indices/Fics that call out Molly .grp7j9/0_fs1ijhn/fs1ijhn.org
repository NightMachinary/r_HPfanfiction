  Molly would likely be a better parent than Sirius at that moment.

Not really? Molly would be a terrible parent for Harry. At any time. She smothers and dictates everything. And has the subtlety and social grace of Hagrid. Howlers... in the main Hall? Really? Yes, let's air our dirty laundry for everybody to enjoy. Like the above argument. In front of everybody?

Okay, tangent over.

The right way to bite back over something out of her control would be to conjure/summon a world map, insert it into a howler and release it to ask "Like you know better, what country is your next kid going to escape to after you push them too far?" Yes, do it all in front of her too.

There, you hit below the belt for something she /probably/ had nothing to do with or control over, and made a dig at her penchant for airing the family's dirty laundry to the public.
