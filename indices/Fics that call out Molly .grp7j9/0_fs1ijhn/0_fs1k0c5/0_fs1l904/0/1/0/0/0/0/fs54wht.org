  Molly could have done something much worse.

when Ron was away at school? not really, apart from maybe sending genuinely dangerous things in the mail like with Hermione's mail in GoF, and that doesn't seem Molly's style.

  Plus, no one ever talked about it after it happened.
#+end_quote

no one talked about a LOT of things that happened in the books, though. Harry's the quintessential unreliable narrator; for the most part, if it doesn't directly relate to Harry's journey, Rowling doesn't add it in.

a Howler isn't just getting scolded by a parent in the moment; it's thought out in advance and sent over. Molly, having attended Hogwarts, would know that students receive mail at breakfast and that therefore everyone in the hall at the time would hear it. that's planning out her son's humiliation in advance, which is emotional abuse.
