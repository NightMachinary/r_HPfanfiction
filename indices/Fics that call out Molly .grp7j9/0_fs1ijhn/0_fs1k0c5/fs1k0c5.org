I mean Molly has her flaws yes. And I don't mean to say Sirius would be a bad parent. Just that Sirius is dealing with a lot at the moment and he kinda needs some time to focus on himself and a lot of support.

I mean he just got out of Azkaban and now is trapped in the family home he never wanted to go back to. So not that he couldn't be a parent at the moment but not being a parent would mean a bit more time focusing on himself giving himself a break which he gets less of a chance to do if he had the responsibility of a parent.

Being a parent isn't the only way to be there for Harry either which Sirius demonstrates for the years Harry has with him despite not actually being Harry's parent.
