  But telling him that he wasn't there for Harry because he spent all those years in Azkaban was such a low blow and so mean. And then Sirius dies and its never really brought up again.

Now that I think about it, Sirius /could/ have walked out any time. I think the nominal explanation is that it wouldn't matter since he couldn't find Pettigrew and prove his innocence until 1993, but that doesn't work very well either. For one thing, I think that he was more interested in revenge than in justice. For another, even if he managed to steal a wand, living as a wizard outlaw would have been far more comfortable than as an Azkaban prisoner.

In any case, Harry didn't play a big part in his motivation; so perhaps Molly was justified.
