Very good point. Sirius always had the capacity to turn into Padfoot and escape. Though if I remember correctly part of how he escaped was by being so skinny he could slip through the bars as a dog. Even then though with how prisoners were treated that probably didn't take more than a year to reach that point.

I think the biggest point in Sirus's favor is the madness of Azkaban. He was already half mad with grief and rage when he was thrown in there and rapidly had his happy memories of James, Lily and Harry stripped away. All that he was left with for years was the bitter knowledge that he was innocent, but that he had as good as killed the Potter's himself. With any positive or happy thoughts about yourself and others taken away what reason is there to escape? He knew Dumbledore was taking care of Harry, but any happiness at the idea of escaping to take care of Harry himself would have been stolen away too. It took a severe shock in seeing Wormtails photo and knowing he was in a position to kill Harry, plus the fact that he had held on to some shred of his identity through the unhappy thought of his innocence, and the fact that he had protected his mind to an extent as Padfoot, to give him enough of an obsession, a "fire in his head that the dementors couldn't destroy", that he could focus on escaping.

Thinking about that, I don't blame him for not escaping earlier. I'm sure he thought about it, about doing his duty as a godfather, about raising a smiling happy Harry, but lost those thoughts and memories under the influence of the dementors. It's why no one else ever escaped from Azkaban on their own. The number of factors needed to give someone both the mental state and the physical/magical ability to escape are just too rare.

I also don't blame him for not immediately focusing on Harry and focusing on his revenge first. He's literally a broken man, with a broken mind, and broken memories. I think seeing Harry at Privet Drive, being in Hogwarts on occasion, watching Harry fly, etc, were all things that he needed to even be in the partially sane mindset he was in by the end of the book.
