Well I think it's really hard to find the motivation when stuck in Azkaban. And Sirius for a while was probably stuck in self loathing. I believe he blamed himself for what happened to James and Lily. And he didn't know where Pettigrew was, once he did he finally got motivation to take revenge.

Molly does have a point that for a while Harry wasn't Sirius' number one priority.
