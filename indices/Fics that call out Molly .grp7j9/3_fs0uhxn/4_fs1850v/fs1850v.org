I mean its Azkaban I do think if he thought he could break out he would. But I think its hard to focus or think in there. My theory is that news paper managed gave him this concrete thing to focus on a concrete thing to do. That sorta clear direction could really give him something tangible to hold on to that could be beneficial to him. It was also not necessarily good therefore the Dementors couldn't feed on it.

Its true that Harry didn't really play a part in motivating his escape. But it really doesn't make it justified for Molly to say he wasn't there for Harry just because his reason for breaking out after being unjustly imprisoned, wasn't Harry, and instead was the actual culprit.

Besides until he found a place to settle he couldnt take care of Harry in the sense of adopting him. And in book 3 he's very unhinged. But he does help out alot in book four while hanging out in caves and eating rats so I'd say Harry was still a big priority for him.
