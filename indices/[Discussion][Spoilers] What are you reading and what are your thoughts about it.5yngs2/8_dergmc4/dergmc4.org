I currently have 3 titles open on my iPad. "Three Turns", "Harry Potter and the Time Warp" and "Dignity in Fear".

- Three Turns

Charming Time-travel story playing in the Marauders era. Its quick, its sometimes witty and a very light-hearted read. However, I'm at chapter 29 and the characters begin to annoy me. All of them. Granted, they're very close to how teenagers act, but the worst is that they're so close to how teenagers act. The dialogues are often just... inconsequential. Just stupid banter for the sake of another exchange of words that, I think, should endear us to the Marauders and their "lol xD" quirky ways, but ends up annoying the hell out of me.

I'll give it a few more chapters to finally /get on with it/, but I doubt it will come around.

- Harry Potter and the Time Warp

I'm actually not sure why I torture myself with this one. I just really scrap the barrel here and at this point I'll give anything a look. Horrible writing, horrible characterizations, horrible plotting and I would suspect an awful plot as well. I'm not yet beyond the introductory chapters so I won't judge that. It has it all, of course. There is the manipulative Dumbledore, the love potion mixing Weasley women, the abusive and violent Ron and so on and so forth.

Probably the weirdest part of the writing are the paragraph-long sentences that just stretch endlessly by the use of the words "and then". Honestly, the funniest thing about this are the ANs as the author seems to be downright delusional about her (?) story.

- Dignity in Fear

This one. /This one/. I came across this in my alert feed. Back when I started following the story it was at 5 chapters or so, but now it bloomed into quite a sweet Hermione/Tonks story. The writing is good, the characterization just an editor away from on point and since its a romance, the plot really doesn't matter that much and therefore does the sensible thing - sticking to canon. Out of the three I currently read, this one I'd actually recommend. Femslash, obviously.

PS.: If anyone is interested for an original title to read: No One's Chosen by Randall P. Fitzgerald

Written by an independent writer who also lurks [[/r/worldbuilding]], its a surprisingly good read. If you look for some fantasy, this one is definitely worth its money, judging by the first ~100 pages.
