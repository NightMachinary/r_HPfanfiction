  I'm actually not sure why I torture myself with this one. I just really scrap the barrel here and at this point I'll give anything a look. Horrible writing, horrible characterizations, horrible plotting and I would suspect an awful plot as well. I'm not yet beyond the introductory chapters so I won't judge that. It has it all, of course. There is the manipulative Dumbledore, the love potion mixing Weasley women, the abusive and violent Ron and so on and so forth.

  Probably the weirdest part of the writing are the paragraph-long sentences that just stretch endlessly by the use of the words "and then". Honestly, the funniest thing about this are the ANs as the author seems to be downright delusional about her (?) story.

Is it funny that your description actually made me remember this fic? It's been at least half a year that I've read a few chapters and I distinctly remember it for the terrible writing quality that you described. It's really really bad.

I too read that story much further than I should have... I think some of the plot-hooks intrigued me, but I just couldn't get over the terrible writing.
