I finished [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3645205/1/][Faultlines]] after asking for some angsty Ron/Hermione. While I had a lot of issues with the story in general, it actually made me realize why two reasons why I hate a lot of angsty fics, even though I like the genre overall:

1) The entire story was built around long arguments that went in circles. And this is really common in a lot of angsty relationship fics. The author basically has one plot in mind and wants to stretch the story out as long as possible to load on the angst. But then every time the two love interests argue, it's the exact same fight. And it isn't as though big revelations are made. They just wind up in the exact same spot. Which I get is fairly realistic for a lot of couples who fight. But as far as a narrative goes, it is aggravating to read over and over again.

2) This fic made me hate everyone involved. The characters were so unlikable because they were so aggravating. And that's a major problem. I need to be able to root for these characters. Not want to throw them both against the wall in frustration and annoyance.

At the end, Ron and Hermione decide to be together and it leaves it ambiguous as to whether it will work. I'm fine with these types of endings but it does make you feel like everything you just read was as pointless as the 5th argument about the same issue. The truth is when you write a fic where the couple argues all the time about the same stuff, you can't really write a happy ending. Because if they get back together, you know it's based on unhealthy behavior and it can't possibly work out.

Angsty romance fics are actually really tough to write, in my opinion, without making one hate the characters or just get fed up with the arguments. This fic fell into the usual pitfalls. Yet it won a lot of these online awards for best angst fic and now I wonder if it's just me.
