I quite liked that one.

I can sort of see what you mean with the characters but they managed to keep me interested. The main argument went on too long and got a bit contrived but otherwise the story worked.

One thing that always amused me about canon Harry is that he was such an innocent little soul throughout his puberty. He's an immensely famous wizard in a school where dozens of girls start openly drooling over him... and he basically ignores them. TheUnrealInsomniac always writes rather more realistically.
