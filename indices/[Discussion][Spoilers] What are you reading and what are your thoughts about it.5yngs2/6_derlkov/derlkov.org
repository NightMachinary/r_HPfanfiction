I've been reading "The Wise One" Trilogy:

It's okay and had some unique ideas in Book 1 and 2, but I completely lost interest in Book 3, which felt like a huge canon rehash and just trying to follow in the exact canon footsteps (even going on a camping trip) - for no discernable reason. Probably not going to go back to it, I don't deal well with disappointment.
