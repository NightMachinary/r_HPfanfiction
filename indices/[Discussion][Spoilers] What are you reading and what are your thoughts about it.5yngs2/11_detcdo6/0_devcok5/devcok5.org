It could have been a good story if not for robst's inability to make life difficult for his heroes and heroines. He'd spend ages on a slow build up of a plan to cause Harry problems of some kind, then about half a page blowing it apart. In a similar vein, whenever any other character says something bad about Harry, all the other adults immediately turn on them and defend Harry. There's no tension at all. Even the ending (and it's robst so I'm not really spoiling anything here) was basically: "We won. We thought we'd lost Hermione for a moment but she's already fine."

There were some really good ideas in Harry Crow - escaping from Azkaban using a wand made from straw and our own hair always sticks out for me - but there weren't enough to keep it going. I stuck with it until the end but only out of bloody-mindedness.
