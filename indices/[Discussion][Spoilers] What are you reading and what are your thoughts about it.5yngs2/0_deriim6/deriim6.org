I have never read a story with a female Voldemort before, and I have to say that I thoroughly enjoy this one. Her interactions with Harry are very fun to read, at least for me; and the dissonance between her personas is neat. Kinda leaves you thinking how Emily (Voldemort's name in the story) could be the same person as The Dark Lord. This is also what Harry seems to feel in the story as well, which is cool. The best part by far though, is that it updates every week on, or around Sunday night (EST).
