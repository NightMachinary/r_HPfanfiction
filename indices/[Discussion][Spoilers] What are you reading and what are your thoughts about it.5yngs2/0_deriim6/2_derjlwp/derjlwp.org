Yeah, I came to this thread to leave a link to this story as well.

To add to what you're saying, It's brilliantly written and a concept I've never seen done before (surprising as it is in a fandom that's as well trodden and this one). Nobody's humanized Voldemort like this author has. It's intriguing watching Emily's slow fall from grace through the many flashback scenes in parallel with watching Harry's slow march to being suborned. There's been careful crafting of a dramatic ending that speaks to the author's skills at storytelling.

My lone quibble is the suddenness with which an event in the last chapter was handled. [[/spoiler][Specifically, the thing with Harry being snatch-and-grabbed by Snape in Chicago after Emily conveniently left her purse behind seemed overly contrived. I would have rather this been handled slightly more carefully. Also, no matter the hour, Harry's return after being gone for several days should have roused a few people out of bed to get answers.]]

That said, I'm very much looking forward to [[/spoiler][the fallout with the Order and his friends following Harry's disappearance and return]] as well as [[/spoiler][the resolution in the flashbacks of Emily's being rejected by her paramour after he proposed and then ran off.]] Some serious drama ahead.

One thing this story does particularly well is keep the reader invested in the characters and the story. This author's last story had times when my attention drifted. Not so here.
