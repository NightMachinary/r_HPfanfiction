This is more by coincidence than design. After a lot of technical manual work I wanted to get back in the habit of fiction prose so I challenge myself to do a chapter a week from the middle of December until the end of Feb. I do not know if I will be able to write and edit around 7000 words by Sunday night. But I'm certainly going to try to.

Thanks for reading though, glad you're enjoying the story!
