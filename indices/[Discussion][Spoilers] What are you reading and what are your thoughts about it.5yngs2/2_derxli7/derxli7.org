I'm at the 50% mark of the first fic of linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter).

I'm a bit surprised that it has actually managed to keep my attention so well. It can be somewhat hit and miss with the pacing - some sections feel absurdly long, even stretched - but for the most part it's been very interesting. One of the story's high points, is how well the author has structured the reveal of new information (here the pacing hits a strike). I felt myself getting excited several times when a mystery was revealed. It shows that the author had a good plan and executed it competently.
