This is my second favourite fic that I follow (with Limpenza being the first), as you say I really enjoy the world-buildings that is happening as well as Charissa's character. I also enjoyed that Lily / James weren't happy as that's a nice change from most AUs and Lilys character as a whole I really enjoy.
