I'm reading The Long Game, by inwardtransience. I just started chapter 27, and somewhere around 30 chapters have been published so far.

For the most part I enjoy it.

Pros:

- great world building

- no spelling or grammar problems I can remember

- great depth to the major characters so far

Cons:

- there hasn't been all that much plot tension so far

- the author's passion for linguistics sometimes leads to passages that are tricky to read due to the languages and alphabets used
