*Spoilers for Sword of the Hero trilogy in this post - will not be tagging them individually*

So I'm reading Joe's Hero trilogy and I'm currently on the last book, Harry Potter and the Soul of the Hero linkffn(3994212, 4042356, 4413991).

My views so far are mostly positive. I'm a big fan of Joe as an author both in terms of technical writing ability, but also his style and how incredible he is a world-building which brings me to my first major positive about this series.

I absolutely love how he's developed a whole story line on top of canon. Whilst it is admittedly a bit grandiose, Harry fighting for the good of the entire universe, it still is incredibly refreshing especially as most fanfiction doesn't stray far away from the main Canon story line. This has always been one my favourite things about Joe's stories and remains true for the entirety of this trilogy.

I do have a little niggle though. I wish he had spent more time in the countless worlds Harry passes through in Book 2. They're touched on and alluded too but only 1 or 2 are ever directly shown to us in the story for a significant length of time. It feels like a waste of what could have potentially been an open invitation to explore countless worlds and seeing Harry grow into the man he became rather than effectively time skipping for 100 years.

The first book does a great job of pulling the story line away from canon and building the foundations for the AU that it eventually becomes. There's some great character development with Harry as well as some great action and fight scenes. Joe builds the suspense of the story masterfully and starts setting up the plot points for book 2 and 3. The only thing that I would say is truly lacking from the book is any development of both Ginny's character and their relationship. It would have been fine if not for how important Ginny becomes later in the trilogy. Reading through the rest of the series you have Harry being hopelessly devoted to her to the point where he abstains from any other women for over 100 years. However with the lack of setup of their relationship it just feels a bit odd and doesn't make much sense. This is only more noticeable in Book 3 as there are multiple scenes that are trying to be romantic only for them to flat because the characters have no real prior relationship before-hand and so it feels forced.

Whilst I really enjoyed Book 1, Book 2 is definitely the high point of the trilogy. You have a great over-arching plot line that has been setup in Book 1 combined with a new AU with fantastic character interactions and a great enemy. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book and it was overall just a fantastic read.

Book 3 however has been a bit of a struggle to read. It still has a fantastic over-arching plot and the fight developing between Harry and Voldemort is well set-up as are the measures Harry is taking. The sheer imagination, as always with Joe's work, is still there as well, with the story not being limited to 3 locations in Britain, but instead taking place all over the world.

However as mentioned before this book seems incredibly hampered by the requirement of Ginny and their relationship being a major part of the story. Harry is meant to be so in love with her that their love is a power that can't matched which means that there needs to be multiple scenes between the two where this love can flourish and can be shown. Joe knows this and so we do indeed have scene upon scene of Harry and Ginny together but it just doesn't seem to work for multiple reasons.

Harry at this point is around 120 years old and Ginny is 16 and you can definitely tell. Ginny comes across as immature in a lot of their conversations and that's a bit unfair to say because she is meant to be 16 and of course she'll have her immature moments. However that is what makes the relationship between them feel so unnatural, Harry has the maturity of an adult that only comes from many years of life and Ginny doesn't. A relationship is meant to be made of 2 equals and Harry and Ginny are no longer equal and it is often glaringly noticeable.

It's so glaringly noticeable and almost uncomfortable that I'm having trouble finishing the book. I know the final showdown will involve the love of Harry and Ginny and that we multiple scenes of them together to sit through before we get there and I don't particularly wan't to read them all. It's a real shame because I've loved this series up to this point and this one problem is making it glaringly hard to read.

Even with that all though I'm still a big fan of this series simply because of the strengths of Book 1 and 2. Whilst Book 3 has its problems and it is noticeable throughout that this is Joe's first story they're still an incredible tale with a scope that is unmatched in fanfiction. If it's a choice between a story of this scope and imagination and another canon rehash with Lord Potter vs Dumbles then give me something like this every time. Definitely one of the must reads of the fandom.

That ended up being a bit longer than I thought it would ! Well done if you made it this far. If you're still here then please let me know your thoughts either about this trilogy or anything else you're reading at the moment!
