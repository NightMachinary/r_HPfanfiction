  Again, I feel like this is one of the few fanfics where it's actually genuine, where it makes complete sense, and where I would say "Yeah, if I were in that position, I would feel that way too," however, it was still too much for me at times and I had to take a break.

For sure. I feel like with both this and the quasi-philosophical language you mentioned earlier, Joe got a lot better in his newer stories, you can see how he's still slightly unrefined in this trilogy and it definitely shows.

  Not much I'll say here except, you can do it! The final several chapters are worth it, in my opinion :)

Haha I do definitely plan on finishing it, but as you said, I'm just having to take multiple breaks to get through it.

Yeah I definitely agree, this is a fantastic trilogy and I think as a series might be unmatched in the fandom just for the sheer depth and quality of the writing. Whilst there might be an individual fic that surpasses them I can't think of many series that maintain the same level of quality throughout.
