I /just/ finished the 3rd book, and I have very similar views as you. (If you're curious, see [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5xz12x/spoilers_sword_of_the_hero_trilogy/][this post]], which I made a few days ago after I finished book 1 and was asking for help figuring out if I should finish the series. Note that there is one comment I made which has spoilers for the end of book 3, but I marked it clearly.)

The rest of my comment will be from the point of view of someone who is part-way through book 3 but not finished it yet, so that we avoid spoilers:

I've been looking for a way to explain my issues with Ginny as well, and I think your analysis is spot on:

  The only thing that I would say is truly lacking from the book is any development of both Ginny's character and their relationship. It would have been fine if not for how important Ginny becomes later in the trilogy.

I love Harry/Ginny fics, some of them are done so well, but at least for the first 2 and a half books or so, I wanted to see a lot more of Harry/Ginny. Ginny is his heart, his soul, his fire, and his anchor, but there hasn't been much showing the relationship between them.

Anyway, I agree that book 2 was the most..."epic"? of them all. However, I personally preferred book 3 simply because I'm more comfortable with fics where he's back home, fucking shit up.

You also said this:

#+begin_quote
  I know the final showdown will involve the love of Harry and Ginny and that we multiple scenes of them together to sit through before we get there and I don't particularly wan't to read them all.
#+end_quote

Not much I'll say here except, you can do it! The final several chapters are worth it, in my opinion :)

Another opinion I'll voice is that there's a /bit/ too much of the weird mystic chapter headers and quasi-philosophical language and intermissions that go like so:

#+begin_quote
  Love. Power. We last left off with our hero about to [...]. But such is the way. Here he was, both mortal and immortal. Evil but pure. Kind but powerful. Tall yet short. Harmonious yet sanctimonious. Imprisoned yet free. Nothing would separate him from his power---he was an Eagle, the Hope of the Earth, the Darkslayer. Grim Reaper. Death reincarnate. The embodiment of life.
#+end_quote

...and so on. You know what I mean.

One other minor thing that annoyed me to no end was the weird grammar and incorrect spelling at times. *Now don't get me wrong*: in general, I don't care too much about minor spelling issues in fanfics. *BUT*, when the story is so incredibly fascinating and well-written, with the author's powerful grasp of language and making the reader feel truly part of the story, it's simply surprising and a bit heartbreaking when I see "their" instead of "there" and it throws me off.

One aspect that I felt was very genuine and honest, but I /personally/ didn't like it, was Harry's amount of angst, especially throughout the first two books. In most fanfics, Harry is somewhat happy for a good portion of it, still having fun sometimes and so on. But I felt like during the /entire/ first two books (and about the same with the third as well), he was always

#+begin_quote
  depressed. He wanted to end his life. His only purpose in life was to kill Voldemort [or whatever]. Even Ginny couldn't hold onto him. etc etc
#+end_quote

Again, I feel like this is one of the few fanfics where it's actually genuine, where it makes complete sense, and where I would say "Yeah, if I were in that position, I would feel that way too," however, it was still too much for me at times and I had to take a break.

Overall, the trilogy was just incredible. I've only read three or so other fics that have made me feel this attached to the story, and that have had such... scary symbolisms, impressive parallels, and moments that made me say "OH MY GOSH :O ".
