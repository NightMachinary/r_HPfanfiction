Something I'd like to Discuss:

What's up with 8th year post-war stories in which Draco returns to Hogwarts. What are these authors smoking? If I have to read one more story in which Draco just returns to Hogwarts with a throwaway line like "Harry spoke in favour of Draco at the trial" I'm going to throw a fit.

Sure, whatever, I can imagine Draco getting a light sentence, maybe even avoid Azkaban... maybe Community Service? I don't know... but the idea that he'd ever be allowed to enter Hogwarts Grounds in his life ever again is so beyond ludicrous, I don't have words. *He lead a bunch of terrorists and murderers into a school full of children in order to assassinate the Headmaster*. If you don't get expelled for trying to murder the Headmaster of the school I'm really not sure about the world you're trying to craft there.
