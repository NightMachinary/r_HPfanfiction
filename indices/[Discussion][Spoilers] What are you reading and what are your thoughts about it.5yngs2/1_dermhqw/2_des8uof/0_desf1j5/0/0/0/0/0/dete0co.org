To be fair, that seems to be a pattern for that poster.

As for the original comment, there are a hundred or so stories on my watchlist but only about 20-30 are updated with any regularity. If it goes 3 months without an update, unless it is a really good fic, I drop it.

Most recently, I perused through DZ2 and Quatermass' latest stuff, since the latter at least has similar fandoms to me. I am just unutterably frustrated by those authors' inability to actually finish a goddamn story. So many fun ideas left to wither and die on the vine. In the case of DZ2, I swear his Autotext fills in the first four chaps of his stories, and all he does is write a new prologue and then slap "Keep reading to find out" at the end of chapters.

As for stuff I enjoy reading, In All Things Balance has been interesting as a SW crossover. I also have been enjoying The Mountain's Range, a SI GoT where the SI takes over Gregor Clegane pre-Hound burning. As for full HP fandom, Not even a first chance! by senawario is an interesting interpretation of Harry-goes-back-in-time fics. I have also been reading and enjoying Basilisk-born by Ebenbild and Stargon1's Cupboard series.

Wow, this turned into a giant essay.
