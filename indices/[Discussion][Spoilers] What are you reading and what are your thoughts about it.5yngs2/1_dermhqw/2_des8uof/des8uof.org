This has absolutely nothing to do with OP's question or the purpose of this thread, but you'll still get dozens of upvotes from people who agree with your rant. This seems to be an interesting thing in this sub. Almost every thread has a rant comment, and that comment seems to be always well upvoted. Interesting . . .
