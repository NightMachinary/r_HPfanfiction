I agree that it's unlikely but idk if it rises to "ludicrous." Draco was a minor when he did those things and under EXTREME DURESS from a dark lord who was living in his house and who (is this just fanon?) threatened his family. Those extenuating circumstances plus therapy and community service would be enough to go back to school in most western countries.
