He poisoned a student while attempting to murder a third, who happened to be a high ranking member of parliament and the international community. He also horrifically cursed another student, also while attempting murder. He lead a band of murdering psychopaths into a school full of children. He attempted to cast an illegal curse that carries a life sentence on a fellow student. He /successfully/ cast - and maintained for months - a different illegal curse that also carries a life sentence.

It is ludicrous.

ETA: he poisoned one, cursed another.
