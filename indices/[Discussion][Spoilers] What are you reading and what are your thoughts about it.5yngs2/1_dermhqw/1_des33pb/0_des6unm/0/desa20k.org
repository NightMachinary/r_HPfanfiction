Right but Duress is the important part. If someone puts a gun to your head and says to kill another person and you do it, in the US at least you'd be innocent of the murder. What I'm saying is I have no idea of the wizarding judicial system, but if they are anything like the US, assuming Draco proved Duress, he'd be innocent.
