Let's assume that the magical legal system is pretty similar to the British legal system for the most part. Minors can be charged as adults for grave crimes.

Duress needs four points to be met to be allowed as a defence:

1. The threat must be of serious bodily harm or death

2. The threatened harm must be greater than the harm caused by the crime

3. The threat must be immediate and inescapable

4. The defendant must have become involved in the situation through no fault of his own

Let's ignore the fact that not only was there no explicit threat made, that the only harm that could come was if Draco failed his task and was caught, and that Draco actually bragged about his assignment. We'll, for the sake of argument, ignore points one and two.

The threat was neither immediate or inescapable. Draco spent a year trying to kill Dumbledore while committing a litany of other crimes. Ample time to go to the aurors. While that might have got him killed for betraying his master, that leads us to number four.

Draco was a death eater. All evidence points to this being something he has strived for for a long time. No evidence is available that suggests that he was forced to join the death eaters - even if he did come to regret his decision. He was seen to be quite proud of it in fact.

In my opinion he doesn't qualify for any of the points that are needed for duress to be accepted.

All of that's moot because duress is not accepted as a defence against attempted murder in Britain.

Even if he somehow managed to get away with no prison time (as he did in canon), I can't see him being allowed back at school; in no small part because of the risk to his safety.

We have to assume that the majority of people returning for the '98-'99 school year are/were against Voldemort. A prominent peer who was a death eater, who took part in death eater activities (including torture) and presumably took some part in the torture of his fellow students, would have a pretty big target on his back for reprisals.
