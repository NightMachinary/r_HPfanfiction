What if they said kill this specific person or we'll kill you, and you decided that the best way to kill them was to force other people to hand deliver anthrax to the intended victim? When that didn't work you decide your /only/ option was to release sarin gas into the building where they work and hope they die?

Surely at some point it stops being okay, right?
