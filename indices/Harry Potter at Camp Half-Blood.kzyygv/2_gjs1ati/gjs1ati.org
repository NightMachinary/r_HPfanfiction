Every time someone asks for HP/PJO crossovers I reference them to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8665858/1/When-Wand-and-Sword-Collide][When Wand and Sword Collide]] You need only read the chapter titles to know it's quality. It isn't the best fic ever, but it's the best Percy Jackson crossover I've ever read.
