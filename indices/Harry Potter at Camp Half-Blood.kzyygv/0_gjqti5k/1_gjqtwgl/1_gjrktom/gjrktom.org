While that is annoying, I feel like the bigger problem is the complete lack in plot variety. It seems like the vast majority of the fics I've seen use the same few plots:

- Percy is betrayed by everyone, gets strong, and comes back to overthrow everyone who betrayed him.

- Guardian of the Hunt and other forced Percy/Artemis plots.

- High school, coffee shop, and weird soul mate AUs.

And maybe one or two others that are slipping my mind, but I think that's about it.

And it might be fine if you enjoy those types of stories, but I got very tired of the first two after reading them a few times, and the third has never held any interest for me.
