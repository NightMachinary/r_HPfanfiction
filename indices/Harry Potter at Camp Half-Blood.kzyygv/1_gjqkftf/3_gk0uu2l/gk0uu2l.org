Ugh, I tried reading this because it was so frequently recc'd, and I didn't finish it. It was just so... boring. Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series (nothing wrong with it, it just didn't resonate with me), but it's a long, child-focused fic without any real stakes beyond one or two scenes. It's just child Harry flouncing around the Percy Jackson universe and nothing interesting happens.
