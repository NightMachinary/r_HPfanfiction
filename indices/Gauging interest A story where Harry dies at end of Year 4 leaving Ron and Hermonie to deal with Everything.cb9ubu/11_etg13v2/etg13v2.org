I'm going against the grain here, so my one input might be hated in this thread.

I don't think that sounds interesting at all. Most of your points sound rather ridiculous to me, and will make zero sense in a story. I don't like the character of Ron on a good day, but following a story where he'd have to do everything just doesn't sound like him.

Why would Sirius give his stuff to Ron, and not say, Remus? Or literally any one else? Maybe Andromeda?

I don't think the story will get much traction at all.
