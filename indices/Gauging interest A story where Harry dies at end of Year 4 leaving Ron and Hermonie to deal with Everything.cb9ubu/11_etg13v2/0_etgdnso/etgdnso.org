That's fine.

That's fine, regarding you not finding it interesting or liking Ron. Yeah he's not doing everything he's got Hermione and the team backing him up.

Sirius isn't giving his stuff to Ron, Sirius is leveraging the position of the Lord of House Black.... Doesn't mean Ron will get Sirius' stuff or even wants it. If that's where your mind went, no wonder you think it's ridiculous.

Yeah it's more just to see if people have feed back.
