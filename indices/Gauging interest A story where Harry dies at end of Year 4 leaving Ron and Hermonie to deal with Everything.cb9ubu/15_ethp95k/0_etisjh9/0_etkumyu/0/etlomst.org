Draco Malfoy is a prat, everyone knows he's a prat, everyone sees he's a prat but he's also the son of Lucius, and Lucius is a well off individual who can get them things. So what do they do? They suck up to Draco and look the other way when he's a prat, with literaly only one or two exceptions and thsoe are people who either don't care about the money (Crouch Jr. disgused as Moody) or are more powerful (Dumbledore).

A TITLE can get you things, or at least the promise of things
