That's not even REMOTELY the same. Nobody would follow Draco Malfoy if he rallied to battle; in canon you see at least Crabbe and possibly Goyle pretty much overturning him and refusing to go along with him at the end. That's the problem with bribery; it doesn't get you loyalty, all it does is give you fair-weather friends who desert you as soon as you can't give them what they want anymore.... or your demands on them are too high for any reward they might hope for.

A fourteen year old boy who just gets a title thrust upon him is not going to inspire anyone to follow him in battle. There might be plenty of people who try to exploit him, if he suddenly gets rich, but these people wouldn't fight for him.

If people don't rally behind DUMBLEDORE, they won't rally behind RON, no matter how much of a Lord he is.

People have much better reasons to rally behind Dumbledore; he's a legitimately powerful wizard who has defeated at least one Dark wizard before; he's been around for over a century and he knows a lot of people and has personal connections and friends in many places. Being on his side makes a lot more sense.

Even rallying behind Harry makes more sense, even without a title. After all, he HAS defeated Voldemort before, even if he's a snot-nosed teen at least he has some accomplishments under his belt that makes it at least SOMEWHAT more plausible that people would throw their lot in with him.

But Ron? It's fourth year. What's RON accomplished? People who know him personally are going to know that he's a brave and steadfast guy, if a little insensitive and snarky... but he hasn't really DONE much to inspire loyalty. A lordship would not change that, especially since he did nothing to earn the title.
