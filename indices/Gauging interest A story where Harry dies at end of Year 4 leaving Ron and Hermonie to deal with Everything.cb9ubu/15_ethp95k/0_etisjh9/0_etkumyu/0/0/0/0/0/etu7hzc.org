Money is one way, influence and the promise of favors is also another way. I'd point you to the new swamp thing series, the main villain of the first 7 episodes is in deep debt but he uses the promises of his influence and ability to make things happen as well as money he's shifting around from one source to another but he, himself doesn't own. having money, or appearing to, is one part of a large puzzle. I didn't say it was.

Yep, part of the struggle is to get the recongition of that name up and recongized for it's potential. Ron has no slanders to his name, infact that articles by Rita in canon paint him as a victim(of the Hermione situation) or a not involved 3rd party to Harry's antics . He's a clean slate to do whatever you want with.

If...but I again never said it was. Never said her skills with magic, but her intellect applied to playing on people's desires. That's fine that you think that.

Yeah, you and several others have said this before in this thread, I'm going to keep saying no. Okay, so give me a suggestion on how Ron and Hermione ,with the idea Dumbledore has been disgraced publicly and harry is dead, could gather people to their side at the start of Year 5? Because this is mine. Or I have planned out idea and you're not exactly seeing it, I do like the idea of Ron becoming more than he is in canon, especially Cursed Child(retired from being an Auror, after revolutionizing it with harry, to run the joke shop?! REALLY!). But at the same time him becoming "Lord" Ron isn't it, but a conclusion I came to based on "What is there that is specifically Ron's that could get himself that Harry or Hermonie couldn't in his place?" and lead of House black was it and to put some spin on it to make it more grandiose idea I played up the nobility part of it that has always been in the name canonically. If you don't like it, that's fine but I'm not going to change it.
