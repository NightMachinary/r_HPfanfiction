Yeah...notice I never said Loyalty? notice I never said they'd always be around? Just that they suck up to him. He commands enough surface level "respect" because of the promise of what they can get him, his perosnality is why they are so fair-weather, because he sucks as a person when he was 14.

Who said it's thrust upon him? Yeah and that's where Hermione comes in, she is going to help him sort those who could be beneficial to him on terms of long term gains vs flighty social manipulators who just want the money. You don't need everyone to fight for you but if they can supply weapons, if they can supply artifacts, ingredients, medicines and ritual books, if they can spare a favor to have someone to look away for an hour on something they'd otherwise crack down on. Those things can be beneficial to making a strong, effective but small group of basically guerrilla fighters.

You're viewing it from the eyes of the audience, in the universe itself : Dumbledore is a kook who has lost his edge and his mind in his older age and has been going on about Voldermort for over a decade to the point he got Harry wrapped up in it. His name is dragged through the mud at the beginning of the canon events of Year 5, they get him removed from several positions of prominence and it's only because Harry lived and went to help Sirius does Voldermort end up getting exposed at the end of Year 5 to the ministry in an undeniable way. So who'd follow him?

Yep but he's dead.

Yeah and that's the point harry's dead, Dumbledore is getting his name dragged through mud, it's up to Ron and Hermione using the tile of the lord of house black and their wits and skills as magic user to right this ship enough to pull through and prepare for a battle, it's not going to be easy. Except he does earn it.
