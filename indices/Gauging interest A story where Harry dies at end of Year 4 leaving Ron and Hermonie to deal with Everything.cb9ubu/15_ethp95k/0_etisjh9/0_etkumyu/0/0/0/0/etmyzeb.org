None of what you say necessitates a lordship or any kind of title. From the sound of it, it's the money that's actually important here. The MONEY could buy artifacts, ingredients, medicines and ritual books, the MONEY could get people to look away for half an hour. I just don't see that the title adds anything at all to this. A lordship isn't some magic that makes people immediately respect a boy of fourteen.

If Dumbledore is a kook who had lost his edge and Harry is untrustworthy, then there's NO reason a teenage boy who was a perfect nobody until very recently would be viewed any more favourably. He could call himself "Lord Black" all he wanted, but he would still be nothing more than a child and an inexperienced upstart with no merits or connections to his name. If they won't follow Dumbledore, they won't follow Ron.

If he throws money at them, then it'll be the money that buys them, not the title. If Hermione's skills with magic win the day, that won't have anything to do with Ron being a lord. So I think the entire title is totally superfluous and would just clutter up what otherwise might be an interesting story. There's nothing the title accomplishes that couldn't be done just as well without, so to me it just seems pointless to even start messing about with titles and lordships.

Titles and lordships are hardly ever used well in fanfic; and it's even rarer that they're used well in HP fanfic. So I would strongly encourage you to drop the lordship unless it absolutely can't be avoided. In this case, it just seems like an afterthought that's just there because you like the sound of calling Ron "Lord."
