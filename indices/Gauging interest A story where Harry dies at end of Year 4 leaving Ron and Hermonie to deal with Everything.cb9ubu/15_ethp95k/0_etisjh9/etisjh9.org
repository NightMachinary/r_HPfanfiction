Without Harry on the board, why would people follow Ron and Hermione into battle? What would draw people to Hermoine, a smart "mud blood" and Ron, the youngest son of a poor house?

Mind you, i'm not talking about just friends and those in the Order of the Phoenix or something but the general public , even Dumbledore at the point of Year 5's opening isn't really believed as a pillar of the Wizard community. to top it off it's Harry's trust of him, along side Hermione's push to train them that pulls together Dumbledore's Army, with the intention of Harry teaching them how to fight a dark wizard. You need an Excalibur type solution of a thing no one can deny makes a person right to lead for this type of situation, and this is mine.
