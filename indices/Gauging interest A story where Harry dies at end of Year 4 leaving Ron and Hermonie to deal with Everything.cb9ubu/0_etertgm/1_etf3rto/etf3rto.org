You could have sirus make Ron the Inheritor of his estate

the black fortune is rather sizable and having a worthy successor would mean the money would go to a trust worthy person

Instead of the whole Lordship thing, it could be sirius Growing into his Role as a black and starting to throw his last name around to get things down sort of like how lucius uses his last name and wealth to get things he wants to get done
