Indeed, Dumbledore and Voldemort are roughly equal in general combat ability. In the Ministry, Dumbledore had a phoenix to let him teleport, but he was also protecting Harry. Also, Dumbledore's goal was not to kill Voldemort, since that would only delay him a little; rather, it was to expose Voldemort's return to the Ministry.

However, both Voldemort and Dumbledore have both been shown defeating large numbers of lesser opponents like Aurors and Death Eaters with barely any effort. It's also telling that Voldemort didn't take over the Ministry until Dumbledore died, but took over shortly after: absent various prophecies, brother wands, and similar outliers, it takes an uberwizard to counter an uberwizard. Nothing less will do.
