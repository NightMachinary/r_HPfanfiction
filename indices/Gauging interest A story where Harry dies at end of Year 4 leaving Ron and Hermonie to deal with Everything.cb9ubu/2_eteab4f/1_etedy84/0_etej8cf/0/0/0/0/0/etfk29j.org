  Killing this body and exposing the remains to the ministry ( as long as he doesn't dust like he did in the finale battle) would work just as good, unless for some reason they'd have reason to doubt the body of Voldermort is the body in front of them. Also even just destroying/cutting off his main wand using arm would also cause the same effect.

A corpse is easily dismissed as a Transfigured forgery. He needed people to see Voldemort alive and fighting.

  Yeah that's part of the reason Harry's death is such a big deal because even Dumbledore kind of relied on Harry to pull through til the end, until he was ready to face Voldermort like he did in Hogwarts

Right. Which brings us back to my original point that short of prophecy and wandlore shenanigans, a wizard like Dumbledore or Voldemort can't be sidelined by the Ministry if he isn't willing to be.
