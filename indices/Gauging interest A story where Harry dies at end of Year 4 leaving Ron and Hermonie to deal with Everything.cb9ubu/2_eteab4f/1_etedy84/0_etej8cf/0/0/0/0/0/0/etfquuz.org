No but acting publicly will draw the attention to the other "uberwizard" as you've put it. If Dumbledore makes a public fuss trying to expose the cover up on harry's death, then Voldermort knows where he is and where he isn't and can thus act on that information(say raid hogwarts). Same if Voldemort attacks a place, Dumbledore would probably use a floo to come and help with the ministry. Which is why Voldermort would probably secure the Ministry first before acting with a still alive Dumbledore. So, They're technically sidelining each other as either exposing themselves will leave them open for the other to act according to their own schemes more so than the Ministry sidelining.
