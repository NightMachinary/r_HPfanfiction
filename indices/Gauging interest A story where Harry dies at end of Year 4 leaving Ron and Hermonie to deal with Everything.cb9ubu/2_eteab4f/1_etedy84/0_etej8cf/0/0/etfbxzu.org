Note: The ones who come to arrest him,.

I don't believe that he's that powerful. I'm of the opinion that Albus was losing his edge but even a slightly dull blade is still powerful if used right. so he focused on using himself when he could be the most impactful to seem like he didn't lose a step. His duel against voldemort while even has voldemort did flee, notice how Dumbledore seemed to be almost focusing his whole body into spells but even then they were all seemingly meant to delay & restrain ? Not disable? Or even destroy? He had come to counter Tom long enough for the aurors to arrive, but I viewed the duel as Dumbledore showing he can't destory Tom by himself in a duel. (referring to voldemort as Tom because it's easier to type while commuting)
