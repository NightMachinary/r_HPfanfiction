It's worth remembering that Dumbledore only obeys the Ministry as long as he feels it is prudent to do so, and not a minute longer. Remember what happens when aurors come to arrest him?

Wizards like himself and Voldemort can defeat virtually any number of lesser opponents and can basically force their will on the broader society, if they are so inclined and don't have another uberwizard opposing them. In fact, Voldemort's takeover of the Ministry in DH wasn't subtle politicking. He just used brute magical force to murder his way down the list of Ministry officials who could oppose him (Bones, Scrimegour, and many unnamed others), then, when he no longer had a fellow uberwizard Dumbledore to worry about, he just had someone Imperius the next person in line.

With Harry dead, Dumbledore might not be in the mood to play petty politics.
