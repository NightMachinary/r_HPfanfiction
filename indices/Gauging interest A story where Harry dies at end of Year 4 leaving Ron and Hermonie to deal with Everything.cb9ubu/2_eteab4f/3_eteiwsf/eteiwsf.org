The politcal pull of a lordship is highly understated and rather misused imo , especially since unlike other stories where Harry becomes a Lord, this is Ron. He doesnt have the masses on his side, nor would he be able to win them simply on the premise of being Harry's friend. Ron also being the 6th child and 6th son would be looked down on by snobs & blood purist who don't agree with V but weren't swayed by Harry. Even Dumbledore would probably be more hesitant to back Ron Sans Harry without something to assure him. That's why I put in place. I can understand the hesitation.

As for Draco: Becomong lord of his own house is a notable shift than him inheriting his father's lordship, it's also allows him greater freedom as he no longer has to worry about his family's dealings and promises made by his father he has to upkeep or will threaten its stability. It's seems like a lateral move but is him winning his freedom by not just simply doing what his father tells him without giving his life style up as he'd be a Lord. That's how I'm proposing it, if you aren't a fan I understand.

Edit: also after double checking, Lucius Malfoy, while a powerful man of a notably powerful house, isn't a Lord formerly, so it'd actually be him exceeding his father's designs.
