This sounds like an interesting story, especially for Ron...question though: Can you do it with that whole Lordship bullcrap just cut clean out? Make a neat little incision and cut that bullet out. Seriously, what, do fanfic authors think it HAS to be there or something? What do you get out of it narratively or whatever that you can't get from keeping things normal and canon? It's just so goddamn dumb and irritating to see everywhere, even where it has no reason to be!

I mean hell, I don't think Draco is "staking his claim out of his father's shadow" by BECOMING LORD OF HIS HOUSE. That's literally like, becoming his father himself. It's dumb. Just stop it.
