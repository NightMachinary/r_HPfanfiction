This. Whole milieu of HP universe is bourgeois, middle class, heroes are mostly businessmen, tradesmen, bureaucrats, that sort of people. Aside from Malfoys we really don't see anybody who even behaves in aristocratic manner (notice, that even Blacks for all its declared nobility lived in one house in the middle of London, no manor house is ever mentioned). *Nobody* (including Malfoys) ever claims any degree of actual nobility (the only lord in whole story is Lord Voldemort and that's just fancy name, nothing actually meaning anything). Ever mentioning of actual nobility is when Hermione (and Remus) just mentions that The Half-Blood Prince being actual prince is a nonsense, because “there are no princes in the Wizarding world!” (OK, princes doesn't mean nobles, but still, it does sound irritated enough to be completely out of character for the wizarding world to even think about such things).

Yes, it is technically possible (or even probable), that at least some posts on Wizengamot are hereditary, but remember we are talking about community of some ten thousand of people, there is not enough of anything to acquire astronomical wealth and grandeur. Wizengamot is more like a town council, not The Houses of Parliament.

In the very moment you say the phrase “Lord Potter” (or even worse Lord Weasley), you are getting massively AU, and you have to basically make a complete whole alternative world to the one JKR made. Wouldn't it be better to switch to some other fandom?
