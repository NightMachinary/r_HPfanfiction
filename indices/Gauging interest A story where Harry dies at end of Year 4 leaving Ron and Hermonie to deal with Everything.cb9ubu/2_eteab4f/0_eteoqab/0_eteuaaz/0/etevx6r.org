You are not British, right? In the standard class-based societies (as UK used to be not that long ago, and perhaps it still is, but US never was) it really doesn't matter how rich you are, but really whether you are of noble birth or not. It took usually couple of generations before very rich middle class businessmen could dream about becoming actual nobility.
