Well, we don't even know how well off he was. Certified in the books is one vault with enough money to get through Hogwarts, and one destroyed inhabitable house in the Godric's Hollow (which may be some kind of national monument, not sure whether Harry could move in, if he wants). Then he got from Sirius one large house in London and possibly a vault in Gringotts (and he doesn't have it in the start of your story; and we don't whether for example Walburga didn't give most of her money to the Lord Voldemort in the First Wizarding War). He is probably not poor, but we really don't know exactly, how much he has. There is no canonical indication he would exceptionally wealthy (like in half fanfic stories, who consider it).
