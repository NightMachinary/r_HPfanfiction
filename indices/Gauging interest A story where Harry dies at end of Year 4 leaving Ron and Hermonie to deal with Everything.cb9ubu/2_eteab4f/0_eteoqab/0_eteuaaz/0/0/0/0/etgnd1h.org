Philisopher's stone states that harry inherited a small fortune, as when Griphook opened the vault it's stated that:

  Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.

As the price of Gold alone was 350 USD pre troy ounce (31 grams) in 1993, and the common gold bar is 400 Troy Ounces, even if a pile of gold and silver and bronze only contains 5 of them , that's over half a million USD at the time. Nevermind everything else.

And this is after his mother and father's years of not working because of them trying to fight Voldermort's rule with the Order. It's also came out that Fleamont, had quadrupled the family's money in the 1900s to the point James didn't need to worry about getting a well paying job (source [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-aol-chat.htm][here from JK ,herself]] ) when passed down in 1979, a year before Harry's birth. Overall Harry should be decently rich, not Malfoy level but definitely able to go without working without an issue. He also is shown to be cavalier with his money during his first few years , like buying the whole cart's sweets.
