  not exactly scientific measurement

Yes it's not, that's why I'm not trying to go off the words but what could be mixed in. even if it was only one pile 3 feet wide pile at chest height for harry that's still a notable amount of money both in our and the wizarding world.

  Yes, I am highly sceptical to whatever JKR said outside of the books (vanishing of one's excrements?), especially concerning any numbers (she seems to be almost having dyscalculia in her statements).

Yeah she's clearly not always thinking when she puts informaiton like that out there. Then let's take it inside the books, it's said that harry has a small fortune and at no point during the 7 books or even Cursed Child is money said to been an object/issue for him at any point after he learns what's in the vault. He doesn't even seem shocked when the 1000 galleons pot is brought up for winning the Triwizard cup.
