Well, â€œmounds of gold coins" is not exactly scientific measurement, especially through eyes of eleven year old, who never seen a piece of money in his life. Also, there is that huge question of the value of a Galleon INSIDE of the wizarding economy (certainly Lord Potter didn't move all his money to GBP and lived in the muggle economy, so conversion to GBP is mostly irrelevant for estimating the value of his vault inside of the wizarding economy). Yes, I am highly sceptical to whatever JKR said outside of the books (vanishing of one's excrements?), especially concerning any numbers (she seems to be almost having dyscalculia in her statements). Who eleven years old risen up as poor orphan without any money management education whatsoever given decent amount of money thirsting for friendship and affection wouldn't be very cavalier with his money?
