The whole miliue is wrecked when you remember: Harry is rather well off after he is found by Hagrid to the point he possibly never needs to work a day in his life if he used his money right that he inherited as the last member of House Potter and more so with his inheritance from House Black when Sirius is killed. This is diving into the realm of needing the nobles on aristocratic types on board just as much as the middle class and maybe the lower class as well. Ron becoming a reluctant arisotract to appease the upper class to get them on their side.

It is an AU already with the title character of the franchise dying during the middle point of the franchise. The claiming of House Black is more a means to the end of finding another solution that isn't somehow Ron and Hermonie besting Voldemort in the same fashion Harry did/tried.

As for your Fandom question : not many have such an interesting place to start from where the main character almost died and if they'd do, it would fall to the remaining heroes to basically pick the slack in a way that isn't just "train how they did" but find different solution.

Lord Potter/Weasley aren't the goal, a leader who uses the black name, a name significant and ancient to stand against Voldemort. It's a two prong thing of making the Black name change(from blood purists/supremacist views) with this new Era under its new head. Also a Banner for the people of the public to rally behind. Lord Black is more of a nickname than what the positiom the winner would hold.
