I was pretty much going to shoot for that for the most part, the traditional lords and ladies of Britain in the late 20th century (and today) is lesser than it was once was in terms of importance. It's basically going to be treated as high society + a title, more than traditional "my lord/my lady I 'd humbly request" stuff except for those who are pretty much begging for favor and think the character who is lord of house black can help them.

Ron or Draco's going to be the only lord active in the story outside of a ghost here or there who was a lord in life.
