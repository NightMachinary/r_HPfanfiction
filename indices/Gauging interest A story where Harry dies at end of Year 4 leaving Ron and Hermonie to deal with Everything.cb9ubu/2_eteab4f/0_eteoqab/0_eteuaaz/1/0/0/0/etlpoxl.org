House Potter was never given a noble decree nor where they never refered in text or in supplement materials release by JK or through pottemore as noble...BLACK however was known both in and out of text as a noble house from the title "most noble and ancient house" to interviews where JK will say "The Noble House of Black". Overall it notes there's nobility in the name Black.
