  The whole miliue is wrecked when you remember: Harry is rather well off after he is found by Hagrid to the point he possibly never needs to work a day in his life if he used his money right that he inherited as the last member of House Potter and more so with his inheritance from House Black when Sirius is killed.

Harry inherited his money from a wealthy relative some generations back, he's not actual nobility.

The Blacks are literally the only ones to call their last name a house, and even that was Sirius being sarcastic.
