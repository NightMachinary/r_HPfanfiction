I would read it for the following reasons: Ron being the main character, you're right that he doesn't get enough love, and seeing how his whole thing is about getting out of both Harry and his families shadow, him becoming the hero would be interesting to read. Sirius helping Ron through his grief, they've both lost their best friends, that's perfect right there. The Ministry covering up Harry's death, that is something I can easily see the Ministry doing in canon, and adds another layer to the story of getting the truth revealed.

While I would prefer Hermione to be in the story, I would still read it. But I just think ot would be more interesting to follow the both of them as they deal with their grief differently, before they work together again to help bring down Voldemort. Though I'd actually prefer to see them take down Crouch Jr if he is the one who kills Harry, and leave Voldemort for Dumbledore or something, would make it a much more personal story.

However, no matter how good your story is, no matter how perfectly you capture Ron and Hermione's grief, no matter how interesting and readable your story is, if there is a single mention of any bullshit lordships, family houses/rings/wizengamot seats, or god forbid the fucking phrase "So mote it be", I am out. The lords of the Wizarding world has been done to death, maybe one or two au's about it would have been fine or interesting, but the way it has been somehow established as canon is so irritating when 99% of the way it is done is the most boring and irrelevant crap. Political intrigue is great, give me corrupt politicians desparate to cover up something they think will effect their position, give me the heroes trying to reveal the truth to the public only to be discredited, give me the fallout once the truth is revealed, but do not give me inherited positions or any of that other crap, it's just not interesting.
