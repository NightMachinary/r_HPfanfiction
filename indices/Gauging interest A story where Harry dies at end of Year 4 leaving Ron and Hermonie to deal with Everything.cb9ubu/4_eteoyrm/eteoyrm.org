Using the Lordship trope can be quite hit and miss but I think it's most well used when there is no magical inheritance involved. Taking the fight into the wizengamot can create a lot of political intrigue and cloak and dagger type tension. The main problem you would come up with is having Ron claim the title as Siris is still a convicted criminal and would not be able to legally name him as his heir. Draco could but he would have to use some serious subterfuge to convince his father he wasn't doing it to build his own power base, Lucius wouldn't trust him nor think him capable.

Other things to think about:

- Hermione would not stand still after Harry's death. She's a muggleborn and she knows exactly what that means for her if the dark lord rises to power. If she's distancing herself from Ron it's because she's throwing herself into the kind of study she thinks he and his family wouldn't approve of. There are a number of ways this could play out and the diverging paths could mean she ends up as Ron's foil.

- Ginny would not take his death lightly either. Being the absolute firebrand that she is I don't doubt her new life's goal would be to have her vengeance on crouch.

How you chose to resolve other characters reactions to Harry's death is up to you but having more action/darker B plots to contrast against your political A plot will serve to create a lot of dramatic tension and suspense
