That's fair.

The thing is though, you don't have to tell it from Hermione's point of view at all while still keeping her an active player in the story. News and rumours of what she's doing will still reach Ron through their circle of friends. Without Harry and Ron, would she be invited OotP meetings? Will she still trust Dumbledore after he fails to protect Harry? Dropping her from the story rather than having her pursue her own agenda seems off to me but that may not be the majority view.

The other thing to think about is what is Voldemort doing now that the only person he believes can truly defeat him is dead?
