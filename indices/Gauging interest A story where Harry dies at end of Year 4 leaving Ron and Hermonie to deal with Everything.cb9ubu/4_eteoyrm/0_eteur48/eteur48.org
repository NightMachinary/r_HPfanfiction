I thought of who could sponsor and it's going to be interesting to see how people react to the reveal.

Hermonie it's part of the reason why I'm not using her because I'd rather not try to get in her head more than "she researched this, found this and that leads her to believe using laws and text, this is possible, Sirius/Dumbledore/Molly checks it out and determines it right or she's on to something."

Regarding Ginny, know the Wesley's who knew Harry are livid going into this story, Molly most of all.

That's the difficulties, balancing but due to the stakes already being set so high going in.
