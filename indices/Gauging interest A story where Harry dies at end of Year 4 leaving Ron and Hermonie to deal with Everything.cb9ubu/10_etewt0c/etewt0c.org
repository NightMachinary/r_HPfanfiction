  Diving into the various family connections. Since Draco and Ron both are pureblooded, come from branches of family by female heirs and are probably near age to claim lordship of House Black. Sirius seeing power in the name of the ancient house in the upcoming wizard war under a new lord, without a criminal record & Draco wishing to stake his own claim out of his father's shadow.

  Harry did actually die (along with the Horcrux part of himself) , it was Crouch Jr.. Who was able to complete his attack, before Dumbledore and McGonagall could find them.

  Ministry covers up the murder of Harry using the Daily Prophet to "suggest" it was suicide brought on by intense mental stress & that "maybe" it was Harry who killed Cedric, using the Voldermort excuse to cover it. All the while downplaying Crouch's escape & capture as coincidence.
