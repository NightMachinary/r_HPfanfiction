Yeah, don't want to get into that fanon stuff, also that'd no longer be Ron, that'd be some weird OC wearing Ron's skin interacting with some weird OC wearing that character's skin. I want it to be at most Ron apporaching some high born blood purist type going "Hey, hey how's i- /Hermoine behind him clears throat/ I apologize I mean, It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance Sir. I'm Ronald, Lord of House black, but you may call me Ron." /looks at Hermione and she nods in approval/ That type of interaction.

It'd be suspcious, if it didn't fit a narrative already built/can be easily bulit that puts together a picture of a broken boy on his mental limits: He's was abused and mistreated by the Dursleys until the age of 12, He's shown signs of being a parseltongue (while not relevant to his supposed mental illness it may be spun to show he was on a dark path similar to V's), he had been know to hear voices. Ontop of all that isn't it oddly 'suspicious' that all 3 of his previous years he just "happened" to be the one in the center of a mystery involving V's legacy? Also that he just happened to claim at a very public event that Voldermort's back and have the death of his classmate as proof? And, just like they bought the story of Hermione using love potions, or the article that ran right before what would be his death in this story, that Harry was "disturbed and dangerous" with comments from 'concerned classmates' Draco Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, Parkinson and the rest of that group. Rita's Libelous claims & other events has created a prefect storm for the ministry to capitalize on if harry died in a mysterious enough way to cover as suicide and pin the death of Cedric on him as the end result of a boy broken by his life as unlike a book reader, a person reading a random article wouldn't know everything we and his friends know about Harry.

Publicly though: Crouch Jr was captured though and is officially stated to have died in Azkaban (actually his mother in disguise) . So to have him, the son of a high ranking ministry official suddenly appear alive and well, announce to the public he's alive, that he set up things so Cedric died while disguised as a FORMER AUROR AND killed Harry Potter IN HOGWARTS' GROUNDS in the finale of the first triwizards cup in over a hundred years. It'd make the ministry look like fools who couldn't keep one death eater they supposedly captured, nevermind the fact this is after Sirius escaped the year before. Overall it's a horribly bad look, one that you can avoid by making it look like a boy who you can establish is in a weak mental state instead took his own life and life of the classmate. Then just simply Dementor's kiss the Crouch Jr. problem away.

To get on your analogy, as I pointed out above though, they do know he's a bit off mentally and even considered dangerous, according to another Offical's son(Draco).
