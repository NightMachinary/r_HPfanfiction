What I dislike about fanon politicking isn't that, it's child heirs allying with each other and following intricate medieval protocols that never come up in canon that are always the same and always simplified yet tedious. It's the 'Light and Dark' factions, it's the 'well not all Dark-aligned houses are evil', the large quantities of unearned prestige and influence with grandiose titles despite a population of about 10,000, etc.

You needn't worry about spoilers at this stage. Only a small part of your audience would be exposed to them, presumably your plans are still fluid and this idea might not even properly take off. Spoilers only become an issue if it's already exceeded 80,000 words.

A teenage representative of their school with widespread fame killing themselves and then their competitor would be far more suspicious.

The Death Eaters were fanatics, and it was known that not all of them were rounded up. When the public knew Black was at large, they immediately expected him to go after Harry. Since Crouch is uncovered, him having killed the Boy Who Lived is incredibly plausible. Harry saying 'Oh no he's back' can be explained away by confundment or something.

Your analogy isn't quite apt. It's more like (I don't want to use Hitler but he's the first one that comes to mind) if the son of a government official in Germany had said his friend was shot by Hitler, and then a neo-nazi does him in. In a world where several varieties of mind-control exist.

Would they believe that over the son having killed his own friend due to mental issues the public wasn't aware of, and then the son committed suicide (presumably covering up the existence of the neo-nazi in the first place even though he's now dead?)
