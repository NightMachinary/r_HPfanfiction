It's not but I can't explain without spoilers, just know it's going to closer to a Triwizards like set of Trails for Ron & Draco. Not bitter nips and snide political talk.

Part of the whole story is that sometimes information is bogus or used to manipulate people.

A lone death eater killing the boy who lived sounds suspiciously like an assassination, especially after Harry directly is quoted as saying Voldemort has returned. Having it seem like a boy snapped and committed suicide while horrible isn't as alarming to the general public. It's like if someone today said "I have evidence (terrorist here) is active in our country" and the government denies it then the person is killed by someone who claims ties to the same terrorist... Wouldn't that strike the general public as suspect? Compared to the person committing suicide, citing mental instability as a reason.
