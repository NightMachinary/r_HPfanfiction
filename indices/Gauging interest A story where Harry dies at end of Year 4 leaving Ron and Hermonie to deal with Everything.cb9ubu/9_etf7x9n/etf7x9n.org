I like the overall concept, hate the lord stuff (it's really never done well and makes me drop so many fics) and would like it if you actually took a crack at handling Hermione. I saw your comments about it, but I think you could at least explore other methods of keeping it focused on Ron. For example, Hermione could be made into a person of interest by the Ministry and forced into hiding. Her parents could pull her out of Hogwarts. I just can't buy a world where 4th year Ron somehow has incredibly emotional growth and a connection to Sirius, and Hermione is doing fuck-all.
