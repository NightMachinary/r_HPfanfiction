I'd read it! Ideally you'd also flesh out some of the characters who dont get some love- I could see Percy being approached by Ron and having to choose between his military career and his family early, the Sirius/Ron dynamic can be a gateway to get the Order involved, Lavender pops up early, etc.

Also with Harry dead, I feel Ron and Draco's rivalry gets WAY worse, especially if Ron thinks Lucius had a hand in Harry dying. And how does Dumbledore react!

.....definitely write this plz, sounds like a lot of fun
