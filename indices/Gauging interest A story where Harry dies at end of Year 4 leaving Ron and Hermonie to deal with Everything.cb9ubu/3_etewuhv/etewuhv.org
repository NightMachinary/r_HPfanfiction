I /love/ this.

Right until the Lordship noble houses trope, then it stops being a 'what if' and wanders off into Noble Houses AU which has been /done/, all you have is different AU characters rehashing an old, very toroughly explored fanfic story.

But, sticking to actual canon world and jumping off from there, ditching the inheritence storyline entirely, that would be amazing, yes.
