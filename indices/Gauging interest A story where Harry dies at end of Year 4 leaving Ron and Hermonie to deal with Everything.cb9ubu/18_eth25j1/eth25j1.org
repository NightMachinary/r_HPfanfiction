Reminds me a bit of linfffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter), which was excellent, although it ended up focusing a bit more on Percy because Harry died as a baby. But anyway, I definitely like the idea. I'd probably wait to read it until you got through the dark parts--I can appreciate angst, but only as part of a whole, not on its own.
