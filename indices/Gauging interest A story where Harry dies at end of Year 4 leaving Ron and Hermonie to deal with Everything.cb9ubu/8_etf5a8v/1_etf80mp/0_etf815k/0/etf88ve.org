You want an addition to build on my agreement? Here's one for you: every story that hinges on the nonexistent lordship trope is lazy and ultimately unoriginal in fanfiction. Therefore, I would not be interested in reading such a story under any circumstances. My opinion, of course.

Funnily enough, you added even less than I did with my original response, but nice try.
