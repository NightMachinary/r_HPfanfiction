Well people have given their opinions and here are my two cents. I won't dissuade you from a lordship story since that seems to be what you want to write. However, I will give some thoughts on the matter.

A different Ron story that involved lordships and such called Fate has recently started to lose my interest. The plot, writing and characters are still on point but the content has become too bloated with Lord speech. You can say Lord to suck up to people that want to be called Lord but when he starts thinking like that it gets way too boring. You start telling a lie so much that it starts feeling like the truth. People that start of as minor political allies start sucking up to his every need. Basically there is a severe lack of that healthy dose of reality where people are only out for themselves.

What I am saying is that I think you should make a clear dissonance between what Ron thinks and what he actually says. Something like this maybe..

Ron stared at Daphne's father as he introduced himself. He was a normal looking man with no striking features surprisingly, he expected him to be a more imposing figure. Still, he bowed his head and said, "Lord Greengrass" in greeting.
