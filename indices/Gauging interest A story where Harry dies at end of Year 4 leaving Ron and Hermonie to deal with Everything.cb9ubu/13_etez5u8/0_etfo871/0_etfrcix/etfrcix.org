Well I've read fics as bad as Dragon's Garrison because of Ron so I don't think anything is going to stop me from reading and following the story. I myself haven't been burned by Lord Fics nearly half as much as other people here it seems.

I think though that Ron is the kind of person that adapts more easily to these things when it comes to survival. His morals don't overwhelm his pragmatism. I don't remember exactly what happened in the books anymore but when they were attacked in the Cafe I think it was Ron who suggested drastic measures like killing the Death Eaters. Of course, on the flip side he does not hesitate from giving even his friends a dose of reality, politeness be dammed.

I'd love to beta read it if you need anyone. Just have exams next week and then should be free for a while.
