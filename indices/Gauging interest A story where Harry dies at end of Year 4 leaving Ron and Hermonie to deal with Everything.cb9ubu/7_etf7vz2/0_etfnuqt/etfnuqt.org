Thank you

I understand it devovles when not handled properly. I'm not going to make it trade deals or anything but it is going to be something key to the characters.

On Draco, he realized he's relying on his father's name a lot and while he does love and respect his father, He wants to be his own man and do better. He doesn't question his father's motives or think he's wrong at this point but just wants something that no one can say Draco only got it because his dad's money/influence. Because remember almost everything Draco does up until year 5 in story is in some way influenced or assisted by his father.

One thing I feel is downplayed is that: Ron is smart ,he did pass his NEWT with a with "Exceeds Expectations" in several aspect, something only less than 20 students in his year did. He may not be Hermonie or Harry smart but he is intellectually solid. His political capitol will be bulit on the lordship/the house name & money, he may stumble with it and that's expected, but a favor/debt from a lord is worth a lot to the right person and *Hermonie will be helping facilitate.*

Yes, this is a key important factor, but it's also the point he has to try, because really without Harry it's all mayhem.

Not sidelining Hermonie, just to clarify, I'm not going to have her as POV and things are going to be emotionally strained/distant with her and Ron (namely the chemistry they have that becomes overtly romantic in the books isn't going to happen). She will still be an active member of the situation, just clearly keeping Ron at arms's length. Namely interactions will feel more silted/professional/direct. She still cares about Ron, as well as the rest of the Weasely family and that scares the hell out of her because she now knows if Harry can be taken, anyone of her friends can be.
