  On Draco, he realized he's relying on his father's name a lot and while he does love and respect his father, He wants to be his own man and do better. He doesn't question his father's motives or think he's wrong at this point but just wants something that no one can say Draco only got it because his dad's money/influence. Because remember almost everything Draco does up until year 5 in story is in some way influenced or assisted by his father.

Man, I think that's a pretty boring motivation. "Wants to be his own man" is pretty cliched. And I don't think we're ever given any indication that Draco /doesn't/ enjoy all the benefits he gets because of his father's influence. He gloats over the brooms, he gloats about how he'll get Hagrid fired...why does he suddenly want to break away from his dad?
