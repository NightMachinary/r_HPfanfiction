First of all, I like the premise. Potterverse was in a sense designed to revolve around Harry, and removing that element opens it up to many interesting and unconventional storylines.

I concur with most of the posters about the Lordships thing... When an element that is completely absent in canon comes to dominate the storyline, the nominal point of divergence isn't really the important part of the premise anymore.

You might want to think some more about Draco's motivation. Draco has no reason to question his father's views and decisions, and, in fact, Harry's death would vindicate Lucius's teachings in Draco's eyes.

You might also want to consider some logistics around Ron. Him growing into his own is generally a good thing, but keep in mind that he will be 15, with no political skills or connections other than his father and Percy (who thinks things are fine just as they are). Sirius isn't going to make a good mentor either: what political skills he would have learned, he would have had to learn before he went to Hogwarts and was sorted into Gryffindor; and then he spent the rest of his life /not/ practising those skills. Ron would have to learn through trial and error, all the while attending Hogwarts and passing his classes, all without Hermione's help.

It would take Ron years to be even barely effective, years that they don't have, because Voldemort is out there.

I understand the decision to sideline Hermione, though I don't like the implication that if you don't have a noble title, you don't matter. You are basically implying that sure, blood prejudice and privileges are bad, but prejudice and privileges based on inherited noble title are A-OK. I like the suggestion made by some to have Hermione go Dark and help in her own, less diplomatic and more unsavoury ways. (Snape might serve as a mentor of sorts---since Harry's death is to him a failure to protect the last vestige of Lily in the world.)
