That has downright scary implications. Someone posted a review about it that made me think... if a Veela child could forcefully bond an unwilling mate with a kiss then laws would have to be changed declaring them dangerous. They'd be ranked among Vampires and Werewolves when it comes to Dark Creatures.

Thanks. That's more or less what I was looking for.
