I presume it's that Quirrel gave becoming able to teach Defense Against Dark Arts as a reason for his sabbatical (since he officially did it “to gain experience”), thus making it so that they'd expected him to take the position when he returned. I do not know how clear he made his reason for the sabbatical to Dumbledore, but he really took time off from teaching to find whatever remained of Voldemort in an attempt to ... do something, I guess prove himself capable or stuff; this also means that though he only took a year off, it might have many month since his meeting with Tom by the time we see him for the first time. And even if we presume that he only got back once the classes ended, that's still a month and a half since then until the moment that Harry (and thus the readers too) meets him, and for at least some people a month and a half would be enough to get used to it the way Hagrid seems to have; and that's discounting the possibility of him actually returning earlier or sending an owl ahead of time to confirm that he will be back and teaching.
