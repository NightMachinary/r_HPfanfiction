One story had it being that the curse could only be broken by a teacher more suited to the position than Riddle himself getting the job(can't remember which off the top of my frawn).

That one really resonated with me and I decided that would be how I break it in my Darkness!Harry story when Harry takes the position in his late-twenties for a few years.
