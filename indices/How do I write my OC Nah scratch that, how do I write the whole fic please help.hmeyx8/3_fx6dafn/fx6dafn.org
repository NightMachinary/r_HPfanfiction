I'd like to think it's closer to the first one, and as for the year I'd start the story in, I'm thinking of third year, because otherwise I'd have a bajillion flash backs and it'd be awful, imagine having to read a story that starts with twenty flashbacks..

I'm not even sure about the above statement I made, because the only interesting thing would be Sirius escaping from Azkaban, and that's in no way relevant to the story as of now, but I think I'll find a pretty important spot for him.

I think I will change a /lot/ of things about the whole series, things like how stupid Voldemort seems to be in first year and after (ignoring the bookcrux)

It's not about them being a combat team, it's about how well they work together and how much they understand eachother, it just happily translates into combat.

I think I missed a few points but whateva
