It's good to know what the important things are, I'd still recommend thinking about and writing your own single sentence summary rather than just going off the one I threw together. Its a good strategy for focusing yourself on the important aspects of the overarching plot. When you've only got one sentence, every word choice, addition, and exclusion means something more.

Remember that just because something happened in the past for your characters, is doesn't mean that you have to show it to your readers. There are less heavy handed approaches to backstory than flashbacks. If something happened in the past that is going to effect the plot in the present, then you can handle filling in the user on the past at the time it becomes relevant.

Consider following an aspect of canon. Harry Potter starts with an introduction, first to the Perfectly Normal world of the Dursleys, through following Vernon's day, and then to the World of Magic through Albus and Minerva. Then the plot jumps forward 10 years. The circumstances that have shaped Harry to be who he is and that have shaped his relationships are explained and doled out in little present day relevant descriptions over the course of the next few chapters.

Consider starting your fic with a chapter introducing your OC and setting the stage for the eventual Harry, Neville, OC friendship. Then jump forward to whenever the plot of your actual story starts. Reveal things from backstory as they are relevant. If you've imagined a super cool way that your trio handled the Basilisk situation but the Basilisk never comes up in your plot, then its best left as author only backstory.

If they come together over fighting the Troll, then you can include that as a small single sentence background point. "They had been inseparable ever since OC used X spell to help Harry and Neville to X thing to take out the troll." It lets the reader know what happened and lets them fill in the gaps from their own imagination rather than having a pointless flashback to write out the scene as you envision it.
