  I know how to write him as a friend and partner and even as a fighter, but I have no idea how to write him as a student or where he would even be sorted.

Then don't. You don't have to prove all your background research.

  I planned to start from first year and see their development as people and friends with the climax being the war and the multiple fights within it (I plan to draw out the war for more cool battle scenes and stuff)

Just be careful, the worst thing you can do is spend a bunch of time rehashing stuff the reader knows because you want to make tweaks or insert your character inconsequentially.

​

Keep it to what your reader needs to know, so it lets you write what you want to write. It is perfectly acceptable to work our your timeline/character but only give the reader what they need in relation to your story's narrative. This can be references back to things that happened in the past, or even full blown flashbacks when needed.

​

So many stories want to show things that start with small changes in the beginning of series that snowball into huge changes later. The problem with this is your reader has to get through the beginning of your story where 98, 99% of the story is identical to what they have already read.

​

Cover what is important for the story you want to tell.

​

As for where to place your character, if you want it to be very close to the canon characters, you probably want to take over a loosely defined side character that fits. If you are willing to be further away from what is already defined (Making your character a year older or younger, or in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw), you can usually just have your own character and pretend he was a background character in canon who never spoke up. You should still have your divergence point (what went different that your character spoke to them in your fic that they did not in canon?) Or, if you are saying your character didn't exist in canon and the difference is the character exists, when their appearance made a meaningful change in the plot.
