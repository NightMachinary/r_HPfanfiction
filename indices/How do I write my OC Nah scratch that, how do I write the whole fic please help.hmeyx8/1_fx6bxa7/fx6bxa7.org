The most important thing to decide is what the story you want to tell is. If you can summarize the story concept down into one sentence, you can figure out what's actually important to you and therefore the reader, and what should be excluded.

For example I have a fic in progress about Sirius sorted into Slytherin. The story I want to tell does not include seven years of Slytherin Sirius, because that isn't important. Yes I know in my head the details about how he and Severus became friends, how he became rivals with James, and how they clashed over the years, but the reader can pick all that up without needing to slog through seven years of what is essentially backstory for the real tale.

In your case, is the story "the tale of how three young wizards became friends across house lines, growing and facing challenges together during the seven years of their magical schooling until facing the greatest challenge of their lives?" Or is it "The story of three young wizards, taking down Voldemort and Death Eaters as a well coordinated combat team?" Or even just "The story of three wizards, kicking ass and taking down bad guys as a well coordinated combat team"

â€‹

Just by clarifying those three you can find out if your story needs all of the Hogwarts years, some of them, or none at all.

If you want to show the growing friendship from a young age, expound on those challenges and find a way to make them relevant to the reader who has seen the stations of canon a thousand times. (IE. Don't go through the stations of canon please. Change things)

If you want them to be old enough to actually know spells and be able to do things, you can start in fifth year, either providing background information about the implied friendship between Harry, Neville, and OC during the last four years, or even bringing the three of them together at this time.

If the story you want to tell is really about this well oiled combat team, why bother with canon at all? Make the three of them Auror trainees facing a new threat, or shift Voldemort's resurrection back a decade and have them taking on Voldemort as fully trained aurors. Or something like that. You don't have to write a single point of departure story where everything butterfly effects out based on the introduction of your OC.
