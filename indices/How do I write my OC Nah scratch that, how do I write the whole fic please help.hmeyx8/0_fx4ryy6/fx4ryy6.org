Given what you've set up, I'd take one of the canon named characters with no real details and turn him into your own interpretation. Based on the mix, I'd say he should be a Ravenclaw. Keep in mind that the Ravenclaws tend to be individuals with their own ideas, and the highest achievement is to be proven right about something that others got wrong. Try Terry Boot, maybe.
