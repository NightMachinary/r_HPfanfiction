This would also mean they would be in their respective houses. Going by your prompt Sal being in Gryffindor would make sense. Sirius/Godric will be In Gryffindor by default but I can't see the other 2 in Gryffindor. They would obviously still be friends but the “marauders” won't exist.

What would this mean for Snape tho. Would one of them take him under their wing or will Snape knowing more curses than an average seventh year put them of a bit.

What exactly happens to the Potter/Snape rivalry

The “James is arrogant, cocky and a bully and also has a crush on Lily but she want nothing to do with the arrogant toe rag” thing would also probably not happen
