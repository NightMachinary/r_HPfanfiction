Ofc! The best one I've ever read so far is actually one that meets those limits: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22144981]] (sorry I don't actually know how to use the bots lol). It's a Cedric/Harry Luna/Neville fic (but also Helga/Salazar Godric/Rowena). It's 90k+ and completed. From there you can prob follow the ao3 tag that SomewheresSword used (Harry Potter is Salazar Slytherin) to find others you might like :)
