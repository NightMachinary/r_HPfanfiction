Sounds like a pretty cool idea. Although I think the backstory should also be quite AU in order to fit the theme better.

As in, have the Marauders still be a thing, but have them be completely surrounded by mystery. They were never caught, not a single time. Because Salazar was cunning and all. And they probably wouldn't bully Snape as hard/at all. So Snape himself would have to be AU: either a true believer (in order to join the Death Eaters) or a "true" Slytherin being a spy from the very beginning.

But I really like the concept.
