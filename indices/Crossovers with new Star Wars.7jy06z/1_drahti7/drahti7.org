I've thought about a Star Wars crossover quite a bit in the past couple months, and here's my problem with anything after Order 66:

The galaxy is less interesting.

Generally fanfiction is about taking characters that fans know and love (or love to hate) and doing different plots with them. After all the Jedi are dead, there aren't that many interesting characters left. Rebels has a little bit of potential, but there's not really any reason to branch off that series over The Clone Wars.

Perhaps that will change with Episode VIII and IX, but right now I struggle to find a reason to use the Star Wars universe rather than creating a new space western/opera.
