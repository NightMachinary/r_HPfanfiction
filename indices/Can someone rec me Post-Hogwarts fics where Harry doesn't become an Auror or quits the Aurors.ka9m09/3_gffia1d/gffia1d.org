1) Had I Known » After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. SSHP, no slash

2) no voyage by aheartcalledhome well written Harry/Ginny fic dealing with the aftermath of the war themes of ptsd. Not novel length but complete and worth reading in my opinion. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23968243/chapters/57648346]]

3) Harry Potter, Wizarding Barrister Harry finds himself doing an unusual thing after the war: defending the innocent before the Wizengamot. Here's what happens during his final case. This is a long one shot but In my opinion it's still worth reading it in terms of a good postwar fic [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3548160/1/Harry-Potter-Wizarding-Barrister]]

4) Script? Bleep the Script! Angering Death is generally a bad idea. Which led to his current predicament. He had gone to sleep as Harry Potter, and woken up as Bella Swan. On an airplane. On the way to Forks. Rated M for Harry/Bella's mouth: Harry the mod becomes Bella and then starts beating the everloving shit out of edward anytime he sees him refusing to go with the “script”

5) Vocare Prabia by Amber Evans Potter Harry Potter u:10-14-2008 - AU. When Harry gets transported to another universe where his life is turned upside down. Is there any way that he can go home? And does he want to when he finds out his parents are still alive there? Chapter 46. Unfinished but worth reading.

6) Made of Common Clay Lomonaaeren Summary: Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that.

Harry breaks the system everyone gets fucked no shits were given
