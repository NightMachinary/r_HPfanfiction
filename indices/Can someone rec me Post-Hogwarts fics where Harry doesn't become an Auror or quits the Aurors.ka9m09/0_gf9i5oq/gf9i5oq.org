  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.

  Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

Harry becomes a dark lord after Hogwarts. (oneshot, 12k words)

Also ,This probably doesn't fit in, but here is a dimension travel fic set just after the war (8th year?) where harry and 5 others go to an alternate dimension where Harry isn't the BWL.

  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger.
