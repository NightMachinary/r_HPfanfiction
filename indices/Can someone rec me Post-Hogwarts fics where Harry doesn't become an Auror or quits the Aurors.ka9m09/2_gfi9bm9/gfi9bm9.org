I have some recommendations, since it seems that u do like time travel fics (which is a trope i adore) and i have a couple of post war fics where Harry has a different career.

In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

This is hands down one of my fav fics. It has wonderful wonderful world building and is very political. It does feature toxic relationships and other triggers so please be wary of that. But its so incredibly amazing. It made me cry, laugh and gave me chills and really changed the way i thought about things in real life. Its not yet complete but its still being updated.

After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.

Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP. Warnings in author's notes.

This is hands down on of the best time travel fics ive ever read and i doubt I'll read one as good in a very long time. It is very political and features a hardworking and smart but not overly smart and over powered Harry. The characterization is amazingggg. I highly highly recommend.

This is rlly nice, i recently found this fic. It features politics within Gryffindor. It characterises all the gryffs within Harry's grade wonderfully. It's not exactly what ur looking for but it delves into politics within the house which i thought you would like.

Harry was at a loss, but it wasn't as though he could let it show. That wasn't what a Saviour did, after all. But loss entailed the need for direction. When a helping hand was pointed the way, he clutched it like a drowning man. That way wasn't the path he'd expected to be set upon, but what more could he do?

Two years later and Draco Malfoy is relieved of his sentence. But doing his time is only half the battle. When thrown his own rope, an offer dangled from an unexpected direction, Draco takes it as the only option rationally viable. He hadn't anticipated who he'd meet on the other end of that rope, however, and that changed things. Especially when change entailed Harry Potter.

They always did have a way of bumping into one another. Fate, as it happens, seemed unerringly persistent in that regard.

This is a rllyyyy good post war fic that explores Harry working in modeling and Draco as a photographer. Its so so sooo gooddddd. The writing is stunning. I highly highly recommend. It was such a strange and unexpected career choice but somehow it really really works.

Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

This is another time travel fic, it features Harry having a different career choice working with seers. Its a work in progress tho, but a substantial amount has been written. Amazing world building and writing.

Well I hope you enjoy these fics as much as i didðŸ¥°
