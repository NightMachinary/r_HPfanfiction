Timeturners.

The way timeturners work in canon is by creating timeloops that seem to be an immovable fact of the universe. Since time seems to be a singular point in the universe on a never splitting path, these timeloops have always existed. They're like a loop on a street the universe follows. When Hermione got the idea to use the timeturner by Dumbledore, it has always been a fixture in the universe that Hermione and Harry would use the timeturner to safe themselves and Sirius so that she could use the timeturner.

Timeturners as they exist now are the anti-thesis to free will. Much like a prophecy, the moment a timeturner is made every timeloop it will ever create is made a fixture of the future, like the outcome of a prophecy will always come to be, one way or another. (I, of course, completely ignore Cursed Child here.)

If I gotta be honest, I'd prefer them to not exist at all.

But if I had to redesign them without scraping their concept completely, I'd make them "Reset Buttons". Turning them is to reset the universe by a certain amount of time based of the rotation of the third planet in the solar system of Helios, based in the Milky Way galaxy in the Orion-Cygnus arm at an orbit of 217km/s. By reseting, the timetraveler can then go ahead and act with the world as normal, changing outcomes at his pleasure.

I'd also change that a tool like that can be handed to a third-year student to manage her coursework. It would be in the hands of Dumbledore, a mage capable of controlling such magic, who uses it to right the wrongs as he perceived them, making the story of Harry Potter one of a loved boy of two loving parents in a world that has never seen the thread of Lord Voldemort as the young Tom Riddle is known as Tom Dumbledore, adopted son of the great archmage.

You see why I want this thing gone? It makes 0 sense, in its original form as well as its redesigned form.
