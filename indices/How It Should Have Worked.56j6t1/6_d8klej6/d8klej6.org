Dementors. They seem to have a pretty strong effect in the first few seconds of exposure. A solid month should leave you a quivering blob for bloody ages. People seem capable of bouncing back (albeit in a heavily scarred state) after years of exposure.

The Imperius curse. If it works as advertised, there would be rolling waves of Imperius-based Dark Lords throughout the world: I put two people under the curse, and each of them put two others under the curse, on and on until I have a giant army of thralls. It shouldn't be recursive; you shouldn't be able to put someone under the curse and have them put another person under it. Like Bellatrix says, you have to really mean it, and I don't think you'd be able to muster the right state of mind while under the curse.
