You argue on the assumption that you'd have to fill the entire day with programs. Magical TV may be just broadcasting for an hour per day for news, another hour for some entertainment and every weekend to broadcast the Quidditch games. Just fill up primetime with a few hours.

Also this is just straight up wrong:

  Filling up even just one channel for even eight hours a day would require hundreds of people working on it.

Regional TV here in Austria, for example, works with a staff of /maybe/ 100 people, including commissioned camera crews. And we are definitely talking regional TV with the meager population of magicals in Britain. Giving that much of the technology and therefore time used in muggle TV can be done by wand-wave in the HP setting, I'd even say that a few omnicular crews of a director, a cameraman and a lighter/setter + a studio crew of 10 people for various jobs is a good estimate. Adding the moderator and such to it, 25 people may work on Magic TV to make a few hours program every day.
