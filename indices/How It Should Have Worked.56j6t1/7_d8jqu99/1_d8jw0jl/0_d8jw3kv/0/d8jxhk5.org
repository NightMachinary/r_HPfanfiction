Not the cost of inventing it, finding a way to profit from it.

To convince people to buy it, you need to broadcast content. Quidditch games might work -- a sports show can be relatively cheap to produce, and there are certainly people who would buy an expensive tv just to watch a weekly game or whatever. Especially since you can broadcast games from all over, with your own English-speaking commentators.

But filling up the rest of the week with what, scripted content, talk shows, etc.? The number of magicals in Britain is debateable but is probably in the 5-20k range. Filling up even just one channel for even eight hours a day would require hundreds of people working on it. Somebody has to pay for all that.

A wireless can be run with just a dj and a producer/engineer, much cheaper.
