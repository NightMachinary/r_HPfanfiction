Economics?

It costs a lot more to make a tv show than it does a wireless show and there aren't that many people in magical Britain. Do you use the BBC model where the government pays for tv? (there's a good argument that the Ministry is actually funded by wealthy families like the Malfoys) Do you use advertising? Are there even enough magical business to support a tv station, or competition enough to make advertising worthwhile? Or do you use a user-pay system (like cable)?
