I don't think the floo thing would really work. I mean, you need to have a person use the floo powder and put their head in for it to work. You can't stick the quidditch pitch into the floo.

I think TV is very feasible in other ways without the floo, like, maybe make a portrait that self-updates to show you the game? Hell, the mirror Sirius gave Harry could work, if it's big enough (that's canon right?)!
