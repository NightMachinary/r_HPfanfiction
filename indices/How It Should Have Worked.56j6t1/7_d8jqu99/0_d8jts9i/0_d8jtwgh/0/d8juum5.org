Yeah the mirror is a great solution but it had the issue of being "really rare." I am not sure if that means it was not reproducible (like Harry's cloak) or that no one knew what charms were on it or what. But yeah, you would think a muggleborn would have come up with a magic TV a long time ago. They clearly know how to magically record things because those omnoculars can record an entire game right?
