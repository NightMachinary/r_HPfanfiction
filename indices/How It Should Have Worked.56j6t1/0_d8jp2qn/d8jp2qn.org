I like Forging the Swords explanation of the 'binding magical contract'.

There are plenty of things in canon I don't like, but I can't stand the idea that things should have happened differently. It is what causes shitty authors to try to 'fix' canon instead of just making something AU. It's responsible for H/Hr being a complete shit show. Because the shippers are trying to show how things /should have/ been.
