1: Wizarding economics makes no sense. How can someone be "rich" or "poor" in a world where you can just transfigure anything you want other than food or (useless) money? Sure there are some things like food or wands that you probably can't get another way, but why would you need money to have a nice house when you could presumably create one? There's no evidence in the books that transfiguration or conjuration are time limited. Even if they were, you could still make your house out of real materials and just use magic to avoid labor. Similarly for clothing and household goods, etc.

2: The Wizarding population makes no sense. Is it large or small? We know of no other wizarding schools, so can we assume that there are only 40 or so children born a year based on Harry's class at Hogwarts? There were about 4 million children born last year in the US on a population of about 300M. Being very, very generous about multipliers, and assuming most families are about the size they seem to be in Harry Potter (that is, not very different from the US or UK other than the Weasleys) we'd have at best a population of under 10,000 people, not nearly enough to sustain a government bureaucracy that has enough people in it to regulate cauldron bottoms and the like.

(This of course combines quite a bit with #1. Lets take just one example. Harry's wand cost seven galleons. Rowling claims a galleon is worth about £5. That means that the wand cost £35, or something like $45. Assuming 40 new Hogwarts students a year, plus generously a couple hundred replacement wands for older folks, Ollivander is selling maybe one wand a day. Is Olivander really getting by on maybe $10,000 or $20,000 a year of revenue on the outside, with one of the most skilled jobs in existence in the Wizarding World? His expenses have to be pretty high, too, as we assume that dragon heartstring and the like isn't easy to come by, not to mention the cost of keeping his shop open etc. so he's clearing less than minimum wage by far.)
