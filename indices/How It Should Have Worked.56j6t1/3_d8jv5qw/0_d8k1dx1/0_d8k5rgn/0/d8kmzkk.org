Sure, but you also have to consider that partly because of his position and mismanagement/lack of understanding of his own office, Arthur is a much lesser threat than he could be. I mean this guy managed to get a law through the Wizengamot which would protect muggles (who are seen by wizards as mentally handicapped at best and as savages at worst) imagine what he could do to mess with someone like Lucius's plans if he were put into an actually important office and kept his curiosity about muggles to a hobby rather than one of the main facets of his life. Personally, I can see Lucius maneuvering to place Arthur in his position, if only to get rid of a potentially much greater threat.
