Your idea that Arthur's employment was a conspiracy is speculation and even if Lucius and Dolores and the like had wanted to meddle with a relatively small department in the ministry, they definitely wouldn't appoint Arthur Weasley. Lucius hates him, his family is seen as a group of blood traitors, and he is pro muggle, muggleborn, and cursed wizards like werewolves. I mean, Arthur co-wrote and proposed the Muggle Protection Act in book two.
