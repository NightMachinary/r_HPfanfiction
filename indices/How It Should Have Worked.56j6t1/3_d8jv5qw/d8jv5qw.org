Halfbloods.

Think about it. Rowling has said that the majority of wizards in Harry's time are not pureblooded, and muggleborns aren't incredibly common, which means most wizards are part muggle. That means that wizards and witches have been successfully integrating into muggle culture to the point where they can have relationships and children with muggles. Arthur Weasley works in the department of misuse of muggle artifacts, so he should at least be an expert in muggle objects, but he doesn't know how to pronounce electricity or what a rubber duck is for.
