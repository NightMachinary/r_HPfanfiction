My biggest gripe is that we don't see anyone become a great witch or wizard during Harry's time at Hogwarts. We should have.

No more specific than that really, but someone becoming a great wizard(not a great person because there are many of those) but a great practitioner of magic. It just never came up.

To be clear I'm not suggesting epic superwizards, but just Someone who is good at magic, who is young and whom we can see grow into it to some degree. That was a missed opportunity. (For a soon to billionaire...grain of salt.)
