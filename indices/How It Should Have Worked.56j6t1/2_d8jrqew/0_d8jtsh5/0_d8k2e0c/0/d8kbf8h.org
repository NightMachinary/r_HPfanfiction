My way of looking at this issue is by thinking that belief plays a large part in magic. We see this in the books such as when Harry casts his patronus to save Sirius in PoA because he knows that he can cast it because he already did.

Another example of this is Neville. At the start of the series he can Beauly get spells right. While part of this may may be due to a badly matched wand, when he starts to get more confidence in OotP and his belief in himself is greater, his spell casting gets better.

This also ties into how I believe Harry survived the killing curse initially. As Voldemort believed that Harry would be the one who could possibly be the one to end him, and therefore doubting his abilities and in conjunction with Lily's sacrifice caused him to fail .

In terms of the elder wand, it makes the wielder believe they cannot be beaten and therefore it is more difficult for them to be beaten, especially if their opponents knows they have an unbeatable wand and believes that because their opponents has that wand they cannot win. In cannon, Voldemort learns right before he dies that Draco disarmed Dumbledore before he died and therefore doubts that he is the master of the elder wand and since Harry believes that he is Harry ends up victorious.
