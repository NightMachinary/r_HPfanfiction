The idea that wands can play such a huge role in the relative effectiveness of individual witches and wizards with regard to their abilities in magic is anathema to the general theme of magical ability setup in the prior six books.

While it was clear that a poorly matched wand was ineffective, there was a clear distinction regarding the relative abilities of witches and wizards with magic in general, Barty Crouch Sr. is magically powerful - GoF, to certain individuals, for example Harry's parents have varying skills within the paradigms of practical magic application. And though it is mentioned that their wands favored such magically it could be inferred that such affinity was a sort of prescient awareness on the wand's part.

Instead, it seems that wand making is the most important possible trade and that having the best possible wand is the an important element in being a great practitioner of magic.

I don't know if it is shit really, but it is an obvious mistake in hindsight, even from a "stories for kids" perspective. If you really want to be great, you need the best thing, preparation, perseverance, intellect, and hard work are nothing in the face of the best thing.

From that angle, Voldemort should have won, Dumbledore should have lost, and inherited items like the ring and the cloak are more important than anything a normal wizard could achieve.

In terms of egalitarian philosophy, the Elder Wand may in fact be shit, despite my earlier beating around the bush. Even in terms of internal agreement it is poor.

That said I'm not British, and the having of a monarchy and also the titles, land rights, wealth and power distribution of that culture may play a part in the formulation of this tale which is lost on me.

Whatever the case, the above is my issue with the elder wand, namely that it feels like a cheap device rather than a missing puzzle piece, precisely because it is a cheap device, in the best tradition of fanfiction, rather than a worthwhile anything else.
