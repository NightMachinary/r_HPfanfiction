The Elder Wand will /always/ change allegiance if its master is killed/defeated/disarmed, but for other wands it's only a probability. The wandlore section on Pottermore also mentions that some wands are harder to win over than others, depending on each wand's materials and the strength of its bond with the original owner. Wands in general are portrayed as somewhat sentient, and the Elder Wand's unique master-switching characteristic is described as being "unsentimental".
