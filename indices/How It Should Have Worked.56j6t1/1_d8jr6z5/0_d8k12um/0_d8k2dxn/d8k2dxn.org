Maybe, but that quote makes assumptions that magic can be analyzed. If magic has no rules and is truly mystical, isn't there a possibility that it would be incapable of being broken down and dissected to any significant understandable point? That likely either makes more or less sense than I think it does, but I'm tired. Good night.
