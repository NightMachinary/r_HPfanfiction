It's magic. So pretty much none of it makes 'sense'. Obliviation is completely 'dark' in my mind, along with viewing others thoughts is being evil, yet one nobody cares about, and the other is either so rare, or difficult that nobody cares or teaches defenses against it. Love potions are taught how to be made in schools, bought from stores, even treated as a joke. Love potions have a ridiculous degree of abuse potential. The fact that Molly Weasley joke about them is rather terrifying when she's supposed to be this wholesome protective housewife. Slavery of an entire race (house elves), mass discrimination of multiple races (werewolves, vampires, merpeople, goblins, centaurs) women who can bend people to their will (veela) and the widely accepted racism that leads to death camps. Pure bloods seem to be crazy, and the entire idea of involuntary magical contracts is one of the most terrifying ideas in the story. I always thought it bizarre that tom riddles name wasn't put in the goblet of fire the year after book 4.
