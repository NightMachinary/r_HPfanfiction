  The elder wand belonged to harry, it wouldn't harm him but it could harm the bit of riddle in Harry.

I never understood where that explanation came from. The book explicitly says that Harry was able to come back due to Voldemort using Harry's blood during the graveyard resurrection.

The whole revelation about the Elder wand was there just to explain the ending 'duel' in which Harry's 'Expelliarmus' completely bulldozes voldemort's 'Avada Kedavra'.
