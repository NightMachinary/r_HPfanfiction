And yet it's the one specifically mentioned and also foreshadowed. After the graveyard scene in GoF when Harry is telling Dumbledore what happened, there is a line mentioning a 'flash of victory' in Dumbledore's eyes. Total victory for Dumbledore wouldn't have been anything less than Voldemort vanquished, and Harry still alive. Combine all of that with Dumbledore's intention to have the Elder wand not be won through conquest, but for it's master to die by his own choosing, and you get far more evidence that it was purely the sacrificial blood protection that kept Harry alive and not some last minute dues ex machina wand lore.

Overall the central theme of the books has always been about choices and the consequences of those choices. Voldemort lost because time and time again he made choices that revolved around selfishness and causing fear. He never understood the power of caring for others or self sacrifice the same way that Harry and Dumbledore did. The Elder wand's ownership falling to Harry through chance, instead of Voldemort, being the main reason everything works out in the end is contrary to the main message of the story.
