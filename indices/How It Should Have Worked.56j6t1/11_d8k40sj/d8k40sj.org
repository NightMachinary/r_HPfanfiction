For me it is the whole concept with souls. Like our souls are tethered onto our beating heart. That the killing curse cuts that tether and our heart gives out, but dementors sever it without killing(?) this is especially confusing because when Harry gets AK'd harry gets a chance to go back because there were two souls in his body(?)
