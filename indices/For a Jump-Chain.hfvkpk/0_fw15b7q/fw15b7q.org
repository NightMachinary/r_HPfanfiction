Jumpchains for those wondering, are a series of Choose your own adventure type stories that have the main protagonist "jump" from one setting to another after a certain amount of time, kinda like a continuous Isekai . As for the question, it would probably be better to ask over at [[/r/JumpChain][r/JumpChain]] for subjects such as these, as you'll likely get more answers.

Personally speaking, I would expect something that favors range and usability over raw power. Given she has access to HP magic her semblance should supplement it rather than overtake it. A sensory semblance that gives her instinctual awareness of her surroundings would be my go to as it would be useful even outside of fights, and honestly it fits her character as well. A knowledge gathering semblance for a person who makes it a hobby to gather knowledge.
