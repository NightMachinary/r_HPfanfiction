Well, I kind of disagree with people on Ginny (maybe it's my personal dislike of the character, that lacks fleshing out IMHO (I mean really: What do we know of Ginny? Temperamental red head witch, good at quidditch with a crush on Harry - IMHO that's it! A few tidbits here and there otherwise, but over all: Not much! We know tons more about Hermione!), talking!):

It's not like a lot of passionate people don't turn into total bores later in life, especially if they pursue a career that eats up all their passion (an athletes life (Ginny play quidditch professionally if I remember correctly!) isn't all fun and games, it's daily training, pushing your limits, only eating certain foods (many athletes have food plans etc.) etc. that can take a lot of the fun and passion out of life if you return home at night dead tired - not much time for sex, fun, going out, sleeping in etc...more so if there's kids involved, kids are a fucking energy drain after all - that's why many unstable relationships are ruined if people decide to have kids because they believe kids make it all better, newsflash: They don't...have them if you both want them and if your relationship is rock solid - otherwise do NOT have them!)

What do I want to say with that? IMHO it's easily possible for Ginny to become a dreadful passionless harpy only interested in her career (and maybe in parties and high society events, the Weasleys are fucking poor and IMHO all of them, except for Arthur and Molly, want success in their own right - Hell, Ron resents Harry (who's an orphan, while Ron himself has a loving family!) for having money! I mean even the twins (they run their own successful shop!), Charlie (who left ASAP after Hogwarts, probably because Molly being overbearing) and Bill (intelligent with a well paying but dangerous job) went out for success, hell even Percy is very successful (for a boring paper pusher!)...so would Ginny not want something similar? I mean the only one without ambition in that family is IMHO Ron (ok, and Arthur and Molly) and IMHO the OP is right that this might cause a rift between him and Hermione! I mean Hermione sounds like a strong and independent woman, but on the other hand she's not someone who wants or needs a house husband who is only good at saying "Yes dear!" and doing what she wants - in fact I'd say she would probably be disgusted in the long run by Ron's lack of propper ambition to make something of himself! Hermione would rather have someone who'd fight her if he thinks she's wrong and who makes something of himself (Harry fills that better than Ron, but not ideally! Unless he changes his habbits and gets his NEWTS, IMHO Hermione in canon should protest Harry leaving school without graduating, especially since it makes other careers than the Aurors impossible, should he want to change later on!)...hell, we have WOG that that relationship basically is pure fanfiction (Rowling admits that it was wrong and that Harry and Hermione make a lot more sense as a couple!)
