I think this is an interesting concept, but I do agree with other comments that you have Ginny wrong. I think it would be easy to have Ginny stay as she is in cannon and have Harry stay as he is, and still have them grow apart and fall out of love. Relationships take work, and sometimes people don't realize that you change as you go through life. Maybe Harry and Ginny were madly in love for a while, but with all of their kids getting ready to leave the nest they have more time to look at each other and Harry feels that the spark is no longer there. He still loves Ginny, as the mother of his children and his friend, but he can't remember the last time that they've even kissed.
