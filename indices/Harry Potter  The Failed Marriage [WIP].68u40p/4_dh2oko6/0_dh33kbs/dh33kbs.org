Eh, but I think even having them lose the passion for each other is OOC. Harry and Ginny are both passionate people. I just can't see them losing that for each other. A better idea would be for the stresses of life and kids slowly taking the passion away, but once the kids are all gone, they rediscover it. Not a H/Hr story then, but more realistic and in-canon.

The idea that he would wind up in a marriage where Ginny is his friend but not more but finds that with Hermione doesn't work because that is exactly the type of relationship he has with Hermione.

And again, the basic premise that Harry and Hermione cheat is wildly OOC.
