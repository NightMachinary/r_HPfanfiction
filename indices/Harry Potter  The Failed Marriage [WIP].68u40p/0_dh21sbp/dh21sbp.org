How could Ginny be cool and aloof? That sounded more like the fanon characterization of Ice Princess of Slytherin Daphne Greengrass. The Canon Ginny was a very aggressive, fiery, and energetic person. She was also mischievous and sneaky (stealing her brothers' broom at age 6). Perhaps you confused Movie with Book Ginny?

In 2014, when Rita Skeeter made fun of them at the Quidditch World Cup, she sent her straight to the hospital. That fact alone showed Ginny hadn't lost any of her fiery spirit (or aggression).
