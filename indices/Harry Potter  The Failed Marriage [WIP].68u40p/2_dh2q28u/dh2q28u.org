Like the others, I think you do need a better line of reasoning for Harry to even consider leaving Ginny for anyone, let alone Hermione, if you're remaining true to the characters. One of the more difficult things about writing a post-canon fic like yours is that there isn't any easy way to break up Harry and Ginny without either of them doing a characterisation 180. Ron and Hermione have some pretty obvious flaws that could be exploited when writing a fic. But, imo, Ginny, was tailor-made for Harry, to the point where I'm convinced that JK sat down with a pen and paper one day during the planning stages of the series and listed all the qualities Harry might be attracted to, and just coalesced that into one character. Even her flaws aren't really flaws: she's a bit judgmental and quick-tempered, but that's always rounded into her being fiery, which is something Harry likes in her. And, Ginny's just underdeveloped enough throughout the series that we don't see any other appreciable flaws she has that might signal a rocky romance, but just developed enough that we buy her characterisation and the relationship with it.

In a way, it's actually quite clever that Rowling didn't turn her into the main heroine: if she had gotten the same amount of "page time" as Hermione, Jo would have either had to introduce real flaws to her that Harry would actually be bothered by, to make her a more interesting literary character, thereby ruining the whole fairytale romance aspect of it all, or she'd write Ginny as is and that'd be a dreadfully boring Mary Sue (pls don't kill me Ginny fans).

But that's a digression, and more of a characterisation nitpick as someone who writes, than me spotting a logical problem in character interaction. Your problem is a logical problem: If all the characters are more or less true to their canon selves, Harry would have no reason to leave a person like canon Ginny in your fic. They have chemistry; if anything, they have /too much/ chemistry. You would either have to contort Ginny into being something she's not (i.e. cold and aloof), or twist Harry into something he's not (being suddenly attracted to bookish types like Hermione over sporty types like Ginny, or even being likely to entertain the thought of infidelity). Even the generally good H/Hr post-epilogue fics, such as Unlike a Sister, are guilty of warping characterisation somewhat, exaggerating Ginny's fiery nature into being someone who is genuinely kind, but also unknowingly callow and career-obsessed. While it's up to you to decide whether or not this better than Jo's version of Ginny, it can't be denied that UaS's version of Ginny is not canon Ginny.

Furthermore, there's the complication of kids, and I don't think either Harry or Hermione would jeopardise their relationship with their children for each other. Hermione's not the type to choose her own happiness over others, and Harry is basically a Jesus analogue, so he's /definitely/ not the type.

Unfortunately, the only way I can think of breaking up Harry and Ginny without messing with the way they're portrayed is to kill one of them off or to set your story at some point before an H/Hr romance becomes logically impossible, which is definitely before the kids, and probably before the marriage itself.
