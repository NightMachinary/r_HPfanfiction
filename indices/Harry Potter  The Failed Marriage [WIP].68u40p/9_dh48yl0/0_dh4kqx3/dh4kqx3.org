You're story idea is fine. And despite the objections of some people here, including myself, there are plenty of people who will like the idea of H/Hr regardless of what you do to the characters. I myself have enjoyed stories with people acting OOC. I suppose the difference here is that you are changing the characters in a negative way, rather than a neutral or positive way. Point is write what you want. People will criticize and you should take them to heart, especially if there is a consistent criticism. But that's part of being a writer, taking criticism.

In my comment above, I advised changing the central characters of the story but keeping the plot the same. How important is it to make this a Harry/Hermione story? And how important is keeping the story the same, one of infidelity?
