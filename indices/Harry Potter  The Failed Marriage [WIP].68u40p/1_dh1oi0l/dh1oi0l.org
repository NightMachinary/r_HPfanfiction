Staying true to the characters wouldn't really allow for H/Hr in my opinion. You're saying that Harry wants adventure? Hermione is a freaking bureaucrat in her adult years. Not at all adventurous. And How the hell is Ginny Fucking Weasley boring? She fucking gives Rita Skeeter a smackdown (or at least a good hex). Also that whole leading a rebellion in her sixth year thing. I don't think you can stay 70-80% in character without having to make significant changes in the past (relative to your story). Don't let me keep you writing, though, but you may want to adjust more than you're thinking.
