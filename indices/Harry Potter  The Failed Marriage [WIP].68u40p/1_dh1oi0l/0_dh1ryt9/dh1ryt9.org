I'm certainly not the target audience for this type of fic as a big Harry/Ginny fan, so take this with a grain of salt, but I agree totally with the above by [[/u/ssnik992][u/ssnik992]]. The series makes it pretty clear that Harry and Ginny work exceedingly well together, IMO. Can't speak much for Ron and Hermione but I certainly buy their relationship too. So a lot of the natural dissolving of their marriages just doesn't jive with what we know about them.

Your characterization of Ginny is so off it sort of ruins the entire premise. If anything, as mentioned above, Hermione is the cold, professional type. You said you want to justify their affair, which is simply not possible unless Ginny and Ron were themselves unfaithful or perhaps abusive. You also want to show Ron and Ginny as the victims, thereby implying Harry and Hermione are acting selfishly and callously. So you're already making the people we are presumably supposed to root for pretty awful people.

Also, you set the story up as Harry and Hermione cheating. While I believe this would hold true for Hermione, too, Harry simply would not cheat. He is far too noble to do so. He isn't even the type to leave an unhappy marriage out of duty to his children and to honor the commitment he made.

Here's my advice: It sounds like the characters themselves aren't that important since they would need to act so OOC as to render them strangers to the reader. So why not take the same basic plot and just use some lesser-explored characters. Maybe it's Percy and Audrey and George and Angelina, and George and Audrey have the affair. George is resentful because he thinks Angelina still views him as a replacement for Fred, the one she really wanted. And He justifies cheating with Audrey by claiming to still be angry at Percy for abandoning the family. Audrey wants more fun in her life and Percy sucks all the fun out of life. Meanwhile Percy feels he is spending his entire life trying to make up for his past mistake and when is enough enough? The family gets involved when the affair is discovered and everyone has different reactions. Maybe you can insert Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione and have the affair threaten to tear them apart too because maybe Harry and Ginny disagree with Ron and Hermione.

This could be a good fic with the same basic premise but different characters. It could force us as the reader to look at two characters (George and Percy) one we love, and one we dislike, and flip the script. I'd read that.
