Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic]] did this, but it's abandoned.

Pretty sure that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird's Son]] does this too. Not a fan of harems in the slightest, but...
