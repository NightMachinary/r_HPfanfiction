Multi Crossovers are hard to come by, especially good ones. You'd probably be better off just looking for single xovers.

Also, does KoM really count? If so, maybe try linkffn(Wizard of the Kaleidoscope) which, though also having a sharingan!harry focuses a lot on Fate/ magic.

Also, assuming you liked KoM, you'd also probably enjoy linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) assuming you haven't already read it.
