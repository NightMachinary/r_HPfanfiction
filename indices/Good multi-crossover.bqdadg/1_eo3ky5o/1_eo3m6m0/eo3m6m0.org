I wouldn't say KoM is a crossover in the true sense. A crossover is when characters from different works /crossover/ into either universe, or both universes are merged somehow. Like the Elemental Countries of Naruto being hidden by magic from mundane eyes but are still in the same Earth as the magical world of Harry Potter.

KoM is a story that borrows elements from Naruto but isn't a true crossover. :)
