Oh man this reminds me of some story where Bellatrix pretended to be Lily and raise Harry and his sister? If I remember she treated the girl badly and tried to make Harry dark some how...I can't remember much from it.

But I like this. I would love for Bellatrix who is crazy in the way that she's smart and dangerous, cautious and stalks her enemies to understand the best way to kill them. Pretty much Bellatrix before Azkaban. So she gets some leads about where the boy who killed the Dark Lord is. She wants to know how and why this brat can do it.

At the same time she questions the Dark Lord. How was he able to be beaten by a child? Disgusting.

She finds Harry in the cupboard and understands that the wards protect him and his family. But she sees the muggles treating a wizard like dirt and it puts her teeth on edge in a way that only her sisters could do when they get on her nerves.

So she plots. She steals another child and with a few spells you could hardly tell the difference between them. And in the middle of the night she switches them out.

Let the muggles abuse one of their own. She was going to take Harry with her.

I imagine that Bellatrix would train Harry in Dark Arts and in hand to hand combat. He would be smart and smart mouthed too. And he would be raised as Draco's friend/cousin.
