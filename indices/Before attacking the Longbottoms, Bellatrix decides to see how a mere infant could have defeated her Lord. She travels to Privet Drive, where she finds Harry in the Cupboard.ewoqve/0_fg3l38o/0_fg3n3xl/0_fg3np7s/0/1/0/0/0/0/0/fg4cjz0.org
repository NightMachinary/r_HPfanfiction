There's a Star Trek one called Spice that's Kirk/Spock and 278k. It starts out really good (but smutty), but then it gets really, really angsty and during the week I was trying to read it, I started feeling more and more depressed. I finally realized it was the fic and I stopped reading it about halfway through.
