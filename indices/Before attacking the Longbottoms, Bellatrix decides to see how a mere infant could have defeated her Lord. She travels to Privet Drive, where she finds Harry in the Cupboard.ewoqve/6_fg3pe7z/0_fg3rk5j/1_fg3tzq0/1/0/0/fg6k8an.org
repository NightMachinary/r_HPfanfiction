Nah, Bella might be the bigger biggot, but she hates muggles and muggleborns solely, halfbloods (read Harry) and Purebloods are alright in her books, so as she wouldn't be so deposited against Harry and all he is, she would accept him, as an innocent baby, easier than muggles who hate Muggleborns, Halfbloods, Pureboods, or anything to do with magic.
