Tangentially related, but I recall reading a fic long ago where Harry asks real Moody to put him under the imperious (which he consciously does not fight) with very specific orders - to study hard and prepare to fight Voldemort or something. He ends up killing Voldemort because he was infringing on his studying time, after which the Imperious ends and he blinks back to reality for the first time in years.

I can't remember the name of the fic, unfortunately.
