I'd just like to point out that a Cheering Charm has a similar enough effect, without the stigma, or the direct danger of losing control. Additionally, if someone were to use Imperious, studying would probbly be one of the orders, because the curse would remove the usual issues like boring material, loss of motivation, etc... The caster would then benefit from the target's perfect notes.
