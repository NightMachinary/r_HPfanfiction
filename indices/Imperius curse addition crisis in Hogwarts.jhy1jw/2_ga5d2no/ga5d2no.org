I can't remember if this is fanon or canon but the unforgivables have a strong intent requirement no? Like that's the reason they're classified as unforgivables, where you need to have the desire and will to dominate the other's person's free will in order for the imperius to work. That would make a cheering charm the easier option even considering that students can get the spell to work. Like that's a bit which isn't fully explored in canon I guess, how difficult is spell casting actually? Like it can't be as easy as doing the wand motions right and pronouncing the spell correctly.
