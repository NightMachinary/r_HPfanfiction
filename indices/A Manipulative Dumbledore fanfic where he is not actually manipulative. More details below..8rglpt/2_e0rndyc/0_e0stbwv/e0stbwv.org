My favorite part of this fic is the head of house summoning button. Imagine how many other Gryffindor students are the hero in their own story and want to rail against the establishment and McGonagall hears the call and just sighs, smartens up her appearance and goes to rain down no nonsense lectures on their heads. I imagine afterwards she and Snape hold contests trying to one up each other on ridiculous students during staff meetings while Sprout and Flitwick just share commiserating looks, because it's always the quiet ones and these two are drama queens.
