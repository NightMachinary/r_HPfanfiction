I'm confused. Are you asking for a Dumbledore who is not actually manipulative but seems like he is, or are you asking for a Dumbledore who is manipulative but doing so for a good goal?

It sounds like you're asking for the latter, but still thinking it isn't manipulation. As in canon, it's still manipulation even if for a good goal. Not necessarily bad, but still.
