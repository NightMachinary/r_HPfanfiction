I started reading HP fanfiction just over a year ago, tracked all the fics I've read in a spreadsheet, and ended up with over 50 million words read. Plus I probably have at least another 100 fics bookmarked in my backlog.

Its definitely a real problem sometimes when I can't reel it in. I find myself reading honestly awful fanfics sometimes just because it feels weird to not have anything I'm currently reading, and I occasionally spend an entire day or two just eating, sleeping, and reading - sometimes without the sleeping part.
