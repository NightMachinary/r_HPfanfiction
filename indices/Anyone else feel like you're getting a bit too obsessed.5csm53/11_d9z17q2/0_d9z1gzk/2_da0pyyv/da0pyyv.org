I think the trick is to find some new books that don't have much in the way of fanfics, to provide a balance.

I loved Harry Potter, and it has over 700,000 fanfics.

My new favorite books are the Grimnoir Chronicles. I honestly don't think there's any fanfiction whatsoever.

It's all about balance.
