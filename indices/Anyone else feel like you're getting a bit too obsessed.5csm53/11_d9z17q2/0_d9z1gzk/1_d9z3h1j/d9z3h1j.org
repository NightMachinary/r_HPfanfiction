If you feel like you're too obsessed, than you could make an effort to slow down. I'm like you in that I loved reading as a child and now love fanfiction. Whenever I felt like I was a bit too obsessed and spending too much time on a screen, I went back to physical books and other hobbies of mine for a while. Now I just balance all of those things equally so I never get too into any of them, haha.
