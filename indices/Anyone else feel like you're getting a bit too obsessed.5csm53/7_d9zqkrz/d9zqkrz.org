It was June 3 years ago that I first found out about fanfics. I did not stop reading until college started in September. I was reading around 18 hours a day, barely eating anything because I was to caught up in the fics, and destroying my sleeping schedule based on how addictive the fic was (ohh its only 200k words I can read through that quickly! Oh look there's a sequel, 300k... won't take a moment...). When college started I had to regulate myself abit more, was forced down to 8 hours of reading a day and it's pretty much stayed like that since. Am I addicted? Yes. Definitely. But it's a good addiction, a non-dangerous one that lets me go back to my childhood.
