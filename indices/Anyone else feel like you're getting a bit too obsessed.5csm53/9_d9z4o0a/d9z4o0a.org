Nothing wrong with enjoying reading. Problem is, I sometimes think I enjoy reading HP fanfiction so much that it sort of messes with me at times.

Since I'm a gamer as well, I moderate gaming and FF reading. Sometimes it's entirely reading or gaming, and sometimes it's a varying balance between the two. Currently, I'm about even.
