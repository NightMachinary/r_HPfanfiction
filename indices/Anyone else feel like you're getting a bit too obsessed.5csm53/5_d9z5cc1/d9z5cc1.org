I can definitely sympathize, especially with the part about feeling a bit empty each time I finish reading a fic. When I reached the end of the denarian trilogy a couple days ago it felt like I was slowly dying. I had absolutely no idea what to do for the rest of the day. I call it the Limbo stage, because you're in the middle of fics feeling all lonely and empty. God I hate the the Limbo stage...
