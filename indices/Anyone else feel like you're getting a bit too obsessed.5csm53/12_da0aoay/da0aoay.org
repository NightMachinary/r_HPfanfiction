When I first started, yeah. I'd consume several hundred thousand words a day. But, then I became jaded after a few months (one too many indy!Harry stories with training montages and inheritances), and the well of quality fics ran dry. If I can find a new long story that doesn't suck once a month, then that's a good month. Occasionally it happens when something like Worm comes along, but that's rare.
