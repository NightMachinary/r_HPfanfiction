Like you, I read a lot of HP fanfic when I first discovered it. It took me some time to read through a bunch of stuff and then to moderate my consumption a bit. Now I go through phases where I read mostly/only fanfic for a few weeks, and then I switch back to reading books from the library, re-reading old favorites, or diving into my massive collection of cheap e-books. It's all good, and there are much worse things I could be doing with my time than reading. (I typically read about a dozen hours a week.)

I think if you feel disappointed when a story is over, that's a sign that it was a good one - I get that with plenty of books of all genres. Curling up with a good story for an entire weekend sounds great to me, although it's a luxury I only get every few months or so. I would only start to worry if you get so involved in fanfic that you're routinely failing to take care of your other obligations (to yourself, family/friends, work, etc.) - and that would be a problem if it happened with any hobby! Otherwise, just enjoy the reading.
