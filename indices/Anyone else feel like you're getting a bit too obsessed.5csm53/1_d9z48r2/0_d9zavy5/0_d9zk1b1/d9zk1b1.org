I specifically look for completed works for this very reason, and a while ago I ran across a story that wasn't exactly /long/, but enough to devote an afternoon to. Well I got to like chapter sixteen and realized there wasn't a chapter after it, and the footnote for the story said it was abandoned. I almost threw my tablet out of the window I was so mad. Why mark it complete if it isn't complete?! They have no understanding of the word complete! Aaaagh! ^{I'm only still slightly angry about this.}
