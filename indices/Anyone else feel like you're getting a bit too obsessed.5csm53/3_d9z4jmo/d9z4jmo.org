I don't know, as someone who read GoF in a day when it came out, reading lengthy fic in the same amount of time is pretty usual. At worst it just feels like I'll never grow up because I can't put the fandom away. It's kind of nice to have this perpetual link to one's childhood, I don't think it would have been possible without fandom.
