started reading it in 2007. started writing it 2009. still reading it and now have a backlog of non-fanfic reading to do.

current peeves: unfinished or abandoned stories. writers who pull surprise slash out of their hat, or lemons without a warning. There is a time and place for those, but a warning would be nice.
