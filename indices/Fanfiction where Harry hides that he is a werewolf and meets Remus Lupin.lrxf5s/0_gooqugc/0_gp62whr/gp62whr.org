I tried reading this and after reading 3 works right after the other, I think the author sometimes forgets what they already wrote. There is some great stuff in there and brilliant ideas, also I don't mind a darker Harry. But the story is inconsistent and jumps forward and backward all the time.\\
Also Harry is in some parts realistically angry but then flies completely off the rail and is angry for no reason / goes over the top in the next scene.
