Canon Ginny is not old enough yet, and I highly doubt Bellatrix was one crazy sadistic psycho at 16 (Ginny's age at Battle of Hogwarts) either. They all need time and circumstances to grow in that role.

Ginny in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), is definitely bloodthirsty, and has a penchant for torturing and looting her enemies.

She's absolutely Harry's brutal, fanatic, and violent enforcer in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7135971/1/][The Voyage of Starship Hedwig]], linkffn(7135971).
