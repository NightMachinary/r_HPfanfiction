I mean, yes, she's more known for that in the wider world of fandom, but if you read what OP is specifically asking for:

  one little thing i found interesting and funny was Daphne Greengrass characterization in there: At first she seems a typical pureblood girl, kind of like Pansy but less anoying... At least until Harry brokes Malfoy with accidental Magic. Then she gets a *very morbid crush on him.*

  Voldemort even compares her behavior with the *obsessive crazy* way Bellatrix acted around him.

  I wanted to know if you know simmilar fanfics. Like:

  -Stories with a Dark!Harry getting *some crazy girl/s obssesively following/working for him to try to gain his love.*

  -Stories with the typical good natured Harry suddenly getting *some crazy obssesive fangirl/s. (Which kinda already happened in canon with the girls trying to get him to drink love potions).*

The OP is specifically asking for girls who obsess over someone they love and act crazy in response, whatever form that takes. OP specifically mentions love potions and fan-girling behavior.
