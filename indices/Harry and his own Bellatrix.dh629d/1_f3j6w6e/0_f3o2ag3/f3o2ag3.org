Ginny is nowhere Bellatrix level when it comes to fear factor or ability (which makes people fear her). Bellatrix is the only Death Eater who turns out to be dangerous (killing Sirius, torturing Hermione, the 1 vs 3 duel at the end). Ginny is known for her bat-bogey hex.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love to read a fic where Ginny gets the right-hand or brutal enforcer role, but canon Ginny is not that person.
