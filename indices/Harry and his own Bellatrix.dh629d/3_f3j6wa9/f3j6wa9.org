21 year old Harry accidentally goes back in time to just before the outbreak of the first war. During Bellatrix's very first mission the proto-Death Eaters attack the pub Harry is trying to get a drink. Harry curb stomps the entire group and only leaves Bellatrix alive so she can deliver a message to Tom Riddle. Bellatrix is terrified, and smitten.
