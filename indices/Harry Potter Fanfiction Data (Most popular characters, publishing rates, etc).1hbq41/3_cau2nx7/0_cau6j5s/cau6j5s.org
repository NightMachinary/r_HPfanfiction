All we really know about her is that she was a Slytherin, friends with Pansy Parkinson, and she was in the same year as Harry Potter. Draco's wife isn't named in the epilogue to the series, but it came out in an interview or something that he married Astoria Greengrass, Daphne's sister.

So if you're a fanfiction writer, Daphne has the appeal of giving you a lot of flexibility to give her a canon-compliant place in the story while giving her whatever personality you want. For example, if your favorite character is Harry or Draco or another teenage male student, then you can write a believable romance with him in it. She is also a popular character for fanfic writers to use when they are writing an AU fic where Harry is a Slytherin, or where he stops being friends with both Ron and Hermione.

Here are some summaries of highly favorited stories with Daphne Greengrass:

- Beginning during the Goblet of Fire, Harry looks to different friends for support after both Ron and Hermione refuse to believe that he did not put his name in the Goblet. Including one unexpected friend: Daphne Greengrass.

- Starts in the middle of DH - What if Hermione left the tent when Ron had asked her to come with him? How will Harry respond? What repercussions will her decision have on the Wizarding World? Will All be well? Who will Harry end up with? Ron bashing.

- During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG

- What if Harry didn't bump into the Weasleys at Kings Cross on his first day? What if instead he met another family, one that has ties to his parents? This simple encounter will set him on a different path including new friends and new ambitions. Year Two in progress. Includes: Slytherin!Harry, Good!Dumbledore, Conflicted!Snape, & Supportive!Remus.
