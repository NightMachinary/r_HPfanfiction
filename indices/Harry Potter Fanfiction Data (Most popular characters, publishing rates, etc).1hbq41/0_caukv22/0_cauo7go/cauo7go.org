I combine the sums of both orders in the code, so it doesn't matter who is listed first.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "Similarly, the Lily Evans+James Potter combo is listed much lower than the combined pairing figures would show." James Potter isn't a starring character in every story Lily Evans is and vice versa.
