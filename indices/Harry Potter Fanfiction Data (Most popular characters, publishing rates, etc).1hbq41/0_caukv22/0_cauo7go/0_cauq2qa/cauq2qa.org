  I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "Similarly, the Lily Evans+James Potter combo is listed much lower than the combined pairing figures would show."

In [[http://i.imgur.com/144OTK2.png][this graph]] (number of fanfictions published vs starring characters pruned), you've got one bar for /'James P.', 'Lily Evans P.'/ and another for /'Lily Evans P.', 'James P.'/ They're the eighth and ninth highest, respectively, but they're both the same thing. If you combined the two, they'd be the fourth highest in the graph. Looking at the graph as it is, though, you wouldn't know that there were so many James/Lily fics because they're separated into two smaller groups when they don't need to be. The order of the characters shouldn't matter, since as wordhammer says, most of the time they're just selected in the order they appear in the FanFiction.net character list, which is alphabetical. It's the same thing as /'Draco M.', 'Hermione G.'/ and /'Hermione G.', 'Draco M.'/ If you combined those, they'd outnumber /'Draco M.', 'Harry P.'/
