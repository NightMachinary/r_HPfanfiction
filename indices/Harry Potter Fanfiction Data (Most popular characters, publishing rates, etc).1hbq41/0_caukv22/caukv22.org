"there is still gender balance in that Harry Potter was almost always the co-star."

Taking a look at that particular chart, it seems like the pairings haven't been properly grouped. If I read it right, you can combine Draco+Hermione with Hermione+Draco and end up with more than Harry+Draco. Similarly, the Lily Evans+James Potter combo is listed much lower than the combined pairing figures would show.

It shouldn't matter who was listed first- half the time it would be alphabetical rather than chosen for primary vs. secondary focus.
