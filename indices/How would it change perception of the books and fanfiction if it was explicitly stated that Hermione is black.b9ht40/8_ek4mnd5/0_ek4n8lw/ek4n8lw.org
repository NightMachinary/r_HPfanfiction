¨shrugs¨ I don't know. I could be overly optimistic about the level of racism in 1990's Great Britain, but if her parents are both higher-class and well-educated, wouldn't that be more than enough for her to grow up "spoiled"? Especially considering that she has very little social contact outside of her family prior to Hogwarts, as we know, so if any lingering prejudice is to be had on the streets, she would have little experience with it.
