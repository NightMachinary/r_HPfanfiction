There are primarily black cities in the UK? News to me. I assume you mean neighbourhoods or the UK equivalent?

Of course I discussed probabilities and not absolutes. I'm not saying every black/PoC child is a budding revolutionary, I'm just sharing from my own experiences. The reason why I think Hermione would be more likely than an average black child to be aware of racism at 11 is because of her canonical intelligence, she's a very special child nit even counting magic. But yes, she absolutely could be a sheltered princess.
