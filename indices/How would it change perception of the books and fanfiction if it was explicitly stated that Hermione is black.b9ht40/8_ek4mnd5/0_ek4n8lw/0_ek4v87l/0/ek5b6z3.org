I think that's a valid thought but I know many upper class Black people who come from primarily Black cities, that don't have the same distrust for authority that you are ascribing to many other Black people.

If we assume black Hermione is from generational wealth and had a private school upbringing, then she could definitely have white Hermione tendencies.
