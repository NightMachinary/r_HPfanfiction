She could still be spoiled in terms of material things and her own importance, but there's this innocence about the wider world and a faith in authority figures that I don't think an intelligent young black girl would have. Being upper middle class isn't a perfect defense from racism and racism doesn't all happen on "the streets". Upper class enclaves can be hotbeds of racism too, racist laws and policies are written and lobbied by /people/ they don't just mysteriously appear. One particularly insidious experience with racism that many PoC encounter in their childhoods is that there are rules or authority figures that tilt circumstances against them. Hermione would have surely experienced this to some extent in school or in pubic spaces by the time she entered Hogwarts had she been black.

So black Hermione could still be: a bookworm, intelligent, strong willed, tactless, uncaring of her appearance, brave.

What black Hermione probably wouldn't be: blindly trusting of authority figures and teachers, a stickler for rules, the person that says "Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed, before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed --- or worse, expelled."

What black Hermione probably would be: more immediately understanding of Harry's conflicts with Professor Snape, less trusting of Mcgongagall and other teachers, much bigger reaction to house elf enslavement.
