I think that it would change the pairings that people in the fandom enjoy. People when they think Dramione, I'd bet that most of them think of Emma and Tom, which is one of the reasons why it's popular -- they seem to go together. I don't know if that would hold true if you switched out the actresses. Same with Harry and Hermione. I'm not sure about Romione, how it would affect people's views of that ship.

There is also the optics of the actress to consider. Emma is, by anyone's standards, a beautiful woman. If she were replaced by an equally beautiful black woman, the ships might not change at all except for those whom race matters more than beauty.
