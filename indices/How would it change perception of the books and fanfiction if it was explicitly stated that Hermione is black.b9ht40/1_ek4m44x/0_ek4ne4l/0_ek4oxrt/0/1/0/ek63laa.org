No, Voldemort's Death Eaters were defeated prior to their showdown because Voldemort called off the attack after he gained the upper hand. In the end, only he and Bellatrix were left standing. His forces had been defeated at that point due to poor resource management.

Also, the Death Eaters managed to demonstrate a massive, staggering incompetence during the battle. Armed with magical equivalents of automatic grenade launchers, flame throwers and energy shields, they were defeated by arrows and kitchen utensils. And let's not even mention their frontal, uphill assault of a fortified position across hundreds of yards of open ground.

The defenders lost 50 people through the entire battle, and that number might include house elves and Centaurs. Three from the Order, two from the DA (or just one if you think Lavender made it). Going by how feared Voldemort is, that is the Death toll you expect from his opening salvo. Not the entire battle. Therefore I would not consider his actual impact that great. Moral certainly, but he wasn't just tearing through the defenders like an armoured battalion would through cavemen.
