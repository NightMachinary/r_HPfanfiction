Voldemort and Dumbledore are both effectively weapons of mass destruction compared to other wizards, without either of them the bigger number of wizards controls the government and the Death Eaters just lack the support to effectively take over and keep power. They only really managed to gain power because Voldemort was killing of the people that would be a threat. We see that during the battle of Hogwarts where just after Harry made the defenders resistant to Voldemorts magic the inhabitants of Hogsmeade and defenders of Hogwartsmanaged to crush his army.
