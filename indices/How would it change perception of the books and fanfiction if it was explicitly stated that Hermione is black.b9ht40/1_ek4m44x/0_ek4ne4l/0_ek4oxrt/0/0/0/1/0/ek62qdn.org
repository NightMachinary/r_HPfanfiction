Soviet partisans also had very few weapons which could reliably defeat German heavy armour, same goes for the Polish, Czechoslovakian and French resistances. That didn't stop them from carrying out sabotage, espionage, assassinations and full blown uprisings. Hell, look at how well the Finnish fought during the winter war to see what is achievable against a hopelessly stronger opponent.

And the tactics used by the Death Eaters in canon are not better than what you'd find in a "worst commanders of X war" compilation. A decent RTS player has a better grasp on how to utilise forces than what we see during the Battle of Hogwarts.
