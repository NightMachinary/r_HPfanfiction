The most likely scenario I can imagine is that people would misinterpret Draco's blood-purism-based racism of her /all the time/, and the "racism based on skin colour isn't a thing on the Wizarding World" bit of canon information would be hopelessly buried while people would take it even more for granted that the Death Eaters /really are/ just a wizard version of the K.K.K. than they already do due to the movies' depiction.

I'd like to think it wouldn't have affected shipping very much, except inasmuch as the hypothetical black actress playing Hermione in the movies (or, indeed, /any/ other actress playing Hermione in the movie) might not have been quite as unexpectedly beautiful as Emma Watson, and therefore might not have had as many teenage crushes on her.
