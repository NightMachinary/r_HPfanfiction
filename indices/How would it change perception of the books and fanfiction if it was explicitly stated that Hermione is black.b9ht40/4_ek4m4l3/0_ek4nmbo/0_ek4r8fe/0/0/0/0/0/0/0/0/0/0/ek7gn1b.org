Good luck with that. I'm not even sure what the point of your comments even was. We were talking about how black people can blush, tan and pale, and you came in here just to tEcHniCalLy all over the place?

  I'll have you know France does perfectly fine that way.

Yeah, I'm sure no French people would call themselves white. Get off your high horse. Plenty of French people are still racist fucks, just like anywhere else in the world. And most French people would still use white/black/Asian/Hispanic/whatever to describe someone if asked.

And you literally did it a few comments ago! You said light skinned black people should just be called white, and black people should be called brown. So what the fuck are you even talking about?
