Alright. We'll just classify the entire world into brown and white like you wanna do. Throw all the Hispanics, Asians, and light skinned black people into the white category, and the rest into brown. Or just forget about it all, I guess. When someone asks for identifying features, we'll just leave out a major one. Because that's racist, I guess.

I'm getting a little tired of a pedantic 16 year old European telling my African ass I should be calling myself what /he/ prefers, so I think I'm done here. Go outside and tell a black man he's not black enough and he should be called white. See what response you get.
