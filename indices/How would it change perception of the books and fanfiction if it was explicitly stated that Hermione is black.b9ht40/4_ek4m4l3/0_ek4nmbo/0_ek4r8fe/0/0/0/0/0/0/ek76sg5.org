This is some stupid nonsense. You're arguing for trivial semantic bullshit. Who gives a fuck? You show JKR a light skinned black person, she's going to say they'd black, not white, and just because you've got some weird ass problem with it doesn't mean we should start changing it when it's fine as it is. People can still clearly tell the difference between tanned white chicks and light skinned black girls.

  In the weird, backwards country that legally recognize the concept of "race"

I'm talking about when you sign legal forms and it asks you for your race. No light skinned black person will sign themselves as caucasian.

  A lot of people being wrong together does not make them right. This is precisely the same reasoning for calling Native Americans "Indians"
#+end_quote

Except, you know, race and ethnicity are two separate things. So no, it's not at all the "precisely same reasoning." Calling Natives as Indians because Columbus's dumbass was mistaken is completely different than calling light skinned black people as white just because it might be closer.
