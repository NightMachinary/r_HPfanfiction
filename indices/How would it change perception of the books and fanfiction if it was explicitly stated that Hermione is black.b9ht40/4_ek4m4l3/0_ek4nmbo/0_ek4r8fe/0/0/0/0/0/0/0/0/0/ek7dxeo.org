  Alright. We'll just classify the entire world into brown and white like you wanna do.

No, we'll stop classifying people like that altogether. I'll have you know France does perfectly fine that way. It does not prevent one from talking about ethnicity --- but the artificial "white", "black", "Asian" category are counterproductive nonsense and I just wish mankind would just outgrow that stuff already.
