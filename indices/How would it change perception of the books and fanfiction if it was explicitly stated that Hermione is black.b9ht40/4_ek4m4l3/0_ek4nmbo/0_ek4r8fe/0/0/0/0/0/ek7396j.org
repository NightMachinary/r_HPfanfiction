  The black people you're thinking of also aren't actually black. Just like white people aren't actually the color of white.

Yeah, yeah. And as a matter of fact, I /would/ push for these people's skin to be referred to by its actual color (brown) if not for the fact that society has taken to calling "brown" people of a /lighter/ shade of brown (such as those of Middle-Eastern or Indian descent), and so it would get needlessly confusing.

But I think we can accept calling dark-brown-skinned people "black" and light-pink-skinned people "white", by the same "eh, close enough" metric that one can call orange-haired people "red-headed".

In the weird, backwards country that legally recognize the concept of "race", perhaps they are, but I don't give much credit to those laws, you see.

A lot of people being wrong together does not make them right. This is precisely the same reasoning for calling Native Americans "Indians" (/everyone/ called them that, and, not knowing any better, most of the 'Indians' who spoke English accepted it as the English name for themselves), but at some point since then, we grew up and realized it was stupid (and vaguely insulting) to keep calling them that obviously inaccurate name, and so we managed to normalize "Native American" as the alternative.
