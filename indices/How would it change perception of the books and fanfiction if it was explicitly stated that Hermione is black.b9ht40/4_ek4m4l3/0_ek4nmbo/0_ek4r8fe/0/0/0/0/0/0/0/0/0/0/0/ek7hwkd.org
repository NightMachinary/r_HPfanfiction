  Yeah, I'm sure no French people would call themselves white. Get off your high horse. Plenty of French people are still racist fucks, just like anywhere else in the world

I'm sure they are, but I mean, it surely /helps/ not to institutionalize the idea.

  You said light skinned black people should just be called white, and black people should be called brown. So what the fuck are you even talking about?

I said that I can accept use of "white" and "black" as terms about skin color --- skin color is an actual, objective physical trait that you may want to use when describing somone --- replacing the more accurate "light pink" and "dark brown". I do not, however, condone use of the terms in a "racial" context --- "blackness" or "whiteness" in my conception is purely a matter of physical appearance, not ancestry. Ethnicity is a thing, but ethnicities are a lot more numerous and complex than "white", "black" and "Asian", for which reason this classification is a purely artificial construct. And since having the "race" construct has historically led to racist thinking and policy, we should steer clear of it.
