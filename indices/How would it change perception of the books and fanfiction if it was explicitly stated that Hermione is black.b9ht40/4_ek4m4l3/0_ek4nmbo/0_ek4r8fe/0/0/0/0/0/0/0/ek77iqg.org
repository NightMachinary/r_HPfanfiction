  I'm talking about when you sign legal forms and it asks you for your race.

Yes, that's the "backwards laws still recognizing the concept of race" thing I'm talking about. You may not know this (people from Anglo-Saxon countries often don't) but quite a number of European countries, such as mine, rightfully threw the whole "race" idea in the garbage can and left it there.

  Except, you know, race and ethnicity are two separate things.
#+end_quote

Yes, in that the latter is an arguably real thing, whereas the former is an old, harmful superstition. It still vaguely stuns me, as a Frenchman, that believing in the existence of "races" in the first place is not considered inherently racist in America like it is in France.
