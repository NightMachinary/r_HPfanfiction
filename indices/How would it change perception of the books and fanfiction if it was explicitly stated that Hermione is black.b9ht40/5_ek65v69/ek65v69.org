What I don't get is why is it such a big deal if Hermione is played by a black actress even if she is white in the books? Dumbledore was recast and the second actor portrayed him completely differently, Harry has blue eyes, Snape/Sirius/Lupin are all decades older than they should be, but nobody is particularly mad about that even if those changes actively contradict the books and, unlike black Hermione, don't make any sense within the internal logic of the movies themselves.
