Black Hermione gives a better reason for her SPEW crusade and refusal to see the Elves' situation as anything but slavery. White Hermione is just a stubborn sjw refusing to listen to the voices of the people she's championing. Black Hermione is exactly the same, but her passion for the project and stubborn refusal to back down has an explanation and a personal connection to her, more than just being that Hermione thinks they are slaves she must protect and save because... reasons??

It also would explain why Hermione is such a bossy outspoken know-it-all who must succeed in every avenue. If she felt she needed to prove herself or stand above the rest, especially as a black girl of wealthy middle class - and possibly migrant - parents, then she would bury herself in books and constantly word vomit knowledge and rules even when nobody asked for it.
