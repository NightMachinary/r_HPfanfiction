  Her world was doomed. She had even attempted becoming the latest in a line of Dark Lords in order to make people see the truth, but all that ended up happening was that Zee Potter was imprisoned with only the spirits of the dead to keep her company. Realizing this world had no future, she took a chance and decided that the Veil might be her only way into a new world. fem!Harry
