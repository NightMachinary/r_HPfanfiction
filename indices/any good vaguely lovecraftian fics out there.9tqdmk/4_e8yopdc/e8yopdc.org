[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7452468/1/The-Children-of-Set][The Children of Set]] is a short story heavily inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nameless_City][The Nameless City]]". The writing style is an homage to Lovecraft's archaic prose.

  Where shall I begin? Shall I tell you first of Salazar Slytherin, whose self-imposed exile was born of a cause older than any medieval text? Perhaps I should cast my line further into antiquity, to the spooling coils of that noble basileus, Ophion -- who journeyed far from the Nilotic valley of his birth to found his Attic kingdom -- or Cecrops and the infant Erechtheus whose scaled form drove some to madness? Or the gifted Herpo, that sorcerer who left us rituals shaped beyond and before humanity, and who first birthed the King of Serpents? I could craft a beginning from the stars themselves or start in the midst of my story with broken fingers scraping against bloody stone.

  No, none of that. You should begin as I began: with the dreams.
