The best explanations are efficiency and difficulty.

For the former, here is an example from the Standard Book of Spells Grade 1: the Levitation Charm. There are alternatives that exist like the Hover Charm or the Rocket Charm that do similar things, and yet people only ever use the Levitation Charm. The explanation is that the Levitation Charm is simply better at creating the desired effect than the others, so why bother using them. And spells have a range based on experience and skill, where one can achieve far more variable outcomes than previously. New spells are created when one wants to do something so different that they cannot really accomplish it with an already existing spell easily.

For the latter, /magic is hard/. The best way to understand it is that only really gifted people like Dumbledore or Voldemort really have a good enough understanding to tinker and experiment successfully. Not only that, but from what we know of Pandora Lovegood, experimenting with spells and magics is extremely volatile and dangerous. If you aren't careful, it could even kill you.
