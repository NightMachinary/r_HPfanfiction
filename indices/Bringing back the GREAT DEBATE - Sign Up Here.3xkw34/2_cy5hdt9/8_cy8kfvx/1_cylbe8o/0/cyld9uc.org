Nope. Given that they are both virtually separate nations with completely different tech trees, infrastructure, governments, cultures and security issues/concerns, there would be virtually no overlap between their respective legal frameworks either.

The better question is, if a wizard commits a crime in the muggle world, does the wizarding world acknowledge it as anything other than muggle baiting if they even bother to follow up on it? And would they care about crimes that don't necessarily entail a direct victim, such as smuggling if the magical components of the crime are confined to the wizarding world itself? After all, cocaine may be considered a rather obscure potions ingredient in the magical world. What would they care if an eccentric muggleborn wants to import a ton of the stuff-especially considering that it won't be consumed in the wizarding world at all? Weapons that would, after all, cause goosebumps to break out of any Law Enforcement official in the muggle world (tanks, missiles, helicopters) may very well merely qualify as curios to the local version of the DMLE.
