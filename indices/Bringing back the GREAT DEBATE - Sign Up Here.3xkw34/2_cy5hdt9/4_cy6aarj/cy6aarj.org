The problems is that many of the really great questions rely on information we are simply not given in the books. So here are some that still work without that background:

The magical world should end international statute of secrecy

Hogwarts should stop sorting the students into houses

Dumbledore was right in his treatment of Harry

The seeker position should be removed from Quidditch

Hufflepuffs are the most dangerous students

Muggleborns and muggle-raised children should be removed from the muggle world as soon as they are found (complete separation of muggle and magical worlds)

Goblins have the true power in magical society

All students should be taught occlumency

The DA was truly an illegal group, and the students should be punished for their involvement

Snape was justified in exposing Remus as a werewolf

Potions are more useful in War then Charms

Muggle studies should be compulsory (even at the cost of other subjects)

The Dursely's were justified in their treatment of Harry
