Let's not do topics like the Ron/Hermione thing this time. There are far too many pre-conceived notions involved in that, and voters are more likely to just vote for whichever side they support rather than anything to do with the merits of the debate. Choose a less hot-button topic this time. Taure had some good ideas in the previous thread iirc.
