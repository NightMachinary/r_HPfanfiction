you can message the admins about people constantly downvoting people like that. We had the same issue over in [[/r/toledo]] and one guy was using ~10-20 accounts to downvote everyone. He was banned. Granted, this is obviously not as extreme given that it's probably multiple users, but the admins might take the time to look into it.
