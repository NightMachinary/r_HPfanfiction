"Rituals, Blood Magic, Shamanism and Druid Studies" <- Nothing really wrong with them, but you should have showed instead of telling this bit. Their inclusion in the Prologue feels unnecessary, aside from trying to look "edgy" or showing how diverse! and different! your magic system is. And it fails spectacularly at that. My advice would be cut these out, just mention the movement or have a throwaway line mentioning the new subjects in Hogwarts, and expound on them in later chapters.

"Back to nature and its ways, that was the path the wizards took and it brought them nothing but a wealth of knowledge and good lifes." <- You make Hermione sound like an environmental hipster.

You also use the idea of muggle technology (no matter how advanced) > magic. I disagree with it fundamentally, but this isn't the place for that debate. My issue is that even in this hypothetical super-advanced scientific society, I just don't but kids not wanting to learn magic.

I mean come on, it's /magic/, for crying out loud. It's fantastical! It's adventurous! What kid wouldn't want that? A small fraction, I could accept. But a majority? You must be shitting me.

You also need to read up on your capitalization. You capitalize Goblins, but not centaurs. You capitalize English, but not arabic. Plenty of places where you don't use the right punctuation. You're mixing up tags and beats in speech.

For example: "Hi," John said. <- this is the right way to write a sentence.

"Hi," John chuckled. <- This is wrong. Because no matter how big John's penis is, or how awesome his magical core might be, or how many animagus forms he has - He. Cannot. Chuckle. A. Word. That's like trying to say he laughed a sentence.

It should instead have been written as, "Hi." John chuckled.

You also misspelled algorithms (not algorythms).

"Gringotts credit card" is cringe worthy as a concept. The magical world has always been isolationist. I don't see them developing a product that has no market, especially since the logical conclusion of less muggleborns is less interaction and therefore greater isolation.

You like to tell a lot. Almost 70% of the prologue seemed to be just info dumping stuff on the reader and make for a boring read. Look it over again and ask yourself, "How important is introducing this concept/idea to the story?"

Does it affect the plot? Is it significant to the world you're trying to create? Does throwing in a bunch of science terms really do anything?

If the answer is no to all of the above, then trim it down. Yes, I get that you're trying to show how advanced and science-y your society has become, but it's just too in your face. Little details, subtle hints and let the reader reach those conclusions on his own.
