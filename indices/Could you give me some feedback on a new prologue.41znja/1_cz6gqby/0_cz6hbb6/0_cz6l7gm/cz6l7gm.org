The breakdown of technology is trivial to the discussion of which is superior. It neither proves nor disproves which system is better.

No, I'm talking about. Hermione's tone on the off-world mining muggles are doing felt too much, to me at least, that it was something wizards were incapable of. How kids were choosing technology over magic.

How its implied that wizards couldn't find a solution to the exploding cybernetic hearts once they were aware of the risk. The first student dying I could accept. They didn't know what was happening. Once they did though? That stretched my disbelief. It should have become a non-issue for magic to fix.

This ties in to what I'm talking about with little details and subtle hints bringing the world to life. You may not have intended to write it that way, but these small things build up a picture that magic is now stagnant.

I guess at the heart of it is, I see all these advances in muggle society, but I can't help but wonder what about the wizards? What have they done? Returning to druidism or whatnot is fine, but does that mean they never found a means to have even faster communication? That they never advanced, made things more efficient, made their magical knick knacks better? That they couldn't, if they put their mind to it, take a vacation on Pluto or something?

Those improvements are exactly at odds with your New Movement idea.

Of course, now rereading it, it's apparent to me that some of my criticism is rooted on the fact that I dislike the idea of old magic = powerful magic. It just makes more sense to me that a magic system develops and gets better over time, not degrades.
