Ah, now I see.

The underlying idea was that the wizarding world of Britain goes into something like the Renaissance of magic. The only way why old magic = powerful magic would be if by some reasons magical knowledge degenerated like scientific knowledge did under the church. Stuff that was illegal, forgotten and whatnot gets found or pours into Britain from other regions of the world. The old becoming the new, essentially. I also wanted to explore the "alternative to progress". Progress as we know it is a very new idea. 200 to 300 years old plus or minus a few decades. Its a symptom of "hot cultures" and the way it strikes me, magical culture were inherently cold. The timeframe I'm writing in would be when this cold culture becomes hot due to a change of mindset within the relevant institutions. Basically from "If they want magic, they shouldn't have these mechanical hearts." to "We must change to allow these implants to work."

Anyway, i'm keeping your feedback in mind should I really write it, because in essence you're right. Especially about the "faster communication" stuff.
