Thanks for your feedback. I agree with most of what you say, especially about the stylistic choices I made. But then again, most of these things I never look at again. This one would be rewritten completely if I decide to make a story out of it.

But I don't get where you read this:

#+begin_quote
  You also use the idea of muggle technology (no matter how advanced) > magic.
#+end_quote

I had thought I made it clear that the Android is the only technology Hermione knows of that doesn't drop dead when it comes in touch with magic.
