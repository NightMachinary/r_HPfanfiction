Right off the bat, I can give you at least 50 solid points for creativity. This is what I like to see, new and novel ideas.

Overall, I thought it was pretty good! It was decently well written and certainly a cut above the average quality of fanfiction. Definitely good enough to read more. I did catch the occasional misplaced comma or slightly unfitting word, but these are just minor problems that could easily be fixed with a beta.

Ultimately, if you have a good idea for how the plot will progress (that is, if you're not just writing an /idea/, but an actual story), then you've got the makings of an enjoyable fic here.

*Edit:* On a second read, it has to be noted that you use a /lot/ of exposition. Maybe a bit too much? You might want to rewrite it so that it's more show (Hermione finds the acceptance letter for the Android) instead of just /telling/ the audience it happened.

The key thing to note here is that all these changes you're describing have existed for decades in this world, so all the explanations seemed more aimed at the audience than anyone. Write as though everyone already knows about these things, show them acting naturally around it, and you will be able to convey the same amount of information without just telling it to the audience.
