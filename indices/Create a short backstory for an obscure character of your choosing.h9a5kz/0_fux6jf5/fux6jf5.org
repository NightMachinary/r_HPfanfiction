Not as obscure a character as the others managed, but I did write a one-shot about Trelawney, and why she acts the way she does. Basically she hates her gift and does everything she can to suppress it. She also makes it her mission to discourage anybody with a true gift from taking her class so that they are not burdened like she was. linkao3(10051766)
