The Tale of Ignatius Prewett

The tale of this man is of one born to wealth. Wealth he never stood to inherit, as he was the second son. When he married Lucretia Black, it was to ensure his own future. That his wife came with a large dowry and a house made him swallow his reservations on blood-purity. He had snorted at the thought of the Blacks considering him a worthy husband for one of their daughters.

Lucretia, it turned out, was more sensible than her father and brother. She did not care much for blood purity, more so her family, and in time, they grew genuinely fond of eachother, though their marriage remained childless for now. With the Black Family behind him and his wife's dowry in hand, he opened several grocery stores in major wizarding villages, bringing a piece of the modern era to the wizarding community. Notably, these stores were magical-only, and sold far cheaper than many muggle stores, owing to magical assistance in production and transportation. Their rich assortment of magical odds and ends, including magical fruit, vegetables and other such things, helped sell the idea, and Prewett's Provenances, known more colloquially as Prov-stores, became a wizarding staple, making Ignatius a wealthy man of his own volition.

It was, of course, then, that his brother died, and his nephews soon followed. By testament laid down by distant ancestors, the Prewett family vault, holding a not insignificant inheritance, was to be held by a Prewett of the name until the line ran dry, and only then could it pass onto a daughter. Which is how he had ended up with it, as the younger brother. Upon his death, it would pass to Molly, his niece, and that would be that. He supported Molly and her ever growing brood of children with what he had inherited. She even named her thirdborn child for her, and he had been supremely humbled by that.

Not long after, Lucretia fell pregnant, and birthed their only child. A boy they had named Graham Arcturus, named for both his grandfathers. Which is when the dispute began. Molly still desired that the wealth go to her children, so they may live better lives, but Ignatius was torn. He had to obey his ancestor's will, and changed his own will accordingly. Graham would inherit everything.

That is how relations had soured between Molly and Ignatius Prewett. She did not talk of him any longer. So he became but a name on a Black Family Tree.

(The son is an OC, of course. Take this with a grain of salt, but this is what I was inspired to write.
