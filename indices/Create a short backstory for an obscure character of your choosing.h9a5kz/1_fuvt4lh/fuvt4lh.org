Time for John Dawlish redemption time.

*Auror Tactical Operations Centre. 2 days after the fall of Lord Voldemort.*

John Dawlish strode into the safehouse, casting a series of detection charms as he entered. Confident that he wasn't followed having done his surveillance detection run, he sat down, facing the large animated map of Britain riddled with dots. /Time to start hunting/, mused Dawlish.

In truth Dawlish was anything but incompetent. He reluctantly carried out his orders to trail Dumbledore after the Voldemort had been outed and let himself get hexed after explaining himself. After Dumbledore's death, Dawlish knew that the Ministry would soon be co-opted by Death Eaters. In response, he began sabotaging the Ministry from within.

Dawlish knew that by allowing himself to seem incompetent, the Death Eaters would in turn begin to underestimate him. /People believe what they want to believe/, was what Alastor Moody told him on the first day of Auror Selection. And when the wizarding world sees an Auror failing to perform even basic tasks such as escorting prisoners to Azkaban, they assume that he's been hit with the Confoundus too many times. Dawlish deliberately let Dirk Cresswell(and many others) escape. And after gathering intelligence on the majority of the Death Eaters, Dawlish let himself get hospitalized to begin hunting them down.

After trailing the majority of Voldemort's inner circle, he broke into many of their safehouses and began surveillance charms on various family heirlooms to keep track of their movement. Although Lucius Malfoy was set to testify about the whereabouts of the Death Eaters in exchange for a pardon, Dawlish didn't trust him to divulge all information on their whereabouts.

The day after Voldemort passed Dawlish began assassinating them. The Notts, Selwyns and Travers were killed, and he'd hoped that the Lestranges would retreat back to their ancestral manor. Dawlish had no plans to spare any of them. There was no reforming a group of genocidal maniacs hellbent on overthrowing the Ministry.

The radio in the study began to beep, prompting Dawlish to listen in.

"Lucius is planning to betray us," said Rodolphus.

Rabastan swore and began to pace back and forth in their study as Dawlish continued to listen in. "What's the plan then?"

"Kill him to send a message to any traitors within our ranks."

"The Aurors have the Ministry on lockdown," said Rabastan. "Haven't heard back from the Notts or Travers yet."

"Probably keeping a low profile," said Rodolphus.

"It's too risky to go after Lucius at the moment still. There's another way we can send a message. Go after the Weasleys, that'll send a message like it did with the Longbottoms. One of the blood traitors is dead and is set to have a funeral next week."

"Perfect. With the Ministry weakened as it is its the perfect time to strike. We'll have to move out of here by tonight since this place could be compromised. Avery has a place that Lucius doesn't know about in London."

/The Lestranges and Avery in one night is going to be one hell of an achievement/ mused Dawlish. He pointed his blackthorn wand to his watch, sending a message to Head Auror Gawain Robards.

/Positive ID on multiple Death Eaters. Requesting permission to engage/

Dawlish kept the message intentionally vague in case Robards was under the Imperious. It would be a mistake to assume anything given how the Death Eaters have co-opted the Ministry. He tuned out the conversation on what the Lestranges would do to blood traitors when Robards replied, a smile emerging as he read the message.

/You have execute authority/
