I'm not sure what you're asking for but...

I always pictured former Unspeakable Augustus Rookwood as being a Ravenclaw Hogwarts alumnai with no ethics whatsoever when it comes to new frontiers of magic. As for why he works with Voldemort. Well, he lost his mother to a tragic accident at the hands of muggles, and he's always wanted to resurrect her. Voldemort isn't disgusted by Rookwood's wish and doesn't view his work as taboo.
