I can lump this in under the general heading of Suspension of Disbelief, most of the time.

*However,* when someone does care about it and actually pays attention to this sort of detail, it really makes me sit up and take notice. I don't mean the clich√© where Harry uses the value of gold to bankrupt the goblins. I mean when there is a sense of an actual economy and financial implications to consider. It doesn't have to be exact or heavily detailed, just considered.
