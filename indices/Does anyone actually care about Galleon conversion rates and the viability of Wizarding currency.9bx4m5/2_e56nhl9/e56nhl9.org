Not necessarily viability, but it must have reasonable exchange rates or capital controls to prevent people from abusing the system or playing arbitrage games.

In my world, Gringotts set the exchange rate of Galleon into Pound at 5:1 ratio in the 1990s. A very limited amount of Pound could be changed into Galleon at same rate. Exchanging larger amount of Pound into Galleon went by the market price of 1 Oz of real gold, which cost roughly 200 Pounds in the 1990s and 1000 Pounds today.

Due to the massive appreciation of real gold price from 2000 to 2010, the exchange rate from Galleon to Pound is now 20.
