I don't think wizards need muggles for many things, thereby limiting the usefulness of muggle currencies for wizards. If we accept this, then banks are unlikely to want muggle currencies in exchange for Galleons, and likely only do so for muggleborns at a very limited rate (likely with some strongarming from the Ministry).

Thus, any kind of currency manipulation or trying to "profit" from this discrepancy is just shut down by the system itself.
