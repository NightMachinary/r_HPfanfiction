The methods I've seen in fics and liked:

- modified polyjuice on a chimp + animagus enforcement potion on the escapee in linkffn(The Perfect Azkaban Breakout by pstibbons);
- modified Draught of Living Death so that the escapee regains conscience upon hitting the water in linkffn(Remus Lupin, PI by Larry Huss).
