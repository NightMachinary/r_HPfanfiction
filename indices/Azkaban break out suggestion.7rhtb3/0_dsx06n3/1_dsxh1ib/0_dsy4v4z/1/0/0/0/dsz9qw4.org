Well it's magic so toss logic out of the window.

WoG isn't part of the official works. The movies are. Movies are more canon than something that the author decides to spout off after the fact imo.

That being said, it doesn't matter either way. This is fanfiction. Fanfiction by it's nature is not canon so arguing about what is and is not is senseless.
