I follow the wiki's policy --- film info /can/ be canon, but only where it does not /contradict/ the book- or WoG-lore or its spirit. And anonically, per Rowling's statements, Transfiguration rearranges the object down to a molecular magic --- it isn't a /sustained/ magical effect like Charms where there is a steady inflow of magic to "keep it up". Thus there's no logical reason it would end with the caster's death.
