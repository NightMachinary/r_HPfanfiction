I thought duplicated objects are permanent?

ah, I haven't read the Wonderbook: Book of Spells, but the wiki says that it rots or tarnishes more easily, not that it disappears. Although I guess that could count as "unraveling". Hmm, as far as rotting faster goes, does that mean that duplicated food would digest faster than regular food? lol.
