This isn't canon, though. How the dementors felt/acted around Padfoot isn't something that's ever discussed in the books. The only information we have to go off of is that it helped Sirius retain his sanity, because they had a lesser effect on him. For all we know, other than sensing people, they're completely unaware of their own effect on people.

All we can do is speculate.
