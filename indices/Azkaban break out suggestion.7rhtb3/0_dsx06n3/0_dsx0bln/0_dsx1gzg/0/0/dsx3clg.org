It's mentioned in canon that they can sense lives, but not individuals.

The Crouch deception worked because they left the mother behind. The dementors could sense only a dying person coming in and a dying person leaving (presumably Crouch Jr. was “dying” due to normal treatment to the dementors - unless I'm misremembering).

Whether or not a transfiguration of someone into a “dead version” of themselves would fool a dementor is likely open to interpretation, but I would assume not.

I would assume not mostly because they have a history of seeing through transfigurations. Sirius used his animagus form to lessen their effects on his own self, but the dementors didn't notice anything amiss until he actually escaped, likely because the transfiguration had no effect on their senses of his presence.
