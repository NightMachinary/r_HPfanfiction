Give someone polyjuice in the form of the prisoner, kill them and place their body in Azkaban, while removing the still living prisoner.

I'm not sure if its canon or just my headcanon but if someone is killed while polyjuiced they keep their polyjuiced form.

A fanfiction I read had something similar, where polyjuice was being abused heavily so there had to be a way to detect polyjuiced bodies. It made for an interesting subplot and if I remember had a twist where one of the dead bodies was someone unexpected/important. I can't remember what fic it was but it was an interesting premise.
