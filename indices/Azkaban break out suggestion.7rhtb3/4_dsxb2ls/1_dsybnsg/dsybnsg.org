Yeah thats basically what Crouch did, except the big problem is that only worked because he was an important ministry official (I forget if he was still Head of Magical Law Enforcement at that point, but whatever) so he had permission to visit his son with his wife. Without having someone on the inside they wouldn't be able to get the polyjuice to the prisoner, and that person they polyjuice into has to have permission to leave.

Ooh wait reread op and i guess that would be secretive as long as they have the ability/resources to pull it off.
