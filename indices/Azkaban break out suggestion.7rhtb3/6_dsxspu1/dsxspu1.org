Your base plan could work, but the problem is not making the prisoner seem dead. It is "How do your characters even get in?".

If you have to go about this with as small 'ripples' in the security as possible, you have to actually get in legally. You can achieve this through some law or rule you made up for this specific situation. But I would not use such a way.

Your plan also has to fit with what your characters would do. A 'Hit it till it dies!' kind of character doesn't seem like the kind of person that would go in using stealth.

Some things that can fix some of these problems:

Bribery/Blackmail: Find out dirty secrets about a person with permission to allow entrance to Azkaban. This is a standard way of making the entering of guarded buildings possible. This can also make less of a 'paper trail' if the guard is also the person registering the people visiting the prison.

Disguises: Azkaban is a classical '3 walls + bars' kind of prison, with full view of the path in the middle. Meaning, everyone you walk past on your way to the target might remember you. So make yourself stand out less from the norm. Or, make yourself not seem to be who you are. Ordinary makeup is popular in fanon for its 'non-reactions' to magic. You don't have to look good, just different.

Dementors: ...Yeah, Dementors.
