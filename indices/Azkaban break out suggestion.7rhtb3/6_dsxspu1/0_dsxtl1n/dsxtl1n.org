These points are most effective if what you wanted to avoid was a trail that would lead to you after an investigation. (except Dementors).

Going full stealth is another matter. It's based more on resources.

What can you use that allows for you to enter without the guards noticing?

What can hide you from the Dementors patrolling the floors?

What makes the other prisoners not notice your presence?
