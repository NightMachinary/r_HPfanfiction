Arrange the ambush and kidnapping of the Minister for Magic to replace him with a Polyjuiced doppleganger.

Have said doppleganger visit Azkaban, go to see the prisoners; when reaching the target one, hand them a newspaper, a Portkey of course.

Once prisoner disappears, remove fabricated corpse with skull-caved-in from a bag that's bigger-on-the-inside and put it in the cell; your target prisoner now appears to have committed suicide by beating their head against the wall, while in reality they've escaped.

Discreetly release the Minister for Magic, having placed a False Memory Charm on him/her so that they 'remember' an innocent version of the Azkaban visit.

Hmm...there's probably a fic somewhere where Azkaban escapes happen all the time. House-elves, portkeys, animagus-ing, swaps...to the point that more than 50% of the time, someone reported to have 'died in Azkaban' escaped and left a fabricated corpse.
