I tried once to find any hp/zombie apocalypse fics. But either Harry was super gay, or couldn't use magic for whatever reason.

I just want me a competent Harry (and co?) Running around scavenging and murderizing all the zombies. No "zombies are immune/attracted to magic" "i lost my wand and am now a muggle hurr durr" "apparition and expanded bags what are those? Combatmagic? Necer heard of it!"
