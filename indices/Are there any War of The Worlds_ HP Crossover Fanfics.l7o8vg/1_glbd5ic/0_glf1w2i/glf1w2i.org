Nah I get it. I'm currently writing a fic write now. It's not on the Fanfiction site yet though because I'm working all of it out. It's about a guy who traverses through the veil and yes, I know that is to some extent already used or overused depending on the person reading it. However my version is a tad unique. Some of the story was influenced by the other HP. Lovecraft, in other words. I don't think I will use even that much from that universe, but I will use the mystery and costs attached to such forms of magic. Abyssal magic.

Probably due to my degree in history, I've so far made up an entire magical history that follows along and originates from the Greek Gods themselves to make the lore of the story that much stronger. The veil itself however is used as a method of travel. A very dangerous method. In fact people who go through the veil usually don't end up where they intend, because it's random. And thus even my self-insert (its my first fanfic, I have to write self-insert for practice purposes) who finds himself in the recognizable world of HP eventually realizes that the enemies of the world are a little bit more fearsome... I plan to make voldy literally the worst possible villain you can fight. Chaotic Evil. But still smart enough to make some valid points.

Anyway, with every advantage the character has, there will be just as many disadvantages. And fear not, this is not some weird suck-up story where I am using the story as a medium for unrealistic wishful desires. I'm a 27 year old male. I'm not into that crap lol. In fact the character is going to be older than the main trio. More like a bodyguard or protector I suppose (I am the eldest sibling in my family). If anything romantic happens between the characters it will only happen if the story "wills" it. And it's not going to be sappy. I've never written romance before, so I think if anything it will be very light, and more likely to happen muuuuuuch farther in the story. Or... I'll burn that bridge when I come to it. Who knows? Also, I make use of clever word play but that also comes with the offset of some terrible puns. Please forgive me in advance [for instance, I made a Limp Bizkit reference/joke with the Rowling's name in one of the classic chapter disclaimers. Again... I'm sorry.]
