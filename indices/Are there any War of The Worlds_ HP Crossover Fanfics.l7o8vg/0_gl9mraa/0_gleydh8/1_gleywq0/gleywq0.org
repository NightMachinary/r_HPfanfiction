As an Empire fan and Sith fan, I'm sure I'd still somehow find some way to root for them. Lol. I've actually heard of Revenge of the Wizard before, but I never checked it out.

What I really wanna see is the Trio and Aurors working alongside ONI and the Master Chief, fighting multiple wars: Against the Covenant, Innies, and You-Know-Who. Before eventually finding Halo, and unearthing the ancient terror that is The Flood.
