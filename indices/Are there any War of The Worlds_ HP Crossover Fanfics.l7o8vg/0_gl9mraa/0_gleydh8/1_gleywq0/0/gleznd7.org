As for being an Empire and Sith fan I totally get it. I am too lol. But at this story makes you really hate them. It's very good at doing that. I mean I feel that despite that a part of me will always like the Sith to some extent even so, but I can't help that, as a lot of the Sith usually had good reason to become Sith, especially Darth Caedus.

haha... the flood or hivemind could be used in some extremely twisted way to allow Voldy to become what he always wanted to be. Immortal. But at great cost.
