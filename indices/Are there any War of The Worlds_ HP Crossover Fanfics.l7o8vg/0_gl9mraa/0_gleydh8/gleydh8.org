An HP Halo crossover? Never thought of that, but would love to see the banter HP would have with 343 Guilty Spark.

But yeah, slash just makes things weird. Anything that wasn't a character fixation before, just makes things weird, and is the cause for very unrealistic and awkwardly written explanations, in my opinion. It's usually a mess.

But anyway, seriously, read Revenge of The Wizard. Just started it back up again and the invasion seen of the Empire upon the Earth is jaw droppingly well written. Tragic, but by god one of the best scenes I've ever seen written into fanfiction. Really, */really/* makes you */hate/* the Empire. It's in one of the beginning chapters, but even the rest are totally worth it. Just give it a try. I'll [edit: try to ] link it here.\\
