Not really, just kind of:

- linkffn(A Muggle In The Magic World by Phoenixfox) ... the main heroine just kind of stumbles into the magical world (including Hogwarts), not really a student

- linkffn(The Divide by Beedle) ... Muggle (or Squib) sister ends up as the teacher of the Muggle Studies at Hogwarts

- linkao3(Tuum Fatum by DragonsAndOtters) ... Petunia gets finally into Hogwarts, but not the way she would like, perhaps
