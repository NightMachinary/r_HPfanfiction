Good lord that is some tropey garbage. It's like the author spent the first several chapters speedrunning all the worst tropes they could come up with.

Dumbledore bashing? Check, though surprisingly not as bad as I'd expect.

Hermione bashing? Check.

Room of Requirement used in non-canon ways? Check.

Harry becoming more magically powerful and good at everything because something something horcrux? Check. (better than something something magical limiters, but not by much)

Goblins being ever so impressed by basic decency? Check.

House elves are miserable because something Hermione something clothes? Check.

Marriage contracts? Check.

Daphne, the "Ice Queen of Slytherin?" Check, literally word for word.

Claim to <insert founder> family? Check, twice over.

Please, spare yourselves everybody, don't read this.
