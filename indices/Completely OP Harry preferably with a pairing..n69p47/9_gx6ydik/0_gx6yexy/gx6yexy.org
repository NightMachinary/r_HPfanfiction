#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is thought dead, killed at the Battle of Hogwarts. Hermione suffers the horrors of a forced marriage, to a Ron seduced by the lure of power. Trapped in this dystopian nightmare, Hermione's last fading hope is to somehow ask Harry to rescue her on his Deathday. Finally, after 5 years away, a hideously scarred - but beautifully alive - Harry returns to grant her wish.
