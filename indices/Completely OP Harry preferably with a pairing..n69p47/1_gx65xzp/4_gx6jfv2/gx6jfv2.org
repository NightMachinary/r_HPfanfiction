De-rec, for the original. It is simply not good. That's expected, as it was apparently the author's first story, but on a level higher than spelling and grammar the quality is severely lacking. Characterization is out of whack, events are tenuously strung together like a bunch of Christmas lights haphazardly flung over the front porch, and the prose is ... well, it /tries/ to be a clear window into events, no accessories, no dross. And that style can be done very well---Brandon Sanderson is an example of an author who's famous for it. But this isn't that. The POV shoots around like an amateur filmmaker who just discovered angles exist, and it is not pretty. The writer of this fic had a vision for what they wanted, and their skill just wasn't up to seeing it realized.
