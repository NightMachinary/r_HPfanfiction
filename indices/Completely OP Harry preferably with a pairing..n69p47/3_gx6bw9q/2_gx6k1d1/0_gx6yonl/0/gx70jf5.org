Liking stuff is subjective, yes. Some people, however, do not have the time to trawl through tons of coal before they reach diamond. If you want to read something that's written without regard for quality, be my guest. De-recs foster discussion. I see the same dozen-odd terrible stories posted on this sub day in and day out when there's much better out there. I'd like that to change.
