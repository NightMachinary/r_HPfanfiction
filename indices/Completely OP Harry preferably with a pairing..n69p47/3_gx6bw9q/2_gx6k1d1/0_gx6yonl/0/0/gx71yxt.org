Your coal is somebody else's diamond. Fic is free. You get what you pay for. Bitching about completely free shit reeks of entitlement.

If you're tired of seeing the same recs over and over again, how about you recommend something you DID like? Your solution is to throw something under the bus that didn't suit your personal tastes? Why is that?

I know nothing about the fic being discussed, but encouraging creativity is always going to have a better outcome than trashing it.

I miss the days of "don't like, don't read." Guess I'm too old-school for whatever the fuck has happened in fandom in the last few years.
