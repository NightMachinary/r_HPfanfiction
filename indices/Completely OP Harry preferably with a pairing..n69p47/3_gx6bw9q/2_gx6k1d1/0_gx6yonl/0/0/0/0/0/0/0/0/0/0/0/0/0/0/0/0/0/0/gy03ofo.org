You have absolutely no way of knowing that. You are assuming that. And even if chances are low, why chance it at all?

Hell, why are you even reading fics that you clearly weren't enjoying? That in and of itself is COMPLETELY mind-blowing to me. If I figure out I don't like a fic, I hit the back button and move on. It's very easy.

This conversation has been mentally exhausting and is a perfect example of why fandom today sucks.

I don't know how many ways I can say "this is an asshole move, please consider not being an asshole." Have fun trashing things people create for fun, I guess.

So... I give up. You win.
