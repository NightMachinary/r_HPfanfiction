For decades, "toxic positivity" specifically referred to people shutting down criticism of the /source material/.

It did not apply to fics because there was an inherent understanding that fics were not the same thing as a published book or a show on television. Fic has been and will always be a hobby.

It's yet another example of fandom language and attitudes changing over time, but I still firmly believe that shitting on somebody's hobby and is provided for free is gross. It's peak entitlement.
