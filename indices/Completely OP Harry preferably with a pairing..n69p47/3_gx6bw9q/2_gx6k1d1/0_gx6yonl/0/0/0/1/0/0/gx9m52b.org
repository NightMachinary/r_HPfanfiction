You're only a filter through your own lens, though. It's fine-tuned for you, personally.

If you're deadset on continuing to do this, you need to make that clear: "this fic wasn't for me because I'm not a fan of [this thing]. If you are also not a fan of [this thing], you might want to avoid it." See how different that rings than "don't read this, it's bad?"
