I have never seen the fic in question recced - ever - so that sounds mighty thin.

Don't shit on people's fics. One of the oldest pieces of fandom etiquette. This new attitude of "let's trash somebody's creation in order to generate DiScuSsIOn" is so very cringe. If you don't like somebody's fic, ignore it. It's not hard at all.
