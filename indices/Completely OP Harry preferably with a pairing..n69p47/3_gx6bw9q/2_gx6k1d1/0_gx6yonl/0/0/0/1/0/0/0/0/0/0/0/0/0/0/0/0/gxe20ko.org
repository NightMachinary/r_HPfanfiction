Look. I'll admit I took a peek at your comments to see if I could find any actual recs and you do seem like a decent person. It appears that we actually agree on a whole lot of issues - just not this one. I'm not 'misunderstanding' you or lack comprehension.

I just don't agree with your behavior when it comes to this. It has the potential to be harmful whether you believe it or not.

I am deeply protective of authors and creative endeavors of any kind, even if I don't personally enjoy the thing a person creates.

Be kind. Be mindful. That's it.
