I am entirely opt-in. I don't particularly care what others read. I am a filter for those who don't have the time to read everything that crosses their path, who only have a few hours between work, sleep, and their other hobbies. You have no idea of my innermost thoughts, and to assume you do is both pretentious and egotistical.
