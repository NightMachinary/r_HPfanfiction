Reddit results almost always populate at the very top of the search and several results include context.

Searching for the title has netted me plenty of results. Gotten several reposts removed from Wattpad and one result removed from some Thai fic site. (FFN does fuckall about reposts, but I still know they're there.) I'll continue using what has always worked. But thanks for the advice, I guess?

I'm hitting the road for a few hours and muting Reddit. I'm done with this conversation. It's clear that you are deadset on moving the goal posts. We seriously went from "they'll never see it anyway" to "they deserve it if they search for their own fic." (Yikes.)

You can have the last word, but never forget that fic is a labor of love and is provided to you for free. Have a good day.
