That seems like Lol Cows or whatever they were. That's a mean spirited, targeted attack on the author themself. That is not this, the comparison is fallacious. Also, what kind of author is egotistical enough to Google their own /fanfics/ to search up criticism? I can see the argument for not leaving reviews on the fics themselves, or you get depressed teenagers and whatnot. But if you go and actively search for criticism, find it, and get sad---well, “dead dove” was written on the bag. What were you expecting?
