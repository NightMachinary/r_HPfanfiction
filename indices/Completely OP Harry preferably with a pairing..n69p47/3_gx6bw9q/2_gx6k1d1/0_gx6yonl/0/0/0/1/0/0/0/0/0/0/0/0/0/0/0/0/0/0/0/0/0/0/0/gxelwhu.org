Then why do you assume they'll find a random Reddit comment if you acknowledge it's weird to say they'll Google up their own fic to find critics? If you're looking for plaigiarism and see a Reddit result, you know it's not on /here/ of all places. Also, just looking up the title is an odd way to check for plaigiarism in the first place. There are sites that scrape your entire fic and search for duplicates. It's faster, easier, and more accurate.
