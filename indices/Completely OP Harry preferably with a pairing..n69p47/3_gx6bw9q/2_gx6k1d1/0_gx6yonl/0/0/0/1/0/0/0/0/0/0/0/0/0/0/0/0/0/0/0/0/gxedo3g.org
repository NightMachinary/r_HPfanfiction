If an author Googles their own fic, Reddit will be among the top results within a few days of it being mentioned. No bots needed.

Apologies, I can see the name confuses you. It was called a 'meme' but it was a place where people anonymously posted about fics they hated. The anon meme was on LJ. At least the mod there had the foresight to put settings to NOT be scraped by search engines, so what they were saying wouldn't be a Google result. People still found it anyway.

I know of more than one person who left fandom forever, and I had to talk another author into calling the suicide hotline because writing was their main outlet for depression. (This is very common, especially among teenagers!) So yeah.

Should people be prepared and aware that they could get criticized by putting their work out in the public sphere? Yes. Will I ever be that person that makes an author feel like shit? Fuck no.
