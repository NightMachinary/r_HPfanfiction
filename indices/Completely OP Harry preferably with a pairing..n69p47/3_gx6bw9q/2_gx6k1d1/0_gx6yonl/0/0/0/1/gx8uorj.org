Yeah I call bullshit on that excuse. You are only saying de-rec, because you don't like it, not "to get people to try something else." You don't know if OP has read this fic before, and are only bashing the fic because you dislike it. Instead of fostering your views on another, why don't you actually do something creative in this thread, and recommend a story.
