Sure, sure. But---/again/---my little comment is entirely opt-in. Some people who manage botnets /might/ look through everything they've scraped and happen upon what I said.

But this ain't the anon meme. This ain't a Pepe frog, or a slur, or even a personal attack. The /one/ person it might emotionally hurt isn't going to see it.

So describe the harm it causes, because I see none.
