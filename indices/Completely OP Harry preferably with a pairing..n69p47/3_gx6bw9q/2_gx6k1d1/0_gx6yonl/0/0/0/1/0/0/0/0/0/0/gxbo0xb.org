  I don't look down on fanfic because it's lowbrow or whatever, in fact I believe it's a very cool, low cost route to get into writing in the first place.

Just coming back for one more thing, because this highlights just how much you are misunderstanding what fic actually is: every author writes for a different reason, and many of them are NOT interested in writing professionally. In fact, I know of /several/ authors who have used writing fic as a way of processing trauma and abuse that they've suffered.

Putting criticism of what could very well be someone else's therapy in the public sphere is a choice. I choose to not trash their effort. This is a very easy choice for me. I hope it will be for you someday.
