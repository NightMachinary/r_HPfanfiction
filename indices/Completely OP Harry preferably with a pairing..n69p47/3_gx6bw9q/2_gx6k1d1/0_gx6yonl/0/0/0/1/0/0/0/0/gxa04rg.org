Nobody cares what you do for a living.

You don't treat fanfiction as professional writing because it's not. Behaving as if it is shows an inherent misunderstanding of why fic is created in the first place.

We're obviously not gonna see eye to eye here. I'm the type of person who chooses not to be an asshole. You think you're entitled to trash somebody's hobby.

I'll take pointless ship wars over this new wave of 'let's publicly trash somebody's fic' shit in fandom. At least ship wars were entertaining to watch. Watching people trash shit they get for free is just sad.

Peace out.
