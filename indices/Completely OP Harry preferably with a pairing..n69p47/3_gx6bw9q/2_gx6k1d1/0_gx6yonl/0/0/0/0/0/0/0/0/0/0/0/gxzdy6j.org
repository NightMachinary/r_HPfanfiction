Alright then. Different scenario. I go into a random restaurant because I'm thirsty. I say, "hey mate, I just came in to see if I could get a glass of water. I don't want to order anything else." They agree, and give me some water. There's a frog living in it.

Apparently I'm not allowed to say, "Yo, there's a frog in this. I don't like that."
