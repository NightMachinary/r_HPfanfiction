You're welcome.

They will never see it anyway. The goalposts never moved. I think you're in the minority when you say you search your title for plaigiarism. It is in actuality /you/ who moved the goalposts---what happened to caring about young teenagers who might actually be emotionally affected by feedback? They're not about to search for or even likely care if someone crossposts to another site.

Mate, I write fanfic too. Of course I know that. I think you're being deliberately obtuse.
