Damn, okay, so how many people do you think usually author a single fic? Is it more or less than the number of people who usually visit this subforum?

Good point, guess I'll sell my car.

  Hell, why are you even reading fics that you clearly weren't enjoying?

Same reason you might try to beat an MMO. Terrible fics have a way of sucking you in in the hopes they'll get better, or that the ending will make it all worth it. The sunk cost fallacy ain't easy to beat.
