You misunderstand my intent. Do you think I want to ... what, ban low quality works from the internet? Censor them, somehow? Get people to stop reading them? To stop enjoying them?

None of that's going to happen. None of that is what I /want/ to happen. I don't look down on fanfic because it's lowbrow or whatever, in fact I believe it's a very cool, low cost route to get into writing in the first place. For a new writer, the most important advice I can give is to keep writing and stop caring about quality. Now, eventually you're going to want to improve your technique, but initially you want to just get your foot in the door, so to speak.

But I'm not talking to writers. I am speaking to readers, here, and especially to readers whose time is valuable to them. If I can help filter out the fics that won't interest that kind of person, then I consider the de-rec well worth writing.

I'm obviously not talking to you. Instead of trashing a random internet comment, why not just ignore it and move on?
