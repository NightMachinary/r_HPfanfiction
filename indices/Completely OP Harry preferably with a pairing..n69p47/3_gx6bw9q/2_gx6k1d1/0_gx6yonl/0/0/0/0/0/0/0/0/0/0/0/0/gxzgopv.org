That's the same scenario as the first. You're asking for a specific thing from someone who is getting paid to provide a service even to non-paying customers. That is their job.

What I will compare it to is walking into a free art showing where all the artists are amateurs, they don't do commissions, and they aren't selling anything. All the artists wanted to do is share what they created. You the type to complain that the art is bad in that situation, too?
