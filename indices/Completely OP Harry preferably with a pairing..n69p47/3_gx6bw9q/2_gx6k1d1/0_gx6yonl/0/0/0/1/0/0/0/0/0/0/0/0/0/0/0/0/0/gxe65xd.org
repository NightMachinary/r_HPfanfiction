Mate, if the author themself came over here and recommended their fic of course I wouldn't be a dick to them. But they're not. Again, my de-rec isn't /meant/ for the author. The author will in all likelihood never see or acknowledge my little comment. I doubt they even use Reddit. I'm speaking solely to potential readers, and even then to a very small portion of those.

If my actions were likely to actually cause harm, I'd stop. But they're not.
