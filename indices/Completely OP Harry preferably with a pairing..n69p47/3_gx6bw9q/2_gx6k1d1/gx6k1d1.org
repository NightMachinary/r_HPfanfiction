De-rec. Standard quality for this type of story, with an author who wants a powerful protagonist and sacrifices everything in the way of quality to realize that goal. It's almost meta, the way the writers of these kinds of fics mirror their protagonists. Core Threads even has the standard Lord nonsense, as well as this lovely little section:

  Nagnok looked at some more parchments that appeared in the drawer before looking Harry in the eyes. "My clan historically took care of both the Peverell accounts and the Potter accounts over the years. You can approve either myself, one of my clan, or any other Goblin you wish at this establishment if you have found some fault in our service."

  Harry tilted his head. "The Peverell accounts?"

  He nodded. "The Peverell family became the Gaunt family, which became the Potter line." He leaned back slightly. "My ancestor was the account manager for the Gaunt family for most of his life. It was a sad day when they passed."

  The boy thought. "Private Clerk Nagnok, would you be willing to become the Potter Family Account Manager?"

  A bright, sharp smile crossed the goblins face. "I would be honored, Lord Potter. As I understand you have an afternoon of shopping planed, we will get you your new keys created before you leave today and a full report of your holdings will be made, reviewed, and I will send you a list of options to your address. With your blood on file, we should have no issues contacting you from now on, mail-block or not."

  Harry smiled, and stood, shaking Nagnok's hand. "I am sure you will not let me down sir. Now, what do I need to do to access my school funds? Is there a way to access the money without visiting every day or so?"

  Before speaking, he turned to the teacher. "Professor, we thank you for finding our missing Lord, but as you are aware family business must be handled in secrecy."
