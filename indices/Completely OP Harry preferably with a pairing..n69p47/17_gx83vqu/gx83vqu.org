First one Harry in the new host for The Specter. AKA the spirit of God's Vengeance. One of the most powerful beings in the entire DC universe.

Second one he winds up, due to blood adoption, as a Half-Saiyan with a creature inheritance. It's a harem, and the writing is a little rough, but it's pretty entertaining.
