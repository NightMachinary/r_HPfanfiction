I wish I could remember the title, but there was this story about Harry and Tom being literal gods that have been fighting since the beginning of time. The caveat was Harry was always stupidly powerful with stagnant power, while Tom started out with basically no power but could accumulate it over time. If I recall correctly, they'd be reborn each time Harry defeated Tom, but the story being told was one of when Tom's steady rise has equalled Harry's and was about to surpass him while Harry freaked out about finding a way to stop it from happening. Something about the universe ending if Tom won, or similar. And I do believe â€˜love conquers all' is the eventual message, likely Harmony.

This basically turned into my own request thread, sorry. But I swear whatever this story is /does/ fit your desires.
