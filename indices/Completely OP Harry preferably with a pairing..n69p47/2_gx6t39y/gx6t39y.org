Stupidly OP Harry? Linkffn(Savior of Magic; International Triwizard Tournament; paid in blood)

There are going to be lots of heavy tropes in almost any of these, but these all strike me as somewhat different in one way or another.

Any of the full length fics by [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Jeconais]] feature a very OP Harry in a lot of different ways. I don't remember any with the pairings you specifically asked for, but I think you might enjoy them regardless
