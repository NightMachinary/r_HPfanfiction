Jeconais is consistently going to be Harry/Veela pairings whether that's Fleur, Gabrielle, or an OC. Hogwarts Dawn is pretty messy with that one. Hope is probably the most balanced of his OP Harry's. Perfect Slytherins is my fav, Harry/Wednesday crossover with Addams family crossover. Blue Steel is probably the most underdog he gets in some ways, with no real romantic pairing, just generally wholesome.
