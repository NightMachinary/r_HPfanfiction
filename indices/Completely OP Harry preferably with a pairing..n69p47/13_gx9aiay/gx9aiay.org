My favorite OP Harry Fic has to be [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4098039/1/Harry-Potter-The-Fifth-Element][Harry Potter and the Fifth Element]] by Bexis.

(Has nothing to do with the film 'Fifth Element' btw)

Really long chapters, well thought out characters IMO and has an eventual /spoiler/ H/HR pairing. And Harry is basically a walking Nuke...
