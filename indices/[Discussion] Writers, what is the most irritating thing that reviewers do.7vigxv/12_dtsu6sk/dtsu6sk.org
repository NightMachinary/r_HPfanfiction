I can think of many but I'll give my top 3 that come to mind. 1) Reviewer commenting and correcting purposely made grammar errors (made purposely while Harry is a kid and talks like that) and their own review has misspellings and grammar errors. 2) I don't mind vague "I love this" "this is awesome" etc, but when I get the rare "This is the best story I ever read" I'm like really? I know of a lot better and I think they just want me to continue on with faster posting. (It kind of makes you feel good seeing the review but then you second guess if they're telling the truth when they don't give any reasons). 3) The best is getting a review on chapter 5 on how they don't like the story and then reviewing again on chapter 6 and 7. Why are you still reading if you don't like it!!!? But I guess it's still good that people take the time to say something rather than Like, Kudos or whatever else.
