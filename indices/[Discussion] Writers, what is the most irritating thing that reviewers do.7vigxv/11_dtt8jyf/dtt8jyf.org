Everything [[/u/TE7]] said, and just one more point I get from HP reviewers ALL the time, which is just so pointless it actually drives me doolally.

Constantly get readers who complain x canon thing did or did not happen, or constantly ask about characters who aren't important in the new AU. If it's an AU, read the actual fucking plot. Don't ask questions about Dolores Umbridge when she's never been mentioned. Don't guess that Dobby is the culprit when Dobby was killed in /second year./

It's so unbelievably insulting for someone to read DOZENS of chapters, hundreds of thousands of words, and try to seem profound by asking basic questions that would apply to the canon text and, very obviously, not the AU. Why bother reading the fic at all?

Ditto leaving reviews on an AU with a complex and developed plot and saying shit like, "But when will Harry become Lord Potter?" as if THAT shit was canon too. Like, this is why I prefer to post on Ao3 - I get fewer comments, but the median age is so much higher. I would genuinely ban under 16 year olds from commenting on any of my stuff if it were possible.

And another thing is the entitled reviewers who comment stuff like "I love this! Hope it doesn't turn out to be slash..." or stuff like that. I genuinely couldn't give a fuck what you hope the fic will or won't be. I especially don't care if you're going to phrase it like a catty wife in a sitcom, supposedly mumbling it under your breath as if I'm going to feel sympathy for you. If your review is just passive aggression aimed at the author, it's probably not worth reading.

I APPRECIATE that not every reviewer is comfortable leaving concrit or a complex comment, but when you get the same idiotic, one-sentence reviews, of COURSE it's going to grate on you. I don't think it's entitlement so much as wishing the amount of effort you put in as a writer would be reflected in the response of the readers.
