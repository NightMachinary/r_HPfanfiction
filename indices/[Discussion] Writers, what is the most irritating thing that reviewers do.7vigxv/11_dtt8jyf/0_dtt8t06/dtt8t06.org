  I APPRECIATE that not every reviewer is comfortable leaving concrit or a complex comment, but when you get the same idiotic, one-sentence reviews, of COURSE it's going to grate on you. I don't think it's entitlement so much as wishing the amount of effort you put in as a writer would be reflected in the response of the readers.

This is big. I'm providing free entertainment that often takes me about 40-50 man hours a chapter of planning, writing, and editing and more often than not you can't even get a 'thank you' instead it's just 'you need to update more!' or 'nice!'. Calling me entitled because these reviews annoy me is laughable. I guarantee anyone who says that that if I were really 'entitled' I wouldn't have published a million words of free writing content on the internet.

The fact that readers hold writers to a much higher standard than they would ever hold themselves is part of the problem.
