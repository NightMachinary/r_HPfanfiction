Prefer poorly written, OOC fics to mine. (insert sarcasm emoji)

To be honest, after reading through the comments here, I realize I've been lucky. On the one hand, I'm not that popular (this is the "cloud with silver lining" view) so I don't get badgered by scads of random lazy readers; on the other, I appreciate every comment I get, including "Wow!" and "Holy shit" and "Thanks for posting."

It probably has something to do with writing one-shots. Authors who have fans following their WiPs are more likely to get poked by impatient and possibly entitled nitwits, or by people who simply want to engage in some way. "Update soon!" is shorthand for "I'm eager to read more!" so it doesn't bother me. Irrelevant, shortsighted questions out of left field - well, I've never actually had to deal with those. My readers are pretty respectful, plus they generally have a handle on the kind of stuff I write. I've never even been on the receiving end of the classic "Why are you writing /slash,/ ew, ugh" bullshit that used to clutter up the premises.

So I'll have to go with a well-intentioned but obnoxious remark that I've been guilty of myself and for which I will someday spend time in a lesser circle of fanfic hell. There are few things more disappointing than a reader who gushes, "Oh, fantastic! I don't have time to leave a long comment now, /but I'll be back later to tell you all the things I love about this fic!/" Only to never be seen again. (Mea culpa, authors whose hopes I've dashed. I've sworn never to type those words again, no matter how tempting they are or how sure I am that I really will be back, bristling with superlatives and favorite quotes.)
