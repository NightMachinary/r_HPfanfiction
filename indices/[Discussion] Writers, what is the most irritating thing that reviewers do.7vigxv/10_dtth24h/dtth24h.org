Although I've written a fair bit, I haven't actually published any fiction online. I'm planning to in the near future, however. But from a reader's perspective, a lot of authors that I've seen have... hm. Pressured is the wrong word, but have certainly made a point of telling everybody that they want every reader to review. And a lot of people don't write themselves and aren't always able to give detailed constructive criticism.

People seem also to be increasingly short on time and if they're following several stories and have to spend time on every update themselves.. well, some would see it as a chore. Even as a writer, I'll sometimes completely mind-blank when it comes to feedback. No idea why, it's just something that happens. I think that's why some people end up leaving slightly inane or not-particularly-useful reviews. - They feel like they should say something but they don't really know what to say.

I have seen an awful lot of people who question decisions, research, pairings etc. and it irritates me even on other people's work. Especially when they reply and the reviewer turns it into an unnecesarry debate.
