Not read correctly. I get rather irritated at reviews that begin complaining about something that doesn't even happen, or does happen but they think it didn't. It's especially bad if it's a guest review, so I can't passive aggressively tell the person they've misread. I end up just deleting these ones if the only thing about is them being outright wrong. Like dude, fucking read correctly.

Motherfuckers.
