I often review differently depending on the state of a story. If it's complete - especially if it's been complete for a long time - I'll often leave a very brief comment. There doesn't seem to be much point offering detailed feedback on a story the author is long finished with. If there's something in particular that stands out - good or bad - I'll probably mention that, but that's about it.

On stories still in progress, though, I'll almost always try to offer some detailed thoughts. I was a bit reluctant at first, because it seemed presumptuous to tell someone writing a story for free what I personally thought of their work, but after I got some nice replies from authors I realised most of them appreciated the feedback. One author was less than friendly, so I simply haven't reviewed any of their stuff since.

With the positive responses, I've ended up being a beta for Starfox5 and presently for TheEndless7 and it's been an enjoyable experience.

I really wonder sometimes what motivates the more pointless reviewers. One that stood out on Limpieza de Sangre was simply "I don't like Hermione.", and was the subject of a couple of emails between myself and TE7. What on earth is that review supposed to achieve? Does it reference Hermione in general or the version of her in this story? Did the reviewer really think TE7 was going to go back and write her out? And at a more basic level, does he think anybody actually gives a flying toss?

For my own stories, I appreciate most comments even if it's just a couple of nice words. The only one that irked me (mildly) was one that pointed out a continuity error that I already knew about, while missing two others. But even that meant someone had read my stuff, and that's a nice feeling.
