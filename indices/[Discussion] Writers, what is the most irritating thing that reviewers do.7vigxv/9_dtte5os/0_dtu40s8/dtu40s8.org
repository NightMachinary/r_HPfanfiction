Ignore this asshole.

He is terrible and once sent me a review about how characters in my story wouldn't shower.

Also that review is driving me batty. Is it HERMIONE in general or MY HERMIONE. Does he have no empathy for the girl who was sexually assaulted?! Did I handle that poorly?! Was there something that I needed to change!? WOULD SHE HAVE A SHOWER?!

Inquiring minds want to know.
