Haven't gotten to the point in the story yet where that mystery is "resolved" since frankly, it is kind of a red herring. Slughorn is found murdered and the reviewers were like "Ah yes, the poisoned drink", which I had completely forgotten about or thinking that Voldemort was tying up loose ends. It was more of an opening act, kinda like the White Walkers at the very start of Game of Thrones while most readers still think that it is the main plot.
