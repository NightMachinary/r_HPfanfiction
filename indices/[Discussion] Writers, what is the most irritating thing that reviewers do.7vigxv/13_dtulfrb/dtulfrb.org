I'm generally happy with almost any reviews I receive, however there are two types that get on my nerves. First, reviews that make no sense. Reviews that merely say "Good story" or the like aren't the best, but I understand the sentiment contained therein. But it's things like a recent review I received saying, "bacon is the cheapest vegetable" when I haven't written anything about bacon or vegetables or things that are cheap that really have me scratching my head. I really enjoy responding to my readers, but how do you respond to that? What does that even mean? I've spent a significant portion of my free time writing this and offering it up for free, and when someone actually takes the time to review, that's what they've got to say?

Second, reviewers who bring their fandom impressions and biases to your stories and argue about them, even if the point they're referring to is absent. I see this a lot with Ron's character especially. Sure, Ron has plenty of flaws, but I think canon portrays him as a generally good kid with his heart in the right place, even if his emotions and temper get the best of him sometimes; he's not the monster that a lot of people make him out to be. I had one person tell me they were abandoning the story because I dared to have Ron be friends with Harry and Hermione, and another argue with me that Ron was never friends with Hermione to begin with. It just makes me shake my head in wonder and confusion.
