I am the sort of writer that really likes meaningful feedback. The most irritating reviews to me are the ones that simply say, "Great start!" or "I love it!" or "OMG Harry Ginny so cute!" I've learned that when I have my husband read my chapters, I have to ask him specific questions to get him to give me feedback on specific areas. Unfortunately, you can't really do that in most online review systems. This is why I like AO3's kudos system as a way to leave a token of appreciation if you don't feel moved to write a review.

I understand that not everything I write is going to be everyone's cup of tea and that's fine. I've certainly run into things that I didn't like. If you have something negative to say, then say it and tell me why. Don't just say, "I hated this." Say, "I hated this because I do not agree with your premise that everyone in the wizarding world would have been better off if Harry had run off to be a lion tamer and gotten himself eaten." Fantastic, got it. You don't like lion-tamer Harry.

If you like my dialog, say so. If you like the way things are described or a certain scene or a particular turn of phrase, let me know. If you find something awkward or poorly worded or you feel a character was acting very out of character in a scene, let me know. I can't improve if I don't know what's wrong.

I'm not a fragile child that will come to pieces because you didn't like the picture I drew. Yes, you're going to get the busybody reviewer that will take you to task because you have them cursing too much or having too much sex or not enough sex or any of a multitude of other things that fans of such a cherished and popular property hold dear, but that's just noise. If you want to do me a solid, tell me what you liked or didn't like and be specific. And also answer questions when I reply to you. It's only polite.
