I think you unknowingly point out a major weakness in Fanfiction. The chapter by chapter updates, as compared to the release of a completed novel/story. For instances, I did not pick on Phoebe being Emily, and having now gone back and read those chapters with that in mind I am now smacking my head against the wall (seriously I have read this story twice through I like it so much, and I did not pick up on that).

However, you are still correct, you as the author shouldn't have to say that Phoebe is Emily to your readers. That does not mean however it, and I am merely using this Phoebe/Emily scenario as an example, shouldn't become explicitly known in the story later.

This is often done, a mystery has small hints revealed at first, and as the story goes on the hints get progressively larger, until it is finally explicitly revealed. This literary device works really well in a completed story, because the time it takes to find out the mystery, or see the twist or...etc, is simply the time it takes to finish the book, as compared to Fanfiction which comes out chapter by chapter and can take years to be completed. I think this leads to people not grasping that the author is trying to tell and flesh out a full story, that will have things which won't be fully revealed until the end.

Anyways, I greatly enjoy your work, so I do hope you do not give up writing Fanfiction, and I look forward to seeing wherever you take us in the story.
