Something authors can do mitigate this problem is finish the story (or at least a story arc) before you post the first chapter. Even if you still have editing to do or are running it through betas, that allows a reasonable and /predictable/ posting rate as well as being able to tell readers in the first chapter "hey, this is already done and has a crafted plot rather than making things up as I go".

I actually think the strengths and weaknesses of the episodic format are largely ignored in fanfiction, unfortunately.
