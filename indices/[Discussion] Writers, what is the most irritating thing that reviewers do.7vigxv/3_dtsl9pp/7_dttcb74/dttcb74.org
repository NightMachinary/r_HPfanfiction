  "You know, you've really wasted a lot of time on a hobby that you're starting to not particularly care about. And every time you post something you get so excited to see what people think, and every time you get the same innane responses to the point that it actually depresses you. Maybe it's time to not do this anymore."

I had the exact same thought process. Other than you, I just ended up packing all that fanfiction stuff in a folder, wrote "/Abandoned" on all my stories and started new, away from fanfiction.
