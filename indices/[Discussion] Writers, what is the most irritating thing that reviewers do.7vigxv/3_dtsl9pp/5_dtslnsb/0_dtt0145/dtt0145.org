I've gotten this as well on one of my fics...some commented that a "tom possessed ginny starts the scare" in reference to the chamber of secrets despite there being no reference of Tom, the diary, Ginny, or the Chamber of Secrets being open. (Admittedly, it is /found/ just not /opened/ the way it was in canon, and certainly not by Ginny).
