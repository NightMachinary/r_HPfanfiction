If it helps, all this stuff happens on literally any web serial ever(that allows reviews/comments), not just fanfiction. :P

I'd like to think that I generally don't do these things, but I'm definitely guilty of asking for updates. Usually only after a long period of time with no update though (like there is a weekly update schedule and then there is no update for a month or 2). Do you mind people asking when the update will be if (assuming you have a schedule) you've missed updates?
