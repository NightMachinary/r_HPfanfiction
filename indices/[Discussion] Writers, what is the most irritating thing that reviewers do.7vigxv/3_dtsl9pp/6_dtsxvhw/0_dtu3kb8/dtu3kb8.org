Updates come when they are ready. That can be a week, that can be a month, that can be a year. Asking about it will not change that. I managed to do about 12-13 chapters of LdS on an update a week pace last year. That pace is nuts for me as it meant I spent three months doing pretty much nothing but fanfiction in my personal time.

You can ask. There's a 90% chance I'll ignore it. A 9% chance I'll respond with a trollish comment and a 1% chance I'll answer with an honest update.

I will say, and I can only speak for myself here, but I find questions about updates to be the most demoralizing thing I get from fanfiction. I would rather be flamed because I at least find humor in that. Asking about updates is a surefire way to get me to go do something else.

Part of this is probably because I'm pretty contrarian by nature. So when I get a review that goes 'OMG UPDATE SOON' it comes off to me like the person is telling me to do it, and I immediately just think 'nah'.

As I've said in other posts, the way to make me write faster is to make me excited about what I write. That means talking to me about the plot and the characters and what's going on. Not telling me I haven't updated in a while. Fun fact. I'm perfectly aware of how long it's been since I last updated. I don't get that message and think 'oh geez! It has been two weeks since I posted something. I better get on that!'
