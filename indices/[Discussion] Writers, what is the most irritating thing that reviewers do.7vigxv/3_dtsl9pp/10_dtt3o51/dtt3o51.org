I can mostly empathize, but I personally don't get so hung about about so-called meaningless reviews (the ones that congratulate or ask if updates are coming (unless you just recently updated, lol)). Since there's no useful place to discuss a particular fic on say, FF, people will just use the reviews sections for general communication. And I don't mind it, as there are usually enough people who will point out any mistakes worth addressing for me (even if it's just a few).
