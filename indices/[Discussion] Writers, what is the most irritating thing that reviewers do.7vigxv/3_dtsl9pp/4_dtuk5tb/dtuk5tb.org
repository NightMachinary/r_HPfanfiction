I understand where you're coming from, my stories haven't gotten nearly as many reviews as yours, but I've received enough to understand the frustration that some reviews can cause. For instance, on my current story, I had a comment (I don't remember if it was a review or a PM or what) that warned me that Harry was turning into a Mary Sue. And this was in the third chapter while I was still in the middle of exposition and almost nothing major had happened yet. Utterly ridiculous.

However, I've found that like most things in life, if you put a positive spin on those idiotic reviews, it can lessen the rage/depression that they might cause. I say to myself, well, that's one more review in the tally, and if people sort the stories on FFN by review count, that's one review closer to more people reading my work and maybe commenting with something thoughtful.

PS, Thanks for the mention that you like my reviews, I'm honored. I've yet to get to your latest chapter - it's on my list of things to do when I actually have enough time to enjoy it - I'll be sure to try and leave a thoughtful review!
