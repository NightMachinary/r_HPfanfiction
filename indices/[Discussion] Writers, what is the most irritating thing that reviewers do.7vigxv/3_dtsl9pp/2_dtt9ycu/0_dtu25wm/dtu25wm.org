Ish. It's not like I'm foaming at the mouth when I see 'Update please'. I usually roll my eyes and wonder what the person thinks that they're accomplishing.

Going out of your way to write a full sentence is a gigantic step above that. I'm still not really going to put much stock in it, but you at least took the time to formulate a nice thought about it.

Ideally, I'd prefer something like, "Hey I'm really enjoying this. I loved when X did X and thought that interaction was neat. I look forward to more." Most of the reviews i get I don't think people even bothered to read the story. Something that indicates the reviewer did read the story cheers me greatly. Something like that makes me far more motivated to write than 'update please'.

I've always joked that if you want me to write faster, get me excited about the story. I don't know if it's attention whorey, but if I didn't want to discuss my writing, I wouldn't post it on the internet and excitement is contagious.

I mean to try for some perspective. My original plan of Limpieza De Sangre is dated March 5th, 2015. I started planning the fic I'm currently working on almost THREE years ago. I started publishing it in January in 16, and focused on it in earnest around August of 16. I've been working in this story in some way or another for almost three years. I'm sick of it. Reading what other people enjoy about it helps revitalize my interest in it. I mean it was three years before I even wrote the one scene I wanted to with Umbridge. Writing takes a lot of time and effort. At least put some in to reviews so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time and effort.

And I'm literally asking for a sentence. Tell me what you liked or even what you disliked. I don't care. Just make me actually think someone is reading it!
