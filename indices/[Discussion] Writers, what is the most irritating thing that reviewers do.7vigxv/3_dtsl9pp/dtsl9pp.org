A few days back when there was a 'Readers what should Writer's do better' thread I almost flipped out and made a 'What Reviewers Need to do Better'

I would say that 80% of the reviews I receive are utterly useless and pointless. Most chapters I publish I look for specific names on the reviews because there are people who I know will provide insight that is useful to me. But the vast majority just don't. As a whole, that doesn't bother me. What bothers me is entitlement and expectation.

The thing that irritates me the most is when the reviewer clearly hasn't read the chapter or the story. These happen constantly. I recently received 8 reviews on the first 8 chapters of one of my fics from the same user in under 45 minutes. I know this user didn't read 80,000 words in 45 minutes. Four of them came in under 8 minutes. Could they have read it and gone back chapter by chapter and posted after the fact? Sure. But their review also says things like 'EIGHT CHAPTERS IN AND NO ONE HAS EVEN USED A WAND' well half of chapter six was devoted to learning one specific spell. Instead your review of six ignored that and whined about quidditch and posed a High School level discussion question to me that was both embarrassing to you and insulting.

This happens constantly with fanfiction. People don't read it that closely, and then miss things and whine about it later. I shouldn't have to tell you that Phoebe is Emily. It's given away multiple freaking times in the text. Rather than reviewing with things like 'Harry's internal monologue seems out of character, he's not that violent' maybe think about what you should know, from having read Harry Potter, what is actually IN HIS HEAD. Didja notice how the narration shifts to make that seem like he's having a conversation with someone? Who could he be talking with? Don't ask me questions in reviews to things that you just missed in the text. I'm more than happy to talk about such choices in the story. But then cite what you have a question about. Because chances are i already addressed it.

The entitlement from reviewers makes me crazy too. Nothing like having spent 40-50 hours (coincidently, I did the math and since I began fanfiction in 2010, based on chapter averages, I've devoted about ten percent of my life, including sleeping time..to writing fanfiction...so....that's pathetic.) writing a chapter and having the FIRST THING I SEE ABOUT IT be "UPDATE PLEASE!" Go die in a fire.

Reviews like that make me sit there and thing, "You know, you've really wasted a lot of time on a hobby that you're starting to not particularly care about. And every time you post something you get so excited to see what people think, and every time you get the same innane responses to the point that it actually depresses you. Maybe it's time to not do this anymore."

People go 'you need to have thick skin' and to an extent you do. But really, it's more that you need to have a super high tolerance level for bullshit.

And the third thing that irritates me is shippers. Fuck your ship. I am not writing a blank and blank story. It doesn't need a cutsey name. You didn't pick up A Game of Thrones to see if Eddard was going to bone Cersei. I'm trying to write STORIES here. With Plots. Characters, and the like. I'm not writing something so that Harry can fuck Daphne. I'm not saying my shit is nearly as good as anything published. But I'm trying to do a lot more than just force random characters into romantic relationships. And the comments I get ignore that.

Instead I have a scene where Harry comforts a Hermione who was sexually assaulted, holds her, cares for her, and acts exactly how a best friend should act. And I get reviews of 'Ugh why didn't you say it was Harmony. Abandoned'. I'm supposed to value that opinion? Harry is obviously attracted to a different person in this story. And obviously treating Hermione on the basis of other things that have happened to him and things he's seen. And really just trying to be a nice guy. It's possible to comfort a female and not be in love with her. And given how fond I am of foreshadowing and juxtaposition, it's possible for Hermione to return the favor coming up on a hugely important event in Harry's life. But the fact that I already know what's going to happen in the story often seems lost on most reviewers.

Honestly if it wasn't for Rpeh, RAFAN2421, Raven3182 and a few others. I'd have given up on this pursuit long ago.

Edit: Oh and Tonythepony left quite a few good ones recently too, so thanks for that.
