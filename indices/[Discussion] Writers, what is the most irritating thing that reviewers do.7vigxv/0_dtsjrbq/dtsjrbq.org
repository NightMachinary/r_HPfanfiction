I had a guy leave a review for every chapter while only writing one to three words each and ending every single one of them with his username. Happened a couple hours ago. Was pretty happy to have gotten twenty-five reviews for the latest chapter. Turns out nearly half of them were pointless and not even about the latest chapter.

On a different story, one person thought it would be useful to quote random mistakes (grammar, spelling) without providing context and make his reviews consist of mostly abbreviations and I couldn't figure out what he was talking about in half of the cases. He also pointed out several nonexistent plotholes because he kept misunderstanding things.
