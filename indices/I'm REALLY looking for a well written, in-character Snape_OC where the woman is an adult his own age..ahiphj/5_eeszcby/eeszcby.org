I'm pretty sure this one I'm currently reading is building up to be exactly the kind of fanfic you're describing:

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12302061/1/][Speaking in Tongues]]

By: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2237626/original-star-girl-78][original-star-girl-78]]

A trader on the edge of the wizarding world is about to turn Snape's world upside down.

​

Description is a bit vague, but basically an OC teacher comes to Hogwarts to teach foreign languages and to work with Dumbledore to figure out how to speak Parseltongue. There is some mystery between OC and Snape that has not been revealed yet, but I have guesses upon guesses as to what it could be. And OC Professor is slowly developing feelings for Snape. It takes place during CoS year, and fits very well into canon, and it's very well written. It's a WIP, and I'm enjoying the hell out of it right now.
