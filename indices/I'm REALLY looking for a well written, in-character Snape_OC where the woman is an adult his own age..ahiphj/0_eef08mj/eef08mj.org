I desperately ship Theophany Knapp and Snape in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15719628/chapters/36541374][People of the Goddess]], but... well... it takes place during Book 7, and we all know how that ends for Snape. The fic isn't complete, so I have no idea what kind of a relationship, if any, they could have. If I had to guess, the author will let us at least glimpse some sort of relationship, however brief, before he dies, but tbh I'm not sure.

Also, side note -- there are several pieces of fanfiction that capture Snape really well, but this is one of my favorites.
