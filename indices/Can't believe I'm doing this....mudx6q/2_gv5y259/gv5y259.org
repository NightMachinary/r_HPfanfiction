Like, exactly how absurd of a fic do you want?

linkffa(1471) - [[http://hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=1471][King of Kings]] is ridiculous. He's randomly kidnapped by a goblin who brings him to some palace somewhere and is told that he's the emperor of magical rome (among other things), and he's like 'okay, makes sense'. And then it starts to get crazy. (Honestly, most of the fics from hpfanfictionarchive are ridiculous, so, like, browse around the political or op tags, k?)

There's also that one that's been linked a lot recently with a 5k word inheritance test at gringotts, followed by Harry getting a harem (and the repeated typo of 'so smote it be' which made me laugh way too hard.) I think it was in the drinking game thread?

... I'm trying to think of a good one, and I just... can't...

So those two. There ya go.
