I've written a few stories where muggle weapons and hand-to-hand play a significant role. A few use enchanted guns, too - though just in the "silenced, cooled, recoilless gun with infinite ammo" role, not in the "shoots magic bullets" role.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10959290/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Spygirl]["Harry Potter and the Spygirl"]]: Mostly British weapons from the 80s used James Bond style.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined]["Divided and Entwined"]]: Modern small arms and explosives as well as military tactics used in a guerilla-style civil war alongside magic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution]["Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution"]]: Military and Mages fighting side by side, including enchanted small arms and vehicles, in a more conventional war.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]]: Naval action, WW2 style - sort of. Including shore bombardment. Magic's more in a support role, the war's fought with naval weapons.
