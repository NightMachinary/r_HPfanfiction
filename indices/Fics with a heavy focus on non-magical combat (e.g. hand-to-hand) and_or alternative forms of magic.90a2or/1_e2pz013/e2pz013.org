[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8775833/1/Per-Ardua-Ad-Astra][Per Ardua ad Astra]] a SG:Atlantis crossover and it's side fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290216/1/Khaveyrim][Khaveyrim]] a NCIS crossover set in the same universe as Per Ardua are good. the premise is that in expelling Voldemort from his mind in OotP Harry loses his magic but gains the ability to sense and manipulate the air, basically controls the weather, and joins the RAF. The author was applying/is in the Royal Navy and has studied Military history so his knowledge of military tactics and how modern fights are played out is pretty good, and his writing of the combat is very enjoyable. I've never watched any of any of the StarGate shows or read any of the SG fan fictions but i found Per Ardua to be easily readable without any prior knowledge.
