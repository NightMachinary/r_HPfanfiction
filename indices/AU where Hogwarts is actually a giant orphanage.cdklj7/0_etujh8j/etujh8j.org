Hogwarts has a fifth house for "orphans" (actually muggleborns who were kidnapped from their parents and obliviated) in linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died). Hermione is one of the brainwashed soldiers loyal to the Minister Malfoy who were raised in that house. The other good guys all spent the last 20 years or so in France while Britain became a dictatorship.
