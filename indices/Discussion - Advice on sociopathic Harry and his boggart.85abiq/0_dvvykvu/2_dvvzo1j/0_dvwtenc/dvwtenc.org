TL;DR look up the medical definition of the mental condition and extrapolate from that.

Also, a lack of empathy does not mean a personal lack of feelings. It simply means he is unable identify with the feelings of others in a meaningful way. He is still plenty capable of getting angry, happy, sad, etc, it is simply more centered around himself.
