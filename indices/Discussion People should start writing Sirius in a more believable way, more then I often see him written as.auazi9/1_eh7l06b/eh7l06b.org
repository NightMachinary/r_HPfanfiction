I don't claim to write him perfectly, but I think I do okay. Sirius is one of my favourite people to write because the bloke is an exercise in unreliable narration. I feel like this is something that isn't utilised that much in fics, and it saddens me because it's so much fun to play with how he see's or talks about something. I think you can attribute a lot of it to JKR and her rubbish maths, but for me, it's far more fun to think of Sirius seeing things in his own specific way and having tunnel vision about it. Some of it is also on purpose because he feels a certain way about it or it's just used to his own advantage. Sirius may be a Gryffindor, but he was raised in a house rooted in Slytherin and he's got some of those traits right in there. It's just that his impulsive behaviour tends to override his more manipulative behaviour. Not to mention he's a huge drama queen, but look at Number Twelve, this house breeds drama and Sirius did not escape that.

Some of the random things I enjoy looking into with him:

- Sirius says he's related to Bellatrix when pressed but she's not his family. This shows how Sirius has his own definitions of what he'd call family and by far my favourite thing to write. He refers to them only as a married couple in Azkaban and manages to insinuate they were friends with Snape at school despite never having crossed over with him, choosing to not reveal his own connection to her. An interesting side note is Bellatrix refers to him as the animagus Black while Andromeda remains her sister.

- Sirius is people smart, which I think is why Peter throws him as much as it does. Obviously what he did was heinous and Sirius has every right to feel distrought over the betrayal, but there's also that Sirius can usually predict Harry's behaviour quite well and judges others on their behaviour. It makes sense, he can't choose who he was born to but he can make his choices and wants to be judged by them.

- His idea of pranking is possibly also rooted in attitude to magic. We are talking about someone who grew up around blades, bottles of blood, things that are designed to kill you as utterly normalised. I think it makes sense his idea of a joke is warped, which doesn't at all excuse his behaviour but does inform it.

- Sirius' sense of loyalty is so immense. He instantly becomes nicer to Ron the moment he illustrates loyalty to Harry (which I wonder if Molly found out who broke her kids leg). He judges others upon it, which probably plays into his dislike of the adult Severus as much as his childhood perception. He's made a life of trading loyalties. The kicker of this? Sirius is a blood traitor. He left his family, the first loyalty most of us have and I think that act in a lot of ways illustrates a lot about the complexity of the character. Even Peter, when begging him not to kill him, appeals to his loyalty above anything else.

- Sirius' voice changing. He sounds considerably more formal in PoA than he does in GoF (compare "I, the spy?" to "What do you think you're playing at" which I'm paraphrasing but you get the point) and it makes some sense. If you look at Regulus' note, it's also rather formal so I've been thinking Sirius thinks in a more formal manner but chooses to speak in a less so way. My headcanon is he's picked up a bit of James' West Country as well, but by the time he's left Azkaban, he's mostly been listening to his own thoughts and has lost it. It takes being around people from his life for it to reappear.

- Sirius has spent his whole life being told what to do in one way or another. He's initially trapped in a family that he feels out of step with (I personally believe his blood beliefs came from Hogwarts so this was more of a personal thing), experiences true freedom of a sort at Hogwarts despite it being a school with a schedule and then he joins up with the Order. He has spent his entire life answering to someone else, from parents to the Order. I just find this interesting for a character so rooted in his own sense of freedom.

- Sirius does admit to Harry that he killed his parents, so every chance he actually did confess to it when asked. The Ministry should have given him a trial, of course, but by this point, Sirius considers his mistake such a misdeed that he does carry that guilt and perception.

- When Harry is trying to cast on him, Sirius tries to move Crookshanks out of the way. We also see a very strong bond with Buckbeak. Even in his lousy mood in OotP, he'll pet Crookshanks. Sirius has an extraordinary amount of love and compassion for those important to him, even animals. It's just that everyone else it can be seriously hit or miss.

- If we're going for dementors being depression inducing, the mental fog struggle is real. It messes with your perception of time, what you have or haven't done, stuff you absolutely know goes out of your head and it's incredibly upsetting. A good example is that Sirius attacks the dorm rooms in January in PoA two days after Scabbers disappears, but he admits in the confrontation in the shack that Crookshanks had told him that Scabbers had run off. I think that does speak to how his sense of memory must be screwed with, and that generally adds to his unreliable narration.

- Sirius is very much a Black. If you look at Sirius' explosions in the end of PoA, there's an uneasy echo to Walburga's portrait. He doesn't even want Peter to speak James' name in front of Harry. If you look at his conversation with the Weasley kids and earlier with Peter, he seems to think that dying while doing work for the Order is something they should accept. You die rather than betray who and what you believe in. That he chooses to say this when they don't know if Arthur will die or not is telling. It has a rather unfortunate echo of Bellatrix in her regard for Draco with Narcissa. I think it just again shows that Sirius is still impacted by his upbringing, which I think a lot of people can forget to incorporate.

If anyone has some recs that include the unreliable narration especially, please hit me up. It's my guilty pleasure.
