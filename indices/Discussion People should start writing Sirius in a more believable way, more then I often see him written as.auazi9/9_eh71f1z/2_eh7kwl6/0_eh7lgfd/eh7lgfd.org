Plenty of stories where Harry is adopted by Andromeda and it turns into a romance +later on+ as soon as it doesn't make Tonks look like a paedophile. De-aging is optional. And while I don't mind the general idea, I didn't find a single one where they develop a brother-sister like relationship, so I started to write one.

It turned out a lot more "slice of life" and slow-paced (82k for a summer and everything including the first task instead of being past the second one) than I originally envisioned, but at the same time it doesn't really include any scenes which I would consider unnecessary (and the Quidditch ones got very good feedback, so definitely not a waste).
