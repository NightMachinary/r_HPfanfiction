It's not dead. I was hoping to have published the next chapter already, but I originally planned to have an 3k chapter and I'm long past that. The biggest issue for the delay was the first chapter, which honestly sucked. It took me months to rewrite it and get rid of the walls of exposition and shade which was thrown around. I also made some tweaks to the Prague chapter after a holiday there.
