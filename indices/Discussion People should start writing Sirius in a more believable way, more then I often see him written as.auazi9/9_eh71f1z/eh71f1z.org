I think the main issue is that the popular avenues for Sirius are already covered (eg he does not go after Peter and raises Harry, he rescues Harry from the Dursleys). And although they are trope-y, removing the tropes wouldn't alter the story much. I mean, Sirius wouldn't be a very different adoptive partner if he brings home countless women or if he is monogamous (and most stories pair him with Amelia Bones or Marlene McKinnon either way). Getting rid of the prank fixation would improve a lot of stories, but not in a significant way.

I mean, I am writing a "Harry is adopted by the Tonks" story because there is pretty much nothing where he does NOT end up banging Nymphadora at some point. In some earlier versions that included Sirius, but I couldn't come up with something original for him. And a year later I haven't found anything new with him.
