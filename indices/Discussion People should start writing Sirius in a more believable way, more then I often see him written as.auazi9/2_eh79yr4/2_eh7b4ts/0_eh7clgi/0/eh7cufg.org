He'd be worried about his parents, he'd be worrying about finding up what was up with Remus, he'd be worried about trying to become an Animagus, he'd try to help with stuff like the Marauders Map, it was also said that Sirius was quite smart as well, so he probably studied and stuff as well.

I just don't think he'd worry about girls that might. I can see him dating one or two girls through out his years, but I honestly don't see anything else happening other then dating with him.

Just the way I personally see Sirius.
