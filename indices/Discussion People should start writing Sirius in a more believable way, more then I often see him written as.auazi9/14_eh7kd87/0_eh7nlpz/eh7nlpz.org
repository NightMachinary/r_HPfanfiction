I ship Sirius/Remus, it's a ship that I'm in love with, but I personally see Sirius as straight (even though I don't write him as such), or at the least bisexual.

I could see him being the sort of person who doesn't care what gender you are, as long as he finds you interesting/likable/attractive et cetra.
