Yes, he's always seemed to me to be a man who, regardless of the terrible things that happened to him, was always comfortable in his own skin (skins). I have written him in both same-sex and heterosexual relationships without ever feeling that one contradicted the other. But I also think that the love of his life was only ever James, though I don't think they had a homosexual relationship. I don't believe anything else would have come close to that bond.
