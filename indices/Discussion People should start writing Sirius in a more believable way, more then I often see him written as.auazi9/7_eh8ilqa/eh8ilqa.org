HP fic Authors struggle with complex characters, they rarely have any depth at all. Typically characters are locked into whatever defining charcteristics mentioned in passing in canon, and even fanon.

Sirius is an immature prankster with a barking laugh who can't hear the word "serious" without making a name joke, Ron is a short-tempered glutton obsessed with chess, Hedvig is obsessively nipping at Harry's ears and fingers, and all owls are exclusively fed bacon. Dumbledore twinkles, Snape billows, Ginny throws Bat-Bogey hexes if you look at her the wrong way. Mad-Eye Moody shouts "CONSTANT VIGILANCE" every time he opens his mouth, and Voldemort is an insane sadist. Everybody's just a 2-dimensional caricature of themselves, which is a shame since they are so rich and complex in canon.

My tip to authors: Write down /at least/ 7-8 different characteristics for each character, and use them in inverse proportion to how well they're known.

Hedvig: One nip or flying headcuff per 100,000 words. The expression "furry little problem" may be used *once* in a story, the same goes for "twin speak" and "Gred/Forge". Dial back the twinkles, billows, sneers and smirks. If anyone calls Harry "prongslet", "cub" or "pup", I will find you and hurt you. Try to keep the pranking down to a dull roar. The twins are not allowed to kneel and say "we're not worthy" when they meet a Marauder, because that's been done to death.

I'm sure there's more.
