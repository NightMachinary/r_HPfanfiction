I don't really understand getting upset about this. I could see if a movie or derivative work mischaracterized him, sure, but this is fanfiction, written by fans to fantasize about a world they love. That kind of work doesn't owe anything to any reader because it wasn't written for you; its primary function is to do something for the person who wrote it. They're not getting paid to or tasked to deliver something to an audience, they just love a work and want to be creative and share and engage in wish fulfillment. A lot of fanfiction is written specifically because something the writer wanted isn't in the original work. Whether that's a relationship, a different character's perspective, a different interpretation of a character like Sirius, etc. Being personally upset that fanfic writers aren't upholding canon characterizations sorta misses the point. The beauty of fanfic is that you can find something you like, however niche, or even write your own story, but demanding all works fit neatly into the established mold undermines the whole purpose of fanfiction. I know it probably wasn't your explicit intent, but let's not try to limit the creative expression of others (even if we think their work sucks) just because it doesn't fit our idea of what fan work should be. Edit: for an apostrophe
