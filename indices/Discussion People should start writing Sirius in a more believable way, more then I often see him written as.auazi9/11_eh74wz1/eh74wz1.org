I totally agree. Sirius is protrayed in fanfics as dorky and not serious at all wheras in canon he is so focused : he is incredibly brillant at magic: his friendship with James and Lupin taught him to hate his family's pureblood mania : personnaly I don't think he started to be against his family from the first beginning ( everyone is influenced actually by their family esp children and teens ) but knowing James who is genuinely good and Lupin who was marginilized because of what he was even though he had nothing to do to change it made Sirius realise that you shouldn't think you are superior to people just because your are born pureblood. You see who the person is for real by seeing what they've grown to be and not by what they were born with. So Sirius' character is a lot deeper that people could think : the process of being a rebell agaisnt your family isn't easy and Sirius went through with belief and confidence. Sirius is like you said harsh sometimes and really dark. I want to see the sad frustrated Sirius at Azkaban sad for the death of his best of best friend.
