Yes, but authors read stuff and review the things they read, if only to judge their own work. And if you read something which resonates with you, you will incorporate that. And if you read something you dislike, you might decide to write the exact opposite. I mean, a bunch of angsty Harry/Hermione Friends with Benefits are how I got the idea for "Bad at this", which is decidedly angst-free. I started writing "No Longer Alone" because there were no platonic Harry&Tonks stories. I like to shit on Snape because too many stories whitewash him IMO.

You can certainly influence what others think and write, just perhaps not in the direction you envisioned.
