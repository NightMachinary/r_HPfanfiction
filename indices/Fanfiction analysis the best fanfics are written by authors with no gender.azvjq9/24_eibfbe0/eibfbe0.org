I really like your take on this! I think a good part of what results in a well-rounded story is good old fashioned character-driven narrative, which is one of the first things that are at risk of being sacrificed in order to create some ideal world or situation for idealized characters.

Some of the most well written stories I've read could've pulled out an interesting one-shot involving their secondary (or even tertiary) characters living a day in their lives without even mentioning the protagonist while staying in character.

Great song there, by the way.
