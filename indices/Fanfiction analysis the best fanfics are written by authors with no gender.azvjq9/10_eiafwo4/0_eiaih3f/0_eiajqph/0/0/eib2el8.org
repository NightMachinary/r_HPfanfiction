I guess it depends on how "limited" the third person limited is.

It wasn't in this fandom, but I've read a couple of fanfics which were written in the third person, but where the narrator was the current perspective character. So the narration changed styles depending on who was being followed, even though it was in the third person.

It resulted in moments like [[https://i.imgur.com/xpAmB1Y.png][this, from a character who was very crude]], or like [[https://i.imgur.com/PeOLTIf.png][this from a character who was very analytic and emotionless.]]

It was kind of a weird stylistic choice, and it took a while to get used to, but ended up being pretty effective.
