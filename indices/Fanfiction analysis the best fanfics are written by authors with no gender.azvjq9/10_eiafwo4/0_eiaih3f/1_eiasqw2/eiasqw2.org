  I mean...why would you want to read that?

I can think of exactly one situation where I would want to include that in a story. Simply put, where it doesn't stick around. Much more accurately put, in a story where it is part of the characters development to start out that way, and then leave this kind of behaviour behind. The original commenter is correct, that is indeed how a horny teenage boy would act and think. And while I probably wouldn't find this kind of character compelling if that's all they were, if it is the starting point of their arc instead, it could be quite compelling. One of the least realistic elements of Harry as a character is how good of a person he is considering all that has happened to him and influenced him. (This is likely an analogy for self determination, wherein the reader is shown how it is possible to be a good, noble person regardless of personal circumstance). However, this archetype of a teenage boy, if employed correctly, could allow for a protagonist that, at the start of their characters development, elicits a unique response in the reader. They're not noble, they're not particularly virtuous, they're not a hero. Similarly, they're not a villain, they're just a teenage boy. The kind of behavior described in the previous comment would be a perfect point to start from when trying to create a protagonist character that goes through significant development and eventually is noble, eventually is virtuous, and eventually is a hero. There are other ways to do this of course, but this method would (in my opinion) best showcase the kind of process of maturation that guys actually go through. It would feel more genuine and earned than other methods, and if combined properly with those other methods, can create a character narrative on a level of quality unlike anything we have seen before.

It certainly wouldn't be for everyone, but for those capable of seeing the transformation through to the end, I believe it would be an incredible literary experience. This connects nicely with my take on the original post, the OP posits that the best fics are written by authors in whose work no specific gender can be inferred. I say that while this makes good stories, the best stories are those in which the author is capable of writing, not with the absence of gendered perspective, but with the perspective of the character being written. Those authors that can write both male and female characters in such a way that, when reading about a male characters POV, it feels like a guy wrote it, and when reading about a female charaters POV, it feels like a girl wrote it, develop characters that feel truly alive.

The key lies in the balance however, if the author can only do one or the other, then the better approach is, as the OP said, to do neither. As only doing one, or doing one to a greater capacity than the other, comes across as stilted at best, and disingenuous at worst.
