I could see that working, yeah. I would likely be turned off of it too soon to see the evolution, but it wouldn't be inherently bad. Sometimes I feel like Rowling was actually intending to do something like this until HBP---she very clearly writes Harry's relationships with Cho and Luna to explore his emotional development over the course of a year that focuses on teenage angst more than any other in the series, and if not for the backslide that is her portrayal of Harry and Ginny in HBP (that I've heard was inspired by fan response, although that might not be true) she might have succeeded in the longer term as well.
