fair enough, I'm being pretty elitist when I say "serious storytelling." I generally don't like that sort of thing, and most people I talk to don't, so I'm almost certainly projecting my own opinions onto others.

I will say, though, that romance isn't predicated on a gendered gaze, and a lot of popular media is lambasted for that sort of writing so I'm far from alone in my opinion.
