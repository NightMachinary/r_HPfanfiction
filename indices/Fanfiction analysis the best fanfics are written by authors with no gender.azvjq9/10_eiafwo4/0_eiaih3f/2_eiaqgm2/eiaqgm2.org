  I mean...why would you want to read that? It's going to detract from any serious storytelling, and “teenage boys are horny” isn't exactly brilliant material for cutting humor.

Umm... are you a hermit? From this comment, I kind of get the sense that you are, because otherwise you would have read or seen some popular media that's been produced in the past 50 years and realized that the "horny teenaged boy (or girl)" trope is rather prevalent. Entire film series and genres have been built around this premise.

I'm not sure what fits into the category of "serious storytelling," but I think it kinda goes without saying that there are a lot of people interested in reading that kind of thing.
