I think we're pretty much on the same page about what good writing is. I think your title is taking away from your point.

The best fanfics aren't written by authors with no gender. The best fanfics are written by authors who can write realistically for any gender.

That said, I still like some of those fics you use as examples of bad, but in the same way I like sugary drinks or salty snacks. I know they aren't good for me, but they're still fun once in a while.
