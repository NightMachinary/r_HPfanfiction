To answer your questions:

#+begin_quote
  1 What are your thoughts on gender neutral/gender impartial writing? For PC wussies like me, or does it actually make for better stories?
#+end_quote

No. Good writing makes for good writing. You can have a good story that is obviously written by a male author, a female author, or an author that is not obviously either.

  2 Do you think canon HP is written in a gender neutral way? Could you tell that JKR was a woman reading HP? (She chose a pen-name to specifically appear gender neutral, so it seems like it was intentional.)
#+end_quote

No. It's been a while since I read the actual books, but I remember it being rather obvious that they were written by a woman. I think this was especially clear in the later books with respect to how the characters acted in their romantic relationships. None of the men (Harry, Ron, Remus, Snape) really acted like typical men who were interested in women, but instead more like caricatures of how someone might think men would act. Chest monster? Ridiculous. Dumbledore is absolutely sure of Snape's loyalty because of an almost 20 year-old crush on a dead woman? Absurd. From my male point of view, that was clearly written by a woman. And if I recall correctly, JKR's use of her initials wasn't her idea, but rather her publisher's, as they thought it would help sell books to young boys. I believe she reluctantly agreed.

  3 Do you prefer a story where you can tell what gender the author is? For male fanfic readers, does it enhance your experience and enjoyment to see a male protagonist like Harry Potter written with an "authentic" male voice? Not just a chest monster, but popping stiffies, ogling the quidditch chasers in the locker room, and making good use of the prefect's bathroom, etc.
#+end_quote

I prefer well-written stories. See the answer above to question 1.

  4 (Question that was not asked) Is this discussion a bit silly?
#+end_quote

Yes, this is rather silly. Read/write what you enjoy.
