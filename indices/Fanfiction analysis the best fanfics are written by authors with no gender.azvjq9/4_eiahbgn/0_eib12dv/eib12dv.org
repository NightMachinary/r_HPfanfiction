Thank you for contributing to the discussion.

After some thought, I find that my original opinion was influenced not by stories written by authors of any specific gender, but the ones where a gendered voice was /out-of-place/ for the character and story context. If it was appropriate for a character's age and personality to view their world through the Male Gaze, then it's unobtrusive. That works. That can still be good writing, especially if the author set out to do just that. What I notice when I read is the most exaggerated examples that /break/ the immersion, and come off less as conscious, organic characterization choice and more as personal appeal. Or are just poorly written and the descriptions are on-the-nose instead of trying to be subtle. Although it's kinda of hard to expect subtlety from a fic whose premise is pure powerwanking.

Interesting thoughts on JKR's writing. I never actually noticed "hey, this is what someone thinks how a man might act" in regards to Sirius and Remus, but assumed their thin characterization was due to not having much screentime. At least, this was what I thought about Remus' big idea to run off and join the horcrux camping trip, which was pretty unrealistic to me, though not for any reasons of his gender, or the author's. Ron's character, however, was more obvious. His emotional insecurity was played up over and over and used as a point to mock him, particularly Ginny in HBP who laughs at him when he calls her fast for dating so many boys. Yeah, that one was pretty clear.
