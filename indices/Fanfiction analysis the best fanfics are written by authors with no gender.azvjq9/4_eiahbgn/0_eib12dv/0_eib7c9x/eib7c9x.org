  After some thought, I find that my original opinion was influenced not by stories written by authors of any specific gender, but the ones where a gendered voice was out-of-place for the character and story context.

Yeah, that's the crux of the matter. The bias/world-view/etc. of the author, whatever that might be, (which, I would argue can never be totally exorcised) is always going to be magnified by poor writing. When you have a male author that is doing a shabby job of writing a female character (or vice versa), the authorial flaws in the depiction of the character are going to be jarring and immersion-breaking - but that's a factor of the poor writing, and not a result of a male or female gaze.

When it's done well, I've quite enjoyed reading some stories that were obviously authored by women and express a woman's point of view, even though I'm a man. The example that immediately comes to mind would be the /Wonder Woman/ movie that came out a couple years ago. The film leaned rather heavily into the fact that it was a movie about a woman, directed by a woman, and it did so in a way that worked rather well. I thought it was particularly good at bringing the Ethics of Care, a feminist philosophy, into the conversation of the superhero genre, which is normally built around punching to Solve The Problem, which is typical of masculine thinking. It's good to be able to see things from the opposite perspective occasionally, even when you know that's what you're seeing.

Likewise, I've had a lot of fun reading and watching media that was clearly created by men and caters to a male point of view.

As for JKR's writing, now that you've got me thinking about it, looking back, it seems even more obvious (at least to me) that the fact that the HP books were written by a woman is all over the text. I think the female characters were much more complex and varied - take the two big villians: Voldemort and Umbridge. Voldie is rather two-dimensional; he's the big bad intent on conquering the world, etc, etc. Umbridge, on the other hand, is rather complex; with her comes interesting themes of government corruption and media campaigns against whistle blowers. I think I can easily say that of the two, JKR managed to make Umbridge into the more hated and memorable villain for her readers. And then there's the hero of the series: Hermione. She's the one that actually solves and overcomes most of the problems while also dealing with rather significant personal obstacles. Poor Harry didn't even get to be the hero of his own story...

There's also the fact that I think JKR emphasizes the impact and importance of relationships in the story overall and from Harry's point of view in particular much more than a male would do. Neither is better than the other, but women tend to focus on interpersonal issues and relationships while men focus on tasks and problem solving. But when Harry is walking into the forest to meet Voldemort in /Deathly Hallows/, does he draw strength from the fact that he's about to lay down his life protecting others? That he's about to solve the big problem and beat the bad guy? Nope. He's consoled by loved ones, by having one last, significant relational moment with important people. I'm not saying it was a bad scene, I actually think it worked rather well, but it was definitely written by a woman.

Finally, yes, this is all rather silly. But there's no reason we can't have an interesting discussion about something that's silly. We /are/ talking about Harry Potter fanfiction after all...
