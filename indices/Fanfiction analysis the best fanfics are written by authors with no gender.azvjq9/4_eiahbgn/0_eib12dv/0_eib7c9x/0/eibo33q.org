I also enjoy reading a broad range of views in fiction, and I don't necessarily need to be able to personally relate to a protagonist in order to enjoy a work, as long as the strength of the character writing can stand up on its own, without having to rely on a specific gimmick or premise. (This is why I also find Second Person PoV to be particularly jarring. They usually involve other elements like Real Person Fiction, or Choose Your Own Adventure game mechanics style storytelling.)

The more I think about JKR, the more obvious the signs of her authorship are. One of her big motifs, which I can't believe I didn't notice reading the first time, was the importance of Maternal Love.

- Lily sacrifices herself and saves Harry, and for the rest of the series, everyone tells him how brave and strong she was, and it's never contradicted by anyone Harry meets, who knew her when she was alive (except Petunia, I guess). Unlike James, whose reputation loses his tarnish early when Harry found out he was a teen bully, Lily remains perfect and untouched until the end.

- Molly kills Bellatrix, in a symbol to show that her pure, motherly love protecting Ginny was more powerful than Bellatrix's unhealthy, one-sided, obsessive love for Voldemort. Objectively, I found it a somewhat unrealistic choice, because Bellatrix is meant to be Voldemort's top lieutenant, and if motherly love could have stopped her, she would have been beaten down by Alice Longbottom 20 years. But I can appreciate it, subjectively, as a symbolic choice.

- Merope's lack of love is how Tom Riddle turned into a monster like Lord Voldemort. JKR has said in an interview that Tom Riddle Jr. would have turned out completely different, had he had a mother's love in his life. Merope's suffering is treated with sympathy by Dumbledore, while the concept of Fatherly Love is barely mentioned, which could have changed Tom Riddle's life too. Other examples of fatherly love are Arthur Weasley, Amos Diggory, and Xeno Lovegood, but I still feel like it's outweighed in terms of endgame relevance by Molly and Narcissa's actions.

Of course, HP isn't a bad series because the gendered writing seeps through, because it's honestly subtle enough that you'd only find it if and when you look for it, unlike in poor writing where you are slapped across the face with it. It also /fits the context of the story/, which from the very first book has emphasized themes of love conquering hate, and the power of love and true friends. It's internally consistent, and therefore doesn't feel out of place or break the immersion of reading.
