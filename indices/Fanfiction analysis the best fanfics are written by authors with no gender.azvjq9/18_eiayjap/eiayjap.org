Oh look a poorly disguised pet peeve thread. You're just describing a bunch of shitty, tropey writing styles and attributing them to gender. Sorry, this has nothing to do with the gender of the author.

Not everything has to do with group identity or your political ideology. Sometimes it's just competence.
