  the best fanfics are written by authors with no gender
#+end_quote

The OP posits that the best fics are written by authors in whose work no specific gender can be inferred. I say that while this makes good stories, the best stories are those in which the author is capable of writing, not with the absence of gendered perspective, but with the perspective of the character being written. Those authors that can write both male and female characters in such a way that, when reading about a male characters POV, it feels like a guy wrote it, and when reading about a female charaters POV, it feels like a girl wrote it, develop characters that feel truly alive.

The key lies in the balance however, if the author can only do one or the other, then the better approach is, as the OP said, to do neither. As only doing one, or doing one to a greater capacity than the other, comes across as stilted at best, and disingenuous at worst.

*Edit:* This comment is written under the assumption that the author in question is attempting to create an intentionally balanced set of characters. While it is in fact possible to create unbalanced characters and do so well, this is a very intentional, and more importantly, very uncommon thing. Thus, in the interest of general applicability, those types of intentionally unbalanced characters are set aside from the discussion to be considered separately.
