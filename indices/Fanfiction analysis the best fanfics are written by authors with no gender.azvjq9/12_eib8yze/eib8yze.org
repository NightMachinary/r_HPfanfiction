    On the other hand, this is why I didn't enjoy fics like Prince of the Dark Kingdom (gratuitous nudity and physical descriptions of 10-14 y.o. girls)

Your description makes it sound like a guy wrote it. There is a lot background slash in this fic though which makes me think it's more likely that it was written by a woman. Also Sirius and Remus calling Harry "Cub" and referring to each other as "Alpha" and "Beta" despite the author claiming they are not in a relationship makes me lean towards a female writer.

I have to disagree with you on it though since I absolutely loved that fic. I thought the characters were really well written and it has some amazing humour, dialogue and worldbuilding. Its still one of the fics I love to reread despite its length.

To me it really doesn't matter who wrote a fic though as long as I enjoy it. I avoid the tropes you mention like slash, harems and power wank fantasies but even being able to tell who wrote it via occasional clues doesn't matter as long as there is good writing, dialogue and characterizations.
