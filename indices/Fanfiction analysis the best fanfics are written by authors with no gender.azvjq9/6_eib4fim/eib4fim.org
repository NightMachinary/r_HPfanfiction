The maxim /everything in moderation/ applies here, I think.

Verisimilitude is a vital part of what makes a good story. Caricatures of one or both sexes do not feel real. The sex ratio isn't a hard rule (for example, certain plots or settings are more suited to one or another), but it could be an indicator of a bad writer, avoiding the problem instead of dealing with it. Genre goes back to verisimilitude --- most fanfiction is set in a world instead of a story, so strictly adhering to a single genre can make the world feel unnatural.

Self-indulgence in a fic means that readers similar to the writer are also indulging, but others are constantly reminded of how fake it is, breaking the illusion of the world. This also applies to nationality, religion, personal beliefs, and politics. They can be done subtly, but too much will make the reader pay attention to the writer behind the curtain.

I like impartial writing. I believe stories should stand on their own. I like it when it feels like a real world. I dislike stereotypically male or female things, because I never experienced them nor has anyone I know. To me, they're "media-fiction", an idealized reality only perpetuated by various media. Which means it breaks my suspension of disbelief if I see it presented as reality.

Canon, especially the romance, does not feel natural to me. I actually think Harry is pretty gender-neutral, which could be an intentional choice to mask parts where JK slips through, or a symptom of insufficient author-character separation. (Which might explain the popularity of Fem!Harry and fanfiction itself.)

I don't care about the writer. I never try to figure out their gender, and will subconsciously avoid the question. I dislike when Harry is given an "authentic" voice, somewhat based on my understanding of it differing from how it's written. This also leads back to canon's presentation of Harry. If a writer makes Harry an "authentic" male, it feels like a misinterpretation of canon.

This is a good discussion topic. I've never heard anything similar to it on here, and it got me thinking about a lot of what I've read.
