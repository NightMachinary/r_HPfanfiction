Hey, I think this a really interesting topic and I was surprised at the comments kind of shrugging it off. I just wanted to say, I tend to agree with you. I'm pansexual and questioning non-binary, and in general I prefer media (and real life relationships, ha) where characters are three-dimensional, people are treated like people first, and where gender dynamics, when discussed, are handled in a thoughtful and compassionate way that doesn't assume like, "Well MEN are one way and WOMEN are ALWAYS this other way."

Another thing that always bums me out in a good fic is a sudden unnecessary moment of "no homo bro," where casual homophobia or transphobia is used for a quick laugh.

I think one of the things that makes fanfiction (for all works!) a minefield when it comes to gender stereotypes is that a lot of it is romance, and romance as a genre, even on a published fiction level, just seems prone to reliance on gender tropes and romanticism of problematic relationships/gender dynamics.

There is a well-written next Gen series (Rose, Albus, Scorpius, etc) I can't remember the name of where some characters are pan and ace and queer and a lot of them have anxiety and they are all in Ravenclaw and have a very close-knit friend group. I have no clue what the author's gender is. I liked it because it reminded me of my smart queerdo high school experience, ha, and had a lot of fun banter. If you're interested, I could try to dredge it up for you!

EDIT: The fic I was mentioning is The Fred Weasley Memorial Scholarship by ad astra.
