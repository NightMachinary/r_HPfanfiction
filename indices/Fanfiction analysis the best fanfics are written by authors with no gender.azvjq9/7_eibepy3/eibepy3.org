This will be a short answer, the best Fanfic is the ones you enjoy, your list of bad may be someone's golden list that they will defend to the hilt, it may be a mix of both, there's no objectively bad fanfics, there's just ones that aren't popular for whatever reason, because even if it's only liked by the author, to them it'll be the best Fanfic out there that nothing else compares. So instead of trying to pigeon hole good and bad, give things a try and you might surprise yourself and let your guard down and read it for what they usually are, someone's escape into a marvelous world.
