For a UK-set story, of course it would be nice if they were all written by native Brits who capture the distinct sound and feel of life in the UK, in the vein of Beatrix Potter or Roald Dahl. But since the Harry Potter series is such an international phenomenon, the best writing comes from authors who may not be British, but who can write a story that is indistinguishable to that of a native Brit's, to the extent where it sounds so British you can't tell their original nationality or native language. This would be different for another setting, like MACUSA or Wizarding France, but the thought is similar: the story's setting, no matter where it is, feels authentic and immersive.

People also care about the Bechdel Test in their fiction.

I think the point is that if the story is about the adventures of the Holyhead Harpies quidditch team, that's fine to write about, and part of the established setting. But if male characters /are/ introduced, they aren't there just to "balance out the numbers", or treated like token characters for some kind of meta affirmitive action. Ideally, all characters should act like human beings, without bashing or pedestals, but that just feels like stating the obvious.

In the fics I've read and enjoyed, I've noticed a good spread of characters, and why I thought those fics were good was /because/ they were all handled like regular human beings, and I could see how and why they were there to further the story, instead of fulfilling some sort of authorial motive.
