It is a story set in the UK. A Brit would be best suited to convey the overall feeling, give good descriptions of (similar) places they have already visited and so on. You can always do some research online (I read the Kent Habitat Survey and spent hours in Street View for "No Longer Alone"), but it takes a lot longer and does not convey the full picture. And the word choice should be British and not some location neutral English.

  There is an even ratio of male and female characters, and even ratio of positively and negatively portrayed men and women.

People care about that? And perhaps more importantly, why should it be when the reality is not? Most atrocities during war have been committed by men. If you go with folklore witches, the "bad guys" will be exclusively female (or the Clergy, so entirely male). If anything, the token "good man/woman" often feels very cringeworthy and can be immersion breaking. Just look at the controversies surrounding inclusion in games like Battlefield or Kingdom Come Deliverance.

"Pranking the Tournament" is a good example of this. It bashes teenage boys and puts Neville on a pedestal for "not being a pervert". It makes the author come across as immature.
