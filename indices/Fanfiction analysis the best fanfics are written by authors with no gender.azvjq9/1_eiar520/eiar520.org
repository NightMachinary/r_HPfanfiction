I think that this is just a matter of general anonymity on the internet, plus a smattering of good writing (i.e. the purple prose stuff trips up newbies regardless). Most fanfics are written by authors without a clearly identified gender, so it makes sense that you see a comparable ratio in "good" fics. Many really good/popular fics are certainly written by authors who are open about their gender. And if you count gender tells in writing, there are a whole bunch that you missed, i.e. "sensitive" male characters.
