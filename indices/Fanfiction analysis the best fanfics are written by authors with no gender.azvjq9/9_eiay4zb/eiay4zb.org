A good story is a good story, and a bad story is a bad story. It doesn't matter how it's written, or what gender a story is written in, or if there's a male or female gaze.

Let me give you an example that's stuck with me due to how poorly it was executed:

One of the worst stories I read, has a page or maybe even two dedicated to describing Ginny's breast growth over the summer. It wasn't smut. It was written by a woman, but written like it was what the author thought a man would want to read, in order to make Ginny attractive to male readers... In other words, a really shitty male gaze. But by the time the author was done with the (very well written) scene, this Ginny wouldn't have been able to buy a bra that fit from Target or WalMart. The overall execution sucked, actually, but it was a well written and original plot.

Meanwhile, something like "Ginny's tight stomach was visible as she jumped up and down, waving, and catching Harry's eye" can convey attractiveness in the same way, while still progressing the story (Ginny waved). Conversely, "Ginny's breasts bounced just a little too much as she jumped up and down, waving, and catching Harry's eye", works if you don't want an as athletic Ginny.

It's all about the execution of Ginny jumping up and down to catch Harry's eye, and I don't think it matters who writes it, as long as it's written well.

  "She ran over to their table, breasts bouncing under her robes"

Can also be written as "She held her breasts as she ran over to their table". That is just as "male-gaze" as your sentence, if not more-so, since not only have we established large breasts, but we've established that they're large enough for the character to need to work around them in everyday life. The difference is that one is basically telling you that the character has large breasts, while the other is showing you how large they are. This is a classic case of "show don't tell", that good authors can pull off. Again, it's about how it's written, not whether or not the characters are 10's who have sex at every opportunity.
