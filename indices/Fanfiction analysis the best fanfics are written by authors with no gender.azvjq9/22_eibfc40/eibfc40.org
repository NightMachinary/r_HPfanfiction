I liked Arithmancer A LOT. But haven't heard of the others you liked, I also liked HPMOR (I think? It's the first fanfic and read and it's been a while now) but I defo liked black comedy to.

But I think that's also maybe because they excelled at what they are. Your 'best' fanfic list just describes good solid tropes, but also glaring leaves out comedy and crack fics. And while I wouldn't say crack is the cream of the crop, it's certainly something that I think can be appreciated.

I dunno what I really meant to say with this comment, I suppose I just wanted to disagree with you since you but I don't really. Except as far as Black Comedy is concerned.
