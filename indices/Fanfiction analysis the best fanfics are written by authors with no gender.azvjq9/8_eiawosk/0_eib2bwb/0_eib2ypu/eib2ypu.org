Yes, one of the points was how authors writing themselves into their characters affected a story's quality. In some fics, it's a Tonks who morphs herself into various forms just to feel herself up, as extensively described over a 2000 word chapter.

In others, it's the author's viewpoints like in HPMOR. Or the author's criticism of religion in For the Love of Magic.
