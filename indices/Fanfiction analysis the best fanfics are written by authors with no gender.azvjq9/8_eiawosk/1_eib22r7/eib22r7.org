Yeah, that's one that has neither gratuitous descriptions of breasts, nor gratuitous descriptions of clothes. In discussions, I've seen the author mistaken for a woman. Is rationality gendered? The insufferable know-it-all in canon is female.

There are other reasons someone might dislike it, but I don't see how it's stereotypically gendered.
