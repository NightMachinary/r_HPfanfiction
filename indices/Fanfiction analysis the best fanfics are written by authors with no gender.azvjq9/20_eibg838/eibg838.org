> the best fics (at least the ones I liked the most), the gender of the author can't be identified by the content and style of the writing.

Are there such fics? Anything I have read 10k+ words I can make reasonable assumption about author's gender. Actually out of the authors you mentioned I would instantly say that:

- WhiteSquirrel is a man
- murkybluematter is a woman
- Inverarity is a woman
- I don't know which Perfectly Normal you mean\\

I also would disagree with your ratings, since I am stuck in both Arithmancer and Pureblood Pretense due to them being incredible slogs. I liked HHD though, AQ less so, but I left it for now mainly because it seems like it may be actually finished.
