I'm surprised no one has mentioned [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7352166/1/Protection-From-Nargles][Protection from nargles]]

  Harry and Luna meet in the Room of Requirement. Mistletoe appears. Will Nargles be a problem? Takes place in during Harry's fifth year, as he and Luna get closer. Basically pure fluff, largely consisting of conversations. NOW COMPLETE.
