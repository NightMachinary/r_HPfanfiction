A couple of fair warnings:

A) They are currently 39 chapters in, at the end of the fourth year, and Luna did not make an appearance yet. This is not at all a Harry/Luna story by any conventional means. The only way we "know" that is because the author spoiled it himself in the description. In-universe it is Harry/Hermione more than anything else.

B) It is extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY, AU. This is basically set in a completely different world that only barely resembles the normal universe.

C) It's quite mature in content. It includes graphic descriptions of murder and rape and it's not at all "fluffy" like you asked.
