Personally I'd put herbology and astronomy as electives rather than core classes, and instead put in "muggle" subjects like english and maths (maybe trivium class and quadrivium class to stay in line with the wizarding world relative backwardness), because it really kinda breaks disbelief that the wizarding world operates out of primary school education.
