Magical theory seems to be innately different between the fields of magic, probably more so for the basics. This is what the classes primarily are, they aren't really learning a lot of spells in class. They learn the magic, and on their exams they're expected to perform similar spells to the ones they learned instead of the same. Like with math equations.
