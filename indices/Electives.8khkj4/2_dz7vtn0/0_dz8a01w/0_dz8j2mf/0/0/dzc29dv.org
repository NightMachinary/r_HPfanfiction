Tbh I think you're pulling that out of your ass. It doesn't make sense given what we know from the original heptalogy about how difficult both silent casting and spell creation are.

It isn't like a math problem where you can riddle out your own solution if you know the broad concepts. Until you learn silent casting, you need to know the incantation to the spell you're using. That means you can't use "similar spells to the ones you learned." You need to use the specific spells you learned because those are the ones you know the incantations and wand movements for.

It's one of the biggest criticisms of the HP universe: that the magic is often decidedly unmagical, and is often described as following a formula to achieve the desired results ("it's levi-/o/-sa, not levio-/sa/")
