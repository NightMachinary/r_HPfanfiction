Magic Engineering. Given magic let's you laugh at a bunch of physical laws and limitations, exploring different construction and technological possibilities when magic is taken into account would be awesome: Unbreakable materials, permanent adhesives, easy(ier) access to rare metals and minerals (via transfiguration), etc.

Magic theory: always disappointed there wasn't a specific course on this. My inner math nerd would enjoy seeing a more... formal look at magic's laws and exploring the fringes/cutting edge of what's happening in modern magic development.
