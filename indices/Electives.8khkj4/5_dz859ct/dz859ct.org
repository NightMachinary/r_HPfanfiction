Civics and Economics. How the ministry and general economy actually works and a minimal understanding of laws. Basically how to get a job and not go to jail on accident. Technically an elective but anyone who isn't a rich pureblood takes the class.

Private Study. a.k.a. the rich kids class. It's for learning a magical skill. You can't slack off since this is actually graded. You hire someone as a personal tutor as long as they have a ministry approved accreditation to teach that skill. They actuallly do grade you on this. Only the kids that can afford to hire someone can take the class. It's very unfair but good luck getting it removed by the board.

Foreign Language.

Ancient Language. complimentary class for Ancient Runes. teaches ancient norse or atlantean.

Home Economics. a.k.a. that class all the witches take in 7th year to learn how to be a good housewife.
