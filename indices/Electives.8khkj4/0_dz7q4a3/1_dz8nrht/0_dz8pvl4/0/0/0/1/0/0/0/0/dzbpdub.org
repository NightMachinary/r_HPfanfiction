I'd say that is pretty far reaching for an assumption. The belief of the author who wrote a novel in which she never specified any religion, except the cultural impact of the rituals involved is nothing on which "we" can make presumptions on. "You" may, but "we" shan't.

That is blatantly ignoring the way philosophical assumptions work in the first place. All philosophy stems from observation and logical conclusion. I highly doubt all wizarding philosophy is diletantic bachelor degree level poststructuralism that ignores any sort of scientific methodical research. I'll gladly admit that there might be magical philosophy out there that denies the /importance/ of a soul, but in terms of determining wether something is alive or not, the soul is probably one of the biggest factors to recognize in whatever philosophical discourse is happening in the magical world.

It would be interesting to know what happens with kissed people/bodies to determine how magical /society/ (not individuals who may harbour emotional ties to an empty husk) deals with the soulless. Are they discarded? Are they preserved and cared for? If its the first we can conclude that the definition of life anchors itself on the soul. If its the second we can deduce there are other factors to it.
