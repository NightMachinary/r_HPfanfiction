The way it works in fantasy is the same way it works in sci-fi: If the subject was programmed to have thoughts, feelings, and intelligence, if its mannerisms were taught, and if its experiences were installed instead of lived through, the subject is not a living thing. It's inorganic, programmed, and man-made. Anything it feels or thinks are all programmed and put there by a person. It didn't come across those things on its own, it was made to be that way.
