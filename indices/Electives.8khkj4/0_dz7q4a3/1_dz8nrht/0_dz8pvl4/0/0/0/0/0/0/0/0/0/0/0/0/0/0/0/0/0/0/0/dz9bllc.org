You say "he's an enchanted object, not a living, sentient being". /These things are not contradictory/. The idea of something being /both/ an object and sentient seems impossible for you to grasp, and this baffles me. Again, think of it in sci-fi terms. The Sorting Hat's intelligence /is/ based on complex enchantments, but how does this preclude his being sentient, anymore that in science-fiction an advanced computer may well be a thinking, feeling being on par with (or even superior in intelligence to) a human being?

(Let's lay the creatures aside; there there is evidence both ways, and it's straying from our topic anyway.)
