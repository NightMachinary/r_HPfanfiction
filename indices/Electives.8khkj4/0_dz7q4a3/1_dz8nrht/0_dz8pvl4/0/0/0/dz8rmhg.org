I don't know. I guess canon is a little too careless with this sort of worldbuilding to be clear about it, but Rowling sure doesn't write about them like they're just simulacra/chatbots. They have their own character quirks (Cadogan), look out for their own safety (Fat Lady). Dumbledore's portrait was able to think creatively on his own, finishing up the original's plan with Snape and the memories.

My point is, /maybe/ you're right. /Maybe/ they're just really good chatbots. But it seems much more in keeping with what we know of them for them to be truly sentient.
