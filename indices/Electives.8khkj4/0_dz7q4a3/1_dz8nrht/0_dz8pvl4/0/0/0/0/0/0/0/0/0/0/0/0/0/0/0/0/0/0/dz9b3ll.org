The evidence is in JK Rowling's writings. Read them, and maybe you'll finally see that magic does not bring things to life. They only cause things to mimick life. They're nothing more than magic powered AI. Also, the way you enterpret Rowling's mentions of the Sorting Hat doesn't mean the Sorting Hat is an actual person. She wrote about the making of the Sorting Hat and how he was just a hat owned by Gryffindor that was later bewitched by all the founders to be able to sort Hogwarts students into their appropriate Houses. In fact, she described the Hat as an "enchanted object" in her writing about the Sorting Hat, not a living, sentient being. In the case of magical creatures, you're also misinterpreting their origins. Wizards breeding animals to have traits they want is pretty much the same as humans breeding dogs or cats to have they traits they want. That doesn't mean that magical creatures were created by wizards. It just means that magic creatures were already existing animals before wizards commenced their selective breeding.
