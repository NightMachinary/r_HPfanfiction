Look, if you're defining life as the biological process, then of course, fine. But /philosophically/, sentient machines are as worthy as organic being; and so assuming Portraits and/or the Sorting Hat possess actual sentience, harming them (or creating one willy-nilly) would be as morally reprehensible as harming an organically-alive being of equivalent intelligence.
