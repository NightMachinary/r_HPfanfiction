From the thread I read between you two, I think one important factor to note is that the magical world is aware of life after death and the existence of a soul.

It may very well be that "life" is defined by something having a soul, or similar spiritual presence in the mortal world. The magicals may just not have the same issue of defining "alive" as we do. Our understanding of life is very much based on sentience, physical life-signs, and even then the lines get blurry often enough. To argue with our own understanding of life may just not apply in the magical world.
