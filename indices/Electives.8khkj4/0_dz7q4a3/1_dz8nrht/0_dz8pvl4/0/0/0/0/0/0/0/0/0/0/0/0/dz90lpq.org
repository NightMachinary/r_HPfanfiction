The comparison between the portraits and an actor isn't very good as the actor, whether or not they're mimicking a person, is already a sentient, living person. The portraits, however, are not. They just start off as paint strokes on canvas. The magic that they have imbued inside them only contains the memories, thoughts, and mannerisms of the person they're supposed to be depicting. They're not trying to "impersonate" a person like an actor would. They're acting how they are programmed to act, like a video game character. This programming only makes them life-like, but it doesn't give them life. They're just running on complicated enchantments.
