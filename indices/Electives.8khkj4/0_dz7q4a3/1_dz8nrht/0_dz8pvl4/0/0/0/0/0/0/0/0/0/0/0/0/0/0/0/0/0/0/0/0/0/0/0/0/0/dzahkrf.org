So you're denying the possibility of sentient artificial intelligence, are you? On what basis? Look, all a human brain is, is a computer that runs on squishy chemical processes rather than electric ones. In theory you could wire neural tissue to make the same computations as a calculator, and you could set up electronics to match brain processes exactly. Present-day science can't do it yet, but there's no doubt that it's /possible/ in the bastract. If they think the same way, a flesh mind, a metal mind and (to get us back to our topic) a purely magical mind are philosophically, ethically equivalent.
