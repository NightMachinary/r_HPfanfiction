Your comparison of the portraits to actors really doesn't fit what Rowling says about them. Sure, the Headmasters spent a long time teaching their portraits how to act like them, but this is more akin to a programmer teaching an AI about what they're supposed to do and/or say. Like I said, actors are already people with their own thoughts, experiences, and (most importantly) lives. They can be taught to act like someone and then eventually stop their mimicking and go back to being themselves. The portraits cannot do that. All they do is act like the person they're depicting just as they have been programmed to do. The Headmasters teaching them to act more like them is pretty much their way of programming the portraits to being more sufficient and realistic AI. The magic behind the portraits is a similar yet more advanced version of the magic behind howlers and moving pictures. Howlers have the ability speech, not because they're alive (which they're not), but because they are letters programmed by magic to speak. They project a recording of the users voice to the recipient of the letter (kind of like a voicemail). The moving pictures are pictures of a subject that in movement, which repeats on a loop (like a gif). The moving portraits bring together both ideas into one thing. The similarities between all three is that they are all programmed to do this with the help of magic. In the Harry Potter universe, one cannot use magic to create life, but one can use it to mimic life. That is the nature of moving portraits. I'm saying your understanding is untrue because it implies that those steps result in a being that is completely alive, when that really isn't the case. It isn't alive. It's programmed to mimick life.
