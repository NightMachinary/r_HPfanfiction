It doesn't state it directly, but Rowling is Christian and clearly sees HP as a Christian universe (not as directly as /Chronicles of Narnia/, but still). Thus we can presume the existence of an Abrahamic-God-type figure.

But if there /isn't/ a benevolent god, then the way souls work is relegated to just a natural phenomenon that has no bearing on philosophy. If wizards have souls and the Sorting Hat none, it just means that wizards have a vastly extended "lifespan" compared to the Hat, and that's that.
