My personal understanding was that Portraits were created with a "blank" (but sentient) mind and the basics of the person's memories and personalities were then imprinted upon it, but only the basics, hence "bad copy". Like an actor trying to impersonate someone, but only mimicking their broadest mannerisms and habits --- which doesn't mean the actor as an independant person isn't sentient, obviously.
