Evidence, please, dammit. What proof have you that magic cannot create life? When has anything like that been said? On the contrary, magic seems very good at /giving/ life to stuff. Perhaps I'm wrong on portraits. Perhaps. But Rowling has /never/ talked about the Sorting Hat in a way that implied he was just a "puppet" --- she talks of him as of a /person/ with /agency/. (And we don't /know/ where the magical creatures came from, but considering we know about things like the 'experimental breeding ban' and the origins of Quintapeds, it does seem likely at least some of the magical creatures were created by wizards long ago from non-magical ones.)
