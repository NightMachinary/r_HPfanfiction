Fair enough, but my point still stands: as long as an artificial mind has feelings and consciousness in the /present/, where they came from is irrelevant. There is no ethical difference between a man who genuinely lived a forty-year-long life, and an AI that thinks exactly the same thoughts as this man based on simulated memories of those 40 years.
