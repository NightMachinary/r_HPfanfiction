I'm not confusing any lore. I don't even follow Tolkien's lore. Magic can't be used to create life in the Harry Potter universe and the Sorting Hat is no exception. The Sorting Hat is also a result of extremely complex spells, this time from four different people with different personalities, attitudes, and priorities. This makes it seem as though the Sorting Hat has life, when in all actuality, it does not. It's an enchanted hat. Dementors and Dragons weren't created by magic in the Harry Potter universe. They're magical, sentient creatures. You can't categorize them as the same thing as the Sorting Hat. Also, it's not the /way/ the portraits act that prove they are not living beings. It's the way they were made. I've already proved and explained this to you. The portraits are pretty much magical versions of Artificial Intelligence. JK Rowling herself said they were just 2-Dimensional representations
