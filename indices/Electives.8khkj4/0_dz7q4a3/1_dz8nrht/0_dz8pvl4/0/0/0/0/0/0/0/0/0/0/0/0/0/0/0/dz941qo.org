Actually, wizarding photographs aren't looping gifs in canon. That's the movies' idea. In the books photos react to their surroundings like portraits, or at least "artistic" photos like Lockhart's do,

At any rate, you say "magic can't create life"? Don't confuse your lores. Rowling isn't Tolkien, and "magic can't create life" has never been a rule of HP magic. (Even if you discount non-organic beings, and it seems oddly bigoted not treat something like the Sorting Hat as a sentient being, how do you think things like Dementors or Dragons were created, anyway?) And you repeat "that really isn't the case", but /prove/ it. When has a Portrait behaved in a way that did /not/ seem consistent with their being sentient?
