Self-amplifying guitars would be tricky. We have the Sonorous Charm, which makes voices louder, and it's not a great stretch to have a version that you can cast on your instrument. The trick is going to be getting an amplification charm that can mimic the behaviour of an overdriven amplification circuit.
