I always had this idea of instruments that can simulate other instruments. Musicians proficient on it can replace entire bands with just that one enchanted guitar.

I always get annyoed when an author writes about a club, and all that is played there is muggle music because "muggle popular media is better". Granted, more competition, better quality. But I think many authors are incredibly uncreative with the Arts in magical society as a whole.
