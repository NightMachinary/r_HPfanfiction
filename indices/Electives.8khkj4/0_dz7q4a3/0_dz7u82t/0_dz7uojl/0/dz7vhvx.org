Yeah, but I don't really consider the movies canon for that sort of thing. According to JKR, the only wizarding games were Exploding Snap, Wizard Chess and Gobstones. Kind of boring, especially when fan fiction writers seem to think that those could be the only things that exist. With so many Muggle-borns, I'm sure someone brought a few D&D books to school at some point.

Intellectually, I understand that she had a job to do with telling the story, but some areas of the HP world seem awfully flat.
