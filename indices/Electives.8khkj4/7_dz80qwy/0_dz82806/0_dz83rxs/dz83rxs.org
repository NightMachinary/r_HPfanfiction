Yes, thus my comments of that nature.

Personally, I prefer the fanon interpretation of Arithmancy as spell creation/magical theory, and Runes used for at least wards, maybe enchanting as well. It means that there's at least some reason to take any of the electives whatsoever --- because as is, I'm not sure I'd take any of them.
