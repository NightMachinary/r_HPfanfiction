Obviously, any list of electives is going to be difficult to justify for only 280 students, especially considering how packed schedules seem to be. That said...

Latin, and probably at least one or two more languages. Probably French and German, but an argument could be made for some sort of Celtic language. Magical Theory, assuming that isn't covered by Arithmancy. Wizarding Culture, perhaps. If nothing else, there should be some sort of introduction to how the governmental system works. Herbology probably should be an elective like Care --- I don't know why it's not. Personally, I'd swap in a language requirement for Herbology. Enchanting or Warding, if you assume those aren't covered in Runes.

Honestly, Hogwarts is an awful school, canonically. Divination is apparently useless. Arithmancy is basically another form of divination. Runes is a dead language. Care is only useful if you plan to work with creatures. Muggle Studies is the only one that /might/ be useful to most people, but it's still pretty situational considering most wizards apparently don't actually interact with the Muggle world almost ever. The core classes are only marginally better.
