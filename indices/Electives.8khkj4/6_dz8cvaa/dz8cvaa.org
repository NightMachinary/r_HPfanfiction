I feel there should be politics/law elective which isn't general history of magic. Healing, enchantment/artificing, the Arts, languages, theory (my preferred name would be Unnatural Philosophy). I think a compulsory subject should be something along the lines of The Liberal Arts, which would cover things similarly to a "classical education" like grammar, latin, maths, etc.
