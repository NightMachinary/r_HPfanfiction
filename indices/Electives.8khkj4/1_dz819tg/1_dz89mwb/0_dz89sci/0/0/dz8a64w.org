No, I don't think it does infer a complete language.

Those meanings applied to runes in our world as well. Norse Futhark runes (predominantly the Elder Futhark) were used as both letters to express sounds or syllables, and as symbols of complete concepts - the “eihwaz” rune meant a yew tree, and could be used as shorthand for concepts around life and death. Calling that /defence/ is an interesting translation with those connections in mind.

“Ehwaz” was a symbol for “horse”. /Partnership/ is another interesting translation from Jo, though a good one - horse and rider are partners.
