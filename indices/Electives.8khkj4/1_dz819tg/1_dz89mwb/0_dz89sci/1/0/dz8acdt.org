I've read the rune poems. I don't know them as well as I would like, but I know them :)

My point was that the language doesn't HAVE to be written in runes to be intelligible - it's like the difference between transliterating Mandarin in Chinese characters or in pinyin.

Modern Icelandic is still relatively intelligible with Old Norse, and they're not using runes still.

How do we know it's Norse they're learning? The Saxon futhorc uses most of the same runes, but it's not the same language.
