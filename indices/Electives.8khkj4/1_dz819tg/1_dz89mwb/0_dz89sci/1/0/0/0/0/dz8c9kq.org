  So which of those three languages is this language course supposed to be looking at?

My apologies: I didn't see what you were driving at. The /obvious/ answer would be Old English, since that would have been the language of the majority of Hogwarts students at the time it was founded - runes themselves were made illegal in England shortly after the school was founded on account of the Roman church wanted everyone using their script.

However, Hogwarts was founded in the north of what is now Scotland, and there was a strong norse influence there, with heavy colonisation, with its high-water mark just before Hogwarts was founded and the strongest influence in the Highlands and Islands. If the Founders wanted to hire an instructor in Runes - or just consult someone - that would have been the nearest source, and one coming from a much longer and stronger tradition of using runes in divination and enchantment. The anglo-saxons might've inherited it, but they had centuries less experience with it and centuries /more/ of the church deprecating the practise of non-christian magic.

Old Frisian comes in a distant third, that had become Old English in the British Isles (and you can actually hear it in old-people Geordie, which isn't far from being mutually intelligible with Ostfriesland dialect to this day)
