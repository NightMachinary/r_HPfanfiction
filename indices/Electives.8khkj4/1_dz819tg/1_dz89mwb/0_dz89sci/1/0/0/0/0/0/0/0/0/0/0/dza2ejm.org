Don't really have one: I'm a dilettante right down to my boot-nails and an unashamed autodidact. Anything that catches my interest, I go digging. I tend to focus on economics, linguistics and engineering (military and civil alike) because you can trace a /lot/ about a people from those things. Who they're trading with, who they're picking up words from (and /which/ words) and how their homes are plumbed (for which we have some surprisingly detailed sources as regards the roman empire, including some of the frauds that the plumbers could get away with when hooking a household up...)

Esprit de l'escalier edit: If I had to sum up my approach to history, it would be 'amateurs study tactics, professionals study logistics'. Someone told me that at an impressionable age and it stuck. So, engineering and economics. The linguistics part was an accident of timetabling at A level and I just kept finding it useful.
