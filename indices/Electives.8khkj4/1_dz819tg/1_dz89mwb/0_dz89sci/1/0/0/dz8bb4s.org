The point I was (somewhat hamfistedly) driving at is that you really don't "get" a script that's more than a pure sound-value alphabet or syllabary unless you have more than a bull's notion of the language and culture it's designed to serve. Runes are more than mere sound-value letters in an alphabet. Sure, you can use them that way, but you're missing part of what makes that script uniquely itself.

I suspect part of what makes this tricky to explain is that as a modern english speaker you're used to standardised orthography in an alphabet that has no meaning beyond its sound-values: as a mode of written communication in a post-enlightenment culture with printing presses and message transmission more advanced than cleft-stick runners, it is without equal.

If your letters mean more than their sound-values, however, and you /don't/ have strong standards of orthography, and every text has to be hand-written on expensive materials, you get as much mileage as yo can out of your letters and alter the spelling of your words to use characters that gloss the meaning of the word, or use a synonym or even a kenning of your word to bring in the runes you want to use.

So if you want to talk about the sea, you could write 'harr', and the double-raido at the end doubles up on 'journey', and reinforces 'joy of the horseman, toil of the steed'. Or you could call it mastallr, 'stall of the seagull', which opens with the runes for 'man' and 'wealth'. One of those is how you'd say it if you booked passage on a ship. The other is if you're joining a viking crew, off a-raiding. (Especially since seagulls are coastal birds, and that's where your targets are...)

Don't take those examples as actual scholarship, btw. They're what I came up with without cracking a book. (I'm loads better with coptic and hieroglyphs, where the shading of meaning based on how you write the word is a /lot/ clearer.)
