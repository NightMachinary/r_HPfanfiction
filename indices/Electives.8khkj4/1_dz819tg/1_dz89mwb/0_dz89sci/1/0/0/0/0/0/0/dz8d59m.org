Early mediaeval british hill-fort: ditch-and-bank with a palisade and buildings inside, some of which might have been influenced by the gaelic and pictish tradition of round tower construction, which in Scotland goes back to the Iron Age.

Motte-and-bailey castles were the coming thing in fortification at the end of the 10th century, but had barely made it to England, let alone Scotland.

It /might/ have had some Roman influence: Salazar, judging by his name, was a basque, and as such would have been familiar with the remains of Roman Hispania, and if Rowena Ravenclaw was, to her friends, Hrothwin of Ravenglass, she would have grown up in a town built on a long-disused roman naval base, part of the western end of the /Limes Britannicus/. (And she latinised her name, so probably a classicist to boot, fitting in with the enduring historical image of scholarship.)

The roman influence would have squared off the fortification as much as the terrain allowed (not much in the Highlands), added half-round towers to the outer walls, and imposed a grid on the internal buildings. The change from wooden palisade to brick or stone outer wall would have come a lot sooner under the roman way of doing things, too, and since they substituted magic for the labour-power of an entire legion (who were sappers when they weren't being heavy infantry) they would have been able to do that a lot earlier. The Great Hall would have started out, on this version of events, as Hogwarts /basilica/ and been used for lecturing and the public parts of administration of the school and community.
