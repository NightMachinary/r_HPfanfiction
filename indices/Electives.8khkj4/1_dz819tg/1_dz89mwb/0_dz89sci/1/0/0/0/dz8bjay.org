You're right, and up to a point I agree with you. The usage of kenning and such to gloss the meaning of the phrase does matter.

But “Runes” in and of themselves form a set of symbols that could be used for any of several languages. Assuming the books mean what I think they mean when they say “runes”, that's at least three languages - Old Norse, Old English and Old Friesian. They have some similarities, but they're not the same, nor even mutually intelligible past a certain point.

So which of those three languages is this language course supposed to be looking at?
