An alphabet/script that you miss all the subtleties of if you don't speak the language. The meanings of the runes are recorded in 'rune-poems' that are written in various dialects of Old Norse (the Icelandic one is the easiest to find via google) and you miss the subtleties of those if you're not familiar with Old Norse poetic conventions. And this is magic: subtleties /count/.

Learning runes in and of themselves takes an afternoon, learning how they're used requires taking the language course.
