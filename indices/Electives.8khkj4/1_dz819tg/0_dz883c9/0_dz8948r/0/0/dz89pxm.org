Gobbledegook would be useful because it's the language of the goblins, and goblins control /literally all of the money/.

I could just see a goblin coming to an agreement with humans and trying to sneak in some hidden clause on the end of that agreement based on the fact that the humans don't understand Gobbledegook/are relying on a translator.

Things like ownership of Gryffindor's sword, for instance.
