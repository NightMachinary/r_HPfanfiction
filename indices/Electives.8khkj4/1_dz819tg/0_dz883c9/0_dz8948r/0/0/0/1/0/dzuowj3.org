I'd give them a week again World War 1 Muggles and 30 seconds against Bellatrix Lestrange razing it with Fiendfyre. Voldemort could probably just tear down the front door and indiscriminately slaughter all Goblins.

They might be good craftsmen and decent fighters, but they don't appear to have gotten the memo about automatic weapons, chemical warfare or that opposing Voldemort with melee weapons is bad idea (and muggleborns wouldn't find it difficult to get a few AKs from post Soviet Eastern Europe). Goblins have never fought professional armies or major dark Lords. By the sounds of it, they had skirmishes with the local wizards and maybe an improvised task force raised against them, but most rebellions predate the Ministry. It would be like Highlanders charging Carolean or Frederikan Infantry formations. On an individual level, the Scots might be the better warriors, but very rarely conflicts are decided on that level. It might become costly and messy, but no way Goblins could mount a better defence than 20th century muggles. Goblin magic is simply too limited to be of great use (at least given what we see in canon).
