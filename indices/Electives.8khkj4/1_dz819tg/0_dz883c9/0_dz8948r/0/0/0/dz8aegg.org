And if they pulled that kind of shit, Gringotts will be razed to the ground by a horde of angry witches and wizards, who would see that as confirmation of all their biases. It would certainly tank the economy for the short term, but getting rid of a foreign power controlling the economy would definitely be better in the long run.

Also, Gringotts is a bank, or storage space to be more accurate, and a tomb raiding business. The average witch or wizard would not be making deals with them. It is never said that they offer any financial services besides hoarding gold. No loans, stock exchange or anything like that.
