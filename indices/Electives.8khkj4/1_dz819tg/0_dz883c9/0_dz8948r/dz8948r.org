Because Latin was the language of both scholarly and religious life for centuries. I wouldn't be at all surprised to find a lot of books in the Hogwarts library written in Latin. Most of the spells Harry canonically knows have a Latin base - “Accio” is literally “I summon”. It's not a waste of time when it's in magic he uses every day.

Understanding Latin makes the modern languages you mentioned easier to learn, too. I speak French and Spanish, and it's helped me!
