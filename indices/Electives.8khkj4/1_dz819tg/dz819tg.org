I'm genuinely surprised there are no languages. Both human ones - Latin comes to mind here, since it would be a huge help in creating new spells - and things like Gobbledegook and Mermish. We know Dumbledore speaks both, and it's heavily implied Bill speaks Gobbledegook, but where the hell did they learn?

Music and art. We know there's a wizarding creative community, so where do these skills get picked up? Where would someone learn how to paint portraits like the ones in the Headmaster's office? Do the Weird Sisters have roadies and stage crew? Music involves both performance and composition, as well as technical skills training for stage crew...my school offered classes in all three. Are there wizarding poets, authors, playwrights?
