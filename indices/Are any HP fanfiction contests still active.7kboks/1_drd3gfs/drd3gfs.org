Not sure about contests, but there's always some fest or the other going on. A far cry from the HP heyday where two dozen or so would run simultaneously, but it's not dead yet.

You can keep track of them on [[https://potterfests.livejournal.com/][The Pimping Place]]. HD Erised is currently posting and will do so for a while. Ditto for Smutty Claus and the SS-HG giftfest. The Next-Gen fest was a big one that just finished posting.

There's a contest on DLP that's currently accepting submissions. SIYE has three or four a year, though it has fallen on hard times lately. There's a few more secret santas coming later in the month - I know there's a mini-exchange for Draco/Ginny, and I'm hearing of a Harry/Ginny secret santa as well.
