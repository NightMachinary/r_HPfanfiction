Hey there,

so this request is basically a request of a massive trope (massive in terms of stories published), and most of them aren't well-written - so there is some aversion to those fics in this subreddit.

You might want to try stories by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Erobst][robst]], he is massively popular. (see Taure's reply)

An alternative might be linkffn(Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor).

Also, everything that has "takes control" or something similar in the description will probably satisfy you.

--------------

Now, there are stories that don't fit your exact premise, but aren't /bad/, and some of them are:

- linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) Harry is definitely independent here, and knows how to have fun. A truly enjoyable read.
- linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) another fun story.
- linkffn(Deprived by The Crimson Lord) Harry is also independent here, and definitely doesn't know how to have fun :) Either way, it's a novel concept
