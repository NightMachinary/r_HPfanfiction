I believe Vekin87 plays in his Albus Potter series with the idea that the wizarding world used to be much bigger and the part we see in the books is just a ruin of what remained from it following Voldemort's war. Also the generations immediately following the second war didn't receive formal education since the records with upcoming students were destroyed in the Battle of Hogwarts, as well as the records of the Muggleborns who were children during Voldemort's reign.
