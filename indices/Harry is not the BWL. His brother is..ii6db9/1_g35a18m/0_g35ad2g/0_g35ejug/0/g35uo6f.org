It's basically a parody of incompetent!Dumbledore in this kind of fic, so it was intended to be that over the top.

Yeah, I too vastly prefer it when Dumbledore is compassionate and capable. Sadly, it's rare enough in WBWL/Potter-Twins stories that I genuinely can't think of any off the top of my head.
