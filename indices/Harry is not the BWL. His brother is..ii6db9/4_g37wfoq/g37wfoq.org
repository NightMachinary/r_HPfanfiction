I still want to read a story where his brother genuinly is the BWL and Harry is a few years older. I had this nagging idea where Harry truly and genuinly loves his family and they love him which means as he gets older he gets more and more desperate to protect them. Especially his brother.

Ambitious. Clever. He's in Slytherin and by all appearance falls in the bad crowd. Goes to join Voldemort. Rises in the ranks and does some bad stuff (only maybe not and with the help of Snape /& Dumbledore hides his victims until the end of the war).

Another twist? I want Harry to be named the Boy-Who-Lived, a decision made to protect his brother. His parents and Dumbledore (and Voldemort, maybe?) are the only ones who know. And his brother is motivated by the desperation to bring his beloved older brother back, facing down Voldemort without knowing the truth.

I think it'd be an interesting twist to the trope.

I should really get around to writing it some day. Hm.
