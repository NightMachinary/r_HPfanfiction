linkffn(5353809) is probably one of the most popular HP Fanfictions in terms of being well-written and famously abandoned.

linkffn(5201703) is also a "Harry isn't the BWL" fanfic but this time it's Neville instead and honestly it's my favorite fic ever created. Incredibly well-written along with a gripping story and probably the best Dumbledore written in fanfiction.
