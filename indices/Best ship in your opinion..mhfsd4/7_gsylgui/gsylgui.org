I like to see the "underdeveloped" ships realize their potential. Let me see Millicent Bulstrode or Pansy Parkinson with Harry Potter, or see Lavender Brown or Pansy Parkinson with Hermione Granger. It gives all the wonderful "enemies to friends to lovers" aspects of Snape and Draco ships with none of the irredeemably horrible person problems of actually shipping Snape or Draco, and your fic would be one of tens instead of one of thousands.

I also have a soft spot for ships involving Padma Patil, Susan Bones, and, uh... older women. The age gap when you ship Harry with Nymphadora, Narcissa, Bellatrix, or Amelia can soothe an angry spot in my psyche. Ditto Hermione with Andromeda or Narcissa.

Bonus points to whoever writes a Harry/Walburga crackfic.
