Having said that, there are minor relationships I would like to see explored, but I have never got a good one:

- Ron/Lavender post-poisoning. I have hinted to it at linkao3(20141410) (and basically explained, what I think could be interesting on it), it is somehow suggested (but not much developed) in linkao3(568303), but I have never read it written well and full-length (but perhaps, it is not meant to be the main relationship of the story).
- I am always hungry for good Petunia stories with good redemption arcs, and that certainly includes some good Petunia/wizard stories. I am so sorry [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]] hasn't written another episode after linkao3(13682133), which kind of seems to end in the middle of the story. I would love to see some continuation to linkffn(12551744). Yes, there are plenty of Petunia/Severus stories but most of them are either horrible, unfinished, or time-travelled to the Marauder's Era, which could be good (e.g., linkao3(23090008)), but it usually walks away from the redemption/forgiveness story, because it is not needed.
