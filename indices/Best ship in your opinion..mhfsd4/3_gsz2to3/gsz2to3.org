As people said before, any ship can be interesting as long as it is well developed, and it's not like there is a "perfect ship" that can automatically makes a fic interesting.

But when it comes to a favourite ship, I have always been interesting by Harry/Daphne. As a "pureblood of Slytherin" and a blank slate, Daphne gives a lot of possibility to make an interesting story : Star Crossed Lover, that one good Slytherin, or even that traitorous lover . . . Sadly, most story just use that some bland "Ice Queen of Slytherin" persona.

Recently, I have also been pretty interested by Tracey Davis. She is even less developed than Daphne (which is already an exploit in itself) and is technically not canon since she only appears in Rowling notes, but fanon seem to agree to make her a Half Blood in Slytherin. I like the idea of "Chosen One Harry" being with some normal, unassuming girl whose only flaw is to be in the same House than the Magical Nazis.\\
Sadly, the character is almost exclusively used as a +1 for Daphne (ever as the loyal best friend, or girl that comes in package when in relationship) and it's almost impossible to find a fic with only her pairing.
