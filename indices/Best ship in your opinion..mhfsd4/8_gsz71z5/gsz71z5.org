I adore Cedric/Cho. I would also have liked to see Harry/Cho if they hadn't broken it off.\\
Tomarry/Harrymort: a lot of potential given their Horcrux bond.\\
Lav/Parvati: Loved their dynamic in canon.

I also find myself increasingly intrigued by Padma/Ron. They might not have lasted, but it would've been cool to see.

But there isn't a /best/ ship, just favourites. These are ones I feel would work well together, and enjoy reading. Ships like Haphne aren't really my cup of tea, but a good writer can make them work even though the characters never meet in canon.
