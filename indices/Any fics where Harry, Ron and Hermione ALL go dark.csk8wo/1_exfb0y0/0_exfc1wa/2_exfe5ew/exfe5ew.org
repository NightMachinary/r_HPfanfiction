The story is definitely a guilty pleasure for me, It probably hits every bad or complained about trope at once.

(Death Eater Weasley's, Both Harry and Hermione have special powers, Harry has a unique and powerful inheritance (including being the heir to the British throne), Abusive rapist Ron, Super Seer Lovegood (though in this fic it is shifted to Luna's daughter), Hits about Every Trigger Warning you can think of, tons of discussion of sex and sexuality, Harry and Hermione being literally fated to be together, Narissa being the only good Malfoy, and Dan and Emma Granger.)

It does have some interesting ideas in it, and the writing is good even if the tropes aren't.
