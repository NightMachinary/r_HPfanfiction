I would like a humorous dark!Ron fic that's a homage to the criminally underrated Serial Mom

Ron is fantically loyal to his friends to the point where he bumps off anyone who wrong them in anyway

Crabbe shoved Hermione ? Crabbe had an unfortunate adventure with a mace in the dungeons

Pansy insults Harry's mum ? Pansy falls out the seventh floor window

Ron burns down the Dursley's house after picking Harry up in second year

Rita Skeeter is printing lies ? She and and her cameraman fall victim to a murder-sucide
