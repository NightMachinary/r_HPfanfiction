I always thought of the Weasleys as very passionate people and that's why they don't care much about money. Arthur cares about Muggle stuff and does his thing, Bill was extremely brilliant (having been Head Boy and having earned twelve OWLs - more than Hermione) and chose a well paying career (because maybe as the oldest son, he felt the need to help the family) but yet adventurous, Charlie quit Quidditch despite being a boy wonder at it for his passion for dragons, Percy was all for politics and rules, Fred and George were jokesters and broke the bank based on this, Ginny was all for sticking out and she became the wife of the BWL as well as a famous Quidditch player and later on a well known reporter. In my opinion it's only Ron (despite being one of the main characters) who doesn't have a particular ambition other than getting out of his brothers' shadow. Sure he sticks for the weaker ones (muggleborns and house elves) but even that is more out of love for Hermione. Sure he is a good friend. Sure he makes it on the chocolate frog cards but that's because he sticks with Harry.
