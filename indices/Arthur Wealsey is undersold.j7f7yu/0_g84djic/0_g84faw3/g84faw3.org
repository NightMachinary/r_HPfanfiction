agree with this take. I still am still frustrated with the way Rowling portrayed him. I think he could have been an absolute boss with a few tweaks, but as he is he's one of the only examples of a wholesome just straight up good dude. A good dad who loves his kids and his wife and works real hard at something he's passionate about

he does take bribes though, and falls into cronyism, but in a cesspit like the ministry I don't know how well I'd do as far as that shit goes either
