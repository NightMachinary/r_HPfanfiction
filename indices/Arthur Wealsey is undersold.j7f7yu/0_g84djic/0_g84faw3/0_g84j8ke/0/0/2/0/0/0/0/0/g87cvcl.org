One thing:

Twins explictly designed that situation so only a shit person would be affected, or at least someone greedy, gluttonous and lacking self-control.

They cast no spells. They weaved no compulsions. They just dropped some of their possesions, and immediately set to retrieving them. To come to any harm, Dudley had to commit a theft - it's like attempting to steal a pretty light on top of the candle and being surprised it burns.

That they knew that he was that type of person changes nothing.
