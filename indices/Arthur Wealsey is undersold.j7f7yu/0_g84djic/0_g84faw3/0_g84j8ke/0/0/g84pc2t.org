Yeah. That book is honestly the worst for Arthur. He also connects the Dursley's house to the floo network without their consent and when his sons partake in muggle baiting (I love them but noooo) he just laughs it off.

Like those people are terrible, but we need to teach our kids how to behave, you know? and that stuff only ended up making things worse for Harry.
