He didn't laugh it off. He tried to calm the situation down to undo the twins' joke on Dudley's tongue but as soon as he was home he ripped into them - he only suddenly quit when Molly came in. And he shouldn't have stopped then, be he probably tried to avoid a further escalation in his home, an angry wife and more tension between molly and the twins.

But yeah, he doesn't really think much in GoF.

I find it a shame that he's so easily represented as a clueless joke, because he's the type of man that is sorely lacking in a lot of media, and HP too. He is kind good man who dislikes conflict, machismo and bravado but stands up with all he has to do the right thing when it's needed. I've always thought that he was the healthiest male figure to look up to Harry had in his life. Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore... the're essentially good people, but they've got a major share of problems themselves.
