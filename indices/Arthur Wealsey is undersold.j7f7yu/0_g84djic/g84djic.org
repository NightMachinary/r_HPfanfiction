To be honest I never really thought that he's the one that actually does the curse breaking, obliviating, the healing. In my headcanon he's the one in charge of finding those situations, going to them, finding out where the curses lie, who needs to be obliviated and tracking them down, and finding who needs to be healed and getting them to healers. He's also the one delegating work to curse breakers, obliviators, and healers.

That being said, I think canon and fics do portray to be much dumber than his job requires, and it is a bit ridiculous that he knows so little about muggles while being head of such a (Imo) pretty damn important office.
