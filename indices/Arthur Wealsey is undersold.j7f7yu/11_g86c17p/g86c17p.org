Arthur IS awesome, but not because he's an expert curse breaker - he's an EXPERT POLITICIAN. Heâ€˜s Head of a department half the Wizengamot would eliminate if they could. They can't in part because Arthur knows how to schmooze and juggle competing rivals against each other so well they don't even realize he's neutralized them.
