It's made pretty plain that you can't use electronics around Hogwarts. That's canon, Hermione says so in the fourth book(chapter 28, Draco not being able use electronic bugs. Hermione also says it several times through the series). I've heard the argument that that is just Hogwarts wards(wards are not canon). But I've always taken it to mean highly magic areas short out electronic equipment. Either way Arthur made an electronic car work on Hogwarts grounds...

Edit: found a link to JK talking about Colins camera and how it worked, since as we know magic and electronics don't work together [[https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221619/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=81][Colin's Camera]]
