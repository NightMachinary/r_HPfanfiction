It is a place where you can get phoenix feathers. Even if all the wizards that work/live there didn't spell the buildings (and just the Gringotts proves that wrong), the wands, potion ingredients, flying brooms and many various 'interesting' objects in it's neighbouring Knockturn Alley would make it a magical area. Not to mention much-traveled Floo exits and the crowd of actively practicing witches and wizardsthat fill it on regular basis.

Otherwise, Hogwarts itself would be considered nonmagical.

That means, the "Magic doesn't work around electronics" is inconsistent at best. And even if the Wards are fanon, the DA curse is apparently not, providing a precedent.

The point is, WoG is irrelevant when directly contradicted by source material. In case where no single, uncontested by books, solution exists, I believe fans are entitled to come up with their own. This is one such situation.
