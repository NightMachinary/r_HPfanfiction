#+begin_quote
  While returning to his past has been more of a challenge than Harry expected, he has still managed to find time to make sure his young friends are looked after. But Harry is beginning to realise that juggling his past and his future is more difficult than he expected, and controlling the timeline is more complicated than he thought. Sequel to Harry Potter and the Ticket Backwards.
