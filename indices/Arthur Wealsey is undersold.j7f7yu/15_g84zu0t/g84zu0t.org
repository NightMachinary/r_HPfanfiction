I am also tired of all the people saying that his lack of knowledge about the Muggle world is unacceptable, especially since he doesn't know anything about " eckeltricity ".

Part of it is because, just as you said, his job does not ask him to understand "how" Muggle technology work, but to identify which items when jinxed and to deal with the situation. But it's also because, for a Wizard, Electricity is probably the most useless thing ever.

From the point of view of the Wizards, "Electricity" is just something Muggles came up with to live without magic, but they have no reason to care about it. Pretty much anything done by electricity can easily be replaced by a spell (from the Animation Charm to the Lumos). So yeah, Arthur know that electricity is used to make things work, but he doesn't know how since Magic is made it useless. He is in the same situation as someone knowing that cars "need" gas, but who has no idea how gas makes a car run.
