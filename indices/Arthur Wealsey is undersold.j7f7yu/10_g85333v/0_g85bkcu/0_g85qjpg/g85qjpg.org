THIS. As Tom Clancy said of his recurring character Ed Foley, the best disguise for a spy is to have him be thought of as 'a worker drone shooter isn't intelligent enough to be a spy'.

For me, the points that made me always wonder if Arthur was following the 'Don Diego'/'Clark Kent' path was the fact that he fits it so well - he's competent enough in an area no one else wants to also put him in charge of it (remember, even a department head of Misuse of Muggle Artifacts is still someone who's frighteningly competent and magically powerful - he's the first line of defense before you call in Aurors or Unspeakables).

I also always thought that he was more aware of the Muggle world than he let on, particularly around his family. Remember, he survived the First Wizarding War (and as a 'blood traitor' who married into the Prewitt family, he was on the list), he KNOWS that Death Eaters and other Dark types are still about & he knows that loose lips abound in the Wizarding world the way that common sense does not. ðŸ˜‰ It would mean bad things if his kids or wife ever slipped up and spoke in the wrong place, so they need to buy into the image, too.

I only wish that, like Molly, Arthur had gotten his moment in the spotlight. After all, his name IS 'Arthur'...

On a totally unrelated note - has anyone else noted that Luna Lovegood, the smartest girl in the series, also has what makes a really good Bond Girl name and persona? (Hermione, to my eyes, isn't the smartest per se - to me, Hermione is a 'technician's while Luna is a 'scientist's, i.e. Luna does things for the point of discovery whereas Hermione does things for the point of implementation of existing materials. Hermione is best when she has a goal, whereas Luna is best when the goal is to look beyond the known. Best example? Hermione would have never thought to ask a centuries-old ghost for information on an ancient relic - she would have instead searched the known repositories of information to create a trail leading to it.)

Arthur, Luna, Alastor Moody and even Harry. It's interesting that the ones who are looked down on by the rank and file are the ones who keep things on the straight and narrow.
