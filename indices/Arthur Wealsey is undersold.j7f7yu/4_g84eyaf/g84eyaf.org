I actually have a headcanon that he's actually a secret undercover dude for the muggle government and has a lot of fun playing the clueless â€˜muggle lover' because it's funny.

Can you imagine his shed actually being the spy movie type of secret weapons cache and him actually reporting to M and shit? I would write it into a fic but I just don't have the capacity to do it well
