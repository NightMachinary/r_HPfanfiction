What an odd mix of authors. Robst and Columbrina have niche appeal (if you can call HHr 'niche'). WhiteSquirrel and jbern are popular, but far from the best the fandom has to offer. And I had to google LeadVonE -- he's only written DPSW, which isn't /that/ popular, surely? I only know it bc [[/u/samsungfutanari69]] promotes it in every second request thread :p
