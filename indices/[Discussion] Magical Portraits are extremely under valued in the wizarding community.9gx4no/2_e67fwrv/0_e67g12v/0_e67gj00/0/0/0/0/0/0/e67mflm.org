Well yes, I was referencing the pottermore wiki, since you pointed it out previously. However, I think that 1 in 50 of portraits being powerful enough to learn does not equal to thousands of portraits learning year after year. Since portraits are likely expensive to create, they are also infrequently made (I don't recall any portraits of which there are more than one of, and the idea of reconciling age differences between two portraits is weird), and so perhaps only 300 to 400 a generation (30 years) worldwide that are produced. Furthermore, many portraits are likely not in any location where they are able to learn. They're valuable and the older ones are likely stored. Finally, many older paintings are probably lost. All of this probably leads to far less than your purported thousands of learning portraits.
