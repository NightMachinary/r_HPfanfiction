I'm not convinced that Hogwarts has thousands of portraits, nor that you can apply a ratio to determine that there are thousands more out there. The Harry Potter Wiki, for all its inaccuracies, mentions only 61 portraits seen in the whole story (maybe including the movies). Even as large and mysterious as Hogwarts is, there are likely far fewer than a thousand portraits. Most fairly notable families likely only have so many portraits, and places with the largest collection of portraits are probably schools, then ministry buildings, then finally very rich and distinguished pureblood families, like the Blacks.
