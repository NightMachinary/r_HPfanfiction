When referring to thousands of Portraits. I meant that there are thousands of Portraits in Hogwarts, then apply the ratio. And you do have a point about them not all of them being in a position to learn. I think for one instance that if lavender could find a portrait in the hall that can and willing to listen to gossip, she would be there for hours. By canon, we know there are portraits scattered in the hallways, at entrances of houses as entry ways, guarding secret passages, and in professer offices. It would be interesting to see how many would be worth talking to.
