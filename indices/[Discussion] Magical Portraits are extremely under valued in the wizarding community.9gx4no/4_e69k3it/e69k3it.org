If you make it so they can only learn from their own subject (i.e. Dumbledore is the only one who can really 'teach' his portrait, apart from very basic things later on) that limits their usefulness significantly. Especially if you add caveats like 'the portrait will understand what is imparted to a lesser extent than the one teaching it' so you can't just read your portrait the encyclopedia and expect it to remember.
