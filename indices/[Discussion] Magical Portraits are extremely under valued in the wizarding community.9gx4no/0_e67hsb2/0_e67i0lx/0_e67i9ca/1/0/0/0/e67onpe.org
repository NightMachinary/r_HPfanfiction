But for this to be a new thing, you'd need all wizards to be idiots- since they started making portraits. No one, not Dumbledore, not Flitwick, no one would have thought of using portraits as teachers. Because as soon as one did it, it would set an example, and soon every school would do it.

So, you need to either treat all wizards as idiots or adapt the entire setting to incorporate such portraits.
