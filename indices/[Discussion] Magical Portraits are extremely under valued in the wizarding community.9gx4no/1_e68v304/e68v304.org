I personally think there is one very important phrase in Pottermore's article about them:

#+begin_quote
  they are literally and metaphorically two-dimensional.

I personally write portraits as some kind of "magical Alexa". They are incapable of learning by themselves, but they /can/ have information inprinted in them by active input from outside sources. You can add and layer enchantments on them, which give them certain capabilities.

Most portraits are just really flat depictions of people. Their characters, activities and desires kept for eternity on canvas, in one moment. A painted choir will never tire of signing, a painted hedonist never tire of sinning and so on and so forth.

Only if you add enchantments to them can they become more. For example, I once wrote a portrait into the Hogwarts Library that had the capability of searching through the contents of books. The headmaster's portrait is a good example for a continous adding of information - of expanding a database the portrait can access, if you will.

But I doubt that the vast majority of portraits would be overly useful. Only a percentile amount of them would even be able to hold a simple discussion, and even less of them would be capable of giving credible advise. Here too, the headmaster portraits would be a good example. Since they can no longer be updated, eventually the informations the headmasters hold would become obsolete.
