  Voldemort smiled. It was a cold, creeping thing. Truly human despite it being on a serpentine face.And it was then Harry could see the real Lord Voldemort. Not the madman throwing curses around indiscriminately, but the man who had lured legions of purebloods to his cause, Tom Riddle who had blinded all his teachers bar one.It was calculating. The long-game personified.--Harry would never have guessed that his animagus would have been a snake. Nor the trouble it would bring when Voldemort found out. After all, who needs to kill an enemy when you can keep them?

  !COMPLETE! He woke with a scream on his lips. Thrust so violently into wakefulness, it took him a second to realize that it wasn't a cold sweat that had him shivering in his bed; it was the three dementors. Without a wand in hand, his death was a foregone conclusion. (Of course, it was really just the beginning.)
