Did you know that Severus' full name is Severus Tobias Snape, Tobias being after his father? Except... it isn't. Severus' middle name being Tobias is completely fanon.

Sirius Orion Black is also fanon, but it always amused me that his fanon initials could stand for something else, which is very true in his case, since Walburga is very much a bitch.

I headcanon both of these complete names, but they're very much not explicit canon.
