Yeah, the books just talk about protective charms, enchantments, and occasionally protective jinxes/hexes. I have never felt that it is a really big leap though to call the use of an area effect protective charm (or whatever) putting up a ward. It /fits/ with canon - you cannot apparate into grimmauld place (the trio have to do so onto the door step) but the twins can apparate from one location within it to another location within it. This means that the anti-aparation jinx on the place acts like a shield around it, so calling it a ward around it isn't /really/ much of a change.

So sure, technically wards are fanon, but if anything they are just helping to clarify some really sloppy definitions in the magical system we're given by the books.
