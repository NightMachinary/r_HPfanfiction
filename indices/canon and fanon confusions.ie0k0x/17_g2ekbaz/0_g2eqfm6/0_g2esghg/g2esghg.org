I mean, if its just another term for the same thing, its not that big a deal. Except that people use it all the time, and its never in canon, so it feels off. Its like if all the wizards referred to Inferi as zombies. I mean, yeah, they are, but that's not the name magical society gives them in this setting.

I'm tempted to write a scene where a Muggleborn fantasy nerd who's just arrived at Hogwarts starts calling things "wards", and just gets blank looks from all the wizarding-raised kids and professors.
