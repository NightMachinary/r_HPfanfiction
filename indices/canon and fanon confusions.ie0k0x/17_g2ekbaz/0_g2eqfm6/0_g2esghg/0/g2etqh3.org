I remember reading one fanfiction, I forget which, where inferi/zombies was a british/american thing. Rowling has admitted that her math in the books is poor and even inconsistent. She hasn't said anything similar around any of her magical jargon definions, but I have mentally placed wards, jinxes, hexes, spells and such to be the same: an area were canon is inconsistent and I have to do something.

Still, I see your point and I don't insist that there is no other solution to the mixed use of language.
