This is actually a really good example of why using the general fantasy concept of "ward" is bad, though. Because the Charm that protects Harry while he is at Privet Drive is on Harry, not on the house.

A spell on a person which protects a location when that person is at that location - is this a "ward"? When you say ward, most people thing of a magical protection on a location. Which in turn is why so many people forget that the spell is on Harry - because they're using the phrase "blood wards" and thereby forget the actual explanation of how they work.

It's similar to the Fidelius. No spell is cast on the property itself - the magic is cast on a secret, which is moved into a person's soul. All of the physical effects just follow from that. And yet people call this a "ward" too.

Basically: Harry Potter magic works in fascinatingly diverse ways, and using the word "ward" imports from the general fantasy genre a "protection spells are placed on the property itself" mechanism which is often just false, and which obliterates all that fascinating diversity.
