Blood wards give shape and definition to something the books have, but leave nebulous and undefined. In the books there is /something/ magical that is related to the genetic ties between him, his mother, and Petunia, which expires when Harry turns 17. It is not, however, the totality of the protection that his mother left him, as some portion of that remains to help anchor Harry to life when he is hit with the killing curse the second time in the forest.

So calling that protection a blood ward is fanon, but only in a terribly minor sense, because the /concept/ is canon.
