I don't think so. I could imagine to easily say that Tom Riddle was more powerful wizard because he knew a way more magic (especially the Dark Magic) than anybody else. It doesn't mean I can measure it, and it doesn't mean that the power is something quantifiable.

And, by the way, I am not saying that magical core and different magical power doesn't make sense. Yes, I am less powerful than Arnold Schwarzenegger and it is easily possible that there is similar difference between let's say Harry and Hermione (to follow the most common comparison of them). What I am saying is that this whole thing doesn't have much support in the canon, and that Arnold Schwarzenegger is just so much more powerful than me. Yes, if we get into conflict, I don't think I can last, but he is certainly not immeasurably more powerful, so he won't be holding train or defeating whole army of Death Eaters just by himself.
