Measuring magical power there could easily mean that there is one or two wizards/witches, not that one is more powerful than other. Otherwise, the boat would go down just with Dumbledore (or even Voldemort, if we follow the most common examples of the most powerful wizards around). And certainly it would not do to put Harry there as well (who is usually in stories measuring the magical power considered one of the most powerful wizards around). Do you think that Hermione and let's Crab and Goyle could all fit into that one boat, because they are so less powerful?
