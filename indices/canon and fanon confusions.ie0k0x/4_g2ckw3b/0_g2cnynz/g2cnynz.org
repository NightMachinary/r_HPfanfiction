I remember someone going over the books for this. I believe he never actually calls Harry my boy, but he does say things that are kind of similar a couple of times. I think he actually calls Draco my boy on the astronomy tower though.

Edit: going over it now, oliver wood, hagrid, trelawney, and slughorn call harry my boy at one point or another, but never dumbledore.

Edit 2: Dumbledore calls Draco dear boy on the astronomy tower, not my boy.
