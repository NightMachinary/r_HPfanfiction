It depends on what you consider "canon" sources. If pottermore/wizardingworld.com counts as "canon" then Fleamont and Euphemia are Harry's grandparents/James' parents. If the movies count as "canon" then you need to fit in Charlus and Dorea Potter, whom the website does not mention at all. The two sources do not /precisely/ contradict, as the movie does not explicitly state that Charlus is James' father, but inheritance would work better if that were true.
