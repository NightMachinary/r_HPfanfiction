Sue Li. Was Sue Li ever in the series?

I'm pretty sure Cho Chang was the only Asian /represent!/ because there was an article detailing how much flak JKR got re: diversity. But I've read so many Ravenclaw Sue Li's that I cannot help but distrust my memory.

Though I must say, if this is the fandom's collective effort towards a broader representation of Asian race, it's like pot calling the kettle black, isn't it? Cho Chang. Sue Li.
