He did it because of Snape, I also think he did it because it's good to have as many people on your side as, possible.

He could have easily gone and tried to kill Neville, and yet he went after Harry, a Half-Blood, the same as himself. He had a self hatred for Halfbloods/Muggleborns, but he also loved power as well.

If someone was powerful, or he saw them as a personal threat, he'd either A go after them or B try and get them to join his side.

His right hand man was Snape, who was a halfblood, he had Greyback, who was a werewolf work for him. For some reason he didn't view Neville as a threat, or not enough of a one to mark him as such, but he did Harry.

I think it's because he knew better then anyone, what it meant to go past what people believe your limits are, as a Halfblood himself.
