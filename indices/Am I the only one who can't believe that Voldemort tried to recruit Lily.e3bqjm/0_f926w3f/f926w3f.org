I don't think he hated mudbloods as much as many of his followers did (I also don't think Hitler hated the Jews as much as his followers did -some Jewish people were even working with the Nazis in WWII, even in high positions). I think he recognized how well he can manipulate people with a common goal/enemy. He is a halfblood himself, his most trusted right hand man was a halfblood, he had werewolves working for him... He saw that through their hatred of mudbloods he could unite many pure bloods and have them do what he wanted. I think he would have made exceptions for particularly skilled muggle borns.
