Voldemort hates muggles, but while he uses pureblood supremacy dogma to get rich people who already have lots of power to fight against the system he knows that blood isn't quite everything, as he's halfblood himself.

I think if Lily was extraordinarily powerful and Snape put in a good word he'd certainly consider recruiting her as a spy since nobody would expect her to work for him. If her loyalty is lacking he can always threaten to make the muggle neighborhood where her parents live the next death eater target.

Obviously if Lily was more Gryffindorish than expected and refused, that might explain why we never see Harry's maternal grandparents and why Petunia hates wizards so much.
