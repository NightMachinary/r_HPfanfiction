Remember that the person on the other end of the computer is also a human. I always try to compliment sandwich my criticism

So: “I loved how you did X. I think that Y might be improved if you did Z. Your characterization of A was spot on and so wonderful to read.”

But also be aware that even if you are super kind and thoughtful about whatever constructive criticism you offer it could still upset the author. You can't control their reaction.
