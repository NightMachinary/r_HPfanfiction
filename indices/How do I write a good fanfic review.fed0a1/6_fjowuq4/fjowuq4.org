Beyond the obvious constructive criticism bit, if you're going to deconstruct something the author has done, that's fine, but don't deconstruct something completely subjective if you can avoid it. I've had plenty of people bash a character or plot simply because they dislike one component about it, but they have nothing to say about the quality, believability, etc. It's just “This is stupid because it should be this way” but that “this way” is a completely subjective opinion, often based on nothing more than personal preference or a desire for self fulfillment.
