Always start with what you liked/admired.

Be specific - not I didn't like Snape in your story but I'm not sure that Snape would weep quite so much.

Don't assume that something you don't like in chapter one won't be dealt with in chapter five or even fifty.

Always comment on the story, never on the author. Always, "I don't think your Dumbledore would have held human sacrifices on the Quidditch pitch". Never "Only a bloody idiot would write this."

Don't be surprised if you get an outraged reply. Some people invest faaaaar too much in their creations

If you're interested in a conversation, signal as much but don't expect it.

Spelling mistakes can be pointed out briefly at the end.
