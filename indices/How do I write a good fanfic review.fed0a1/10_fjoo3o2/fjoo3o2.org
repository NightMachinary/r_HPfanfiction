Here's my general formula for reviews:

1. What you liked about the story.
2. What you disliked about the story and, importantly, /why/ you disliked that.
3. What the person's mistakes were *and how you would go about correcting/improving them.*
4. What good things mitigated the mistakes and/or made you keep reading anyway (it's always a good idea to end on a positive).

   - Alternatively, if you cannot find a mitigating trait, then end as politely and non-confrontational as possible and encourage the author to keep trying and practicing. You can only get better with practice, after all.

Do:

- Review the substance and structure of the fic
- Highlight both the good and the bad
- Explain areas of potential improvement

Don't:

- Attack the author, their identity/politics, or their other idiosyncrasies.
- Attack the characters, especially in amateur work like fanfiction; writers have a tendency to project/empathize with their characters, so attacks on their characters can feel like attacks on themselves.
- Make fallacious arguments. Reviews need to be logical, not irrational, and based in substantial merit than irrelevant opinions.
