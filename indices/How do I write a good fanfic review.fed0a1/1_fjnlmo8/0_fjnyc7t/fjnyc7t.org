All of the above, plus my recommendation to open your review with everything that you personally liked or approved of. Make sure that the author sees that you are positively invested in their work by making a tactful comparison of what you like vs. what you think can be improved upon with a suggestion of how.

ADDENDUM: And if it looks in the next update as if your advice has been ignored, do not throw a hissy fit in your next review. Assume that all of your published suggestions have been noted and discarded. That is the author's prerogative to accept or reject.
