1. Remember that most are writing as an act of pleasure, vicarious thrill, or as a way of improving their writing ability. You should temper your criticism accordingly.
2. Recognize the big picture - whats the most important thing to relay to the author that you like/dislike in their work? Try to relay both subjective and objective views where possible (what is technically good vs. what is appealing to you).
3. Be concise. Waste too much and the author will disregard or likely not bother fully reading your words. This is counter-productive overall.
4. Don't just write to ask for an update. Passive aggressively or otherwise.
5. Try to give an indication that you have reasonably thoroughly read their work, and have not just been skimming and then gone to complain while missing between the lines. This makes you look stupid and is overall disenchanting to writing in general.
