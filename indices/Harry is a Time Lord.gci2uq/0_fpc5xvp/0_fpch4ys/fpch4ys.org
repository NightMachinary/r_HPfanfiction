Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time)

A groundhogs-day looping Harry Potter, reset back to the Very Beginning upon Every Death, in the world of an Evil Overlord List abiding Dark Lord... It's been uncountable millennia from the relative prospective of Harry, and as a result he's completely off his rocker... Time, itself, is beginning to break down, and we're approaching his Final Chance. There's no Plot Armor in this world. Get ready for a /wild/ (and confusing) ride!
