Sort of like Sinyk's fic (don't really remember the name, something about heirs?) but with no Ron bashing? Or Lordships? Or too-mature ten-year-olds? Or Dumbledore bashing? Or piles and piles and piles of inheritance? Or too-many-hyphenated-last-names? Or being knights in the Muggle world?

Edit: or marriages/betrothal at 10?
