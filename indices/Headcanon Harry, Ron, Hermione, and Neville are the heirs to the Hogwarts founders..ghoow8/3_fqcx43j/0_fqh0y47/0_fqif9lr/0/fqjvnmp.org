Canonly, Harry's not related to Gryffindor, but considering this is a headcanon, I completely agree. It's like how Tom Riddle's mother was related to Slytherin and his family turned into muggles after generations of Squibs. I can totally see that happening to Gryffindor's family and considering Gryffindor and Lily Evans both had green eyes and red hair, you could claim that it's a family trait! Especially when considering the Prewetts and the Weasleys. And I think that Neville and Harry may be related, so you could say that since Harry is already Slytherin, Neville fully inherits Gryffindor.
