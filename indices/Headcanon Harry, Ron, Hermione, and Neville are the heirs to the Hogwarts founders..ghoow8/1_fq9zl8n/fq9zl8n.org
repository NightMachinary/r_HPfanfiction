In terms of muggleborns being descended from Squibs. If you don't have something like that then you need to come up with how a muggleborn gets created with no magic ever being present in any ancestor. Obviously the easiest rationale to justify explain muggleborns is the descended from squibs storyline.

A couple of stories went with the idea of the ability to use Magic is a recessive gene and is present in all humans and somehow becomes active. I believe one story had Hermione's house on a leyline and Hermione's "magic gene" was activated at conception. And further enhanced/strengthened by living overtop of it.
