In the HP fandom:

Delenda Est had a cliffhanger in the middle of the story (when they get sent forward) and I freaked out because of all the possibilities. That was as good that story got.

Any updates to the Rigel Black series get me giddy and jittery because each chapter is tens of thousands of words long with so much content. The last chapter for the second year was ~ 72,000 words. I was very happy.

I was straight up sobbing when A Difference in the Family ended. The last chapter was beautifully written.

Other fandom:

There was a mash up between ATLA and Hunger Games (The Black Games) and one of the characters did something so unexpected to what I imagined that I may or may not have shrieked a bit.
