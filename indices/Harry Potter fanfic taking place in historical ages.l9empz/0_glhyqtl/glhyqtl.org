Hi! I have two for you. Both Founders stories.

*Strange Visitors* is a story where the trio go back to the Founders Era. Its good! Theres a good mystery, a lot of backstory, Salazar is very interesting. Both parties learn a lot. There's not a whole lot of detail regarding the era aside from 'The food is weird' but the story and plot itself is really enjoyable. I haven't finished it yet but I'm liking it! There's only 1 chapter left which i assume will be posted in the next few weeks since the last chapter was posted at the start of the month. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519887/chapters/918771]])

*Of A Linear Circle* is a series that is super big with a lot of emphasis on being real to the world and time period and everything else. Aside from the main plot which is set in OoTP time and about Snape, they have side-stories just about the founders that can be read alone. These are brilliant and are a real learning experience about different cultures and languages and royalty and how that all works. Its incredible. Part 3 is Harry going back to Founders Era. Kinda the same plot as Strange Visitors but waay more focus on the time differences of being in 996 (and in my opinion better tbh). Way more realistic and i just love the characterisations so much! The magic is all the same but bigger and better and better explained. Cannot recommend enough! linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11631114/chapters/26156739]])
