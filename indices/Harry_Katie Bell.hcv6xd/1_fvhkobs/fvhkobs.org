The problem with her is that she is just too similar to Ginny: Quidditch player, friend with Harry, and we don't know much more about her. Against her is that she is a year older, and the tradition still prefers younger women in a pair.

Otherwise, I still wonder whether somebody utilises the fact, that while Harry was waiting for his first Quidditch match, and being green from his nerves, there was next to him a year older girl with the same shade of colour on her face (because it was her first match as well). It had to be a bit of bonding experience.
