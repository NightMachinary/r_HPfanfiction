  she is just too similar to Ginny

This always comes up, and it makes absolutely no sense. Literally comes down to "they both play Quidditch".

Ginny has all the baggage of the childhood hero worship, being Ron's little sister (Best friends little sister thing), and is really quite a passive character romantically (with lots of passive-aggressive relationship signaling).

Katie is a bit of a blank slate, but that hasn't stopped Daphne shippers. But what details we do have would lead to very different story paths: She is older, so more likely to be protective/expect to be the responsible or leading person in the relationship. She has an established friends group with its own mechanics. She also is a half-blood, giving a bit of a different perspective on the blood war.

Further, there is no indication she had any intention to do anything professional with Quidditch. She also shared the hobby with Harry through most of his time at Hogwarts, for a teammates-to-lovers story if you like. (Unlike Ginny, who was clearly set up as a love interest for Harry before she ever joined the team).

The fact they both play Quidditch is a piss-poor reason for saying they are basically the same character :|.
