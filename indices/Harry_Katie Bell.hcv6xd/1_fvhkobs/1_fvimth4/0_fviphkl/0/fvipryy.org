Oh, you mean Miss Daphne "Ice Queen" Greengrass? Give me a break.

I love Harry/Daphne, but outside of a precious few stories and a few stories that purposely aim to subvert the Ice Queen trope, she's the same character.

Blonde, blue-eyed, talented at magic to the point of near Mary Sue, et cetera. She's a trope that's become copied over and over instead of authors trying their hands at a unique take on her.
