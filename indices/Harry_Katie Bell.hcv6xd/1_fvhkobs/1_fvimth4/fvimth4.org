Honestly, I put this down to fan-fic writers either not being capable enough or are just outright lazy in not developing Katie into a unique character.

Unlike Ginny, who is actually (sort of) fleshed out as the series went on as her screen-time increased, Katie is actually a bit of a blank slate.

We know that she was pissy with Harry in his first year for a while, after he, Hermione, and Ron lost a ton of points (calling him "the Seeker" instead of his name), like a lot of Gryffindors were.

We know she's a year older and, duh, on the Team as a chaser.

Her friend, maybe her bestie, is Leanne.

She's considered "kind".

She's susceptible to the Imperius Curse, but that's not exactly unique.

She's a Gryffindor, obviously, and was in the DA (not unique, again).

...That's it. We don't even know if she's muggleborn, a half-blood, or a pureblood, what her eye/hair colours are, et cetera. Hell, although it's highly unlikely, she could even be black or Latino!

Now, extrapolations could be made, like her liking sports/Quidditch or basing her appearance on her actress, the lovely Georgina Leonidas (since JKR had a direct role in choosing actors/actresses per character), but even then they can be subverted in clever ways because she's a blankish slate.

Did she feel guilty about treating Harry like that in First Year? Not guilty? That ties into her personality.

Is she actually friends with the other chasers? Or just 'team-mate friends'? Is she sporty? Girlie? A tomboy? Hell, is she a vegetarian? Vegan? Does she think that sort of lifestyle attitudes dumb? Is she straight, curious/experimental, bi, or a lesbian?

Does she swear? Does she have a hidden nasty streak on seeing her friends threatened? Is she kind yet vain? Brave? A coward? Kind yet manipulative?

Does she have a large family? A small one? Close or not? Does she want to just be a loving spouse and house-wife or does she have ambition, like playing professional quidditch or something more esoteric?

What foods does she like? Her talents?

Does she like dressing like trash outside Hogwarts? a punkette with dyed hair?
