These are my Favourite Headcanons, not tropes

- When Dumbledore became Headmaster he placed an enchantment on the student body at Hogwarts which altered fate so no Student dies while at school, which resulted in lots of coincidences that prevented students from dying when they should have, like nobody directly meeting the gaze of the Basilisk. Its basically the opposite of the jinx Voldemort placed on the Defense against the Dark Arts position. This enchantment faded after Dumbledore died.
- When objects and beings are exposed to magic they increasingly start to work by rules of stories and fairy tales rather than physics, which results in stuff like animals starting to behave more like they do in fables with intelligence similar to humans and technology starts to behave in a dramatic rather than predictable way(the Weasley car for example randomly developed sentience)
- The Greek gods were wizards, but not in the sense that there would have been one powerful wizards who was worshiped as one particular god, but rather that there were multiple wizards over longer periods of time who muggles ended up interpreting as a single god. This fits nicely with how. Greeks often absorbed foreign mythologies and tried to fit the various gods into their own. And also explains why they often have multiple contradicting myths and occasionally act very out of character.
- The point of the Seeker position is find out which people are going to be relevant in the future. Wizards assume that fate will cause important people to end up in that position, because its the only position that actually matters in quidditch. Basically, wizards are aware that their universe is to a certain extent driven by a narrative that can notice things like goodness and actively cause ironic things to happen, and this is their way to find out who to watch out for.
- It was Ginny's decision to name a child after Snape. We know from the books how bad she is at naming(see Pigwidgeon) and she had much less reason to hate Snape. Harry agreed because he got to name their first child, and it was better than her other horrible suggestions.
- You cant us Transfiguration to create potion ingredients because while its physically the same object it wouldn't change the magical significance of the objects, meaning a cat hair transfigured into a dog hair would still count as cat hair for the purpose of magic, despite the molecular structure being identical.
- Similarly using charms on the ingredients to increase the amount(enlarging and duplication) would leave magical traces on the ingredients which would render them useless for potions that require the original ingredient.
