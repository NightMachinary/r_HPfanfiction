Not sure i'd say it's my favorite but Parselmagic is cool. Gives it more to do than open doors in the girl's bathroom. Not sure for what it /does/, but I just like it doing more.

I have my own headcanon that the Marauders found/invented a new method to become Animagi. From memory Sirius describes what they did as "dangerous". The official method isn't dangerous, it's tedious. So I say that they invented/found a new way, one that was faster but more dangerous.
