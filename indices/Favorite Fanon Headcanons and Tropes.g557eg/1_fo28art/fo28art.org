These ideas don't form part of my headcanon, as there's not enough support for them in the books (and some, such as the House Elves one, directly contradict the books), but here are some ideas I enjoy:

- The Wizard's Council, which we know ruled magical Britain before the Ministry, was a wizarding sub-committee of the King's privy council, such that the Muggle King had authority over the magical world. During this period of time, the King would award prominent wizards titles of nobility.

- A magical civil war took place in parallel with the English civil war. Monarchists who supported the Wizard's Council and opposed the idea of wizarding secrecy on the one side. Pro-statute wizards who wanted an independent magical government and a split from the monarch on the other. The Wizard's Council lost, Britain supported the Statute of Secrecy, and the Ministry was created.

- From this time on, no wizards would receive Muggle titles of nobility, and those wizarding families which held pre-existing titles had been on the losing side of the war. Those titles, associated with Muggle rule and the demonised Wizard's Council, quickly fell out of fashion and it was considered a point of wizarding pride to be simply referred to by the egalitarian title of "Mr".

- Pure-bloods disagree over what constitutes a pure-blood and there are different schools of thought on the matter.

- House-Elves more closely aligned with Brownie folklore - they spontaneously appear in sufficiently magical households, and are tied to the property rather than a wizard Master.

- There were several attempts on Harry's life during his childhood with the Dursleys.

- The Moon is made of cheese, Wallace and Gromit style. Due to all the craters, the Swiss claim that the Moon must be a form of Swiss cheese and therefore belongs to them. The Dutch contest this.

- The 11 countries with top-tier magical schools are like the Great Powers of the magical world and are generally able to dictate terms to the rest of the magical community.

- The educational norm in the international magical community is for young wizards to be taught magic informally by their local community, a form of collective homeschooling where the families in a given area come together to homeschool their children as a group. Once the children are in the older teens, they may take up an apprenticeship for a more formal type of education. As a result, most wizards have quite a narrow specialism, only learning the magic that has been passed down by the families in their community.

- Over time, some of these community schooling groups can become more established and develop into something resembling a school. However, they tend to disappear after a number of years - either because there aren't enough students (because the local magical population isn't big enough to support them and years can go by without any new children being born in that area) or because key individuals move on or die. The 11 great schools are unusual in their permanence.

- Magical (Western) Europe is considered dangerously liberal by most of the world when it comes to their approach to wizarding secrecy, permitting Muggleborns at their schools and allowing wizards to marry Muggles. In most of the world, there is no blood-related conflict because pure-blood dominance is so complete that it isn't even a question.
