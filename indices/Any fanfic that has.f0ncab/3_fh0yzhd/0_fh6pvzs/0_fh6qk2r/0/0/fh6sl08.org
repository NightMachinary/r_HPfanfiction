The OP did ask for either a competent Ron, or a Ron who knows he's ordinary and doesn't angst about it. This fic has the second.

Hermione is very smart, as per canon, but having read the whole thing, I'd say that it's less important than in canon. She plays a big role as Harry's sister, but not so much as the fountain of knowledge.

Pacing is a matter of taste. If the OP wants fast paced, then absolutely, this isn't the right fic. That wasn't part of the request though.
