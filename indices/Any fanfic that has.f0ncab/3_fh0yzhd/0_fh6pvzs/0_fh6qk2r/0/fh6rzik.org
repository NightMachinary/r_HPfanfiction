Well I suppose my first response is that I shouldn't be able to read 30/112 chapters for the story to pick up. Secondly, the powerup of Voldemort is fine and all but it still doesn't change the fact that it really doesn't fit the request. It's not really competent Ron; it's a Ron the author ignores. Hermione is OP, not to mention the sheer ridiculousness of her social interactions. I suppose 4 and 5 hold true. The story also contains enough tropes and typical wankfest material that I can't say it's of good quality either.

In short, I think the combination of the poor quality, poor fit to the prompt, and slow pacing means it shouldn't be recommended. Or at the very least, my recommendation is to read the other recommendations first.
