If you only read the first 30 chapters, then yes, it probably seemed like everything is going better than canon and Harry is overpowered.

Keep reading, though, and Voldemort gets /allies/ on his level, who are devastating on their own and also significantly power him up. The sequel is still in progress, but as of the latest chapter, Hogwarts and the Ministry have been simultaneously captured, the Light forces have been driven out of Britain, and Voldemort has a good chance of being recognised by the ICW as the legitimate government of Britain, since he's now the one enforcing the Statute of Secrecy there. Plus, Dumbledore has picked up a nemesis, a Dark Lord with a personal grudge against him. Certainly all is not yet lost, but the conflict is getting pretty epic, and in the midst of all of that, being able to turn into a house cat is pretty minor. Hermione's study capabilities aren't a big factor either.
