I think linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) has all of that.

1) Definitely competent Harry. He has an actual family, and learns about magic much earlier, including training to use wandless magic for years (plus of course his Animagus transformation, as per the title). Furthermore, his adoptive sister is Hermione, so naturally he's a more diligent student. /However/, the opposition is scaled up, too, especially in fourth year and the sequel.

2) Ron is around, not as close to Harry, but not bashed. His jealousy is short-lived and doesn't cause big problems; he's generally a loyal if arm's-length friend.

3) Hermione is very clever, but doesn't singlehandedly solve everything. She's just slightly ahead of Harry in most subjects.

4) Snape is loyal to the light, but frequently cruel and unfair to Harry, and loathes the Marauders.

5) Pairings might be spoilers, but are not as per canon. Definitely not Harry/Hermione; as mentioned, they're siblings.
