I think Ron and Lavender could have worked out if Lavender chilled on the PDA and Ron actually cared (because I do agree that Ron did take advantage of her feelings towards the end). For all Lavender's faults, she showed obvious, consistent interest in Ron which is more than I can say for goddess Hermione. Ignoring the bickering aspect of the 'ship, Hermione never saw Ron's potential and constantly put him down - [[https://www.quora.com/Isnt-Hermione-somehow-harsh-to-Ron][see this link for more]]. If my crush complimented our mutual best friend, calling them 'fanciable' and 'scarred' and 'tall' when I'm all those things as well, I'd take that as a sign of disinterest.

If they had talked things out and made more of an effort, they could have gone somewhere. Even if they still broke up, it could have ended more amicably. It's really sad that their relationship was played for laughs and so that Ron could become 'deserving' of Hermione.
