The flaws need to matter. Seeing that Hermione never suffers any consequences or get in trouble or even at least confronted because of her flaws, she might as well not have them.

Or even when at first it seems like some of her actions are not portrayed in a good light, she's nearly always vindicated eventually. Like how everyone thinks SPEW is stupid, but at the end Dumbledore says she was right. Or how she doesn't believe Ron could be Prefect instead of Harrry, and then we find out that she was 100% correct in assuming that.

It's like when people say Batman has many flaws. Like how he's too paranoid. Except that he almost always turns out to be right, so he really isn't paranoid.

Compare this to Harry. His reckless attitude got Sirius killed. His flaws have impact on the story, he suffers consequenes for them.
