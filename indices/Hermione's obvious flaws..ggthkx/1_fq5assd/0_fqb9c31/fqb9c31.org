  The flaws need to matter. Seeing that Hermione never suffers any consequences or get in trouble or even at least confronted because of her flaws, she might as well not have them.

In loose chronological order, almost killed by a troll, turned into a catgirl, petrified, ostracised by her friends, wastes time on an ineffective campaign, is almost expelled, gets cursed worse than anyone else at the Department of Mysteries, loses out in Potions, fails to prevent DEs from raiding Hogwarts, distracts Harry from the Hallows, gets tortured.

  Compare this to Harry. His reckless attitude got Sirius killed. His flaws have impact on the story, he suffers consequenes for them.

Harry is the lead protagonist. /Of course/ his actions are going to have more consequences.

And, here's the thing: Harry is the point of view character. We are going to be privy to every bit of his guilt and suffering. We don't get to see Hermione's unless Harry is there to see it.
