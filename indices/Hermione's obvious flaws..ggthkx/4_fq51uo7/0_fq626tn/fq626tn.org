Don't exaggerate.

It's been a few years since I read the books, but I definitely don't remember Hermione hitting Fred/George, Luna, Percy, or Hagrid - all these characters have disagreed with Hermione at one point or the other.

She only does this with Harry and Ron, who are her best friends. Maybe I'm the weird one here, but I think you do have the freedom to do this with your besties. If you don't, you're not that close with them in the first place.
