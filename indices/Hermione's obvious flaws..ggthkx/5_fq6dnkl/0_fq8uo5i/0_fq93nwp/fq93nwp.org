Remind me again how using someone's notes to improve potions is cheating?If one student was using formulas he found online to make solving math problems easier is he cheating? If a student was taught a subject by their older sibling is that cheating? She was annoyed because Harry was doing better at her.

Also I would assume the immediate gloating was what is considered not perfect. Then again maybe next time a friend of mine fucks up really badly and is in shock I'll take the opportunity to gloat about how I was right.

Also btw, slapping someone and having birds claw them everywhere until there were multiple scars are completely different. You telling me that if Ron had slugged Hermione in the face so hard that it bruised her or broke her nose because he was jealous that she dating someone else it would have been fine because there's nothing wrong with a little violence between friends?
