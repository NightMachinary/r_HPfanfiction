  Remind me again how using someone's notes to improve potions is cheating?If one student was using formulas he found online to make solving math problems easier is he cheating? If a student was taught a subject by their older sibling is that cheating? She was annoyed because Harry was doing better at her.

Seeing as there is a prize for the best brewed potion in the first class, it's quite clear that it is an open book test.

The modifications in Snape's book aren't Harry's work - and using someone else's knowledge to improve your own results in a test is, quite clearly, cheating. He never even tries to verify Snape's scribblings, ever, throughout the course of the year.

This should be obvious.

She is rightfully annoyed - her friend cheats her out of something that should be rightfully hers, seeing as Harry's usual potion work without Snape's modifications is next to unusable.

Are we reading the same lines here? Harry isn't "in shock". He's being a whinging little shit, refusing that he was in the wrong. Sectumsempra could have just as easily have been something like a "skull exploding curse". What would his excuse have been then?
