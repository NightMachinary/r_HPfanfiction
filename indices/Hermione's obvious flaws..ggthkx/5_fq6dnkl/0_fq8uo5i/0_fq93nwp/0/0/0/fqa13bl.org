  That's the dumbest definition of cheating I have ever seen

Well in that case, I'd say your idea of what is cheating and what isn't, is rather different to most people's.

  Every student in existence uses someone's else knowledge to improve your test score, that's how people study unless they invented the contents themselves

Maybe you haven't ever taken a test where you have to answer the question in a given manner - but I can guarantee that if you do solve it in a different manner than what is expected, you will get a zero.

When literally every other student uses one particular method of solution and one single student uses concepts from something more advanced/original that they themselves did not come up with as a shortcut, that is unfair advantage, and is cheating.

HP did not come up with Snape's methods or instructions, and therefore has no right to be using those in an open-book test.

  If a student finds a website that teaches how to easily solve complex maths formula in a simplified manner instead of the more long-winded one, are they cheating when they become the best maths student in their class?

Go ahead and try this. Solve a basic mechanics problem from high school that specifies you to solve it with basic Newtonian mechanics with Hamiltonian theory and see what happens. You will get a zero.

Or a math problem that asks you to solve a problem without using graphs, and you use graphs anyway, "because it's easier". You will get a zero for being a smartass. As someone who has graded papers for

  I mean considering the opponent was trying to fire an illegal curse on him, I assume his excuse would be under duress or self defense.

Yes, this will work wonderfully when he's put on trial for murder. "B-b-but Malfoy was trying to use the Cruciatus curse! I heard him start to say Cru- that's why I cut his head off!"

Get real. In case the spell goes wrong and he kills Malfoy, it will be Harry's bumbling excuses against a dead body. And what's more, when they inspect Malfoy's wand, there won't be a single spell fired - it will appear as a completely unprovoked use of Sectumsempra.
