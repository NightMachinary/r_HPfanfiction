  Snape was cheating throughout his years at Hogwarts for failing to follow the notes given and using his own providing himself an unfair advantage cause the only thing that matters is methods
#+end_quote

Seeing as Snape isn't a moron, and can actually explain his methods and how he arrived at those conclusions, unlike Harry, he wouldn't be penalised. Snape also knows the standard methods, again, unlike Harry.

  you do realize not every subject marks based of method right?
#+end_quote

Have you ever taken a science or engineering class in your life?

No seriously, I'd really like to know which class gives priority only to the end product, not the process that is required to get to that product.

  Wanna go with cooking instead?
#+end_quote

How about chemistry? Potions is a lot closer to chemistry than cooking, since it turns substances that are otherwise completely poisonous to new substances with very different properties. When someone asks you why chemicals react in a specific manner under the proper conditions, do you go and say "Well that doesn't really matter, all that matters is the end product!"

You really like getting zeros, don't you?

  You just don't wanna admit that Hermione was just annoyed at Harry doing better than her at the subject.
#+end_quote

Harry does better than her at Defence as well, and he's been doing better than her ever since third year. I don't Hermione throwing a sulk because he's doing better in that class. I'd say he's doing about the same as she is at Charms, and you don't see her throwing a tantrum then either.

#+begin_quote
  If he was really cheating in class you think Hermione of all people would not tell
#+end_quote

I don't know what books you've been reading, but Hermione isn't a snitch. It's like you're talking about some other person here. Hermione lets him copy her assignments, knows about his made up homework in Divination, and never tells.

The only time she does snitch is when she fears for his life in PoA.

  I'm sure people would believe that the son of a Death Eater..
#+end_quote

You really are barking mad, aren't you? You seriously think that Harry will get away with an unprovoked attack on a peer that results in murder, all because of the peer's father is a criminal? And with a witness present? In a high profile case like that, with someone as famous as Harry and Malfoy, son of a convicted Death Eater? Have fun with the legal precedent that would set.

Harry's not going to be sent to Azkaban because of the political climate, but his dreams of joining the Aurors or any kind of job in law enforcement? He can kiss that goodbye.

What in the world are you smoking? Sheesh..
