By that logic Snape was cheating throughout his years at Hogwarts for failing to follow the notes given and using his own providing himself an unfair advantage cause the only thing that matters is methods .Or maybe Potion teachers only care about results. Also Slughorn was observing all the students,you think he never once noticed that Harry did something different? Or was it more likely that Slughorn was looking at the results and making sure that it was going along all right.

Yeah you do realize not every subject marks based of method right?Wanna go with cooking instead? Slughorn never said to follow the textbook, nothing makes it cheating. You just don't wanna admit that Hermione was just annoyed at Harry doing better than her at the subject. If he was really cheating in class you think Hermione of all people would not tell if Harry had been cheating in class?

Please, I'm sure people would believe that the son of a Death Eater who spent years antagonizing Harry Potter the chosen one who will take down Voldemort would try and torture him and Harry reacted quickly but with the wrong spell. If Zimmerman can get off murdering someone the same can be said here.
