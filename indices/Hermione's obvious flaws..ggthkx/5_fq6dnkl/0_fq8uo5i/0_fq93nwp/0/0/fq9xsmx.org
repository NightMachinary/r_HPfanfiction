She wasn't upset about the prize, she was upset about not being the best at making potions in general. Even after the test she was annoyed at Harry for using different instructions even-though nothing states that you can't do that.

That's the dumbest definition of cheating I have ever seen. Every student in existence uses someone's else knowledge to improve your test score, that's how people study unless they invented the contents themselves. You telling me everyone who has ever used notes that weren't written by them to study is a cheater?

If a student passes their medical exams because they studied the notes given by their senior which pointed out buzzwords , are they cheating? If a student finds a website that teaches how to easily solve complex maths formula in a simplified manner instead of the more long-winded one, are they cheating when they become the best maths student in their class? Now it they were using those notes in a close book test than yeah they are cheating.

"rightfully", potions is all about following the instructions written and Harry followed instructions that were superior to what she used and won. There's a difference between copying someone's work (which can't be done in Potions anyway since it's a basically cooking with instructions given) and using a different cooking recipe.

I mean considering the opponent was trying to fire an illegal curse on him, I assume his excuse would be under duress or self defense. Also considering he skipped dinner and had no appetite after that incident of almost killing Malfoy I would assume he was in shock but hey, what do I know, I'm sure he was completely fine.
