Honestly to me the problem isnt that Hermione has flaws but that she doesn't get to be wrong much. Not that she never does anything questionable; she does clearly. But as far as the narrative is concerned shes not wrong. She's justified.

For example in half blood prince she is a bit jealous of snape's book and gets suspicious of it. But because in the end she was right to be suspicious her jealousy is never adressed. She never got that chance to self reflect and grow because the narrative didn't let her be wrong.

The books especially later ones are full of instances like this. I love Hermione but i can't help but think how much more interesting and compelling she'd be if opportunities to be wrong and grow were capitalized on more. So its kinda a shame it wasn't weren't and still isn't. I dont often see much self reflection of Hermione that leads to character growth. Usually when i see many flaws highlighted or called out it just leads to bashing.

To be fair this is fanfic and people don't usually call out their favs like that. But i have seen this sort of thing on fanfics. Many Draco centric fics will call him out drag him for his flaws make him wrong because he is and then lead him to character growth. Now I understand there's much more to call in Draco than Hermione. I also get alot of the appeal to fic Draco is what could have been not what was. But It does result in more compelling stories for Draco and it would be nice to see that with characters i like more than him.
