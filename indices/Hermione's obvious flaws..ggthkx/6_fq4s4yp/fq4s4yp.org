Because relationships and people are complicated. Just because Hermione, in certain situations, doesn't have a problem with speaking up or making decisions doesn't mean that that's going to continue into her relationships as well. She might not be feeling particularly confident in her worth as a woman, or in her desirability, or she might just be scared to say how she feels because she's afraid of being rejected or losing her friendship with Ron. While I'm not particularly a fan of how Lavender was portrayed in the books, it's hardly fair to say that Hermione wouldn't have been emotionally affected by the object of her affections kissing someone else. This shit is complicated and sometimes leads to situations like attacking yellow birds. In the HP universe, at least.
