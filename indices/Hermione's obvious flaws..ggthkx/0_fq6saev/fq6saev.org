Well, let's face it: Hermione is a Mary Sue. JKR's complete Mary Sue, that many of us identified a lot with when we were young and thought we were the only reading, clever girl around.

All of the good qualities of all the houses are united in her.

She is as brave and upstanding as a Gryffindor, as smart and studious as a Ravenclaw, as loyal and nice as a Hufflepuff, as cunning and clever as a Slytherin.

So yeah, JKR even tried to gave Hermione some tiny little flaws, but she never made her suffer for them, because that is what you do with Mary Sues.
