Mate, I know that people like to quote Rowling that Hermione was based on herself at that age---but they neglect the other part, that Rowling does not remember herself at that age with fondness.

If Hermione were a Sue, you wouldn't have a proliferation of fem!Harry fics in which fem!Harry has all of Hermione's virtues and talents but none of her flaws and limitations.
