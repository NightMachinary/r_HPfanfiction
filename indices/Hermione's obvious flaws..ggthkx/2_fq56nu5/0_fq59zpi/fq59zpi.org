  But...

  /“We're allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who for some reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, “and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it's that stupid then I won't bother!”/

To be fair, and as Ron mentions later in the book, this does not really count. Hermione said she could bring a guest, not a date, a guest. Harry went with Luna who was also a guest and not a date. Hermione inviting Ron (who is one of his 2 best friend and the only one without an invitation) as a guest does not count as her making a first move which is ignored by Ron.
