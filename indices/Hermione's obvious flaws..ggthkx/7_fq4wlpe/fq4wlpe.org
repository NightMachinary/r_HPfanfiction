Just because hermione comes across as more mature than her years most of the time she was still a teen girl. We all let out emotions drive a time or 2 when we were that age. Yes hermione is flawed just like all well written characters are. She was upset and lashed out. Not that ron was entirely innocent in this scene either. We all know he harbored feeling for hermione at the same time. Imo he simply went with lavender because she was safe. Asking hermione out would have open the option that she didnt return his feelings which would lead to awkwardness and possibly the loss of their friendship. I figure hermion would have a similar thought process. Yes hermione was a logical level headed young woman but since when do logic and reason come into play in matters of the heart? Especially with teenagers in the middle of a war?
