The top comment on this thread says that Hermione hits /everyone/ who disagrees with her.

I know it's been a while since I read the books, but I don't think Hermione ever hit Fred/George, Percy, Hagrid, Luna or anyone. She only gives a smack to Harry or Ron, her two best friends.

Maybe I'm the weird one, but you do have the freedom to give a nice punch to your besties every once in a while. Why else would you call them best friends?
