I agree. This sub is sensitive in the extreme when it comes to things like this, and forgets that the birds can be cancelled with a few words.

Taken in context, it's really not much more than Hermione slapping Ron.

What's more, she's a teenager. Why on earth these people take so much offense at a teenager's actions is beyond me.
