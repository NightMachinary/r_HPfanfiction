It wasn't abuse. People throw that word around so much its practically lost all meaning. It was the magical equivalent of her slapping him across the face. Would you say she abused malfoy when she punched him in the nose for being a hit about hagrid? I've already said she was in the wrong but it was an emotional response. As for getting detention ron and harry arent the type to tattle. Subconsciously they both knew why she did it. That whole scene was nothing more than a magical teen soap opera.
