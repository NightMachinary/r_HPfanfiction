Abuse:

- As a verb: /treat with cruelty or violence, especially regularly or repeatedly/

- As a noun: /cruel and violent treatment of a person or animal./

Abuse is a relevant word that absolutely fits what happened.

Your point on Hermione's detention does no refute the fact that she deserved one.

And to tell you that you are pulling that 'magical equivalent of her slapping him across the face' (which would also be entirely unwarranted and UNACCEPTABLE, simply because he *dares* to be romantically involved with someone other than her), this is a quote of what actually happened to him: */"the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach."/*

You can still like Hermione, because she has done some great things in the series, but what she did to Ron here was: vindictive, wrong, cruel and entirely unwarranted. She physically assaulted him and actually did worse to him than she did to Draco Malfoy, who spent nearly three academic years being (effectively) racist and bullying towards her.
