I define abuse as being more than a one time attack. And she didnt do it for some stupid reason as Ron's with someone else she did it because her heart was breaking and she acted without thinking. And we never learn her thoughts about what happened afterwards l. We dont know that she probably felt really horrible for doing it. I never said she wasn't in the wrong but people are making out like this would lead to her being the type to beat ron anytime he did something she didnt like.
