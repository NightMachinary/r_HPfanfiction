If we move this to the real world.

Hermione Granger has a crush on her friend Ron Weasley, but he is currently dating a girl in their class. She then proceeds to attack him.

That's a literal crime, and she could have/should have received at least detention or a visit by the cops for it. You shouldn't defend abuse.
