Yes, but each 180 degree turn is caused only by some monumental reveal, not any true introspection or thought. And even then, going from thinking someone is as bad as Voldemort to worshipping the ground the walk on (how he feels about Sirius after the truth is revealed) doesn't show any more maturity or capability for true thought than blindly following the first impression. His first impression's been proved wrong, so he makes another snap judgement in the other direction.
