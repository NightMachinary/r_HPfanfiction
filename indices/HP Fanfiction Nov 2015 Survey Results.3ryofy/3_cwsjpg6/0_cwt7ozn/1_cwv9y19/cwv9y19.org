I'm with you for the very most of your reasoning. But from my - probably quite fanatic - point of view there is one addition that you overlooked:

Harry not only persists in his first impression but is often motivated to make an unsophisticated 180Â° turn if he sees any reason for it:

- From loathing Sirius (for an at that time understandable reason), he goes right to loving him as his family. Without asking any questions.

- After being tormented for 6 years and seeing the continuous torment of his friends - mainly Hermione and Neville

- through Snape, he goes to naming his child after him.

- The defense of Quirrel is another but much weaker example.

The good counter-examples seem to be Hermione in first and Cedric in forth book. There he has good reasons for his opinions (negative and positive) and finds the - most likely right - valuation of them as friends after some time.
