I just want to talk about the "Do you believe Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore about the return of You-Know-Who?" question, which was probably meant to be satirical in nature, but to which I answered "no" seriously:

From the perspective of most people, Dumbledore and Harry are asking the entire wizarding world to prepare for war on the word of one 14 year old boy and an old wizard who believes him. Dumbledore sounds senile and like he shouldn't be in positions of authority. Harry is claiming that someone who has been dead (and official word has always been dead, not gone) for 13 years is back alive; he sounds like an attention seeker, and not even a good one at that. His encounters with Voldemort his first two years were always very hush, hush, which doesn't help his case in the slightest, and as far as Fudge is concerned, he has a history of claiming dead men are coming back to life because he did the same thing with Wormtail the year before.

Fudge has a little bit more evidence (Snape's dark mark, Barty Crouch Jr) than the general population, but even still that's maybe enough to launch a quiet investigation, not proclaim war. Fudge is an IDIOT for not looking into it further, a little bit of research on Harry's resurrection story might turn up a real, powerful dark ritual that Harry had no way of knowing well enough to recount. But maybe he did launch an investigation, and couldn't find any evidence of that ritual (not out of the question). He's Kiss happy (again with the being an idiot, but not out of maliciousness) so Barty Crouch isn't available to question, nor would Sirius be able to submit to veritaserum to explain about Wormtail. Edit: And the thought that Crouch just went mad being under the imperius curse for over 10 years has merit.

I have no defense for Umbridge. Odious, sadistic, bigoted woman.

Harry spends most of book 5 complaining that only half the school believes him. His story is so fantastically unlikely I'm surprised there were that many. And this is why the fifth book is my absolute all time least favourite of the series, because Harry is so wrapped up in himself that he can't see that the rest of the world has a very very legitimate point of view. He spends the entire book complaining about people who are behaving quite rationally (apart from Umbridge). But he's so consumed with his own righteousness that he can't even look to see if there might be a real reason.

Harry's inability to see anything from anyone else's perspective is actually what I'd consider his most annoying character flaw the entire series. He gets a first impression of someone, and unless something truly monumental happens, that first impression is the way he sees them for the rest of the series. Snape and Sirius are the biggest offenders here. Edit2: This is actually Gryffindors' biggest character flaw in general

I really really want to read a fanfiction where everything that everyone else does is exactly the same, but Harry has the ability (or does not have the character flaw of not having the ability) to look at things from someone else's perspective. What would change if Harry went to Snape at the end of first year and said "thanks for saving my life during my first Quidditch match and refereeing the second one". What if he talked to Sirius at some point during the fifth and helped him find an outlet for his stir-crazy that didn't endanger himself and the entire Order. What if he looked at the half of the school that didn't believe him during the fifth book and could say "look, I can see where you're coming from, this story sounds absolutely insane, but if you think I'm lying and you're willing to accept this defense curriculum it's only going to hurt you, whether Voldemort's actually back or not". It probably wouldn't change much, but my goodness, Harry would be much less annoying.

Sorry for the wall of text/rant. Anyone got a fic like that?
