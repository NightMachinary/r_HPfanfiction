For the favourite non-Harry pairing question, I've got the data and am doing stuff with it now.

First of all, I broke the data down by whether an intelligible preference was entered, or no preference was specified: [[http://i.imgur.com/sREeyrP.png]]

For eveyone who entered a pairing preference, the frequencies are here: [[http://pastebin.com/52MwGrBN]]

Now I need to find a chart program that supports that many segments without doing this: [[http://i.imgur.com/LhjivYd.png]]

I'm also going to look at doing some correlations between fields, any ideas would be appreciated!
