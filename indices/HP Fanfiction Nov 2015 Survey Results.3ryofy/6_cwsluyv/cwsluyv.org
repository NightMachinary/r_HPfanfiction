Any way you could share some of the "other" responses? I'd be interested to read the responses for the favorite character/pairing questions, especially because one of the questions is pointless without it (favorite non-Harry pairing's options are "I only read Harry" and "other", so if you can't see the other you don't get an answer to the question really.)
