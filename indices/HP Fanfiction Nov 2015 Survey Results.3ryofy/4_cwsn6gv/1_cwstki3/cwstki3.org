The ICW is useless, it's basically the League of Nations. Name one thing that sham of a governing body has done for Britain.

That time they sent troops to help hunt down a terrorist group after the former head of the ICW was assassinated.... oh wait.

That time the government began rounding up muggleborns and sending them to concentration camps? I'm sure they sent a harshly worded letter.

England doesn't need them, England stands alone and proud!
