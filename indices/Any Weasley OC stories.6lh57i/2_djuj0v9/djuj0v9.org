Well, the [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][Weasley Girl series]] has Fem!Ron, who's KIND of like an OC in that she's both like and unlike Ron, but she probably doesn't count?

There are a couple of fics that give Ron a twin sister, but none of them seem to be much good... the best of the bunch is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9774250/1/What-if-There-Was-Another-Weasley][What If There Was Another Weasley?]], but even that isn't what I'd call a classic.

No stories with extra Weasley brothers that I can see, probably because there are already so many of them.

It's surprising that we don't see more Weasley cousins around in fanfics, though. Canon hints that there are a lot of them around, so you'd think that the Weasleys would be the perfect family to insert OC relatives for.

There should be an entire genre called "YAWC" (Yet Another Weasley Cousin). But, no. I suppose the Weasleys aren't "cool" enough for the fanfic writers.
