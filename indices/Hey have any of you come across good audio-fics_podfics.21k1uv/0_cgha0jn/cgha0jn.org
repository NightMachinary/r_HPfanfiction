If you just want to be able to listen to your fics while commuting and generealy prefer to read I might suggest using an ebook-reader app for your smartphone that comes with text-to-speech support (for example Moon+ reader).\\
In conjuntion with a good TTS-engine (I like the IVONA range of voices) I find this to be a good compromise for on-the-go listening over short periods of time like on the bus or while mowing the lawn ;)

You can get the necessary ebook files for your fics by using a fanfiction downloader (for example the ffdl-plugin for calibre or one of the many online alternatives) or the ebook-download option of AOÂ³.

That way you can enjoy /any/ fic while you commute with the tradeoff of a slightly robotic voice.
