Hi, I'm staff at DLP. Recently there has been somebody plagiarizing member's stories from our "Work by Author" section where authors post rough copies of their stories in order to gain feedback. We're pretty sure someone made a bot to do it.

This is probably the same person who forced us to make new members post in a hidden forum in order to be authorized to post elsewhere on the forum by throwing thousands of bots at us who then posted thousands of threads a year or so back.

In order to protect our author's content, we've had to make it so that the only people who can view the stories in Work by Author are those who have actually posted a few times. Work by Author is not meant as a replacement for ffnet, but many people still treat it as so. It's meant as a place for authors to get feedback, which is why we only allowed registered members to view it - as only registered members can actually post constructive criticism. Now we made it so that only members with a few posts to their name can see posts in it.

We didn't do this in order to inconvenience anyone, we did this so that a plagiarist can't get to the stories. Authors are the foundation of any fandom, and we don't want their creativity to be sullied or stalled because of someone taking their work as their own. I'm sorry if you think this is an asshole thing to do, but the post limit isn't that high (less than 10) so it shouldn't be an issue to just contribute something to prove to use you aren't a bot designed to steal stories and post them to ffnet.

It really isn't that hard to find somewhere to post on DLP, we have a broad range of ongoing discussions from politics, to anime, to gaming, to other fandom's fanfiction (Naruto, Star Wars, Dresden Files, etc) that you can engage in.

Honestly, we're not as bad as people make us out to be. There's a reason we're still an active community nearly a decade after Harry Potter has been done and all the other sites have died out. Come try and post something, I can assure you that as long as you are genuine, you'll fit right in. :)
