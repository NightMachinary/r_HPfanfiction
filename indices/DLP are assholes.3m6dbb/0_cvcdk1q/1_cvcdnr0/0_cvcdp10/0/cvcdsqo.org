To be perfectly honest, we wouldn't want to randomly bolster our community through an effort like this. It's counter productive to the culture of DLP.

Unfortunately for the random people who have decided that WbA is for their reading pleasure, and that the fact that it's meant to provide feedback means nothing to them, we've had to implement a barrier to make it more difficult for someone to simply register an account and use an automated program to trawl the subforum.

It kinda boggles my mind that people feel that they're entitled to viewing something that requires you to be a member of the forum, without attempting to be one. If DLP is such anathema to you, why even bother to go there just wait for the authors to post on ff.net.
