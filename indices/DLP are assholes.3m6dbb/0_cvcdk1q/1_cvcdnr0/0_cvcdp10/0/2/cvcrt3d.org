I only use DLP when it's a DLP-only story, or the story has more chapters on DLP. I read the 7th horcrux there, and a few other stories, but the boards are green and very obviously Not Work Related =D I guess I need to post a few more times to be able to read those types of stories again...so really, you ARE bolstering your community in doing this. Ah, I see you have a gaming section...here I come!
