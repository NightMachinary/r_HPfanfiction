This is a fair point and I concede it. However its futile, as I can easily make the required posts to gain access again, in which point I will go back to my undeserving reading. The bigger point here is that someone stealing content, not just reading it, can do so just as easily. So in the end this does nothing except force more posts, which is why I alluded that this was a movement for a increase in community activity instead of an attempt to thwart plagiarism.
