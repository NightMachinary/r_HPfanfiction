You're absolutely right. The only options we have right now are to either a) do nothing, or b) close access to the forum permanently, since taking any other steps in the long run is futile.

You aren't entitled to the content on WbA since you don't consider yourself a member. If you were an actual member this wouldn't inconvenience you at all. You, and those who, like you, choose to simply use the WbA as your own personal library do not factor into the decision.

WbA exists to help authors refine their stories, not to pander to readers. That you feel that you deserve the access, when you don't provide any contribution to said authors is mind blowing.
