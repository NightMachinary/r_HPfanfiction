Narfsree is the good cop, I'm the bad cop. Consider yourself lucky my attempt at creating a 'punch people through the monitor' device was an abject failure.

I agree my tone is aggressive, and I suppose that's because I'm having to deal with people who feel that they're entitled to access a betaing forum with the express intention of not providing any form of feedback to the authors who post there.

If they were providing feedback, then this would be a moot point since they would have already reached the post count in question.

If someone wants to talk to me rationally about this issue without their argument boiling down to 'it makes things harder for me, so stop it' then I'll gladly talk to them without any overtones of aggression.
