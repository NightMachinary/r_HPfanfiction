It was a manual action by Raven. There's a thread currently on the board called 'Muggle Status', we aren't callous assholes (most of the time). Post in the thread asking for it and you may find your wish granted. That said, it really isn't hard to meet the quota, but we aren't punishing people for not posting (despite what some people seem to think.)
