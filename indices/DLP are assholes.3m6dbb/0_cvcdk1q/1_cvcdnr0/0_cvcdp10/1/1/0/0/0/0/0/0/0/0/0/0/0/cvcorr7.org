I can't imagine any sane person would think this.

HP fanfic is a pretty close-knit community these days. Let's say Taure put up a few more chapters of his very popular LotR/HP crossover up in WbA, and then someone ripped it off and posted it on FFN.

You /really/ think the person who ripped it off would be well regarded in the community?

Personally, I would think that person was a massive tool, a thief, and worthy of nothing but scorn.
