Like I said, Work by Author is not a replacement for a fanfic website like ffnet. It's a place for authors to polish their stories in order to publish it to ffnet. We don't mind people reading the stories as casual readers, but they aren't the people the authors are targeting when they post in WbA. Again, I'm sorry for this inconvenience, but it's just an inconvenience, when on the other hand, we have author's work being stolen which is much more serious.

Also, this has only been applied to members who joined on and after January 1, 2015. Members who joined before are exempt.

We don't know if it will help, but we know it won't hurt. It's one step we're taking to address the problem as it unfolds.
