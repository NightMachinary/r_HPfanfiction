Good on DLP for doing this. Though I wasn't caught up in the latest wave, I've had stories copied out of WBA several times in the past and it's an annoyance.

Will it stop the copying? Probably not. Will it recover time for authors, site members, and admins that could be spent more productively (like writing or shaving one's testicles)? Probably.
