I'm not a member of DLP, but did some looking around out of curiosity.

It's a fanfiction community with some extremely talented authors and a 'we don't suffer idiots gladly' philosophy. I see no problems with that.

The issue seems to be that they've had some serious plagarism issues recently, and took steps to require people to actually participate in the community to access things the community creates.

This... seems perfectly reasonable, and the only way I can see anyone disagreeing is if they want to mooch off of the content without actually providing any feedback. As the content in question appears to be a tool for authors to get editing feedback, rather than a hosting replacement.
