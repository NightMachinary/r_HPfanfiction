There's a little button under posts labelled "save" that I've found really useful for this sort of thing. It adds the post to a giant list of everything you've clicked "save" on.

You can access the list by going to your user overview and clicking the "saved" option in the list of tabs where you click "submissions," "comments" and "gilded."
