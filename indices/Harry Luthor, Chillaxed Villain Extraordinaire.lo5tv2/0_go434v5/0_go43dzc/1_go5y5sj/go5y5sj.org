Klarion is the weird allegedly-uncle-that-has-a-human growth hormone-issue that just shows up and gives Harry gifts and advice on how to get the girls, except Harry has a weird feeling about his advice so he doesn't follow it too much. The gifts are generally just little knickknacks that are enchanted to fuck with people.
