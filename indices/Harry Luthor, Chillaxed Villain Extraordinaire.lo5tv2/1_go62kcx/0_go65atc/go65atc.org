  Now the question is does he treat Superboy like a beloved brother or are they like weirdly jealous and competitive over stupid shit.

Harry questioning Lex about his weird obsession with Superman is something I didn't know I wanted. It's even funnier when you know an very early incarnation of the character started out as Superman's fan!
