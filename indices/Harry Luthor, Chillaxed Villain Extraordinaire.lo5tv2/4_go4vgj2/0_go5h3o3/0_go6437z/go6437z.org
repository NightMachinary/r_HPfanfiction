Because the story as described is 100% about the DC universe. Where's Hogwarts? Where is Voldemort? Where are the Horcruxes? Where are Ron and Hermione?

Even the backstory of this "Harry" is so radically different (Lex Luthor's son??) that you can't even say the character is the same.

How is this supposed to be about Harry Potter? Like how?
