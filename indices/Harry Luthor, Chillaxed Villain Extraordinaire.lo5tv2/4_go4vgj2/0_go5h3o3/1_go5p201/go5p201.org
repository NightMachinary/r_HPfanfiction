As described, the fact that the main character is Harry Potter had nothing to do with the story. You could replace Harry with literally anyone else, and nothing would be changed (and let's be honest, this Harry would almost certainly really be an OC with some superficial similarities to Harry Potter).

Now I would still love to read a story based on this premise, but that's because I enjoy reading DC stories.
