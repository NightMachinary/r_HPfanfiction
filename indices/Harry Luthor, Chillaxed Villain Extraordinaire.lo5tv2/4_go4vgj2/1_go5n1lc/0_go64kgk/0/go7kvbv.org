My point was they could be the same universe, and both be cannon, and we'd never know due to the timeline. Harry is old news by the start of Smallville so he doesn't affect them, and he is 30 something when people start finding out about heroes so it can only affect the epilogue. Niether would effect the other in ANY way, even if they were the same universe. Unless the Dursleys take Harry on a vacation to Kansas for a meeting with Lionel Luthor.
