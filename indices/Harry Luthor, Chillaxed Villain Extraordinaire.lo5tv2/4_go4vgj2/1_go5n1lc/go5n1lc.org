At what point does it say Harry has moved universe? Wizards live among us in secret. The books could be set in the DC universe without us knowing.

Technically Smallville and Harry Potter could be the same universe without ever interacting or affecting each other in any way, and remaining completely cannon.

Based on the cannons, Clark Kent was guessed to be around 2 and a half when he was found by the Kents, shortly after Harry Potter's 9th birthday. With a 7 year age gap, Harry would finish hogwarts before Clark started high school/start of smallville show.

Why would wizards talk about a meteor shower in America that happened when Harry was 9? Why would Smallville residents discuss some deaths in the UK from a couple of years ago? Why would Parents be discussing American Superheroes when dropping their kids off for the Express? No reason to talk about it so it isn't mentioned in either.

Both happen in the same universe, still cannon. Boom, mike drop.
