"Thank you Wormtail, for informing me of the location of the Potter hideout," said Voldemort, who looked very pleased. "And not to mention that you have acquired the locations of the Order safehouses..."

Peter Pettigrew merely averted his gaze and began deflecting Voldemort's offers of rewards, claiming that his only desire was to serve the Dark Lord. There was once when he feared Voldemort and what he meant for the wizarding world. After confessing how he felt and learning of Voldemort's origins by Dumbledore, he saw a man desperate to obtain power at all costs. Magically powerful, but ultimately a weak willed man obsessed with delaying the inevitable. Death was not an enemy that can be conquered, even with magic. In addition, Peter realized Voldemort only believed whatever he wanted to believe. A useful trait for manipulating him, given his obsession with the prophecy.

"Voldemort's arrogance would soon prove to be his downfall," mused Peter as he thought back to the plan the Marauders drew up.

Lord Voldemort strode purposefully towards the cottage located near the coast. After Pettigrew's defection, he now had access to the Potter home, and would soon prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled. He reasoned that James Potter would put up the most fight, given that he managed to evade him on three separate occasions, defying the Lestranges twice, his most skilled Death Eaters. A twisted smile emerged on his face as he saw James Potter's eyes widen as he approached the cottage, wand ready for a duel. James pulled out his wand and faced off against Voldemort, much to his amusement.

"Come now Potter," said Voldemort. "We both know that this can only end with you dead."

"Well then, my Lord, what are you waiting for," taunted James as he stepped out towards the coast.

Voldemort snarled and sent out a Fiendfyre serpent, hissing as it hurtled towards James. With an upward flick of his wand, James sent the Fiendfyre creature tumbling into the air with a powerful updraft. A chain shot out of James' wand, wrapping it around the serpent before he brought it downwards, sending it hurtling towards Voldemort who was forced to Disapparate to avoid being crushed.

Voldemort reappeared near the shoreline and was forced to shield as spells rained down on his position. Sensing a lull in James' onslaught, he fired the Killing Curse which was intercepted by a rock, shattering it. The debris transformed into daggers which rocketed towards Voldemort, who managed to vanish it just before they impaled him.

/Protego Diabolica/ incanted Voldemort. A ring of black flames encircled the duellists, and on his command, tendrils of flame shot out towards towards James from all directions. The black flames were parried by James' shield charm, sending them upwards as they gathered above his head, forming omimous clouds. Voldemort was forced to Disapparate once again as a bolt of lightning was sent in his direction.

"Come on now Voldemort, not very sporting of you to run now," said James, continuing to taunt his opponent. He raised his wand and cast an Anti-Apparition and Anti-Portkey Jinx. "Lets even the odds, shall we."

A conjured spear was sent towards Voldemort who easily deflected it, the silver spear landing twenty feet behind him in the sand. Voldemort flew into the air, summoning a Fiendfyre serpent, dragon and chimera, the cursed fire animations lunging towards James.

With a flick of his wand, the sand beneath him began to form into the shape of Death, standing tall in front of James. On his command, Death began to engage the Fiendfyre, his sycthe cleaving the serpent in half as James duplicated the sandy behemoth to block the Killing Curses sent in his direction. The Fiendyre dragon struck the sand figure, blasting it apart before the sand reformed into a troll with a club above the dragon, smashing its head open and sending it careening towards the shoreline.

Voldemort gritted his teeth as he directed the chimera towards the sand troll. James matched him spell for spell, Transfiguration against Fiendfyre. /Time to end this/ thought James as the sand constructs began to gain the upper hand. The figure of Death emerged once as the troll threw its club at Voldemort. Voldemort was now forced to defend as James' figure of Death, the troll and spells rained down towards him.

/Expelliarmus, Petrificous Totalus, Stupefy, Reducto, Confringo/, James' spells increased in force as Voldemort was now purely focused on defending himself to prevent the onslaught from overwhelming him. Death was blasted apart before reforming into a hippo, charging at him as Voldemort was forced to duck to avoid being decapitated by the troll now wielding a sledgehammer. Sensing that Voldemort was on the verge of being overpowered, James seized his opportunity.

The silver spear which landed behind Voldemort began to rise in response to James' Summoning Charm. Voldemort roared in pain as the spear struck him from behind, dropping his wand as he fell.

/At least I have taken measures to ensure my eventual rebirth/, thought Voldemort. /The child of the prophecy will need to be dealt with as soon as possible. I have underestimated Potter once, I cannot afford to make the same mistake twice/

Despite the pain, Voldemort smiled as James walked towards him.

"This isn't over Potter."

His smile faltered as the features of James Potter began to change. Voldemort recoiled as Albus Dumbledore stood in front of him, his eyes boring into him.

"Ironic isn't it," said Dumbledore. "How you meet your destiny on your way to avoid it."
