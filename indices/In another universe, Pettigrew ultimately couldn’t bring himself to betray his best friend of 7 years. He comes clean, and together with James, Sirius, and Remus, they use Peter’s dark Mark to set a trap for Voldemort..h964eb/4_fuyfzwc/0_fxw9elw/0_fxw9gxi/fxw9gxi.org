  Godric's Hollow, October 31, 1981. The fated night for the Potters.Peter thought he'd make a short trip to James' and Lily's. After all, he was the only person who knew where they were hiding (as far as they knew). They'd be alone. No Sirius to come muck everything up. Not even Remus could drop in for a visit. They'd be ever so happy to see little old Peter. Lily would probably make him tea and cakes, and then he'd be on his way with neither of them the wiser.Oh, he'd finally have gotten his laugh. After all those years.A prologue to the Everyone Lives series.
