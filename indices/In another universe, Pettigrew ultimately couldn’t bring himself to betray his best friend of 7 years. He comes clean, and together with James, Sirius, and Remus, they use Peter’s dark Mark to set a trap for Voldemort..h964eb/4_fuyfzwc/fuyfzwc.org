I read something many years ago along these lines. Peter got cold feet at the last minute and made excuses to be at Godrics Hollow on that night and they were all in the kitchen. When Voldie arrived, he jumped in front of the killing curse and sacrificed himself, the next curse sent at the Potters rebounded much as in canon, but they all survive. The "protection" was carried by James as it was tied to his friendship and brotherhood with Peter.

All in all it wasn't bad, and I liked how the question of the "vanquishing of the dark lord" was handled in absolutely the same way as canon (sacrifice for those you love) but also managed to be completely different.
