Peter sat there listening to james talk about how he would become the secret keeper, sirius would be the decoy to the world while peter would be the true one he felt sick, he knew as soon as he they had finished the transfer he would sell them out he had too voldemort promised he would spare remus and sirius if he did so. they would hate him but they would be alive. Peter felt a tug at his leg and looked down to see James and lilly's son looking up at him with such Joy. "what are you doing out of bed young man'' Lilly said noticing harry tugging at Peters leg. "he keeps floating out of his crib' lilly continued with a smile 'too much of his father in him he can not wait to cause trouble. "you have told me about your accidental magic, so do not blame our son's accidental all on me'' James said with a smile. ''I can not wait till he is a bit older'' Sirius said ''I can not wait to see what trouble he gets into at hogwarts'' ''my son will not be caught getting into trouble at hogwarts'' lilly replied with a snap. "caught ?'' peter said 'you said he would not caught getting into trouble'' Lilly smiled '' it would not be hogwarts without a potter causing trouble, though I imagine since harry shares some of my blood he will get away with his schemes more'' " We Just need to get our young harry some daring companions'' Lilly continued.

Lilly continued " so its settled when this all blows over we will set them all up on a playdate''. James then smiled grimly 'So petey, you ready to become the secret keeper ?'' Peter then felt helpless and very ashamed "No, There is something I have to tell you guys'' Peter Paused and then draw on the last of his resolve 'you know how there is talk of a spy in the order, its me, I am the spy.'' "Pete thats a poor joke'' sirius called out ''I understand you might be afraid, I am terrifed too but I belive you will be a good secret keeper'' "ITS NOT A JOKE'' peter called out angrily standing up pulling his sleeve up " I HAVE THE MARK'' he shouted
