I like this idea, but I don't think a stinging hex can possibly be comparable to a punch.

A real punch doesn't just hurt. People that get punched hard are not going to be standing up. Punches don't just sting, a hard blow injures the whole body.

Boxers and competitive martial artists resist punches by their movement and they constrain each other by that they could attack and what we see in their bouts is not comparable to the damage that an unresisted punch inflicts.

So punches, in a way, are a whole lot of violence.
