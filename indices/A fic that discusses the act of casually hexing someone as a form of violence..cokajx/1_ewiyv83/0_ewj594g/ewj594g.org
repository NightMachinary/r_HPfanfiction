That's true. It's easy to be a bit callous about people you'll never meet in real life even if you don't think of it as being insensitive or mean. I'll also say that in the fic I'm currently reading (Harry Potter and the Marauders of the Mind) Draco is constantly being silenced because he's annoying. Every time it happens I have to stop myself from thinking of it as this metaphor for real world displatforming of political figures. I have to remind myself that "not /Everyone is Jesus in Purgatory/".
