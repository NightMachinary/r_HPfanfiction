Am I the only one that thinks that a little cut throat ruthlessness and willingness to break the rules is an admirable trait? In some situations, being good and flowery isn't the best thing to do. At least in my mind.

If I was in Hermione's position, I'd have done the same thing in many of those cases if I was clever enough to think about them. Especially with Skeeter.

Doing what you have to do to protect your friends is a good thing.
