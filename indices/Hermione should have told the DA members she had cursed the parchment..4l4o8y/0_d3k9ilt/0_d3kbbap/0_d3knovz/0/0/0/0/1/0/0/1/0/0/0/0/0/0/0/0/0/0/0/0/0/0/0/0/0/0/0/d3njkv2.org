And, as far as I see it, you are missing the point. Most actions of Hermione's from that list are things that can be excused, or justified even, given the circumstances. They are still questionable actions because we are given Hermione just doing them and have to excuse or justify those things on our own and we know that Hermione is fairly haughty and has a tendency to make decisions for others.

That was the whole point regardless of the case. Changing it into being about Skeeter is, in this case, missing the point and missing it badly. We /do/ know that this is one of those “bad or worse choice” situations and that she chose as best as she could. We aren't even taking issue with that. But you were acting as if that was the crux of the whole issues.

It's not about the ministry being incompetent and worth close to nil. It's not about Skeeter and how bad a person she is. It's not about Cormac deserving anything she could have used on him. It's about the fact that she thinks she has the right to decide for those around her. Ultimately, in the end, it all went well and we know that most of the stuff she did could be excused or justified. But that is her character flaw, and as in many of those cases we were not given any reason to think that there was a reason for her making those decisions other than her simply being that pushy and/or haughty, it remains about that. /This/ is what the whole thing has been about from the very beginning, that Hermione is a flawed character. But so is everyone, so it doesn't mean that she is automatically evil nor are we saying that.

Talking about this specific case for real would have been actually debating why you think that we've been shown what had caused her to feel forced into deciding in the first place, not changing it into a thing about Skeeter and why this decision is best. Doing that in this case accomplishes nothing as we already know that Skeeter deserves it and much more and it really wasn't even about Skeeter in the first place, it just was about Hermione's act of making a decision when the situation behind it somehow involved Skeeter. Not about the choice she made, we already know why she made this particular choice, it was about why she thought she has to make a choice in the first place and the fact that the only answer we are seeing is “because she thinks she can make choices for everyone”.

So if that is how you approached the whole thing, then you've been shooting at a different training range from others to begin with, so of course everyone missed the other side's points.
