What could you achieve anyway? Make me think that stopping Rita was not worth it? I made my opinion of her clear. She was doing so much harm to innocents, she got off lightly. So, I don't really see Hermione's actions as hat questionable in the first place - she stopped a cruel, evil scumbag from hurting people. No one else had managed that during the entire year. I consider her actions as a clear-cut case of self.defense. After a year of the authorities not doing anything to help her, she was utterly justified to do this, and she showed quite the restraint as well.
