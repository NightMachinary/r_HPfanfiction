And by that time she still did not consider Dumbledore impotent politically. Two months later, sure, but by then there's no reason for her not to try him other than her deciding on her own.

And that's the entirety of my point from the very beginning, really: her deciding on her own. That Skeeter did deserve what she got, sure, and that there might not have been a better solution, sure, but we don't even see Hermione consider any other solution and instead (as far as we see it) decide on her own that “oh, this is what she is going to do with Skeeter”, which makes her decision questionable. It doesn't mean she is evil or anything, nor does it mean that the ministry was reliable or anything, but in the previous book (the third one, to be precise) she knew that she has Dumbledore on their side and in this book Dumbledore proved that he can't go against the tournament but was still somewhat reliable and yet she made the decision she made on her own and we never saw her actually consider alternatives or go “well, I guess I have no other choice, nobody will do anything anyway”. It's one of those situations where the character might very well have had a reason to do what she did, but because we don't see that reason as there's nothing given to us to even think that she has it and because of the character's behaviour throughout the story, the action and the choice of taking that action are questionable.

/That's/ what I am on about. The whole timeline thing and fighting about whether or not authority figures were reliable or not at this point is pretty much making fire by now, as the whole point is the ambiguity and thus questionability of Hermione's motives which is her recurrent flaw in the story, not whether or not her decision is excusable because of the ministry's incompetence or Skeeter's wretchedness (it is and I won't say otherwise, but it irks me that some people seem to think it makes her not flawed).
