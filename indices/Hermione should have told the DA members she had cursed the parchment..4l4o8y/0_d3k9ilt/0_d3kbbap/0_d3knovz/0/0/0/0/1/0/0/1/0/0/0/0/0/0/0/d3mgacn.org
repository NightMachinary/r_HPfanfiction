It wouldn't have been her decision what happens to her, then, though. I do understand what you are saying and where you are coming from, because Rita is a despicable person and she did deserve every single thing she got and even more. It's just that we aren't discussing whether or not she deserved punishment but rather whether or not what Hermione did was messes up or not, and as all we got is Hermione going off on her own and kidnapping and then threatening someone without even looking at alternative options, I can't agree that what she did was “good”. It might very well have been the best option she had, but even if that happened to be true it still wasn't a “good” option. Because as it is shown to us it doesn't look like something that had to be done or was done to protect anyone, just something that Hermione decided to do and that's it.

I think it's one of those things where Madame Rowling tried to do something with the character and went a bit too far, just like with Ron's “betrayals” across the books.
