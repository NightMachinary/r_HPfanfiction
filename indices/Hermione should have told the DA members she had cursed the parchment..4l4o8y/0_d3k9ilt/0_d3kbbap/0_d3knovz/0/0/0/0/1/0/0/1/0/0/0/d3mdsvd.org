You seem to be looking at it in a rather “white versus black” way, with Skeeter being black and therefore Hermione automatically being white, whereas in reality both of them were grey and the issue others are talking about isn't that Hermione did /something/ but rather that she chose this specific action without there even being anything to show that she considered other possibilities.
