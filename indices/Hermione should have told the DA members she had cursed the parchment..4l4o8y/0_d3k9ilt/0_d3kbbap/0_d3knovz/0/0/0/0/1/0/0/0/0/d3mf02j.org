I will admit that those things can /potentially/ be admirable traits. That said, whether or not they are depends on the reasons behind what is happening. In Hermione's case, we can't be sure if she did those things to protect her friends or if she did it just because she decided to do it and that's it, and as quite a few decisions she makes are made for the latter reason I still see it as a problem regardless of whether or not it's seen as admirable.

If she really wanted to protect her friends in this case, she might very well have simply taken Skeeter to the DMLE and that would have been the end of it, and if not that there were always Dumbledore and McGonagall. But she didn't, which is a flag that might very well be red.
