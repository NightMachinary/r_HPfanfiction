What about the fact that nothing was done to stop Rita before that? She could publish her lies and slander and hatemongering unhindered. We also saw how corrupt and ineffective the Ministry was in book 3 and 4. And we saw Harry being forced to take part in a tournament, and no one bothering to ensure that everyone knew he didn't want to.

What more do you need to be shown to see that the system wasn't working?
