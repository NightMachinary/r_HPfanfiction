Ok, first of all, you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny --- and he had a nasty temper anyway, nobody would have wanted someone like that on the team.

The accusation about Malfoy's goons is just ridiculous --- if anything, the experience did them some good and taught them that not anything that looks like food should be instantly shoved into their mouths.

The reporter was writing all those nasty articles about Harry and Hagrid while having the support of the entire Ministry, and there was no other way to stop her from doing that. Killing her might have worked, but can you really say that it would be better than just temporary incarceration and some blackmail?

Same with Umbridge --- she deserved what she got even if just for her blood quill torture trap.

The situation back then was such that all of these things just /had/ to happen. And it's partially because of all these unsavoury choices that Harry grew to ruminate over lately that today we have this better society to live in. So the next time you decide to spend your vacation in one of those nationalised former Malfoy-resorts or get to live with a pretty pureblood girl for a while thanks to the Ministry Lottery, be sure to think over the things you so wantonly share as a public opinion!
