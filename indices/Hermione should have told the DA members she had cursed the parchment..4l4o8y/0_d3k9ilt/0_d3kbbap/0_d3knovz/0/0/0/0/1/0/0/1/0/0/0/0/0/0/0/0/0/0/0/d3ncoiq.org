I don't “need” to be shown that. I am simply saying that Hermione's actions there were questionable because we were not shown that she's actually tried or even just considered other options and then rejected them for whatever reason. I am not saying that she is some kind of ultimate evil or the vilest scoundrel of all time, all I am saying is that her actions were questionable, and all that because we weren't shown the “why” of her actions and she has a history of acting as if she knew better than anyone in the books so without knowing her reasons or her train of thoughts there doesn't seem to be any reason for her to do it that way other than her just deciding to do it and that's it. It doesn't mean it's the worst decision ever or whatever, it just means it's questionable because we don't know why she did it and her motives for doing stuff like that tend to be kind of selfish.

So I'll return the jab: how hard is it to see that this is what I mean?
