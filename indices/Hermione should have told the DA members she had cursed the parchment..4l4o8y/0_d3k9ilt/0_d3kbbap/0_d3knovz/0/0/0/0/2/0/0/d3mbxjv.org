Hmm ... well, yes, but that's one side of the problem, and the other side is that Hermione clearly has a problem keeping to rules and stuff. Of the things she did, for many she had a reason, yes, but ultimately she did them because she could and because she wanted to and because she decided that she knows well enough to decide for everyone and do what she plans to just because it's her who plans to do it.

I mean, had the situation been different and the person slighted or hurt happened to be someone else and that person did the same thing she chose to do, I'm fairly certain she would have started about how bad the thing they did is, because she doesn't see it. And yet, when something happens to her she behaves as if everyone else could automatically see that she has a reason and agree with it just because it's her.

I think this is the same reason she didn't tell anyone about the fact that the parchment was cursed: she thought to curse it, so “clearly everyone could see that it was cursed because she could see it”.
