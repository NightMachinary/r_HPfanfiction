And as I keep pointing out: She had all the reasons to make this decision, seeing as no one else did or could help her.

In canon, adults are generally useless so the kids can be the heroes. A consequence of that is that the kids often do know best. And Hermione usually knows best among the kids. Unless the plot needs her to screw up.

Also, most of what she does has obvious reasons. No need to spell those out even more. And when it doesn't have obvious reasons, it's usually "for the plot".
