Hmm ... that's a good question. Seriously though, we know she could have taken her to Dumbledore, even if just to give him means of preventing her from getting into the castle, because he wasn't the kind of person who'd ruin her the way DMLE would have if they found out. We know that by this time she did not have problems with authority that would prevent her from doing it because of what happened with Harry's hand in the next book (what with her dragging him to McGonagall). Heck, if it truly was about stopping Skeeter's lies for moral reasons, then I'm sure that taking her to the DMLE was the thing to do, so whatever caused Hermione to keep her in a jar I doubt it had to do with that.

I think the core of the issue in this case is that we don't know why she didn't do that or anything else but instead decided to keep Skeeter in a jar and then release her under forced cooperation---which from Skeeter's perspective pretty much was being abducted and then threatened with ruination---so we can only guess and in the end what she chose remains morally questionable. Skeeter is presented as a really bad person so it's easy to see her as quite evil (well, she is a pest, that much I will admit), but we don't see Hermione trying to fight that evil and being forced to resort to using the jar and threats for a lack of a better option as the circumstances or other people close option after option, and instead what we see is ... well, what is in the books. And because in the books Hermione has a history of acting “because she knows better”, it makes it hard to automatically assume that her intentions for this specific course of action were good rather than it simply happening because she had the possibility and decided to do it.
