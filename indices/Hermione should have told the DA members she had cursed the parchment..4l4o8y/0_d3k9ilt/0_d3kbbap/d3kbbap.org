Agree with this and what Starfox said. No point knowing who done it if you're already in the shit when you find out. Not one of Hermione's best moves.

Although I think some people might not have signed if they knew, once it's signed you would know that the people in the know are definitely trustworthy, or at least not going to squeal if they eventually leave.
