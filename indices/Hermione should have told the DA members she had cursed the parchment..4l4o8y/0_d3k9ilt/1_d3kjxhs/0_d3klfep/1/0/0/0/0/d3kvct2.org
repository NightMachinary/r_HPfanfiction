  No. its is stated that McGonagall or Dumbledore would put a stop to it if Harry said something. not if it was found out.

Huh? Not sure what are you trying to imply here. That even if McGonagall and Dumbledore found out they wouldn't have done anything unless Harry directly complained about it?

  Even she knew she couldnt stop anything Umbridge did.

True. I should clarify that Ron and Hermione /thought/ that McGonagall or Dumbledore would have put a stop to it if they knew about the blood quill. I don't think it would have done Harry (or anyone) any good.

In any case, the trio thought that McGonagall and Dumbledore didn't know, implying that Umbridge's "torture" wasn't common knowledge.
