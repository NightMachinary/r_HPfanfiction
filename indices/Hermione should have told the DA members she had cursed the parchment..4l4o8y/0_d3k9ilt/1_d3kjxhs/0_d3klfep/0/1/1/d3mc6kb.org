Not really. We know she was pressured by her mother who in turn was pressured by Umbridge with threats of losing her job. That put her in the position of being the one who would have been blamed had her mother really lost her job, and not only would that have been true because she did know about DA, but she also never really wanted to be a part of it and attended only for Cho.

People expect loyalty from her and see her as some kind of big traitor who was loyal and then stopped being when in reality she'd never been loyal and had only been pulled into it and expected to keep quiet because Cho didn't think it through. All in all, the blame for her betrayal is more on Cho's side than on hers; the blame for telling, yes, that's Marietta's, but the blame for betrayal not really.
