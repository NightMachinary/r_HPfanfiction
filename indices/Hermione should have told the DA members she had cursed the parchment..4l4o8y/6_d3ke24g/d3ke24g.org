I agree but I'm willing to forgive her this lapse in judgement. Hermione doesn't know how to break rules, it just doesn't come naturally to her. She can lie to help her friends, as we see with the troll incident but I would like to believe if she ever actually found herself pranking someone she would go completely overboard and maim them for life. It's just not a skill she has a natural aptitude for.

So enter Umbridge, an authority figure that is abusing her authority and is free of any checks and balances AND is messing with Hermione's OWL year. Imagine the talk Ron and Hermione had about starting the DA, how excited they both would be, all the plans and notes Hermione would be making, because it's Hermione and she likes to be prepared.

They finally convince Harry to meet with the people they've spent months trying to commit to coming, they've had a tough time of it looking at some of the people that made it into the final meeting.

Then the meeting doesn't really go too well. Harry is aggressive and defensive and isn't interested in using his mystique to draw people in.

Days and nights of hard work are all about to fall apart but some how they manage to get people to agree not only to come but to put their name to paper.

I can imagine Hermione being unable to bear the idea that her brilliant idea to curse the contract could ruin everything at the eleventh hour, so she didn't tell anyone. It's not exactly a lie right... it's an omission.

And she couldn't very well use a different piece of paper because it's such a good idea. No one will ever know right?
