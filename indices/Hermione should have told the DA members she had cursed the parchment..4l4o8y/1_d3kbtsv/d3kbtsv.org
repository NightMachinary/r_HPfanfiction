I agree that she should have made it known, but not for your reasons. They were forming a group meant to act as a defense against Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the future war and it absolutely had to be kept a secret from the evil toad bitch that liked to torture kids. When you enter into that voluntarily, you're accepting some risks. So, I don't think it was unethical, and I wouldn't particularly care even if I did.

However, it was also stupid not to share the information after the contract was signed. The curse does nothing to prevent betrayal if no one knows about it, it's just a vindictive punishment.
