To play devil's advocate (because I do kind of agree with OP), Hermione is a clever witch but she's not exactly powerful or knowledgeable enough to make an unbreakable magical contract. It's entirely possible she considered that if a traitor knew about the jinx, they would find a way to get themselves out of it before snitching.

As for it being useless for preventing being snitched on unless everyone knew about it, she probably didn't consider that they wouldn't actually see the snitch until after they'd been busted. Therefore giving them ample warning to scatter, create alibis, etc.
