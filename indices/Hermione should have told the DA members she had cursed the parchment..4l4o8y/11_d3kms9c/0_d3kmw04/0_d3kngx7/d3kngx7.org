I don't think we ever were told. Just that it made Eloise's breakout look mild in comparison. So I would suspect it's some form of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hive-conjuring_spell][hive conjuring spell]] or possibly a mild form of the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Transmogrifian_Torture][transmogrification spell]] combined with a bit of the Unbreakable Vow and then whatever spell it was that the Diary Riddle used to spell his name or possibly a Spattergott causing spell...

And I'm not sure that that's true about the permanent scars only coming from dark magic. (Dragon pox leaves scarring, and the brains in the MoM left scars are two that come to mind). And I'm not entirely sure that the blood quill was truly "dark magic".
