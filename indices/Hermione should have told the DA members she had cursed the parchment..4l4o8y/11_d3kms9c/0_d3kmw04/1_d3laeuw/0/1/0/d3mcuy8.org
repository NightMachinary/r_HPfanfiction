It's still something she might not have had had she actually known about the curse. Oh, sure, it's easy to say that she snitched on them because she wasn't loyal enough and thus she deserves it, but people forget that she never really wanted to be in DA and got pulled in because Cho was forceful so she had no reason to actually be loyal, and had they been told that the parchment is bespelled she might have backed out at the first meeting and then let go after being obliviated, or alternatively had they learned about it afterwards it would have been a counter-point to the whole reason why she did snitch (her mother's job was being threatened and her mother herself pressured her to say whatever she knows).
