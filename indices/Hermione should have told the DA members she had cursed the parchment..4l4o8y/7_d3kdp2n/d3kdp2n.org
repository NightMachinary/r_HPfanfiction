I actually don't agree. The curse outed the traitor and wasn't all that horrible. It was more like the dye pack in a bank bag than anything else. There's just too many ways to compel people to talk in the HP world. From Veratiserum to Imperius. A warning about consequences would be less than useless but immediately outing the person who talked could actually be useful.
