It comes from Word of God. J.K. Rowling confirmed in an interview that Marietta had permanent, lasting scars from the incident, though they "faded with time". She also didn't seem to regret Marietta's punishment, because "she loathed a traitor". Another poster above also referenced the fact that Marietta is mentioned as wearing concealing clothing after the fact in the series in order to hide these scars.

As an edit, here is the quote.

What Hermione used was indeed Dark magic. Dark magic has been shown several times in the series to permanently maim or disfigure victims, including George Weasley (a missing ear); Bill Weasley (body scars); and Mad-Eye Moody (body scars and a missing eye).
