So wait a minute.

Lets say someone betrayed them because of veritaserum or coercion.

Do you think the "traitor" in that case deserved to be branded for life? What would have happened if lets say... Umbridge had real Veritaserum and interrogated the students?

You would get a bunch of innocent students with permanent scars.
