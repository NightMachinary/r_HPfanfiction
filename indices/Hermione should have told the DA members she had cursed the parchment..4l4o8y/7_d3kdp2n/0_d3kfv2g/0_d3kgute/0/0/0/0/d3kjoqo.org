The Imperius curse got Moody to tell Crouch what he knew. Veratiserum got Crouch to spill the details of Voldemort and we all know he didn't want to do that.

Oh, legilimency too. All of these methods work regardless of what the person wants except in rare instances. Fear of reprisal isn't occlumency.

Edit: also, apparently in the movie Cho told due to veratiserum and did so without reprisal. I know it's not exactly a slam dunk due conflicting canon, but this allows the possibility that intent was a key component to the jinx. I'm getting all of this from a wiki, cause I can't remember all of these details. lol
