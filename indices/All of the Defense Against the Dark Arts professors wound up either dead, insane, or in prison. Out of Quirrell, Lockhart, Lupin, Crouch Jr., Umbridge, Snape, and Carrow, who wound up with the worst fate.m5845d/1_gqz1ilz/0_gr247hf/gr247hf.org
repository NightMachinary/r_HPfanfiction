Hmm while I do agree it was a tragedy about Tonks and Teddy, I cant sympathize with Lupin due to him attempting to abandon them until Harry kicked his arse for it

Lupin was always a coward, he abandoned Harry, he abandoned Sirius and he tried to abandon his own Wife and child during a War in which they were both being hunted down for merely existing

There was a reason even James and Lily viewed him as a potential spy and never told him the truth about their protections, Lupin only ever concerned himself about his own self until other people had to put him in check
