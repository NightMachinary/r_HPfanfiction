You asked about other recs where they become friends. I would be remiss if I did not point you towards the epic Promises series, which spans 2.6m words and is very well written (even more so considering its age).

Harry and Draco are friends for the first 5 years and Slash really only appears during year 6 or 7 and is not very present.

I am not a fan of Slash by any means but even I cannot deny how well done this is. Highly recommend.
