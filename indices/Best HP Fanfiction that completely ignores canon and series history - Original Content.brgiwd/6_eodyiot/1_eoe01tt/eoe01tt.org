Either to be honest. But in my head I simply want a cool AU that ignores entirely the history within the book series themselves. So canon characters can remain, the wizarding world exists in its basic design (twists are fine) as JK wrote it, but history itself is completely AU and as such, it changes the stories of the characters entirely for obvious reasons and certain other things develop differently as well (politics being a big one).

I've read HPMOR, but while I have Fthe Firebird trilogy downloaded, I don't think I have read it yet so I will take a look.
