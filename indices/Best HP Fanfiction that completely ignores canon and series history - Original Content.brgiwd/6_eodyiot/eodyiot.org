I'm curious, do you want complete AU or recent-history AU? I have some examples that might fit, but you could approve or disapprove them to help future commenters.

linkffn(8629685) The Firebird Trilogy has a more alien Wizarding World that's matriarchal. It's kind of a deconstruction of the Harem fic genre. Wizards are referred to as Witch-born, men /must/ take multiple wives in order to maintain the population, and women make all the real decisions.

And HPMOR. Appears similar on the surface, but the deeper you go the more different it gets. (Personally, am not recommending you read this as an AU fic, as the AU info doesn't become clear until 50-75% of the way through, but if you've already read it you can use it as an example of whether it fulfills your request or not.)
