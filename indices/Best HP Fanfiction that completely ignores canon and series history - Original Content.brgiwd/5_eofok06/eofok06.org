It's probably not what you're looking for but I just want to point it out

It was abandoned but I love the historical accuracy of Helga,Not just Hufflepuff at it's other part many names of Rowena and Bold Gryffindor.

It's a bit out there but it's a short story about the founders. It's based on the description of sorting hat where they came from and a historical approximation on their lives based on the era. It's still for me, the best founders era fic.
