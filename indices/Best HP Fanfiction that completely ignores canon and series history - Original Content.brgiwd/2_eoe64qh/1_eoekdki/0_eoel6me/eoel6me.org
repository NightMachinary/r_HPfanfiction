Th√© MC has a completely different upbringing, is a sociopath, has siblings, lives in a no-Voldemort world, has living parents, shows none of Harry's personality traits (surprisingly that's not an exaggeration. None at all.)

Personally, I started this at chapter 20 and read in a non-linear fashion because I got bored often. However, in the end I read it start to end (skipping a few uncomfortable scenes) because the world building was just too interesting. This is one of the few stories I have actually saved (downloaded). It definitely isn't for everyone though, so if you think you won't like it, don't waste your time.
