Linkao3(8494264) fem!Harry that isn't actually Harry at all. You could consider it to be an OC but I still like thinking of her as Harry just for familiarity. She's never mentioned as Harry at all (I think). I would definitely read it for the excellent worldbuilding, if nothing else. The story is incredibly deep, which I found really refreshing. Also available on ffn. It's abandoned, but I often find myself rereading it for the setting.
