Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

Malfoy is a dictator ruling wizarding Britain, Dumbledore is in exile, Harry and the Weasleys grew up in France, Hermione is one of Malfoy's brainwashed mudblood soldiers, nobody knows on which side Snape really is and Voldemort is a half-naga.

That should be AU enough.
