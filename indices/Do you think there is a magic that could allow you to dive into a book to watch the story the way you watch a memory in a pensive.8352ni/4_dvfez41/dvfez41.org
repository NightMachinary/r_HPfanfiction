That sounds interesting, but I don't think it would be anything like a Pensieve. See, I see Pensieves as materializing the actual memories of the soul. That is to say the Pensieve creates no data, it's just an interface for something that already existed. A magical story-immersion system is definitely /possible/, but would work along completely different lines.
