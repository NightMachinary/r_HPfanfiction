Sure. The problem is creating the false memory for it to use and mass production.

I imagine it would start with people selling their real memories.

Imagine Victor Crum selling his memory of a winning game.

He would never sell it, but Boy-Who-Lived fans would kill to get Harry's memory of the Dragon task, or the basilisk encounter.

Etc.
