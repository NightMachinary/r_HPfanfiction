You also got to remember a lot of the places we see prices for things are places where the normal price is usually inflated.

Getting food and especially candy on a train is usually not a good idea due to inflation. It's like getting concessions at a movie theater.

The Butterbeer? Hogsmeade is basically a tourist trap, it's the only place most students can buy things from, so the town itself could put whatever price they please.

This kind of a problem if you want to get an idea of the economy of Harry Potter. What little information you have on products are places where mark ups would regularly occur, and what families we regarding the subject of Finance are the Weasleys, who have a total of nine people to take care of with only one income, yearly schools supplies, whatever resources it takes for upkeep on the property, Arthur's rather expensive sounding hobby of fiddling with anything Muggle related /(including a car, which can't be cheap.)/ All this accumulating to the question of if the Weasley's are actually smart with their finances, considering they Arthur's aforementioned hobby and the fact that they spent the money they gained from what was essentially the lottery /(The Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw)/ on a vacation to Egypt instead of using it buy better school supplies or clothes.
