It seems like a good portion of the wizarding world works in the Ministry of Magic, and I'm not sure the population that Wizarding Britain seems to have could really support it as written.

I thought about this and concluded they mostly fund the MoM from the muggle government somehow. They are a part of the government so maybe it's budgeted in. The muggles that are in the know might be willing to pay to keep magicals under control.

In the USA at least it might explain those thousand-dollar toilet seats in the defense budget.

If I had to guess I'd say that there's taxes on goods, and possibly property taxes, but no income taxes.
