For me it was one of those fics that I knew was complete, so I had to see what would happen and his path to it. Overall, I enjoyed, even if it was pretty bad at times, and the fact that I hate when Lily is bashed(even if there's a good reason) James though, I couldn't care less. The ending was... bittersweet. It gave what it promised from the start, but we didn't get that cathartic reunion, it soured it to me a bit.

Bout the sex with ageing pot, IDK, it makes sense that the author would want to "clear" himself from having a perceived 11yo having sex with a 20+, but it honestly feels useless to the plot and could've just gave another reason for the pot affecting him later on.
