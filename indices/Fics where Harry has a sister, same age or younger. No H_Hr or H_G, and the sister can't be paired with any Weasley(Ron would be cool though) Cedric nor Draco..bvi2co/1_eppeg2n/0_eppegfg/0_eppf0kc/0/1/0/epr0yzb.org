I had to check out when Harry drinks a potion to age him up, then immediately has sex with that 20 or so waitress or whatever. It was too weird man. He's 11. If the author wanted to write in sex couldn't they have started from year 5 or something where it'd be substantially less weird? The timeskip could just be played off as Harry biding his time to learn more, or maybe the sisters death could have happened when they were already in school. I'll give the fic credit though, I did skip ahead and read the ending and it was actually pretty good. It's pretty rare to see both a fic that's finished and that has a good ending to wrap it up.
