Yeah, been reading it since the fourth chapter. Not the best of fics, mostly because I feel that James is too indecisive, Remus is the same as canon, so he's a pussy, Morgan is ok, but Veronica is just meh, and the whole plot feels bland, even though its a really interesting premise.

Its one of those fics where you keep reading just to pass time(when its updated) and to know how it ends. Not a bad fic, there are so so many bad fics out there, but not a great one either. Enjoyable enough I guess.
