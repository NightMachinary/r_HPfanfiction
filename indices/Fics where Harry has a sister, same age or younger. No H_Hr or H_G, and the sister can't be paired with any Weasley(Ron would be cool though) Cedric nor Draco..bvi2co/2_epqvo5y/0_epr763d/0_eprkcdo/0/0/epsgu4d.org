So with regards to the Bitch thing: I thought about that a lot but went with it at the time... Don't expect to use it anymore and will probably take it out if I do another review cycle of the whole thing.

Do not feel bad about being harsh. Part of why I am writing the story and posting it is to get feedback. When I don't get much feedback I don't know what parts of the story are working, which aren't, where I am week and where I am strong.

I am glad you liked the Princess thing. It felt natural for a bunch of teens to do something like that. ii

As for Veronica, she is suffering from panster writing. I had no clue what her background was aside from bitten, saved by Remus, bites James. That is what she started as. Since then she has grown. The Larimont thing came because if I was going to do a top man and top woman Greyback needed a partner. Insert Veronica's deepened backstory and what happened with that.

I am glad you are liking the side characters that are being beefed up. Fair warning, Katie is in for a rough time the next couple chapter.

As the story goes on please feel free to level criticism and feedback. One of my Goals as a writer with Wolf Lord is to focus on show don't tell story telling. I know I haven't always succeeded in this, and part of the slow pace and bloat is showing when I probably could just tell. The other is realism, in so far as character's act rationally from their own personal perspective and suffer logical consequences for their actions within the story. That said, if the character is batshit insane what they consider rational probably isn't to anyone else.
