Looking forward for it. I do have to say that for me, one of my favourite things about it is the offshoot joke that makes me giggle. I also have to say that your werewolf-head-canon is by far one of the more enjoyable ones in the fandom, so there's that. One thing that weirds me out a lot, though it makes sense in the context of the fic, is the use of "bitch" for females. Even if its right, it feels wrong.

I'm sorry if I sounded too harsh, but those are the actually only holdovers for me for this fic to be a great one, meaning that the rest are actually really good and keeps me around. I couldn't stop laughing for couple minutes on the first time you called Sirius "Princess". It came out of nowhere and it was such a natural joke that fit perfectly to James' character.

To expand on why I think Veronica to be meh, which isn't a really good, well, explanation, I feel that at times she's the "perfect" hen mother without any flaws, and then it just fliped out during the Greyback fight. It came out of nowhere and even though it was explained later on, just felt OoC. She's also not a charismatic, for me, character, for some reason. I just can't relate to her the same way I can relate to Hestia, which is by far the best Carrow I've read in fanon. Or Kate, or the Twins. She's bland and yet not. Its weird. I guess I wasn't as clear as I wanted to be.

That being said, I'll keep reading it and I do want to know how you'll progress through the story, and the fact that Snape knows/assumes he's Harry, I want to see what he'll do with that info, and how you'll make the story go on if you're planing on getting them back to the US.
