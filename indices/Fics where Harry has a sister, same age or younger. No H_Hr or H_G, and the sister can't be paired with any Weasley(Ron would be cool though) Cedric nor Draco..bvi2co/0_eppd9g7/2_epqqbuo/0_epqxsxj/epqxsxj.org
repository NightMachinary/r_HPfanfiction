I'm not a fan of the pairing, if that wasn't clear. For some reason, I find HarryxFemHarryFromAnotherDimension much more interesting.

The only HarryxSibling that I know of that is any good is Potter's against the World linkffn(12200475). But that is just because Temporal Knight could write a story about a fling between a flowerpot and a whale and have it ready good.

(Note: if you read this TemporalKnight, do not take inspiration from this. At least not until we have a sequel to hourglass)
