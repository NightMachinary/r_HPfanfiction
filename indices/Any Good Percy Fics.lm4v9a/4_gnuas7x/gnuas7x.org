It's part "missing scenes"/minor character perspective and part sequel for linkao3(Escape), bit linkao3(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by Singular_ Oddities) is a very pro-Percy fic.

And that's all I've got for you, my taste in Percy-centric fics runs towards things like linkffn(The Collaborator by midwesterngirl)
