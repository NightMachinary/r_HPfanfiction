It's still on going but ‘Percy take the wheel' by kittysmith on ao3 is my all time favorite Percy fic! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14033613/chapters/32322168]] “A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.”
