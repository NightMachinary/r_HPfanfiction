A bit late but I'd like to recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1998893/1/What-You-Left-Behind][What You Left Behind]] linkffn(1998893). It revolves around Percy reconciling with his family after the events of OOTP, focusing on Percy's regret, shame, and his desire to redeem himself. But what's really interesting is that the fic points out how his family mistreated and alienated him. The author is especially critical of Fred and George and, surprisingly, Bill and also acknowledges Arthur's own fault over what happened between him and Percy.
