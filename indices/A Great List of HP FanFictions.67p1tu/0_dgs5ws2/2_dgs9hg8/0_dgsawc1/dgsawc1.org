Well, I've never seen Firefly either, but Browncoat, Green Eyes is still one of my favourite stories. You really don't need any background, it gives you enough to work with.

I'm probably a little biased with regards to Browncoat and Wand and Shield. They were the stories that got me interested in crossovers in the first place. Had it not been for them, I may never have got into writing in the first place.
