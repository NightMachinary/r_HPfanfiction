Nicely formatted list. I agree with [[/u/blandge]] that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/][Wand and Shield]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/][Browncoat, Green Eyes]] deserve a mention well above something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11027086/1/The-Power-He-Knows-Not][The Power He Knows Not]], which is a decidedly uninspiring story to my mind.

Also, while I love Taure's ideas as much as the next guy, I dunno if a two-chapter unfinished story can be counted among the top 33 of the fandom.

Lastly, is it strange that while I know many of these are good stories, I haven't really been able to read them from beginning to end? Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11487602/1/][Resurrexit]] is like the Schindler's List of fanfiction, surely incredible, but I just don't have the energy to invest in something so serious.
