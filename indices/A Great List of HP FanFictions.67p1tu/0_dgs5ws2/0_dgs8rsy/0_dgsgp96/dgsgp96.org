Certainly in the wacky world of HP/Lord of the Rings crossovers it's one of the better ones, but it was my first ever 'completed' story and that was pretty much its sole purpose. It's a bit clich√©d, and rather clumsy in places, it doesn't do anything particularly earth-shattering. If HP/LotR wasn't such a wasteland it wouldn't get anywhere near as much praise, but it is what it is. I will admit, though, that I always try and maintain a good level of canonicity.
