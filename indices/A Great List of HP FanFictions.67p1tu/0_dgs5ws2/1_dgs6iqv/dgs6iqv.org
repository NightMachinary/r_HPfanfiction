  I dunno if a two-chapter unfinished story can be counted among the top 33 of the fandom.

This was my thought as well.

  Lastly, is it strange that while I know many of these are good stories, I haven't really been able to read them from beginning to end? Something like Resurrexit is like the Schindler's List of fanfiction, surely incredible, but I just don't have the energy to invest in something so serious.

Not at all, I've never made it all the way through many of these. Most notably A Long Journey Home and Prince of a Dark Kingdom. I think it comes down to taste to a large degree. Sometimes certain fics just don't catch you.
