This is a great list, but I have a slight problem with you proclaiming the two crossovers you listed are "easily" top 2. Probably the foremost is linkffn(Wand and Shield by Morta's Priest) which certainly could make a claim at the best HP/ crossover. There's also linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) among others.

Also, not having linkffn(Resurrexit by Master Slytherin) in a top 33 list is a crime.
