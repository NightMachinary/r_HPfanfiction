An eerie, unsettling tale of Harry's decent after the death of his wife, Luna. In my opinion (which is shared by many that frequent the HPFF IRC) it is the best written HPFF in the fandom. It's a fic I would recommend to everyone, but that I'm scared to read again. It doesn't exactly give you the type of satisfaction you generally get from reading fanfiction, but it does manage to make you feel hollow and empty inside.
