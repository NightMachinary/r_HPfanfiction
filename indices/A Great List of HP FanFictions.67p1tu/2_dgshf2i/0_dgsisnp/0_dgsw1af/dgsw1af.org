Fahad's fic created/perpetuated a lot of bad fanon. Many characters were far less likeable than canon.

Maybe Harry's dickishness was realistic in some sense, but it was not entertaining. I really didn't like how Daphne ended up falling for him. She should have just screwed him over at some point. There's a difference between having flaws and being an asshole.

I agree that both are flawed. In my opinion however, Knowledge is Power is far more flawed than Delenda Est. So much so that I'm wondering why it's even on the list.
