In my opinion, likeable side characters enhance a story. Fahad's characters are often boring. Sometimes it feels like he is making up things about them specifically to put them down.

I prefer to have my main character be somewhat likeable. This is true even when the main character is a villain. Otherwise I find myself hoping for a bad end. This is exactly what happened with Contractual invalidation. On top of that, the romance was kind of shitty and the plot was boring. I only liked Daphne.

I wasn't to fond of the fanon Fahad created. Some things were just stupid.
