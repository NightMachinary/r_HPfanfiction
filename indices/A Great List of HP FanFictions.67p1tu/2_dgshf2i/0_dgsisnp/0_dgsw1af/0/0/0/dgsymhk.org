  I prefer to have my main character be somewhat likeable. This is true even when the main character is a villain. Otherwise I find myself hoping for a bad end. This is exactly what happened with Contractual invalidation. On top of that, the romance was kind of shitty and the plot was boring. I only liked Daphne.
