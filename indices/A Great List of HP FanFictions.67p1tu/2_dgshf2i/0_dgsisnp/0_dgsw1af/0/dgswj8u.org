I don't find the likeability of characters, especially non-important characters, to be a huge factor in what I read. Truthfully, I want to have characters that I don't like because it means that the author is invoking a reaction from me. And if someone perpetuates bad fanon that's on their copycats, not the original author.

  I agree that both are flawed. In my opinion, however, Knowledge is Power is far more flawed than Delenda Est. So much so that I'm wondering why it's even on the list.

Respectable, though if I decided to take of Knowledge is Power I would probably also off Delenda Est.
