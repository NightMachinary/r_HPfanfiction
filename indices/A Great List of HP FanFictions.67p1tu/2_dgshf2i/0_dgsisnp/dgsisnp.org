  I noticed you mentioned that Fahad's crossover might be the best crossover on the site, but it tends to misinterpret several of the canon DxD characters.

I don't really mind that as I find his characters and world much more endearing than the original.

  I didn't particularly enjoy Harry's character in Contractual Invalidation. He was kind of dick. However, I never finished the fic, so I might have missed some explanation as to why he was acting the way he was.
#+end_quote

I felt that Harry's 'dickishness', as you put it, was realistic and entertaining. People do not gain power or garner support by having impeccable morals. And overall he really wasn't a dick, but more scheming and shrewd. I found it to be a nice refresher from the average FF that always has the main character having almost no flaws besides some unimportant things like a short memory.

  I would definitely put Delenda Est above Knowledge is Power.
#+end_quote

Both of these are incredibly flawed which is why I have them on the bottom. I found that Bella in Delenda Est was an uninteresting and flat character.
