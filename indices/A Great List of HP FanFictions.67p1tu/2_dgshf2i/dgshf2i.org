I noticed you mentioned that Fahad's crossover might be the best crossover on the site, but it tends to misinterpret several of the canon DxD characters.

I didn't particularly enjoy Harry's character in Contractual Invalidation. He was kind of dick. However, I never finished the fic, so I might have missed some explanation as to why he was acting the way he was.

I would definitely put Delenda Est above Knowledge is Power.

Other than that, interesting list. I will probably check out the fics I haven't read yet, which seems to be most of them.
