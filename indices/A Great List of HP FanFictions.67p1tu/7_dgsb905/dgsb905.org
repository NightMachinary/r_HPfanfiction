Nice list! I'm not sure if you're including incomplete fics, but if so linkffn(Gabriel by Shikatanai) is one of the best written fics I've read. Also worth a mention (at least in my opinion) are:

linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) -- I thought this one had some really interesting ideas about magic that were developed pretty well as well as an anti-heroine, which was a nice change.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpoint) -- technically canon compliant, and well-written!

And, of course, there's linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness by Thanfiction) which is also technically fairly canon compliant and also is a really well crafted emotional story.
