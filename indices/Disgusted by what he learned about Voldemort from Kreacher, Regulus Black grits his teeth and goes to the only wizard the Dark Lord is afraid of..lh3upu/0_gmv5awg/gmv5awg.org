Many would comment that the only wizard Voldemort feared was Dumbledore. In fact every single person would, including every sane death eater.

Regulus however was not rank and file in the death eaters. He was part of the true inner circle, as all the Black's who had joined were, even Narcissa.

So when he had learned about the truth behind the foul things the man had done to his own soul, he made his way to Dumbledore's door.

Black's were twisted, evil, and Dark (with a capital letter even), they were not foul enough to alter their soul.

The soul was sacrosanct, to harm it intentionally was disgusting enough to make Regulus get sick across the floor.

So he had made his was to the door at 8 in the morning sharp when he would likely not be busy yet.

Dumbledore greet him past the wooden door and to take a set before the great oak table in front of him.

"Dumbledore sir, I bring grave tidings and require your help. The Dark Lord has done something truly vile."

Dumbledore leaned forward reaching into a bowl on the table eating a candy.

"Oh, what mess have you gotten yourself into?"

Regulus steadied himself taking a deep breath before saying the words that filled his soul with disgust.

"The Dark Lord has created multiple Horcrux. He had me help him is hiding one of them."

The room grew uncomfortably hot quickly as he could see the rage of the information anger Dumbledore.

The old man stood and lashed out his hand, a staff smacking into his hand. There were only four Staved magicals in Britain currently.

Alastor Moody (who was so spell damaged he could barely use the thing anymore), Dragon (the head of the unspeakables), Arcturus Black (his insanely powerful, and insane, grandfather), and of course Aberforth Dumbledore (Last of the Druids).

Aberforth ushered the boy out and slammed his staff into the ground. A stone archway grew from the ground and Regulus saw his grandfathers rose garden through the archway.

"Come along, Arcturus will need to know what foolishness his family has gotten tied up in."
