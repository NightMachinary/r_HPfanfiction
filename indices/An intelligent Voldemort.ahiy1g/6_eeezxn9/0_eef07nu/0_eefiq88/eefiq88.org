That's a common issue. Personally, I agree that Harry would be hard to get along with, but that's not necessarily a flaw in the storytelling, merely a flaw in a character. I still found the story very entertaining and thought-provoking - and Harry's mistakes /do/ come back to bite him.

If you don't enjoy it, though, c'est la vie.
