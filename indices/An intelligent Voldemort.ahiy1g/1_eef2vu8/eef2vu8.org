linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) fits. Voldemort won the first war and is charismatic, clever and sane. Wizarding Britain under him is a decent place even if there are a few ethically questionable things going on. There is no main romance plot line and Harry is not overpowered or super smart/powerful.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux by the Imaginize) The horcrux in Harry's head awakens when he is a child. This version of Voldemort is quite manipulative and charming while slowly influencing Harry to do what he wants him to do.

linkao3(Keep Your Enemies Closer by Riddletobien) I thought he was well portrayed here as well.
