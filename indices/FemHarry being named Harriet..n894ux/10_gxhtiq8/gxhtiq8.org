While fem-Harry could be interesting in a "DC Elseworlds" kind of way, most authors use it either as a "bate and switch" for their OC or even SI, do it so they can pair Harry with Malfoy "without it being slash", have it as Snape's "second chance" as either a future love interest or as a daughter figure, or other things just as odd/nebulous.

The names are usually the same, but that's not a bad thing outside of common ones like Harriet: I could see Lily sticking with the flower theme in her family, so fem-Harry being "Rose" or "Daisy"? Yeah, I could see that.

But on the whole, it's why I avoid them like the plague, as 99% of the time it's author agenda driven for something like "not-slash", an SI/OC, or a fetish/pairing.
