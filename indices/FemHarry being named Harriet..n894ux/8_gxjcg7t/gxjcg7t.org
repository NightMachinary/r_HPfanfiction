I'm not a fan of Fem!Harry being named Harriet, either. I like something that's along the lines of the Potter names that we know like Harry, James, and Henry, which I classify as classic royal names. So, I'd choose something like Mary, Elizabeth, Victoria, or Margaret with either Lily or another flower name as a middle name as a nod to the Evans girls for Fem!Harry.
