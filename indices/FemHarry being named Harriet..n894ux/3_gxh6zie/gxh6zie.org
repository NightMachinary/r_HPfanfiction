I always thought it fit better with femHarry keeping the naming-theme of the Evans-family, by naming her after a flower. Lily - Petunia - Rose(?) Potter or Bella(Short for Belladonna) Potter

Also personal opinion: I think it is just a tad bit lazy to go "I am making Harry a female... name? female-version of Harry as well!"
