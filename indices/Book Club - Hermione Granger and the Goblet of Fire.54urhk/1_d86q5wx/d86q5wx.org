I read the fic a long time ago, and liked it very much. I agree with most of [[/u/MacsenWledig]]'s comments, both good and bad. It is, as far as I know, the only exploration of how someone like Hermione --- not as athletic or recklessly courageous, but more disciplined and better at magic --- would have handled the tasks, and Hermione's gradual development into an action heroine was excellently done. Having her make mistakes and have the mistakes have consequences was also well done.

On the downside, I think the fic could be edited down by about a third without losing much, by reducing the amount of text dedicated to plot threads that didn't lead anywhere, like the attempt to use Muggle Law to get out of the Tournament. Also, my feeling is that the ending was a bit too fixfic: Voldemort wounded, his return acknowledged by the Ministry, so while it is unfortunate that there is no sequel, I am not too sad, since the tension that had set up the canon OotP is gone, and I can't see anything waiting in the wings to replace it. And, I wish I could say that any of this happier ending was due to Hermione's actions or planning, but it was mostly because 1) Voldemort made even more unforced errors than he had made in canon at the time, and 2) Hermione had better lawyers. (That is not an exaggeration.)

I admit that I would have liked to see Hermione *win* a little more: actually manage to put Draco down for the count in the Slytherin exercise, rather than needing the rescue party, or maybe not need to be pulled out of the water after the Second Task.
