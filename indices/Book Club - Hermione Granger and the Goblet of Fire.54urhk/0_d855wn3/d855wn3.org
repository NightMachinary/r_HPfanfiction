*The Good:*

- Magical idioms: 'flooed to the wrong fireplace' (for barking up the wrong tree), 'a politician to his very wand tip,' ‘don't look a Niffler in the snout,' ‘tell it to me straight from the witch's cauldron'

- Emphasis on believable emotional responses: the protagonist genuinely seems terrified before each Task in the Triwiz. The author has done a great job of showing, not telling here.

- Pre-existing character preferences and traits are preserved: It's a canon divergent H/Hr fic that doesn't gloss over Hermione's attraction to Ron or Harry's to Cho. Harry is not as empathic as Hermione and fails to understand Ron's fit for what it is as quickly as Hermione did in canon.

- Focus on character choices: Hermione excels academically due to her choice to frequently study, not because of any innate super-intellect.

- Hermione's parents do not simply exist to blindly validate their daughter's choice in life.

- Protagonist makes a few bad decisions and suffers the fallout for them: believing she can outwit Rita Skeeter in an interview with the /Daily Prophet/, freezing for a lengthy period of time when confronted with a dragon in the First Task of the TWT

- Casanova!Harry and Supermodel!Hermione are nowhere to be seen.

*The Bad:*

- Despite being an AU divergence, it sticks with the stations of canon for a bit too long. Having Hermione face the Hungarian Horntail is a bit silly when the second and third tasks are somewhat different than canon.

- Unbalanced narration: light on needed description in a few tense moments, overload on minor details in other scenes

- ‘Dan and Emma Granger?' Yuck.

- A few spots of narrator omniscience where the author forgets that they've been writing in third-person limited.

- Loads of Manic-Pixie-Dream-Girl Luna and hints of Seer!Luna. These tropes completely miss the point of her character in the original series.

- A few conversations indicating that Hermione loves rules, and only breaks them at the behest of Ron and Harry. Directly contradicted by canon on several occasions.

- There is an unchallenged assumption that what Hermione starts to feel for Harry is genuine love, and not a typical teenage infatuation. While this is eventually addressed later in the story in a moment of self-reflection, I would have preferred to have the protagonist tackle this internal struggler earlier... preferably as soon as she realised that her feelings were more than platonic.

- Unironic use of the phrase ‘limpid emerald pools.'

- Hermione runs roughshod over a sputtering Dumbledore at the end. Hardly realistic.

*The Minor Nitpicks:*

- Inconsistent convention: Muggles capitalised, but Muggle-born is not.

- Overly-verbose dialogue tags: ‘Declaimed' was a new one for me.

- Ginny's Bat Bogey Hex^{TM} was lame in canon, it's lame in fanfic.
