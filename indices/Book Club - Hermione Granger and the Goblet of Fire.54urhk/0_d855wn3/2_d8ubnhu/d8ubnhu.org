Point of Luna's character? - I might be the only one, but I think her character was POINTLESS! (She's goofy for goofynesses sake and nobody tells her to snap out of it/to go to therapy!)

Also: Hermione DOES love rules - she doesn't have much of a problem with breaking them if it's for a higher cause, but over all she's in love with rules, structure and authority figures (Dumbledore, McGonagall etc.) - otherwise she would have told them off for sending Harry back to his relatives (much less putting him there in the first place!)

ps: That doesn't mean that I condone people bullying her, as a former victim of bullying (it's still hard to overcome to this day!) I hate bullies and think they should all face the harshest punishment that's possible (at least if telling them to stop several times does NOT help!)

pps: I will have to read this fiction...I don't normally read fictions that put Hermione in the spotlight (particularly because I think she's so overrated in fanfiction (she can basically do no wrong - unless the writer dislikes her and bashes her! Very few fictions actually aren't biased in favor of her or against her!))
