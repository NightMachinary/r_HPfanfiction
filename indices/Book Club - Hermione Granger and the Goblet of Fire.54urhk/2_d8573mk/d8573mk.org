I liked this, I thought it was a fairly clever fork from canon that returned us to canon at the end in almost the same state as the books. Characters behaved in character, the dialog was realistic.

I did find that Hermione's parents disapproval of Hogwarts was really similar to that in The Arithmancer (which I had just read), so that dragged a bit.

Plenty of accurate references to contemporary Britain which would be normal for a muggle-born.
