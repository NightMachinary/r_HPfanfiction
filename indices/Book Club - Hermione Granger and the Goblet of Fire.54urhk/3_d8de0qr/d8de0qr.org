Overall a good fic -- I did start at the "limpid green pools" bit though. Sometimes dialogue didn't correctly shift tone (Harry and Ron using Hermione-style big words) with characters, and Krum's language barrier was a bit much. There was some serious idiot ball holding in the last few chapters.

In the end though, it was enjoyable, and had a decent amount of unique, interesting ideas, even if the idiot-ball made it a bit frustrating at the end.
