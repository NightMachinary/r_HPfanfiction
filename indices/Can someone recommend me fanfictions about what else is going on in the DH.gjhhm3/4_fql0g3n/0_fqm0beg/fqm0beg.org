I wish people would comment with arguments in threads like these rather than downvoting legitimate recommendations that meet the ask. Downvotes should be for suggestions that don't meet the request.

I don't like the fic you suggested and I think Not From Others is a much better DH at Hogwarts story, since it isn't torture porn with strong undercurrents of misogyny. But obviously you enjoyed it and it does meet the request.
