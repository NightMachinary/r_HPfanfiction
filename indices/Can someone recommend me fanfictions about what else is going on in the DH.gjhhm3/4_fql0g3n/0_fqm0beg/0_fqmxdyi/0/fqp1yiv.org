The story behind it is more entertaining, haha. The guy that wrote it had his own cult.

I think the story is not terrible. But I dropped it pretty quickly because of how certain aspects annoyed me. As mentioned the undercurrents of misogyny, it's gratuitous nature and frankly the fact it doesn't adhere to canon very well. Neville is not remotely Neville.
