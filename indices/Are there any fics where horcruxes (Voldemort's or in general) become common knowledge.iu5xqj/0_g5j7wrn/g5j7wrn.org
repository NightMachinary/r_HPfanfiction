The Fallout.

the war breaks out when Dumbledore dies. Moody and Lupin run the war and set Harry on a horcrux team away from all the fighting. That's in the background though cause it follows Hermione as a foot soldier. There's a Dramoine romance in the secondish half but imo it's a good war story if you skip the smut.
