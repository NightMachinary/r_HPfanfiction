I seem to recall numerous stories where sending Harry to Azkaban was all part of MustacheTwirling!Dumbledore's plan to make him strong enough to fight Voldemort. Also all the other ones where it was clear that the author had just read The Count of Monte Cristo in school and thought they were cleverly alluding to it.
