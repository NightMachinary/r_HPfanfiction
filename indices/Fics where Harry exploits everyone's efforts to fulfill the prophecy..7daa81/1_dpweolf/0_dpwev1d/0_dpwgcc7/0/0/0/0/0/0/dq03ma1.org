Do you really think that this brat could have defeated Voldemort in the first place, even if they'd done what he wanted? To defeat Voldemort, it took a hero, with unmatched will and determination, and willing to sacrifice himself to save others.

This brat, with his attitude, and reinforced by others' subservience, would he defeat Voldemort in Priori Incantem? Would he to sacrifice himself for his loved ones, granting them protection and destroying Voldemort's last horcrux?

No. Giving in to his demands would just postpone the inevitable: the brat finally being hunted down and killed by the Dark Lord, or, worse yet, joining him, only to be betrayed and killed (or worse).

This Harry taking responsibility and reforming was the only chance he had of fulfilling the prophecy in his favor, and to make him face the consequences of his actions was the only chance this "bureaucrat" had of effecting that.
