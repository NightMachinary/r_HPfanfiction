  Something where Harry can transform into anyone and anything

This is me stretching a bit, but fem!Harry is a metamorphagus in linkffn(Victoria Potter), and it's one of the best fanfictions I've read. It's long, completely avoids tropes, avoids canon rehashes, all the children talk and act like normal children would, has good pacing and the best world building of any fic I've ever read. It also avoids bashing.
