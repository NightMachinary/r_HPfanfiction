It very much depends on what you think is "great". But if we do go by conventional standards, it's achieving something others can't, and for this you need the ambition to try and a certain ruthless, single-minded focus that (for good and ill) runs over everyone and everything that stands in the way.

Which sounds like something Slytherin could have taught him (in a "sink or swim" manner) -- he certainly didn't have it on his own.

Of course, Harry did achieve something (defeating Voldemort). But leaving aside that at the time, no one could guess this, do note that this is something that doesn't originate within him. From PS on, Harry feels responsible for the world; it's quite different from pursuing something you picked in a free decision. Harry in Slytherin might well have gotten into a hard choice of whether or not be the "Chosen One" -- and given that the prophecy is a state of mind, it's not like he would necessarily be forced to be.
