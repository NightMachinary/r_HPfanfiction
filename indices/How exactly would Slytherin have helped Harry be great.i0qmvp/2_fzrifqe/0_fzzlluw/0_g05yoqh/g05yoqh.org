Based on the definition, you are, of course, correct. And it's certainly something people have written in FF (or tried to, anyway). You'll find quite a few fans of that here.

Though, if you read my [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i0qmvp/how_exactly_would_slytherin_have_helped_harry_be/fzum1pt/][other comment]], you see that I'm personally not the biggest fan of that story line. This has two reasons; for one, it's Canon that some of the more (as commonly understood) "nasty" traits belong to Slytherin, e.g. "using any means to achieve their ends" is just a more fancy way of saying "cheating"; and if you count Pottermore, then Slytherins are selfish and cowards. So "reforming" the House would be equal to discarding it; it wouldn't be Slytherin anymore.

More relevantly though, I find it boring as both a writer and reader. The interesting thing to explore with Slytherin, for me, is how a different view of morality turns the "bad" traits into "good" ones, and how this is what causes their continued existence (because obviously, no sane person likes to think of themselves as "bad").

Disregard for people turns to commendable ambition. Cowardice turns to commendable valuing your life. Cheating turns to commendable dedication to a goal. Selfishness turns to commendable clear-eyed realism.

In other words, like I said in the other post, the inside POV, and the contrast it yields to the Gryffindor POV, whose traits would be inverted as well (braveness becomes stupidity, nobility becomes highhanded arrogance, insistence on doing the "right thing" self-righteous preaching of those that know of no hard choices). So the only reason for me to stick a Harry with Gryffindor values into Slytherin would be to poke at this dark mirror of those values, and as that makes for a quaint reading for about one chapter, I usually just give him the Slytherin POV, and use some other Gryffindor for contrast.
