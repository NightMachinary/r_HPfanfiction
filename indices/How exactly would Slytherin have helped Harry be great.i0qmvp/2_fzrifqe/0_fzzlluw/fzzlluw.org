Based on your definition, perhaps the "great" thing Harry would do in Slytherin is reform the House. In the books, Slytherins are supposed to be ambitious and cunning, but I don't think we see that...unless you count cheating as cunning and committing racist terrorism as ambitious.

Harry might, MIGHT have been able to provide a better example. Someone who succeeds where all the odds are stacked against him. And with such an example, maybe the upcoming generation would think "maybe Voldemort's path isn't the best one?"

This is speculation on my part but I thought I'd throw in my two bits.
