One thing that comes to mind is that Harry would have been in a hostile environment, from day one. Adversity breeds Excellence and to survive in the house Harry, most likely, would have had to shine.

Be the best in classes earns respect. Learn and master curses early gains fear from his peers.

That is one way to look at it.

On the other hand, Harry could have been an... interesting presence in Slytherin. Another option, a different path, a way out to many children spending their formative years in the house that bred Voldemort and 99% of his Death Eaters.

That's what comes immediately to mind, in any case.
