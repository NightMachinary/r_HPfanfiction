imo houses are all about creating the right environment to hone the kids' potential strengths. It's not really decided by the kids' personality (I mean come on, they're at the age right before their personalities have a major change) but their potential and, most importantly, their own priorities and dreams in life. That's why the Hat takes into account the kid's choice, why whole families go to a single house, why many characters don't seem to fit their house's traits, etc.

So Slytherin is not a house /for/ cunning and ambitious kids, but a house which /creates/ cunning and ambitious young adults, in an environment that's competitive and unforgiving and whatever else. And that's what would have helped Harry be great, achieve glory, blah blah blah.
