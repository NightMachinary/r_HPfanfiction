Well, if we go off of canon, he'd be dealing with either respect from those who thought he was a dark wizard or hatred from Voldemort supporting families. The adversity would push him to prove himself, though in a different manner from how he tries to go about it in 5th year. The difference with 5th and AU 1st year would be that Harry would be proving he isn't a dark wizard whereas 5th year he gets called a liar. He'd also have to go about it differently instead of yelling at everyone because remember, he's straight from an abusive home and likely less outspoken. So with his new freedom he probably works his best to do well academically and physically, to be the “good” slytherin to prove his housemates wrong. In 5th year he's been in gryffindor he's developed different traits which make him more outspoken and loud, whereas Slytherin would breed sneakier traits and work as a juxtaposition. He would retain what makes him Harry, but with a less upfront way of doing things and likely more of a determination to show people up. Though it's been a while since I've read canon, so I might be off.
