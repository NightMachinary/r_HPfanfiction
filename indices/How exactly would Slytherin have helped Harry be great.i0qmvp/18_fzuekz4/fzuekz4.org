I think it's more to do with how the houses are. While Harry was treated as a celebrity by the Gryffindor and had a lot of pull with them from the beginning, he would have had to work a lot to achieve that kind of a system in Slytherin. That would have surely changed him from the person he became.

It would've honestly, changed how he approached a problem. Maybe being cunning for once rather than charging head first into a problem like he does throughout the canon.
