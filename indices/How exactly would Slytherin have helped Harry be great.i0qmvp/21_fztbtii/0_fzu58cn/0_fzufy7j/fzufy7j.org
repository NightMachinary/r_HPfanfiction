I was speaking about canon, and its binary morale undertones. You're either good or you're evil, and a Harry in Slytherin in Canon would have been evil just like the rest of them.

This situation really only works in Fanon, cause JK operates on a very black-and-white system in her books.

Of course, a Fanon Slytherin Harry likely wouldn't be evil, just like the majority of his classmates. But I doubt also that he would find an "in" with the 'old crowd' as is so often the case, or that he would actually study dark magic in-depth.
