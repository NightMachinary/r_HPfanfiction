He would be in a sink or swim situation, many in the House would be recalcitrant, he would have to prove himself in a semi-hostile environment. He would have to either develop the people skills to make friends, or isolate himself and seek friendship in other Houses.

He would learn to work hard, to focus, he wouldn't have the distractions he had in Gryffindor.

Snape would be in one hell of a quandary, if he exaggerated too much in the punishing, Albus would intervene. If he hurt Harry he would be going against his vow to protect him.

I could see a Harry that merely doesn't want to deal with this shit just asking to be transferred to another school after first year. He wouldn't have the friends to anchor him.

Maybe he would find fewer but very loyal friends, maybe he would become more charismatic and swing the house's loyalty towards him, much more competent than Malfoy, and more pleasant to be around. Maybe he would be swayed to a darker, ruthless philosophy(not support Voldemort just being more brutal and self-centered), without Hermione, Ron and Dumbledore(among others) to help guide him towards good.

The hat does say in Slytherin you find your true friends(this can be interpreted in a myriad of ways).

I could totally see him being influenced by the friendships and environment there(like any child) and being quite different from canon Harry by the third year.

Second Year would be very interesting.

OR Maybe he finds out the Slytherins are misunderstood traditionalists, who only want to be free to study more magic. He does that while forming real friendships and finding true love in the arms of a rich pureblooded heiress who teaches him politics and how to walk with grace and greet people "properly". All before he reaches puberty /s
