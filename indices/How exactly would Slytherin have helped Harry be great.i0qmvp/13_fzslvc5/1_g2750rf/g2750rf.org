It's amazing how many people seem to think that being great is the same as having no scruples. Though this has certainly some logic, considering how Voldemort was described even by someone like Olivander.

Except of course for getting rid of the person responsible for their deaths. It's beyond me how one can think that the way he did that would somehow be disrespectful to their sacrifices. The end result is exactly the same, only without the usage of a curse that warps the user's mind.

I don't recall Dumbledore telling Harry to use a Disarming Charm against Voldemort. In fact, if Harry was brainlessly following Dumbledore, he would have used a far more lethal curse, as Dumbledore did during their duel.
