I personally think that if Harry was in Slytherin that his competitiveness would've pushed him to earn respect and pushed him to be better. I think the mindset would've changed the way he acted in that he would've had to be calculated and also just being around the ones who's parents were death eaters would've given him insight and more information to make better decisions. He would've seen the best and worst from both sides. As well his friends, regardless if they were Hermione and Ron or a Slytherin would've probably given him tough love and motivated him that way and given him a competitive "I have to improve" instead of the "You need to be better" he felt from people in Gryffindor. The enviroment in the Slytherin house was probably survival of the fittest in essence and he would've had to learn to play his cards properly. The determination wouldn't have let him spend him mess around much and in my opinion he probably wouldn't have even thought about dating until it was all over. Another factor is how he would learn to watch his back. He would've been in the same dorm as at least a few of the boys he was openly enemies with from the start. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle. I'm sure threats would've been common and he would need to be careful if he wanted to keep his secrets and cloak.
