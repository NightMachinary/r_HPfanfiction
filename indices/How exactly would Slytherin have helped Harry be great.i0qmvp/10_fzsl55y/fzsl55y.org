Well, if Slytherin was as it was supposed to be (ambitious and cunning), it could have been good. Those are both good traits to have, though honestly all of the house traits are good. Canon mostly treats the house as pureblood bigots. The house had to have known that. It certainly is aware of things that happen outside of it, after all, and in any case the last few generations almost certainly were bigots as far as we know. I'm not sure how that was supposed to help him in any way.
