Assuming that Harry being in Slytherin wouldn't make Snape any less hostile and hateful, Harry would've been forced to mature and learn fast. Since Snape hates him, he'd probably make Harry hated by his fellow Slytherins. That and Draco being annoying whenever he succeeds would force Harry to be the best. His social skills were developed more because of Ron and Hermione showing him true friendship and family. without those, Harry would be a lot darker (maybe new dark lord? prob not but its an interesting thought) and probably a more well rounded wizard. Harry is cunning in canon but if he was in Slytherin, he'd be a lot more manipulative because of his peers also being manipulative.
