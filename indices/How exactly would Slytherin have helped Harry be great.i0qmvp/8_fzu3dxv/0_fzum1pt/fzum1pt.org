  and so Draco could easily be dragged along on the adventures till this point without even having to renounce Blood Purism except to be less loud about it in Harry's earshot.

"The adventures" are the epitome of Gryffindor. From the point of view of Slytherin, they are nightmares, and Draco would thank you very much not to get involved with this. Actually, a Harry that was a Slytherin wouldn't be involved, not unless he was a Gryffindor-in-Slytherin, which ... well, kinda defeats the point. A Gryffindor-in-Slytherin!Harry might well do what you say; but it's moot argument: No such thing will exist, if the Sorting and Houses mean anything at all.

An actual Harry in Slytherin might work the following way:

- Year 1: Draco destroys Neville's remembrall. Troll kills Hermione. Dragon burns down Hagrid's hut. Quirrell steals the stone.
- Year 2: The Basilisk kills a student. Hogwarts gets closed. And off you are to AU territory.

The reason why it happens (exemplarily) like this is because Harry does not get involved in the Canon situations. As a Slytherin, he knows the value of his own life, and asks two very important questions: (1) "Why should I", (2) "What's in it for me". Both of which lead to him staying far away from deadly beasts, schemes by Headmasters and Death Eaters, insane professors and suicidal situations. Because the very premise in any of those is a feeling of responsibility for the world at age 11, which is fundamentally incompatible with Slytherin, so a Harry correctly sorted into Slytherin does not possess such a thing.

This is also why I don't like those kinds of stories; as you say, there are a lot of them, and they never make sense to me. I always like to think the author himself would be a Gryffindor, and is so boxed-in in his POV that he doesn't even realise the issue. One memorable instance in a story declared -- *unironically* -- that "not all Slytherins are bad, some are noble and brave". Which would be a hilarious joke ("not all Slytherins are bad, some are Gryffindors"), except the author was serious.

Writing Slytherin like that -- in effect, sending Harry there to Gryffindorise it -- does a great disservice to House system, I think. Slytherins /are/ selfish. They /do/ consider their own gains first. *And the point here is that this is only bad as measured by the standards of a Gryffindor.* You don't need to fix this, indeed you musn't. Slytherins don't consider /themselves/ "evil" or bad persons. That's an outside POV. The whole point (in my eyes) in writing a Slytherin story is to cover the inside POV, i.e. a set of beliefs that considers themselves as perfectly good.

And to return to the OP, such a set of ideals is one building block to achieve more than the average person (or what often is called "great"), because the focus is on the self, as the drive make it work, and the belief of being better than others is the reason to try.
