Slytherin is stuck in a self-fulfilling loop where because people view them as Junior Death Eaters, kids avoid the house if they aren't Pureblood supremacists, which ensures that the house becomes and stays full of Junior Death Eaters, who are the only people happy to bear such a reputation.

Having Harry be sorted there, an undeniable beacon of light and a hero to plenty of Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws would give him extra ability to reach Slytherins, while the fact he's the Boy Who Lived would prevent him from being ostracized just to Slytherin as other kids might be.

In place, he would be able to do two important things, and I think he'd intuitively do them as a result of his personality. First, he could reach out to any Slytherins who were even slightly sympathetic to the Light, pulling them further into the good side before Voldemort's return draws the battle line. Additionally, the raw cunning move for many Slytherins around his age at Hogwarts would likely be to ingratiate oneself to him, joining behind him as they do behind Malfoy or did Voldemort, due to his power and status. This might convince even the kids from some darker families to act more neutrally or pro-light purely from self interest. Secondly, helped along by progress in the first task, he would be able to begin rehabilitating Slytherin's image. Cunning and Ambition are not inherently evil and by having the Boy Who Lived providing a human example of this for other Slytherins and potential Slytherins to respect and aspire to, as well as for the other houses to understand. This should ease the connection between the 4 houses, allowing for a more diverse DA, a more diverse resistance against Voldemort and the Death Eaters, and in the best case maybe even the ability for Harry to turn a former Death Eater to the Order by their child's loyalty to him.

Plenty of stories have shown something like this, and for Malfoy as an example I think it can work well. Malfoy initially wants to befriend Harry, likely on his father's instructions and had it not been for Hagrid and Ron's offhand remarks about evil plus Draco's rudeness to Ron he would likely have maintained that goal and approach rather than becoming antagonistic. At 11 years old and too young to remember the War or Voldemort first hand, he is still pliable and naive, so Harry acting as a positive influence on him could well turn the friendship real. From there, it's not till Year 4 that Harry has a direct run in with Voldemort that is kinda expected - Year 1 he expected Snape and would otherwise have expected Quirrel, Year 2 he didn't know who it would be, Year 3 was Sirius - and so Draco could easily be dragged along on the adventures till this point without even having to renounce Blood Purism except to be less loud about it in Harry's earshot. If he is genuinely friends with Harry by now and has had a hand in defeating Voldemort's plans multiple times he is a lot more likely to side with Harry after the Graveyard or equivalent. From there, you have to ask what Lucius and Narcissa would do and for Narcissa at least I think the answer is clear. She'd turn for Draco, as she does later in canon anyway. Lucius would likely be inclined towards this too, if Harry could work with Dumbledore and the Order to provide safety and reward, and if Snape (who would presumably see more of Lily in a Slytherin Slytherin Harry who respects him as Head of his House) is willing to help recruit them, I think that could work.

From there, using Malfoy's influence to spread a similar offer to the rest of the DE's, especially if you could get this started pre-resurrection when some still think he's dead for good and they have nothing to lose by swapping sides, may well turn the tide when Voldemort does return.

How far you think this would go, and how large scale the butterfly effects are from Harry's sorting is up to you of course, but there's a clear path if you want to go for maximum fix-it, and that would certainly qualify as greatness.
