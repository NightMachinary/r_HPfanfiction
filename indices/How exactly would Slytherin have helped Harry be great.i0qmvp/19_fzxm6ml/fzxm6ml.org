Snape wouldn't be so hard on him and maybe Harry would be really good at potions because of it? he did cook for the Dursleys. I think potions is one of the talents Harry could have in canon if JK didn't go for the "power of love" nonsense. lost potential that is.

he wouldn't be ostracized by his house in second book, because Slytherin would think how cool it is to be the heir, nor in fourth year, because Slytherins would think him very Slytherin for managing to fool the goblet. I'm sure they would love to have a Slytherin champion, and they wouldn't be sore about it like Gryffindors were. in fifth, the Slytherins might choose to stay with him instead of siding with Umbridge and they would definitely notify Snape if they notice the blood quill writing (or do something sneaky against it). and if not that, they could moan to their Slytherin parents sitting in the ministry so Umbridge could be out sooner. and let's be honest, McGonnagall wasn't a very good head of house. granted, we don't actually see any other head of house in action so it might be all of them. I think the main thing would be, at least some of the Slytherins would rather follow Harry instead of Tom. be it either by being his friends, or Harry being able to manipulate/talk people out of it.

Harry would become the minister or maybe headmaster. both are better, much greater, jobs than an auror.

I don't think he would be hated in there. the only one making problems would be Draco with his bodyguards, and Pansy, but he could be friends with Blaise. actually other Slytherins weren't really his enemies in canon. maybe except quidditch matches and that's sport.

(He could be the one practicing dancing with Snape before yule ball!!!)
