A few years ago there was this tumblr post about what could have happened if Cassius Warrington, a Slytherin, was chosen to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. It basically theorized that many Slytherins would be affected by his untimely death and mobilize secretly against Voldemort.

What came to mind is that Harry being in Slytherin could inspire many to side with him and change things in the war. He would eventually get to know his Housemates well enough and become another path instead of Voldemort.

Harry could also make friends with people in other Houses and unify the Houses against threats like Umbridge.
