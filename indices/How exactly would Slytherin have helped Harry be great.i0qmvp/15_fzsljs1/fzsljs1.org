I always thought the pitch about greatness was less the Sorting Hat knowing it would make Harry great, and more it testing him, to see how he reacted to the most basic ambition-bait. It was saying any House would work, until Harry brought up Slytherin himself and then it focused on it and poked to see why/why not.

Ultimately, I feel Harry in Slytherin would have fostered his "thirst to prove himself", and he would have been rather like Hermione - studying harder to learn as much as he could to prove he deserved to be there, especially with Malfoy and Snape looking down on him throughout.
