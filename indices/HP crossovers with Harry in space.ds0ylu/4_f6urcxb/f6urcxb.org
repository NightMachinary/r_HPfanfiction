Not actually a crossover until the sequel, but linkffn(The Voyage of the Starship Hedwig) takes Harry into space. Despite giving their ship a cute name, the story itself is anything but; getting into space and colonising another planet is /hard/. Named characters will die. /Species/ will die. And those who survive will not be unscathed.
