Not really focused on space travel as much, but Araceil does alot of decent crossovers, and this one with Avatar is really good: Firefly

"When they went to sleep, they hoped of a better future. But with Gaia insane and Magic as dead as his friends, Harry has no reason to stay. Escape and exist was all he had in mind when he stowed away on a ship to Pandora. Not another war."

It does good with mixing HP-verse magic with Eywa's magic. Give it a try if you haven't :)
