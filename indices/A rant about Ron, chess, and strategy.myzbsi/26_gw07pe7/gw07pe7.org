I'd be surprised if logical ability doesn't help with inventing new strategies or maybe even recognizing the best strategy to use, and memory doesn't help with remembering strategies (either for your own use, or that you've seen the opponent employ) that you've memorized during a match.

But that doesn't mean everyone who is good at one is good at the other, this is true. It just might grant a small bonus to one's chess skill if one is smart... especially if one is figuring it out basically without training.
