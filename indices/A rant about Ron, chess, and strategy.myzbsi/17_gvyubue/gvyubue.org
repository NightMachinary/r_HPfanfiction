I've always been told there were many different kinds of intelligence- social intelligence, problem solving skills, predictive ability, etc.

Chess is primarily a test of your ability to predict and problem solve. Being good at Chess means you can logically go "If I do this, then that might happen, so I should be prepared in case it does."

I don't know if Ron ever shows that ability outside of his chess games in book 1. He may only be good at that kind of thinking within a visual context (e.g. Chess or Checkers). But the relationship between Chess and Intelligence is there 'cause chess does measure your ability to predict.
