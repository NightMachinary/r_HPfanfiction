I generally agree that chess =/= intelligence. HOWEVER, I do want to remark on a caveat.

The first is young kids. Chess is amazingly complex and young kids don't have the patience to learn deep theory yet, they're playing on intuition and some sort of pattern understanding and calculating if this/then that. No one teaches them that, it just clicks for some. Given that Ron is 11 and clearly experienced, we can assume he started playing pretty early on (and winning regularly, they're kids - otherwise you'd have quit by now). Now I'm not saying that kids who don't play chess at a young age are dumb, there's a ton of stuff that goes into who discovers chess. But I do argue that kids that start playing chess that young at a high enough level to best adults cannot be completely stupid. Adults have had time to learn these patterns, kids have not.

It gets trickier when transposing our experience as adults. Even if you're a smart adult - if you're new to chess you don't know the usual traps, etc. You don't know not to accept the poisoned pawn in the Najdorf. Your opponent can be dumb as a rock, but simply be a more studious chess aficionado and they'll likely beat you bloody over the board.

But chess ability is really just chess ability. That doesn't mean you don't learn some valuable things from it. Saccing your queen, but you have forced mate in 6? Doesn't matter, it still feels uncomfortable. Recall Ron immediately understanding during McGonagall's chess match that he's got to sacrifice himself to win and didn't even hesitate? People die and get hurt in war and it demands brutal sacrifices. That's the kind of understanding that I could buy Ron having or coming around to more quickly whereas Hermione would argue that there's got to be another way.

So sure, while we may not have causation - I do accept that Ron's chess ability could contribute to further character development, in line with my argument that based on the context of /when/ Ron began learning chess he cannot be that dull.
