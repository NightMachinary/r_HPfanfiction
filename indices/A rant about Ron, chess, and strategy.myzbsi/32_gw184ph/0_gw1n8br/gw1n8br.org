  But chess ability is really just chess ability. That doesn't mean you don't learn some valuable things from it. Saccing your queen, but you have forced mate in 6? Doesn't matter, it still feels uncomfortable.

Huh? Is that actually something people feel o.O

I admit my chess skills deplorable because I'm playing once every blue moon, but, y'know, they are chess pieces (literally, not figuratively!). If it feels uncomfortable, that's because a powerful piece on the board is gone XD

Anyway, being able to sacrifice /people/ is actually not uncommon. All you need is distance; it gets harder if you have to look them in the eye. Even so, enough people also can do /that/. Whether that is a good thing I'll leave for everyone by themselves to decide ...
