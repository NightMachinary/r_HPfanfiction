Chess has been used as a visual shorthand to show that a character is smart or strategic for decades at this point. So, I don't understand this inability to accept that people want to use this trope in their writing when it has been used by so many different mediums.

It actually makes sense when you look at how impressive Ron's chess match really was. Ron has to protect four pieces at all cost. He's handicapped in ways not normal in chess. These are stone pieces destroying other stone pieces. Ron had to believe that if his friends or himself got hit, they could possibly die. He also has to protect the king for obvious reasons.

Secondly, they are under time constraints as Voldemort is ahead of them and they want to stop him from getting the stone. Ron is under absolutely enormous pressure to win the game as quickly as possible while assuring that his friends or the king don't taking. If Ron gets taken to early, there's no hope at that point. He can't make mistakes, but can't take all day to make decisions. That's a tough game from any perspective.

Ron is not just beating up on Harry as some want to believe. He played an excellent game of chess at age 12.

So if I was a fanfiction author, and I want Ron to have those characteristics, there's evidence that I could go that way. (purely in a literary sense)
