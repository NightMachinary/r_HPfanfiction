But the rules are NOT that all three of them had to play the game. If that were the case, then Quirrelmort wouldn't have had enough people to get through. They could've gone through one at a time as the king. Ron could've dictated moves for each game and if he really were a good chess player they'd all be safe. Having to protect four pieces rather than one (or three) was his choice. And playing the challenge, which was to get through alive, he lost.
