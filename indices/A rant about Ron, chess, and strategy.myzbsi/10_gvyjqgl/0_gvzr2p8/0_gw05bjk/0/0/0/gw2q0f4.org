These are eleven and twelve year old children, not SEAL Team Six. Yes, there was a rush. Yes, someone was ahead of them. Yes, there was need to stop that someone. But that's not a good reason to NEEDLESSLY risk all of their lives by making a game where one piece needs to be protected into a game where FOUR pieces need protection, and where the loss of any one of them might mean one of these children DIES. That's idiotic. He endangered everyone. He made a small risk into a huge risk all in the name of speed, for something that wasn't their responsibility to stop, and for which not stopping it had equal or less risk than what he did. If they failed, MAYBE Voldemort gets a body back. MAYBE he wages war again (the responsibility of their adult guardians!). MAYBE is not a reason to risk your own life and that of your friends.
