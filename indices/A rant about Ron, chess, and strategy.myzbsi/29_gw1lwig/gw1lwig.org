Well, in the first place I don't think Ron is an amazing chess player to begin with. He's good. That's all. Why is that not good enough, and he must be some super genius? He works fine without that.

Anyway, but that aside -- I don't think I'm entirely discarding the chess <--> intelligence link. Anyone who has an amazing talent and is proficient in something without much trying already at a young age is highly intelligent. Mozart for music, Gauss for mathematics, and people like Carlsen in chess. Those aren't average people. Anyone can't do what they do, even if they try their entire life.

But of course, that has nothing to do with chess in particular, and even less with strategy. No offence to him, but if there ever is a war here (let's hope not), I'd prefer an experienced general over Carlsen at the helm :P
