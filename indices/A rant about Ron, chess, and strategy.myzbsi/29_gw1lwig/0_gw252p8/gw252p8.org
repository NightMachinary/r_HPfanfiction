  Anyone who has an amazing talent and is proficient in something without much trying already at a young age is highly intelligent.

There's zero evidence that Ron has "an amazing talent"; he's better than other 11-year-olds at a game he plays a lot and they don't. That's not amazing at all. It's to be expected. And since he does play a lot, you can't say "without much trying". He practices chess a lot, so he's better at chess than his peers. It's that simple.
