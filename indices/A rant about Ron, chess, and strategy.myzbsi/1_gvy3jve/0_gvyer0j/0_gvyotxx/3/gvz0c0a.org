  But if used in its common way, there's no proof that being good at chess means that one is intelligent, makes one intelligent, or is caused by being intelligent. They're just two markers that frequently but not always go together.

But they frequently go together for a reason, no?

  "Often linked" is correlation, though, not causation.

Why do you think that is (genuinely curious)? I was always under the impression that a lot of the skills gained from chess could be helpful in other subject areas. For instance, according to OP, "chess is mainly a game of pattern recognition," and being able to recognize patterns is a very useful skill to have in mathematics.

  There's a HUGE difference between beating children at a game that you love and they tolerate vs. being a world grandmaster. So the debate, if such it is, about Ron's intelligence due to his being able to beat Harry, an abused orphan, at a game he had to TEACH Harry... shouldn't be a debate at all.

I never brought up Ron in my comment at all, so I'm not sure why you're bringing him up. I will, however, say that Ron not only beat Harry, but often Hermione (someone who was /not/ an abused orphan or taught chess by Ron) as well.
