  Because this post is about Ron? It's in the OP at the top of the thread.

The post may be about Ron, but my comment wasn't. It was a general statement about chess. I do, however, now understand why you commented about Ron, so thanks for clearing that up!

  When I was 8 years old I was beating high school kids, but that doesn't causally make them dumber than me.

No, but I'm guessing that that makes you better than them at chess? 'Intelligent' and 'dumb' are both broad terms. So, if Person A is better than Person B at chess, then there's a good chance that Person A has developed more skills (like pattern recognition) that are considered 'smart' than Person B.
