Yeah, I wouldn't use the "defense for a very valuable item" as a benchmark given that a) the teacher in question wasn't there (it was an automated system), b) in general ALL of the defenses sucked, and c) someone had already bludgeoned their way through.

The only trial that was difficult even for children was getting the key. Any half-competent upper-year would simply blow a hole in the door, use the broom provided for the key trial to fly over the chess set and past the troll, and then blow a hole in the wall next to the big flaming doorway. Those trials were intentionally weak, to the point that even first-years didn't have much trouble with them, so using them as a benchmark for skill is a bit disingenuous.

Also... Ron only won by SACRIFICING HIMSELF. It wasn't a one-on-one game. It was a one-on-three game that he technically lost.
