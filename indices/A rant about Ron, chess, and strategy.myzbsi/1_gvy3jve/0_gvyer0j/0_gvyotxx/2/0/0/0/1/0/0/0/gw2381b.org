1. So what? If the argument is that he's great at chess, you can't turn around and say that he's not great at chess because he's 11. He either is or is not great at it. This isn't Schroedinger's Chessman.

2. They know that someone had already gone through. The harp to put Fluffy to sleep. The lame key. The fact that the chess set was set up for a new game is proof that it resets.

3. That's true, but nothing says they all had to go on. This is where the lack of wisdom really comes in; Ron risked all of their lives needlessly in order to get more of them through than necessary. And this gets back to the whole "he's 11" issue; they thought they were chasing a bad guy trying to steal something and suddenly they're all child soldiers risking their lives on a battlefield. It's a fairy tale, but it's not evidence of wisdom! He's risking their lives, not their grades, at ELEVEN. On purpose.
