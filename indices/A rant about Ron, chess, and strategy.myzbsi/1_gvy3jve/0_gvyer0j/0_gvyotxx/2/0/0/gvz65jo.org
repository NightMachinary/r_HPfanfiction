  Also... Ron only won by SACRIFICING HIMSELF. It wasn't a one-on-one game. It was a one-on-three game that he technically lost.

But wasn't Ron telling Harry and Hermione where their pieces went? IIRC, Harry and Hermione were just following along. And in a game of chess, you're going to have to sacrifice pieces, so Ron sacrificing himself hardly means they 'lost'.
