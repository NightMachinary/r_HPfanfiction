Well, the scene doesn't really make any sense outside of a plot standpoint (why none of them replaced the King since he must always be protected? Did they really have to be all three of them on the board rather than watching from the side . . .).

But there is one thing that is made pretty clear in the book. Ron had a big disadvantage because he had to protect 4 pieces rather than just one (the King). If the party had be played "as intended" with only Ron on the board, he would not have had this disadvantage and would not have been forced to sacrifice himself.
