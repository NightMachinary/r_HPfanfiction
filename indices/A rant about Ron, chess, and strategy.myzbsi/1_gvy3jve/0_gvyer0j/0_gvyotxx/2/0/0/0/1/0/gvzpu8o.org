Like I said above, Ron should know that. He could've had Harry as the king, and called out the orders from the side for Harry to repeat. If he were good at chess, and had the goal of getting Harry through, that's what he'd have done. Then reset the board, play with Hermione as king. Instead they play with NOBODY as king, and three endangered pieces in addition to the king. That's just dumb, and someone good at chess wouldn't have done that. We're TOLD that he's good at chess, but when it matters he doesn't really show it.
