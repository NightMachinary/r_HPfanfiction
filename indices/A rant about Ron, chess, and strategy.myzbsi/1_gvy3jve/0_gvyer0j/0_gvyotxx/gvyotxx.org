"Often linked" is correlation, though, not causation. Also, "intelligent" is an overused blanket term anyway. But if used in its common way, there's no proof that being good at chess means that one is intelligent, makes one intelligent, or is caused by being intelligent. They're just two markers that frequently but not always go together.

Now, absolute top-level chess players are almost invariably intelligent, or at least calculate variables very quickly. But nobody's saying that Ron's at that level. There's a HUGE difference between beating children at a game that you love and they tolerate vs. being a world grandmaster. So the debate, if such it is, about Ron's intelligence due to his being able to beat Harry, an abused orphan, at a game he had to TEACH Harry... shouldn't be a debate at all.
