I suppose this really depends on how you define intelligence. Do you think people that are good at math are more intelligent?

Of course is silly to think all chess players are smart it is also silly not to recognise that a lot of chess players are smart. I don't think is purely a cultural assumption or social behaviour, it has to do with the abilities chess demands and develop.

You say it's only pattern recognition but pattern recognition and good memory are two of the biggest markers of high intelligence.
