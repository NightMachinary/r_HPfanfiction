I agree to an extent. Intelligence is definitely a strong factor in making someone good at chess. Being intelligent is being good at problem solving, which chess needs, and the more intelligent you are the likelier you can solve chess problems. Its just not all about intelligence, but also as you said pattern recognition, along with a great memory, and a good attention span/focus.
