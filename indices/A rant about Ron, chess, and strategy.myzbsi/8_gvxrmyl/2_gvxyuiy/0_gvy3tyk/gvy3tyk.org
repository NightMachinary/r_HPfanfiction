Nothing wrong with liking a character, but I see alot in this sub that have gone to extremes. Many are now no different than the people that justify Snape abusing his students/joining Voldemort. Ron is a fictional character written to be flawed; he's not your ailing mother that you have to defend to the death from every ill word spoken.

I mean, JKR wrote Hermione to be a self-insert/Mary-Sue, and it's irritating to see Harmony shippers magnify that. She wrote Ron to be 'normal' and have several negative traits. You're still allowed to like him and accept his character as a whole, warts and all.
