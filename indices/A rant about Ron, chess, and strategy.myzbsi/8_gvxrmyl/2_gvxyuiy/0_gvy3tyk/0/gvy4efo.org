I agree that it is 100 % fair to have good criticism of Ron.

But problem is 99 % of the time I see this 'criticism', it is just borderline bashing or removing all context from any given situation to make Ron look worse than he is.

famous example? Ron leaving in DH.\\
Was he in the wrong for leaving? yes.\\
Did he 'abandon Harry and Hermione and leave them alone to face this task all on their own, being disloyal' like many like to claim? No, and anyone who says that needs to re-read the books and get their facts straight.

1) It was Harry who told him to go away.\\
2) Ron wanted to come back immediately, he literally just left before the influence of the horcrux disappeared and he tried to get back, but was stopped by Snatchers. It was basically the equivalent of leaving the room in a fit of anger to clear your head.
