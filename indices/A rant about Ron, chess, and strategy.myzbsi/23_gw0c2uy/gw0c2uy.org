Apparently, I have an above-average IQ. Some of my behaviours (especially regarding social issues and cues) sometimes make me wonder if I'm actually on the Spectrum somewhere (a long story), or if my brain is just wired differently in a few areas.

Anyway, it's nothing too amazing like you'd expect on hearing that, but apparently it was enough to get me placed with like six other people I knew to do another, more complicated exam after I and the rest of my year-mates finished the normal exam.

I thought we were in trouble after they shuffled us into an unused classroom somewhere, lol.

I was also assigned to a Professor along with a few of that group that also taught the year below us, and we often had separate assignments from everyone else (freaking algebra when I was like 10, which I was shit at, haha) in our year, who were in the other class next door.

Apparently, I also unnerve people sometimes by being able to watch a movie or episode or something (or read a book) and 'map' how it's going to end very early on, including its plot-twists, et cetera, with reasonable accuracy based on what's shown at that point. I think it may be some sort of "pattern recognition" thing going on since a lot of books/movies/shows use a format that's pretty common (such as the Hero's Journey).

I'm like that with words in the English language, too (apparently that baffled my English teachers, when I was a kid, haha).

Art too was another odd thing: I used to colour in my workbooks (which annoyed the teachers) after finishing my assignments a lot earlier than my peers, and I liked to paint (really crude) landscape copies when I was like 4--8.

When I play RTS games, I'm a reactionary player to the other players' moves or the team-player that creates supporting attacks/moves to my allies' assaults, and that's how I often win, if I don't get the shit kicked out me first.

Now, you may think I'm bragging or something, or you may be confused why I'm giving a brief life-lesson about my past.

Here's the kicker: I know how to play chess. I know how the pieces move. I can think several moves ahead and anticipate what the other player would do if I do X, Y, and Z...

*But holy shit am I terrible at it.*

Seriously, I'm awful at it. I expect I would be at checkers or any other board game like it, too.

It's one reason why I cringe (trope aside) when I see Ron being a strategic mastermind, helping to win the war against Voldemort, in fiction... because he's average at chess?

smh
