  The latter article argue that chess does not necessarily make people smarter, but rather attracts more intelligent people.

This is exactly the reason. A lot of people go into chess because they're smart and chess is a 'smart person game'.

In fact, this is exactly why I started playing originally. I thought I was pretty smart and I wanted to break other people's egos. But people who aren't conventionally 'smart' can be really good at chess too.

I don't have the time to go over your sources, but here's what I can say based on what you posted.

There are people smarter than me who are worse than me, and people stupider than me who are stronger than me. The most reliable predictor of chess strength is practice+play time. Not intelligence.

And chess strength is not a good predictor for intelligence. I'd be interested to see if there was a study comparing intelligence by chess rating. I find it highly doubtful that a higher rating is correlated at all with a higher intelligence.
