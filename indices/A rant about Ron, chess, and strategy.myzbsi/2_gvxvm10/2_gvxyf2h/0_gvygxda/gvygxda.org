I think I'm actually reasonably smart. I worked in engineering-related research and did quite well in my job. But holy shite I am horrendously bad at chess. Not just chess but high level pattern recognition in general. Sudoku, checkers, chess, Rubik's cubes, even freaking Connect 4 will trip me up because I have a tendency to focus on very small and specific parts of the game board. It makes me look really stupid because I simply can't look at the overall picture of anything and figure out what I'm supposed to do next.

But when I do focus on "that one specific thing" I'm really really good at it. I can find virtually every single thing that can go wrong with it and potential fixes for it. It's very straightforward to me. Just don't ask me to do pattern recognition of any kind because I /will/ fail at it and get very frustrated with the situation.
