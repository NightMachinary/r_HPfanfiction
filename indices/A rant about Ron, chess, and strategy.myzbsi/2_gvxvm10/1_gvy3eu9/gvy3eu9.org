The main thing is we can't even ascertain that Ron is that good a chess player, we don't know McGonnagal's rating, and the only person he plays consistently that we know the results is Harry, who doesn't care too much about it.

We also rarely see Ron display strategic abilities that much in the series.

He seems to know a lot about Quidditch tactics though.

But the principles of chess hardly applies to the small unit tactics we see in the series, and the other more subtle aspects require more introspection than Ron has ever shown.

If anything the only one who seems to grasp those is Dumbledore.
