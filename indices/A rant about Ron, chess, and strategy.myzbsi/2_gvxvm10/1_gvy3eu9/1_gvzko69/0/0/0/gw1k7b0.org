It has been years since I read the books, and now I am even angrier at the movies because I realize even more of how they gave his scenes and lines to Hermione, I was pretty sure the fire was Hermione's idea.

And that Harry figured the parselmouth thing by himself.

> he is also the one who steps in front of Harry to defend him against Sirius Black while Harry is frozen by anger and Hermione by fear;

Don't know if that was how it played out, everyone was kind of in shock, and I don't think Hermione would have thought about placing herself in front of Harry, instead of pulling him away, I don't know if that was tactically sound AT ALL it was more of a desperate/bravery thing.

> he opened the Chamber of Secrets, without being a Parselmouth, while a big-ass battle was going on;

Now, that's just bad writing, it makes no sense in or out of universe for parseltongue to be a regular language and not something magical, the first reason being that snakes can't hear.
