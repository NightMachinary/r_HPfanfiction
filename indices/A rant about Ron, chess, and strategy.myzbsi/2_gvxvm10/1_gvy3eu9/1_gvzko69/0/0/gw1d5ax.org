  Ron often panics.

That's not true. Ron is most of the time pretty level headed and can think on his feet:

He is the one who has the idea about using Wingardium Leviosa on the Troll;

he is the one who thinks about using magic to conjure fire against the Devil Snare;

he is the one who figures out that Harry has to use Parseltongue to open the chamber;

he is also the one who steps in front of Harry to defend him against Sirius Black while Harry is frozen by anger and Hermione by fear;

he is the one who tricks the Inquisitorial Squad so they get free and help to Harry and Hermione;

he saved Harry from drowning and got the Sword of Gryffindor while he was at that;

he opened the Chamber of Secrets, without being a Parselmouth, while a big-ass battle was going on;
