  *The only thing your chess ability measures is your chess ability. Not intelligence or strategy or anything else. Chess is not a representation of war. It is a board game.*

That's not exactly what science says.

  Expert chess players display above-average intelligence.

  Playing strength in chess is related to general cognitive abilities.

  "[...]several studies employing psychometric tests of intelligence have revealed that expert chess players display significantly higher intelligence than controls and that their playing strength is related to their intelligence level. In addition, [...] it has been found that both, expertise and intelligence impact on the performance in expertise-related tasks."

  Several research teams have tried to find out by administering various cognitive tests. Reviewing these studies in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science in 2011, the psychologists Guillermo Campitelli and Fernand Gobet concluded that tournament chess players score higher on tests of intelligence than do comparable nonplayers.

  In a paper this year in the journal Intelligence , the psychologists Alexander Burgoyne and David Hambrick analyzed the results of 19 studies, involving a total of nearly 1,800 chess players, that correlated IQ scores with skill ratings. They found that stronger chess players tend to score higher than weaker ones, and that this was especially true of newer players and younger players.

The latter article argue that chess does not necessarily make people smarter, but rather attracts more intelligent people.
