I would definitely agree with you in chess not making Ron a master strategist by default. Also on chess making you "intelligent".

However... There are two things to consider.

1) Chess is not just any board game, as you put it. A chess master learns skills that a master hungry hungry hippos will not. There is some pattern recognition, I won't deny that. But do you know how many possible combinations can be? No one can memorize them all. So, why I wouldn't say chess makes you a master strategist, it does allow great practice in pattern recognition (unsurprisingly), awareness, planning (it's not just about recognizing pattern but on how you're going to counteract said patterns) and thinking ahead. It should also make you develop your intuitive skills.

2) There's a concept of multiple intelligences, and while chess might not develop your arithmetic ones, it can help you with logic and spacial thinking.

So in summary. It doesn't make Ron a master strategist. Chess doesn't translate nowhere near to exactly to real life. But it is a valuable skill that should give Ron a boost in awareness and intuition if he can recognize when to approach something as he approaches chess.
