I think you think people only get good at chess by sitting down and reading it or playing it like an AI. I'm pretty decent at chess and have done ok at tournaments and lead winning chess teams. I've never read a chess book, I don't know any fancy chess move names and I don't go by pattern recognition. I think your "method" of getting better at chess assumes that a fairly freeform game can have no creativity to it and that's just wrong. You can be good at chess by planning a new strategy baded on a situation you don't need to have seen a "pattern" before to make progress.
