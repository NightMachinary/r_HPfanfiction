You think wrong. I don't know where you're getting such ideas from. I never said that. You're just inventing viewpoints and saying I have them.

Are you telling that in none of your games you've thought of something or seen something because it happened in a previous game? That's what I mean by pattern recognition. Whether you can name those ideas is irrelevant.

If you're saying that you've never done that, then you're either really weak or have played really few games.
