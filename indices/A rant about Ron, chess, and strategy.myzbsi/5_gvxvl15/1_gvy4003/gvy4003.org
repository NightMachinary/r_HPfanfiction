We don't know Ron's "chess level", all we know is that he wins against Harry who most of the time is not even trying and playing either to pass the time or to humor Ron. The match in PS shows nothing because if we equate to the average level of the other obstacles it's a joke.

Ron doesn't show some of the other skills needed to apply principles of chess on RL strategy, like perceptiveness and logic skills.
