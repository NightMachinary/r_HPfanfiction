For me personally, chess is one of the few times Rowling gave readers "evidence" of Ron's intelligence. Not saying that chess= super smart, but it's a shorthand thats easily understood in children's books. I remember vague mentions of him using strategy in Quidditch, when he was on the team. So, when I'm writing Ron I try to hone in on specific traits- chess, strategy, and growing up in the wizarding world. He most likely knows a lot of cultural issues that Harry and Hermione never even think about.

Like other commenters have mentioned, it's possible that Rowling is using chess to display Ron's intelligence early on. Although it does grate on me, that this characteristic is never developed. Chess and love of Quidditch tactics could have easily developed into traits more useful in a war. It seems like all the groundwork was laid, then never utilized.

Rowling uses Hermione's traits to help them prepare to go one the run, I was always quite disappointed that Ron didn't play a larger role in DH.

I'd love to read something cracky where chess and Quidditch strategy has nothing to do with it, he learned hit-and-run tactics by living with Fred and George. That's the true survival game.
