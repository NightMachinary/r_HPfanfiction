Chess certainly doesn't have any connection to being good at strategy and tactics. Napoleon, for example, was a very mediocre chess player, despite his interest in the game.

Chess is a game with a rigid structure of simple rules. One piece can move per turn. Each piece can only move in certain specified ways. You can see all your opponents pieces. At any given time, you know exactly what your options are and exactly what your opponent's options are. Everything is very straightforward and predictable

Actual warfare is far from straightforward and predictable, and there are no rules, beyond the laws of physics (people invent laws of war, but don't necessarily follow them). Instead of one move per turn, everything is happening at once. You can't even see all your own "pieces" correctly, let alone the whole state of the board. You cannot rely on your pieces achieving what you want, or even having the right capabilities at a given time. You can't rely on being able to communicate with them precisely, or them obeying the orders in precisely the way you want. The combat pieces have to be served by a whole logistical network. Instead of a flat, even surface, you're faced with a huge variety of terrain, fortifications, and weather conditions, which will have huge effects on the outcome. You may not be in ultimate control of all your pieces, some of which might belong to your allies. And so on, and so on. Modern militaries have developed sophisticated ways to deal with all of these, but even if you're lucky enough to have access to all that organisational infrastructure, it's an incredibly complex undertaking
