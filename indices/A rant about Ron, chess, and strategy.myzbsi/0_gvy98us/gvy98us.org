This is irrelevant, but now I want a stupid crack-fic where Ron Weasley decides to hone in on chess after his first year, and runs off to muggle London with the help of his muggle-obsessed father to try to become the next grandmaster over the following summer. He comes back during second year still being pretty Ron Weasley about everything. But maybe he throws chess pieces at Malfoy or something lol
