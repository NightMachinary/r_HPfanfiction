This exactly! I've seen comments both about how Ron must be smart and the “plot hole” of Hermione being the “brightest witch of her age” but not being good at chess. One specifically was talking about how she couldn't do the giant chess set, but then gets to Snape's logic puzzle and was suddenly smart again or something like that. I was like... but those are...entirely different skill sets?!!?!

Like, I myself am good at logic puzzles and school in general, but I'm absolute /pants/ at chess. Granted, I'm not interested in chess, so it's not like I've tried to become a good player, but Hermione doesn't seem interested in chess either. And, while Ron being both great a chess and an absolute bumbling idiot don't mesh, neither does that mean that he could get just as good of grades as Hermione if he put in the same effort she did (either a post or comment I saw about both Ron and Harry). I wholeheartedly agree that he could get /better/ marks if he were more studious, but on Hermione's level? No. I'm sorry, but she's not going to be /repeatedly/ referred to as the brightest witch of her age just because she gets top marks.
