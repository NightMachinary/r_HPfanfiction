It measures adaptability and creativeness in situations though, and Ron is a very adaptable dude. You can memorize a lot of the positions from the board using the engine(well since we are talking about the nineties then the book, since engines were popularized in the XXI century after all => and chess had a slightly different main-line in the last century than it is today though, cause people didn't have computers or engines to determine the best possible move in exact position at any given time, and that precise and that quick => and even the engine is sometimes bonkers and has a completely inhuman way of developing, hence why it's only good to look for broadening your horizons, but not to blindly follow it). Learning chess now is quicker than back then due to improvement of technology and easier access to material. And as a modern chess player, today mostly is thought that accurate moves = engine moves, but back in the nineties you still had to be a little more creative while studying. So if we use the timeline back then (since HP is set in the nineties, and neither Muggles or wizards didn't have an engine or anything computerlike to use). So, in a way, it meant more strategizing, adaptibility and creativity than pattern recognition, back then then now. That still doesn't mean Ron is a ultra mega giga god strategist, by any means

Adaptability is a trait most strategists use, cause they need to know their armies and field to certain extent on how to place formations and when. BUT that does not mean that every chess player is a good strategist. It takes creativity to use it the best possible way your adversary can't respond to gain board presence/to break even or even win(like not using the first best move, instead use the fifth or sixth or completely something entirely new to throw them off their rockers). As far as you probably know, Magnus makes some "unconventional" moves in his games(unconventional for an engine and the mainline).

Just playing with a defect start is really a hard thing to do, and Ron had a big minus in material (that being he couldn't use Harry, Hermione or the King to their full intent because losing either of them is bad, the latter being the main piece anyways, and he couldn't sacrifice Harry and Hermione). If you pull a game without being able to use the full extent of your bishop, rook and knight, you are surely a good player (now that you mention it I would like a chess mod where you select three figures where you can only sacrifice one and that only when it's mate #1, and if the other two get eaten before that, you lose the game).
