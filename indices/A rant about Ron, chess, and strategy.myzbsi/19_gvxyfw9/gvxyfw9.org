I got a trophy in middle school at a chess tournament. I am very stupid, too. Also I'm not even that good at chess? I engage in what I call "the ape game", by which I mean my strategy consists of making absurd sacrifices without even blinking to unnerve my opponents. They'll think "Okay, I'll move my bishopto this position where it is threatened by my opponent's bishop but protected by my pawn" and I'll say "TRADE OFFER".
