Yup. Beating harry is no measure of strength. Harry could be the worst player in history and Ron could be the second worst.

In the movie though, the chess game that Ron played with McGonagall's set was consulted on by International Master Jeremy Silman, and according to Silman he made the game for a Ron who was at the strength of 2200 at age 11. Really strong, but there have been people who are better. R Praggnanandhaa for example was 2400 at age 9 if I remember correctly.
