Never understood that Harry is unreliable he's never played wizarding chess or probably muggle chess before so if Ron beats him all the time it doesn't mean he's an expert on chess. Ron did win the giant chess match at the end of first year but It was against charms not another person and it was just one time. If you win one match that doesn't mean anything. Wish we heard/saw Ron in a chess club winning a few to really say he's good or even an expert on chess.
