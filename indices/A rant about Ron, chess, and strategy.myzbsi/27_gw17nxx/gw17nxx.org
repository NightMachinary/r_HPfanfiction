I think the issue really lies in what is "smart" and what is "intelligent". As some people have pointed out before, a lot of Hermione's behaviour points more to studious than intelligent. I don't think she's stupid - I actually think she /is/ intelligent. But the fact that she does well in school doesn't = intelligence. This is true in the real world. Lots of "average" people do well in school because they work hard (plus multiple other factors, like they know how to ask for help, and there's supports in place, etc, etc).

The same for Ron. I honestly think he's smart. He does above average at school. He's not emotionally intelligent, but he's not exactly below average there for a boy of his age.

And being good at chess doesn't = being intelligent in many ways, /but/ it means you're either instinctively good at recognising patterns or you've put in a lot of work (or both). There's a reason why chess is part of the smart culture - because pattern recognition is an uncommon skill that can be incredibly useful. Does it mean you're intelligent in every way? No of course not. But there are few smart people who are "smart in every way."

It seems like a lot of Ron's chess ability comes down to having done it for years, and an enthusiasm for it that was presumably encouraged by his parents/family. But if he can use that skillset to defeat adults at age eleven, then yes, he is smart. Or lucky - but the two are often mistaken for each other in the real world as well.
