Yeah, all this “Ron is good at chess so he must be good at military strategy” makes as much sense as “Ron is good at chess so he must be good at playing oboe.” These are all different skills, requiring different types of intelligence. Intelligence isn't just one thing. There are also different kinds of stupidity, which is an independent variable from intelligence.

That said, being good at chess shows that at least he has some kind of intelligence, which is better than having none.
