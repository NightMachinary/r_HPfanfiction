You're not wrong. But you're not right either. Generally chess players /are/ more intelligent. The game prizes the skills of memory, pattern recognition, imagination, and creativity (in formulating combined attacks). All mental skills, none physical, dexterous, vocal, empathic or charismatic. Hence people who tend to enjoy chess will also tend to be more mentally-oriented, by nature and nurture. (Conversely, people who enjoy boxing are more likely to be more physically-oriented.) And such people tend to be better strategists (within certain limitations but let's not go there...)

Also, you have to take Ron's chess in context: It could well be that JKR is making use of this common trope to signal that Ron is intelligent. This doesn't necessarily mean that JKR herself believes that chess-playing means you're smart. But it is what the average reader might think. Therefore it's quick writer's shorthand for "this guy is smart, in this way."

It's also well-balanced out by Ron being an average performer nearly everywhere else, and having the "emotional range of a teaspoon".

In my fanon I like to give Ron the role of the strategist whenever I can. It was his very unique contribution to the very first adventure, back in PS; it should be his unique contribution later as well. (As well as being the "heart" of the team. But that's another story...)
