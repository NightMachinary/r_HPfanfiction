In fairness, it's not just the chess thing that makes people think Ron is clever in a strategic way. He also has an incredibly developed understanding of sports tactics (well ok one sport, but wizards do seem to only have the one) for someone his age. And don't forget the "good at chess ergo smart" trope doesn't come from him beating Harry. It comes from him beating McGonagall's giant chess set- a set she was so confident was unbeatable she uses it to defend a priceless artefact from Voldemort.

You say all chess is is pattern recognition and you're right, to an extent. But there's also space for human error, creativity, and switching of tactics. No one just plays an entire game of chess by using an existing tactic, plan, or pattern- because if you do that your opponent will twig what you're about and you'll lose. The tactics in chess come from recognising your opponents habits and weaknesses and using those to beat them. Ditto sport tactics. And guess what? These are transferable skills into strategic planning, policing, military exercises, political campaigns and so on, which is what most "King of Strategy Ron" fics focus on.

Being an excellent strategist doesn't make one book smart, or even traditional clever. No one would ever cast Ron Weasley as a nerd or an academic, no matter how much chess he plays. But strategy, seeing the larger picture? Yeah he can do that- and someone has to. Hermione is doubtlessly the "smart one" but she gets bogged down in minutiae, tiny detail, and is liable to be sidetracked by information that although very interesting is not pertinent- she wants to know everything, she's a traditional academic, and, speaking as a traditional academic, we are not the best at big picture, we get very focused on niche interests. Harry is also, probably, smarter than Ron. But Harry's intelligence is people skills. He can read people, he is reactive to situations and he thinks fast on his feet.

Basically, there are many kinds of "clever" and the trio all have different kinds of intelligence. Hermione is book smart, as evidenced by her love of books. Harry is instinct smart, as evidenced by his ability at Defence/combat magic and also how he either takes to things instantly (flying) or fails dramatically at them (occlusion). Ron /is/ strategy smart- evidenced by his understanding of games like chess and quidditch that rely on tactics, but also by, for example, his ability to gather evidence. When he walks away in DH, what does he do? Goes and ingratiates himself with Bill, to find more out re the Order, the War, and to be able to return with more information and sight of the bigger picture- tbh you could argue it was this lack of sight of a bigger picture, the blundering around blind, that pissed him off so much and yes, Horcrux exposure, but the Horcrux only magnifies what is already there...
