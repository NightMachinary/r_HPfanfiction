  As for habits and weaknesses of the opponent, those don't really matter unless you're both either very weak or very strong (top 20 in the world strong).

Respectfully disagree. If you notice that someone is playing to a specific habit or favours a specific way of play, if you're good enough you can use it against them and beat them. If you know your friend favours a specific style of play, you can exploit that when you play them.

  What I'm saying is that no matter how good he is at chess, it doesn't mean he is a genius.

Absolutely, he's not. As I said, no one in their right mind would cast Ron as a genius or even an all rounder. But he is clearly better than average at tactical things, and it's perfectly realistic in fic to develop that talent and have Ron able, with the right encouragement, to turn it to real world applications. Of course anyone who goes down the "he's smarter than Hermione because she can't play chess" route is, frankly, demented. But it's a sign that Ron has a specific type of intelligence, he definitely has a talent for something that involves thought, memory and recognition and the ability to use those things to his advantage.

Half the problem with the kind of fics you're rallying against are that they think there's only one type of intelligence- book smart- and because Ron has shown talent in something associated with clever he must be secretly book smart. And that is, as you rightly say, nonsense!
