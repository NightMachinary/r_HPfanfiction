  If you notice that someone is playing to a specific habit or favours a specific way of play, if you're good enough you can use it against them and beat them. If you know your friend favours a specific style of play, you can exploit that when you play them.

Well, if you're talking about opening preparation, then certainly. But except that, what do you mean by 'specific ways to play'? You play the position, not the opponent. Players can be more aggressive or more defensive, more tactical or more positional, but does this really give you an edge?
