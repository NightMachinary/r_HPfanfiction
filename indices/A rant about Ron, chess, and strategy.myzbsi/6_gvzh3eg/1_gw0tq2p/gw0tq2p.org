  You say all chess is is pattern recognition and you're right, to an extent. But there's also space for human error, creativity, and switching of tactics. No one just plays an entire game of chess by using an existing tactic, plan, or pattern- because if you do that your opponent will twig what you're about and you'll lose. The tactics in chess come from recognising your opponents habits and weakness...

As I said in the post, I'm vastly oversimplifying.

Yes, no one plays an entire game with just pattern recognition. You have to calculate and plan and strategize. I'm not denying that. What I'm saying is that no matter how good he is at chess, it doesn't mean he is a genius.

As for habits and weaknesses of the opponent, those don't really matter unless you're both either very weak or very strong (top 20 in the world strong).
