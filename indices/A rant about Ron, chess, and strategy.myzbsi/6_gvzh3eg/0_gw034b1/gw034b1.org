Does Ron actually have an incredibly developed understanding of Quidditch tactics? I thought it was mostly him being good at recognising when some tactics are being played out, but I don't recall whether he was good at more than just recognising them (granted, I need to reread book 6 and book 4, where it'd probably be most detailed). But also, his faith and support for the Chudley Cannons is a bit against him. I guess it could be the same as an otherwise intelligent person being blind to their own biases.
