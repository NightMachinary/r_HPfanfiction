I'm pretty sure it needs some smarts to be really good at chess. Ron knows more than just the rules- they all know the rules. However I agree, that you don't need to be a genius. After all Ron plays a lot. He probably knows about a lot of common mistakes people make that he can Exploit, and technically he could just know a few good strategies by heart and hope that Harry who's a beginner doesn't know how to counter them.

I mean sometimes I can google a easy chess strategy and play it against my father who's a lot smarter than me. But since he doesn't know it (we don't play that much chess) he'll Fall for it. But then he knows about it and won't Fall for it again any time soon.
