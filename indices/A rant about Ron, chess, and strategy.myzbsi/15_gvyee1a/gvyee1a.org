Yup, I agree. In actuality, chess is not really a good indication of intelligence past, well, being good at chess. Chess players might be self-selected for certain types of intelligence (after all, enjoying that type of game isn't /everyone's/ cup of tea), but it's not on its own a perfect indicator. Likewise for strategy - strategic thinking in chess will obviously be different from in other situations.

However, as visual shorthand/in our culture, being a good chess player has fallen into that 'intelligent' and 'strategic' bucket. If we see a character in a movie be an expert at chess, we (as the audience) can infer that they're meant to be smart and strategic - even if the work isn't directly saying that.

When it comes to Ron, I personally think that the interest in having him be smarter/more strategic is less of a 'this is how he was in-universe', and more of a 'what-if we made him be better at those things?', which is interesting to explore.
