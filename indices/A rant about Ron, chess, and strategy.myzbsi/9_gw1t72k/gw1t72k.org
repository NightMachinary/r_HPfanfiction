I dunno man. My dad hit USCF GM back in the day and all his chess buddies are smart as hell. So were their spouses and children. Almost universally high achievers all around. I did decent at tournaments and chess clubs back in the day.

Anecdotes aren't data, correlation != causation, etc. but I'd say two things. The average non-chess nerd is usually terrible at chess, and it doesn't take much ability or intelligence to stomp 99.9% of the population. But to be good by chess nerd standards? Nah , you gotta be smart.

Granted. We don't know how Ron would fare at tournaments and being great at chess doesn't require you to be a polymath type person(my dad's language skills are garbage).

I definitely agree with you that skill is more indicative of how much you've studied chess, rather than how smart you are(assuming your play is disciplined). I also think there is also a a fairly low ceiling for people who aren't â€˜academically gifted', let's say.

Hogwarts is small enough an utterly mediocre chess nerd would stomp. So hard to get a feel for Ron off of that as well.
