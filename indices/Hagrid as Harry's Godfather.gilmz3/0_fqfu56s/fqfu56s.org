The problem here is that if Hagrid was so inclined, he could have done this anyways. He KNEW where Harry was, hell, he took him there. The problem here is that Dumbledore wouldn't let anyone check up on Harry and just said he was fine, and Minerva and Hagrid just accepted this as gospel and left him there with barely a word to the Dursleys telling them to knock it off. Just as they did once they KNEW that the Dursleys were all but abusing Harry once he was reintroduced into the world.. Hagrid would never go against Dumbles.
