I agree that Hagrid wouldn't directly defy Dumbledore. Buuuut he doesn't go out of his way to tell Dumbledore about baby Norbert, does he? He found Aragog a mate and raised "werewolf cubs" under his bed because he's sympathetic to the plights of creatures he thinks are misunderstood.

I could see godfather!Hagrid checking on Harry in one of two ways. A, he could hear Dumbledore's instructions about the Dursleys raising him and no contact with wizards, wholeheartedly agree, and then simply /not realize/ it applied to him too. "He said no wizards, but I'm not some random wizard, I'm family. I'll let the Dursleys raise him like Dumbledore said and just check in on the wee mite now and again."

B, Hagrid could publicly agree to what Dumbledore said and then privately justify it to himself using mental gymnastics. "Well, this doesn't count as contact" and "Dumbledore's busy, I won't bother him" and "Christmas is an exception to normal rules" and "I'm sure Dumbledore would agree if he knew so I'll just save the hassle of actually asking" etc. Etc.
