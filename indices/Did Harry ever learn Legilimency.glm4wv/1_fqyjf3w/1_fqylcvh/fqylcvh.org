According to the wiki Bella taught Draco. Which I think at this point is established canon. She had no way to each Draco without Legilimency and I doubt one can teach a skill without knowing how to use it.

I attest Harry did learn Occlumency. Not in the traditional sense but there is more than one way to skin a cat. Instead of the traditional clear your mind he just forced the mind to focus on a different idea. It's the same way Snape was able to lay a faux memory. I think it's kind of splitting hairs as to how.

Also her quote seems limited to just when Snape taught him. Not after the fact. If this is quote you're going off of. Harry's problem with it was always that his emotions were too near the surface and that he is in some ways too damaged. But he's also very in touch with his feelings about what's happened to him. He's not repressed, he's quite honest about facing them, and he couldn't suppress them, he couldn't suppress these memories

That being said I don't think we actually have any evidence of anyone other than Voldemort trying to dig into Harry's mind. So it's hard to tell if it was only effective because of EVIL or if it work for others. Correct me if I'm wrong.
