The Wiki is based on Snape's speculation, and I was making that assumption explicit. I actually think that Snape is probably correct.

For some highly asymmetric skills, it is, in principle, possible to teach something without knowing it. For a sports analogy, if you want to teach someone to hit baseballs, your skill as a pitcher is probably more important than your skill as a batter.

Harry's "Occlumency" only works because Voldemort is allergic to love, and it wouldn't work against anyone else. For that matter, maintaining focus on one specific thing for a long time is actually quite difficult, and it's very easy to become distracted. Against Voldemort, Harry didn't need to do it for a long time, because Voldemort was more hurt by the contact than Harry. Someone who wouldn't be hurt by Harry's emotions could just keep throwing distractions at Harry until he lost focus, and then they'd be in.

Rowling's quote is about being /gifted/ in Occlumency, and the specific teaching method never comes up. Personally, I like the idea of magic being integrated with personality, and the very same traits that give Harry a powerful Patronus also cripple his Occlumency.

We know that Harry's occlumency didn't work against Snape at the end of HBP.
