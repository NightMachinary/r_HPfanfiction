As far as I know, Harry didn't learn Occlumency in canon. Specifically, he was never able to close his mind to Voldemort. What he /was/ able to do was to figure out how to hurt Voldemort when Voldemort was in his mind, and he did it by doing the opposite of Occlumency: by concentrating on his genuine feelings of love and joy. We even have JKR's words to this end.

Is there evidence to the contrary that I am not aware of?

Also, do we have evidence that Bellatix is good at Occlumency? She would need to be decent at Legilimency to teach Draco---if Snape's speculation about that is correct---but from what little we see, you need Legilimency to teach Occlumency, but you don't need Occlumency.

Actually, if Bellatrix is a Legilimens, then there's some indirect canon evidence that Hermione had picked up Occlumency at some point, since Bellatrix, despite urgency, tortured her for information rather than use Legilimency. (Of course, an alternative explanation is that Bellatrix is a sadist and succumbed to temptation to torture the mudblood.)
