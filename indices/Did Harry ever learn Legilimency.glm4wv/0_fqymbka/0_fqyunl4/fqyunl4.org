I think that the key distinction is that Harry, when he does morally dubious things, generally does them on impulse or under severe duress. He is angry, so he uses the Cruciatus. He is about to be discovered by a Death Eater, so he casts the Imperius. Draco is about to cast the Cruciatus on him, so he casts the Secumstempa. But, he doesn't, say, practice using these spells ahead of time. Doing morally ambiguous things with planning and premeditation is more of a Hermione thing.

Mastering Legilimency is probably something that takes months, perhaps years of persistent effort and at least one other person to practice on/with---a person willing to have all their deepest secrets potentially exposed. I don't think Harry would go for it.
