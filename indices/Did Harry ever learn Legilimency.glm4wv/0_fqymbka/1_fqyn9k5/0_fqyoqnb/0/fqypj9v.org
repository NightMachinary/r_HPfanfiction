Oooo yes I had forgotten about that. Not that Carrie didn't deserve it. And that train of logic becomes horribly slippery. I can definitely see a harder Harry holding on to that after the war. Temper and all that.

As far as fretting over it or not I could totally see him thinking of it as an eye for an eye.

Technically a lot of spells are 'for enemies'. I think it's fair that assuming the book was owned by a standard hogwarts student that 'for enemies' would mean nothing worse than a bat bogey hex. He was pretty horrified when he realized how awful it was.

The privacy point is difficult just because 1. Teenagers. 2. There is a whole different level of wandering around a trusted adults office and basically seeing what is in their photo albums vs digging around in someone's non-isolated thoughts. It's still shitty but I feel like there is a line that got crossed somewhere in between those two.
