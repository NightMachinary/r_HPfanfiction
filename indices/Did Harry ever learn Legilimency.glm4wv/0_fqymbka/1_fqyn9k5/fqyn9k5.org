Not in the books. I'm speaking purely theoretically.

From an ethical standpoint it's very murky. The Snape backlash could easily be accidental and at least display the face he had potential to. Voldemort is a slightly different concept just because it's wholey within his mind. Dubious spells aside I can't remember a moment in the book where he uses a dangerous spell intentionally that wasn't life or death. One could argue even SS was used only because he didn't know it was fatal.

They're big books though. I may have missed it.
