No, Harry doesn't learn legilimency in the books.

I do disagree with the notion that he's too morally righteous to learn it, though. He uses far more dubious spells when it suits him, he thinks nothing of seeing into Snape's mind to my recollection, and he uses the link to Voldemort's mind to his advantage.
