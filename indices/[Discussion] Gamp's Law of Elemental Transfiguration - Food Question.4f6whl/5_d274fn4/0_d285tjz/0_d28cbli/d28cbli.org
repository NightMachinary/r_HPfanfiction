I disagree. Let me explain it: Perhaps, in reality, if no one could ever starve, it would be a better world, despite the giant disruption and wave of crisis that food being infinite would produce (Imagine all companies that sell or produce food disappearing, from farmers to McDonalds or Kit-Kat, Coca-Cola, all wines, etc.)

But in a fictional world, and given that we need to work for food, it would make HP Universe more flat, leveled in a bad way. Eliminates a problem, but that is not good for a story. Stories need conflict, problems. And they also need to exist in our same wave lengths, we need to be able to understand and relate with the characters in some way. Otherwise reading it wouldn't bee enjoyable.
