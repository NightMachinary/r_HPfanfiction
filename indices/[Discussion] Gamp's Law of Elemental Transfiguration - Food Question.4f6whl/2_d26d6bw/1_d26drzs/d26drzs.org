Thanks for the wine example, that's actually a great help. I'll look it up. What's confusing me is the part where Hermione says "you can *transform* it", which makes me wonder what exactly she means. If you can transform any object to food if you're skilled enough, or only one food into another, etc. Without that word, I'd just have assumed that you can only summon food or increase it's quantity, but as she specifically says "transform"...
