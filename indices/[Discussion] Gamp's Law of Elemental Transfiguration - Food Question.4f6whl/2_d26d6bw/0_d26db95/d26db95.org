  transfigure objects into similar objects, and if you're clever you can keep transfiguring until you hit something edible (seaweed to pufferfish, pufferfish to kangaroo, kangaroo to chicken, for example), but I like the other rule better.

But I think technically seaweed is edible, as is pufferfish and kangaroo. So the example of the second rule is about transforming the taste.

I agree that the rule you like better makes more sense
