The impression I got here is that food is the problem. Harry can make wine (he does this during the felix incident in HBP) but food seems to be a no go. In the books, you don't appear to be able to transfigure or conjur any food.

however, we do see multiple instances where food magically appears. Sandwiches in CoS, soup in HBP, pork chops in GoF. I suspect Molly weasley summoned soup from the pot (or else vanished it to wherever vanished things go), but the other instances all happen at Hogwarts. In linkffn(harry potter and the natural 20), dumbledore describes a spell that allows you to summon food (in that case, hot chocolate) from the kitchens, so my head cannon is there. Linkffn(harry potter and the summer after the war) (not my favorite fic) instead allows you to transfigure objects into similar objects, and if you're clever you can keep transfiguring until you hit something edible (seaweed to pufferfish, pufferfish to kangaroo, kangaroo to chicken, for example), but I like the other rule better.
