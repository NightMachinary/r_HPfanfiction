I don't remember which fanfiction it was in, but in one someome explains the problem with food(in that particular interpretation of the HP universe):

Food isn't the actual problem, but ingestibles are.

E.g. transfiguring a log of wood into a loaf of bread will destabilize if you digest it, possibly transforming back to its original state, which would potentially end with fatal results for the wizard. Fluids are less of a problem, if the original (e.g. water) is simply changed into a different fluid (e.g. wine), because the destabilization is less disruptive to the organism.

Insofar creating food isn't impossible, but simply incredibly unsafe. Since Gamp's law was written down at a time where there was no way to find out what actually caused the violent death of the wizards (and because logic was never a strong point of wizards to begin with), they simply assumed that there was a fundamental restriction on food, for one reason or another.

This theory then was further expanded upon by saying that a good example for this was potions: the ingredients are changed by the magic of the potions-master by changing attributes of the fluid, which evidently can still be safely drunk by the magical who decides to drink it. Some complicated potions might even rely on the fact that the potion 'changes back' while inside the person.

The problem with this theory is one encountered with many magical theories: it creates new plotholes and possible exploits. If you can kill someone by simply changing something inedible to food, why isn't that more common a method of assassination?

In the fic I read the author tried to fix this IIRC by saying that magic instinctively destroys 'false food' when digesting it, which also destroys all nutritional value in the process.
