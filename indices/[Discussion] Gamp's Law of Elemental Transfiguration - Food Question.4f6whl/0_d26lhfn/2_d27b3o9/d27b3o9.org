That's about the most conclusive analysation of this topic I've ever seen, and it even makes sense within the boundaries of canon. I took 'thin air' literally, and imagined that you just couldn't conjure it like water, but that you could transform other objects into (good) food. I guess I didn't look at Hermione's second statement close enough. Thanks a lot!
