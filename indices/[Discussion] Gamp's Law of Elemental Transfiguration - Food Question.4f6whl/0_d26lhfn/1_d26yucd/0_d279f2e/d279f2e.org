  If transfiguration changes the molecules permanently, then transfigured food is good food.

I think something more is happening here, because if this were the case, there should be no reason you /can't/ conjure food. Despite that, you can't. That's told directly to us in canon with no ambiguity. I have a rather complicated theory I've been working on which tries to tie together why magic works with the assumption that physics isn't fundamentally wrong, which would technically allow for food with no nutritional value, if it's totally necessary for it to exist.

Crazy theory warning ahead. Total conjecture for the next ten miles. Turn back all those who get unnecessarily butthurt at these things.

--------------

The basis of my theory is that magic is "all in our heads", but that it's also not an illusion. Life is what gives meaning to events and objects, without it, everything which exists would have no meaning. Magic often applies our understanding of the world, even a subconscious one, or one we no longer share, back onto the world. It also necessarily means the universe is alive, but that's kind of irrelevant for explaining food.

Rowling has already stated (and I'm paraphrasing a bit here), transfiguration changes the shape of something, while charms change what it does, the latter I'm going to call "essence". So let me explain what /I/ mean by "essence". Essence is something which gives property to a shape or thing. For example, a dancing charm can give the essence of "dancing" to a cup, making it dance, despite there being no physical method for the cup to dance.

While that's what an essence /does/, an essence exists out of a concept, idea, or of knowledge. There's no base physical concept of "dancing" as far as the universe is concerned, but as intelligent, living beings, humans can create and understand that knowledge, which can then be applied to an object as a metaphysical thing, an essence.

The physical law is no more or less an idea than the dancing, it's just of a different type on a different scale. A porcelain cup may be hard because it has the essence, the metaphysical property of being made up of a hard material (to simplify), but magic can give it another essence, one on our level of understanding.

I think this also means that complex life has created some very odd situations where our understanding and the universe's "understanding" conflict in areas.

Food is one of those weird parts of our understanding messing with an object's essence. Things come from the Earth, and they return to it when they die. For humans, food is the single most complex part of this cycle. It takes time, and it takes sacrifice, but it's completely necessary for life to continue. The very first human religions and spiritualities were about how the world is alive. We've always understood this complexity, but even if /we/ didn't, this is a necessity to all living things, and they are part of that system, that idea. If I continue on this path, it gets into crazy land and isn't particularly relevant so I'll move on.

This is different from water, because while water is far more important, it's also far more simple. Every needs water, but it flows through the Earth everywhere and even falls from the sky. There are great big lakes bigger than the landmasses, and even a massive frozen one at one of the poles.

So, food as an essence which can't just be replicated by transforming an object. Even if you can /physically/ change its form from "nothing" to "food", as conjuration does, you can't /create/ the essence of food so easily. Even if you could create the physical object and ate it, it physically would not give you the nutrients real food would give you. I don't know if this means the chemistry would literally not work, or if time would do something silly, but it's largely irrelevant. The essence of food is interfering with the essences of mundane, physical law.

This is only true because transfiguration /specifically does not alter the essence of something on its own/. I think there are times where it can spontaneously change on its own, but food is not one of those cases, and it's why food is one of the five Principal Exceptions.
