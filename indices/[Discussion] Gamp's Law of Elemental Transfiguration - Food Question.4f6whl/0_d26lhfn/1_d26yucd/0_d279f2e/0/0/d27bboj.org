That's one way to go, but I've been trying to avoid the assumption that wizards are /total/ write-offs. It's not outright impossible in my theory, I didn't really go into that, it's just not possible through the usual methods. I bet in either theory, you could set up a weird roundabout way to do it, or use a Philosopher's Stone or something like that. I just figure, if it was possible the normal way, they'd not have claimed it to be impossible.
