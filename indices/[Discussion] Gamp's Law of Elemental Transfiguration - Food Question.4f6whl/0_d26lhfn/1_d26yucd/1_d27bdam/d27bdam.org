Well, that's the question, but the more I think about it, the more I think that it makes more sense if you can't transfigure non-food into food. If you could, then, as somebody else pointed out, what's stopping wizards from conjuring a rock, and transfiguring it into food? Why would Hermione go looking for edible fungi if she could just transfigure something? (DH, camping) Of course that also leads to the question why she didn't just transform the fungi into something tastier, or why Molly Weasley and Hogwarts' house elves actually do the cooking, and don't just transfigure say a loaf of bread into a meal for ten. The only thing that I can imagine is that either transfiguring food is hard to master, or that there are limits... Or Molly and the elves simply like cooking, and transforming food went over Hermione's head at the time ;)
