Or, to sum it up: if it didn't start as food, it will have the nutritional value of sawdust even if it does happen to be edible.

This makes me think that however one changes the substance they started out with it's still going to retain its original composition for the purpose of digestion and nutrient absorption, and that would basically be it.

It kind of makes me wonder what would happen if you transfigured someone into food, duplicated that with magic, then changed the person back and tried to eat the duplicates.
