Thanks. If that's all we have I probably will. It's just the way Hermione says that you can't make food out of nothing, but you can transform it, that makes me wonder what exactly she's talking about. Can anything be transformed into food, or just food be transformed into other food, etc...

Edit (to answer to edit ;) ): That makes the most sense. Otherwise really would be laughably easy to get around that rule.
