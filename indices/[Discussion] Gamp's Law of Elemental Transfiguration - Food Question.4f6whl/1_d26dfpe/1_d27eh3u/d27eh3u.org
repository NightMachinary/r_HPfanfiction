I'm wondering... I know there's a spell for water (Aguamenti)- does it just pull water from the nearest available source? Or is the water it conjures no good for drinking somehow? Anyway, I'm betting that Ollivander did a simultaneous/very quick transfiguration of water into wine. And can you transfigure drink into good food? If so, seems you could just conjure water and then transform it into anything. But maybe what you transfigure will only ever have the nutritional value of the original object.
