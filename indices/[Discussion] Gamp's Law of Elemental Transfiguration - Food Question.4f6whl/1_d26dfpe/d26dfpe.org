You can definitely conjure wine, I think Ollivander did it when testing Harry's wand in GoF.

As for food, I think the little bit you've quoted is the only canon info we have, unless JKR has addressed it in an interview somewhere, so I say feel free to make it up?

Edit: clarity

Edit 2: on second thought, I think you should only be able to transfigure food into different kind of food. If you can transfigure non-food into food, it brings up the question of whether you can conjure something -- say, a rock -- and then transfigured /that/ into food, which technically shouldn't be allowed, right?
