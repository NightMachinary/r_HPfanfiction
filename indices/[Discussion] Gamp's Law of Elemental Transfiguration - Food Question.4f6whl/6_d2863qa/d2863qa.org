She's implying that you can transform food into something, but doesn't specify whether you can transform it into something edible.

I might suggest that mages need to ingest magic. Plants produce it, or gather it from the ground. General transfiguration cannot disrupt any magic present in an item. Food-shaped magic remains food-shaped magic; if I managed to transfigure a horcrux into a bread loaf, it would still have horcrux-shaped magic.

The result? I can transfigure food for muggles, and I can eat muggle food, and that leaves everyone healthy. If I have a diet of transfigured food as a mage, I will wither and die as I starve magically.

The other leading idea is that transfiguration is not permanent. What happens when you eat bread that was transfigured and it transforms back?
