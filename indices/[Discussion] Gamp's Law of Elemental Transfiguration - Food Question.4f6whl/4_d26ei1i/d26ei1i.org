Technically she says

#+begin_quote
  It's impossible to make *good* food out of nothing!
#+end_quote

So I'm guessing it's possible to create food out of thin air or transfigure a rock into a sandwich but it's bad and inedible.

#+begin_quote
  you can transform it
#+end_quote

I'm pretty sure it means you can transfigure food, although I do wonder if there's any limitation. I mean if I transfigure a loaf of bread into a steak and eat it, would it taste like a steak, bread or something different?
