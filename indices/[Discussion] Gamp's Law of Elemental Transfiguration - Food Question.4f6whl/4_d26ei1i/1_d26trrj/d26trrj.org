I think the word “good” was meant it's about food with higher nutritional value than sawdust; meaning, “food” food rather than “something technically inedible that you tried to eat” food.

But yes, technically she does say that.

And with the rock example, I think it'd technically taste like a sandwich and be edible, it just wouldn't give you anything that you wouldn't get from a rock so basically it'd all become stool and your body would hate you a bit for eating junk.
