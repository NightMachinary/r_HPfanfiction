Three years later nine-year-old Neville Longbottom stood in the entry hall of a house not terribly unlike Longbottom lodge. The building had a cavernous feel that no amount of furniture could hide.

Today was the day that determined if he had been wasting his time.

A tall dark-haired man in a black polo shirt and trousers entered the room reading a book. "Did you need something Alfred?"

"Actually Master Bruce, I believe I have something you need."

The man looked up from his book, seemingly surprised to find strangers in his home, but Neville could tell that it was an act. The man not only knew they were there but had known it before he had entered the room.

"If I may, Master Bruce, my grandnephew, Neville Longbottom, and his grandmother Augusta Longbottom."

"What is going on Alfred?" Bruce Wayne asked.

"I'm here to be trained," Neville interjected. "Uncle Alfred says that you're the best and that you would understand."

"Trained? To do what?" Wayne asked.

"To fight," Neville explained. "To win."

"I don't know what you think I can do," the man said until he took in the driven expression on the boy's face. "No, that's not going to happen."

With that, the billionaire left the room.

"I was afraid of this," Alfred sighed. "Give me a moment, please."

*-oooOOOooo-*

Knowing the house even better than its owner, Alfred caught up with his employer and son in all but blood in a few moments.

"What were you thinking Alfred?" the man thundered.

"I was thinking that Neville is on much the same mission as you are, Master Bruce," Alfred said quietly, "He is as driven as you, he is as angry as you, and in his world, he is as wealthy as you."

"'In his world'? He's magical?"

"He is," Alfred acknowledged.

"So you brought him here so that he could end up like me?"

"Actually, no," Alfred corrected. "I brought him here so that he wouldn't, and I hope his presence will give you someone to care about, so as to pull you back from your own psychosis."

Bruce Wayne was many things, but he never, ever lied to himself. He could see the truth in Alfred's words... but to risk a child in his work...

"The gym, one hour," Wayne growled. What could it hurt to see what the kid could do?

*-oooOOOooo-*

*AN: An idea I started but could never get to go anywhere. A classic 'Neville as the 'hidden badass' trope', he finds himself working with Bruce Wayne, taking on the identity of Dick Grayson, (and Augusta becoming 'Aunt Harriet' simply because it amused me), while circulating rumors of his near Squib status to explain why no one ever sees him. At 11 he shows up at Hogwarts under glamours as the chubby, utterly unconfident Neville of canon, while working behind the scenes to cut the Junior Death Eaters off at the knees.*
