Well, not so much Harry...

"Hello, Gussie,"

Augusta Longbottom's eyes widened in surprise, and then she threw her arms around the man. "Alfred? We weren't expecting you."

The man shrugged. "An unexpected vacation. My employer is busy and will be away for several months, so I thought I'd come home and check on Frank and Alice. Have there been any changes?"

"Sadly, no," Augusta answered. "They aren't degrading, but they aren't getting any better either."

"I hope the Lestranges are enjoying their time in Azkaban," Alfred said viciously. "And how is Neville?"

"Let's get some lunch," Augusta countered, obviously trying to change the subject.

"Let's," the man agreed.

*-oooOOOooo-*

He waited until the meal was served and the waiter had left them alone before again asking his question.

"Out with it Gussie, how is Neville?" Alfred paused for a moment before continuing. "Is he like... well, like me?"

Augusta's eyes widened, "oh, no, Merlin, no. If anything he's too powerful, Alfred."

"Too powerful?" Alfred asked with a grin. "Allowing underage magic at Longbottom Hall, are we?"

"Oh, don't you start," Augusta huffed. "His accidental magic started when he was four, after the fifth time he turned a room inside out, Garrick Ollivander himself told us that the only way to get it under control was to get him his wand."

"All right," Alfred said with a small smile. "If his problem isn't his magic, what is it?"

Augusta looked around to ensure there was no one near enough to overhear. "He remembers, Alfred. He remembers everything."

The man blinked. "Oh, my."

*-oooOOOooo-*

"Hello Neville," the old man said as he entered the nursery.

The boy in question looked up from his primer and his face brightened with a smile. "Uncle Alfred!"

"I had some time, so I thought I'd come to see my favorite Grand Nephew."

"I'm glad you did, sir."

"Sir?" Alfred asked quizzically. "Nice try Neville, but remember who you're talking to. That rot won't work on me."

The boy blushed, so Alfred pressed his inquiry. "Your Gran tells me you remember that night."

The boy avoided his eyes, looking back down at his lesson book. "I do. At first, it was only at night, in my dreams, but now it's all the time. I even remember the man who tried to make me forget."

"Cornelius Fudge is a miserable little man, Neville," Alfred said, "and not much of a wizard. If there is any justice in the world, he and his ilk would disappear and never amount to much, but as there isn't, they often rise to high power. You're a strong wizard, you get that from both Frank and my Alice. Your magic has broken the Obliviate that fool Fudge put on you and given you some horrible memories."

"Uncle Garrick said the same thing," Neville sighed.

"Garrick Ollivander and I rarely agree on much," Alfred laughed. "But on you, we both agree. You will be a force to be reckoned with."

Alfred lowered himself into the chair next to Neville's desk. "So, you know. What do you intend to do with this knowledge?"

The six-year-old was silent for several seconds, quite obviously pondering just how much of his plans he dared reveal to an adult.

"I go to Hogwarts in five years," he said softly. "I can't do much about the surviving adults who bought their way out of gaol, but I can keep their children from spreading their poison."

Alfred could not help but be taken aback by the intensity of the boy's anger, and he also could not help but find it startlingly familiar.

"And what do you know about me?" he asked.

"I know you're Mum's uncle, that you live among the Muggles, and can't visit all that often because you're a squib," Neville explained. "And I know that isn't fair."

The old man smiled. "Life is quite often extremely unfair, Neville. In most families, I would have been banished at 11, if not outright killed."

"Not our families," Neville said stubbornly.

"Indeed," the old man agreed. "Not our families. I was nurtured and educated, and most importantly loved. Your Gran was my sister Kate's best friend at Hogwarts and believe it or not, we even dated a while until she met your granddad."

"Okay," the boy said eloquently. "Ew."

"Poke fun all you want," Alfred laughed. "There will come a time when you will learn to take joy in the torment of children. After I finished my education, I did my time in Her Majesty's Service, and then I traveled for a while."

The old man paused, watching as his all too mature grand nephew schooled his features. Yet another familiar trait. "I see the question in your eyes, Neville, you want to know what any of this has to do with your plans for the future."

The boy pondered this for a moment. It was hard to believe anyone this intense could possibly be 6 years old. "Are you telling me I should ignore what they did to Mum and Dad?"

"No," Alfred said with a shake of his head. "Never that. What I'm telling you is that you won't be able to do anything about it with only your wand. You will need more. You will need to know tactics, equipment, planning."

The boy's eyes went wide in surprise. "You're not going to tell me I'm too young?"

"Would it do any good?" Alfred asked.

Neville once again would not meet the man's eyes.

"You are too young, but all demanding you change your ambitions would do is have you hide them from me," Alfred pointed out, "which would mean I would not be able to help."

"You're going to help?" Neville asked hopefully.

"I am," the old man agreed. "At least at first. When you're old enough, I'll introduce you to someone who will understand your ambitions perhaps even better than you do yourself."

"I'm ready now!" the six-year-old decided.

"No, Neville, you're not," Alfred disagreed. "And I hope you never are, I hope there will come a time when you decide you don't need or want the training I'm going to give you, but that is up to you."

"Teach me." The boy said, and the old man knew he had lost.
