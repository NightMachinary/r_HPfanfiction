I would read the hell out of this. A recommendation if you're looking for one--- linkffn(Kicking Gotham) by Steelbadger is the best-written Harry Potter/DC crossover I've come across. It follows Harry, an Auror, as he travels to Gotham to look for a missing Neville. 10/10 in every aspect: seamless blending of the universes and lores, humorous when appropriate, and amazing fight scenes. It was Kicking Gotham that got me excited at the possibilities of HP and DC.
