#+begin_quote
  Harry comes back to Privet Drive after another tiring year of school, but there is another unexpected guest there. It turns out Vernon Dursley has a nephew as well, and 19 year old Dick Grayson seems to be nothing like the Dursleys that Harry has grown to hate. Maybe this Summer will be a little bit better with some company.
