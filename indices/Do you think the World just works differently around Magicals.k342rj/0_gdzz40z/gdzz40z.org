Well if you asked the Dursleys, they would certainly say that Harry's presence along with all of the many incidences of accidental magic that happened along with it messed everything up.

That's an interesting thought though. The fact that muggle tech doesn't work on the Hogwarts grounds is canon, so maybe magical people can have a similar effect in close quarters. Like if a wizard held a smartphone, maybe it would freeze or the battery would discharge.

That might explain why wizards tend to have such a difficult time understanding muggle technology when they are able to comprehend stuff like arithmancy. Maybe it's hard for them to observe electronics and things in their proper working order without having a negative impact on them.
