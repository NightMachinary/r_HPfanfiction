  Potions could also been seen as another example of this, there is no active magic being done, but if you were to have a muggle try and brew a potion even if they did everything right all they would end up with is a mess.

When you break it down, all magic is like this. A Muggle can speak an incantation and wave a wand. A Muggle can put ingredients in a cauldron and stir.

I don't think Muggles' inability to make potions is any different from their inability to cast spells - both involve taking actions that anyone can perform, but their having special significance when performed by a wizard.

Another example of this is Lily's sacrifice. A Muggle can sacrifice themselves but it's not going to result in a magical effect.

Focusing on the OP question, personally I like to treat the fairy-tale logic that governs the HP world as only occuring in highly magical places, not just anywhere a wizard goes. At places like Hogwarts, yes, objects may spontaneously gain sentience or events may conspire to produce exciting adventures for the students. But in the outside world, these things are rather more rare. A wizard's magic must be actively used to change the world; whereas at Hogwarts there is magic in the place itself as well.
