I tend to think of it as magic not just being something they can do, its something that they are, they are magical.(I think being magical or non-magical is a binary thing you either are, or your not. there is no in between. Magic is not like chakra,Ki,ect were people have different amounts of it).

You take two identical people apart from one being magical and have them both do any task at the same time in a identical way. And they are going to end up with different results, because the magical person just by the fact of being magical puts magic into everything they do its not something they can just stop doing.
