To expand on your theory, students coming together to learn magic /is/ a 'magical spell' in its own right - just as waving a wand, stirring a cauldron or swirling tea leaves is. That's why Hogwarts is magical above and beyond other wizarding places. That gets rid of 'magic in the air' that I never really liked much.
