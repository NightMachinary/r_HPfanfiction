OK- this is not a Drarry- it's a Gen Fic- but one of my favorite Harry as a Slytherin is called “A Learning Experience”- it is an amazing fic that creates an incredible representation of Slytherin culture from the inside- it does justice I think to a lot of characters, including Snape as a stern, but ultimately super devoted Housemaster trying to save his snakes from ending up on the dark side. There's no sexual relationship between Harry & Draco, but there's a very interesting dynamic where Harry is a vital part of pulling Draco back from the dark side, despite some of their initial rivalry.

It's super well written, with three fics in the series and over 500K+ words so it's a solid read. If you're OK without the overt slash- this gives a great portrayal of Slytherin Harry, Snape, Draco and some of the other characters of Slytherin.

Sadly not on AO3- but it's on FFN.
