The problem with this that even if they forged documents and/or Confounded and/or Obliviated people to get into non-magical Uni/college, that doesn't mean they'll be able to keep up with the work. People going from high school/college (in the UK) to college/uni have problems, and they were just in school a few months back! Imagine someone who essentially dropped out of school at 10/11 (if the person is Muggleborn/raised) and coming back for post-secondary education with little to no catch up.

Unless they're on some potion regimen to enhance memory and retain information, that scenario will not go down well. Hopefully the wizard has an insider as well, or else the ruse will be discovered sooner or later.
