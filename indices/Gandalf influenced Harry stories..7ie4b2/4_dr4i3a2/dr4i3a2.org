The fic A Long Journey Home linkffn(A Long Journey Home) has a female Harry accidentally travel back in time where she takes a Gandalf-esque role in history (ie very powerful, fighting injustice, teaching magic, mentoring others). That's kinda where the similarities end, and the fic does have its flaws, but it's still an extremely good read nonetheless.
