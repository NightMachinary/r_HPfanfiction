I'm with Karigan on this one. Magic reflects the people, so you've gotta look at what's important to them. Egypt was an immensely practical nation and one of the few to survive most of the Bronze Age Collapse. Egyptian Beliefs focused a lot on patterns and cycles - rising and lowering of floodwaters in the Nile, seasonal change, death and resurrection, etc. It's all about maintaining the order of the Universe and the cyclical patterns it falls into.

Egyptian Magic was also very focused on that same sense of practicality and function. You'd call in a Wizard like you'd call in an Exterminator or a Plumber and that was perfectly normal to them. Priests tended to specifically focus on doing the big maintenance rituals, but there was a different type of wizard you could call in to help with all manner of things from fertility to healing to pest control.

Spells and Charms did exist, with both incantations and motions, but the spell could be attached to a myriad of foci (not just the wand - though they did have those, they were usually used as drawing tools for protective circles or symbols of authority for summoning beings) and was often more complex and ritualistic than the swish and speak method of Harry Potter. You might activate an Amulet (worn gewgaws like necklaces that give special powers or protection), or a figurine, or a potion, or the wand, but there'd be a process of preparation and routine to go through beforehand, and the spell could be anything from a spell written on a scroll, a ritual dance, or just drawing symbols and images of powerful beings on various surfaces to draw their attention (and thus protection).

So, yeah. If you're gonna make an Egyptian-ish magic system that reflects what they thought, make it practically-focused and make it ritualistic.
