I think with any magic it's important to look at what was important and practical to the people in question at any time, so with Egyptians I'm not in any way an expert, but the Nile seemed to be pretty central to the way they organised their calendar and stuff, so maybe some of it was intent based and elemental. Making sure the Nile flooded at the right time, and grain wasn't eaten by pests or rot, carving out tombs and working outThe Pharaohs were considered to be gods so is it more heavy hitting elemental magic? Weather magic? Death magic?

But we also know that soul magic was if not invented in Egypt, at least it was used and refined there to make horcruxes

Plus their curses and protections were gnarly enough that curse breakers were still being employed to work on breaking them
