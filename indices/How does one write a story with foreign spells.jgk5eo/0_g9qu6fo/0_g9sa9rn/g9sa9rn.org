They were also big into medicine - on a tour of Egypt about a decade ago, I remember seeing carvings depicting male genitalia exhibiting a venereal disease in a complex largely dedicated to a Greek healer who was associated with the Egyptian pantheon (I've forgotten the details).

Also, in the British Museum, there are many exhibits that can be touched, or at least, could be touched the last time I was there (late 1970s). Perhaps Harry, on a field trip, could get a jolt from touching the Rosetta Stone or, more likely, some less famous and more relevant artifact.
