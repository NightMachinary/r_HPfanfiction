[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]] has a relatively major subplot in the later chapters where the three Marauders (James and Lily survived Voldemort's attack, in this version) join forces with Hermione Granger's dad and start making magical television - they never really address the fact that they're essentially stealing large amounts of movies and TV shows from the Muggles, by broadcasting them to Wizarding Britain without paying any royalties, but apart from that, it's very pro-Muggle and (blatantly) advocates in favor of increased integration between the magical and Muggle worlds.
