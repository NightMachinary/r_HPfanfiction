I have written so many posts on this subject because every time someone new asks, I've lost those posts -_-

Basically, his characters are one-dimentional demi-gods and he absolutely wastes all interesting plot elements, especially the goblins, by practically making them into deus ex machina that overpower Harry. The 11-year olds (or younger) falling in love is squicky and treating Hermione as a damsel and Harry as tween-age knight in golden armor made of chivalry and hat-tipping is borderline offensive. Bashing the Weasleys/Dumbledore is nearly identical from story to story as well as most of the other independent!Harry tropes.

Yes, he's written a lot of stories and finished all of them, and that's great. He's one of the most consistent writers of Indy!Harry, HHR, MoB!Dumbledore, Bashed!Weasleys, and Helpful!Goblins. Because of that, though, he's kinda like the Pewdiepie of Fanfiction. He's appealing to the lowest common denominator: the younger folks who couldn't give a shit about quality plot and only care to see Harry kick ass and get the girl.

If other authors and readers are honest, they can see that they are jealous that, like Pewdiepie, that shit sells like hotcakes while their stories or favorite author's highest quality stories barely get any recognition. I am too. Thus, the hate that he deserves for the plot/writing alone is colored by the hate he gets for being popular.

I've said this before, and I'll say it again: as far as I know, he's never been hateful towards the community and I was one of the many that got into HPFF via his fics. I won't say he's the cancer killing fanfiction because he's not. He's more like the McDonalds next door to a 4-star restaurant. All the kids go to the McDs and if they grow up or want some better food, they might head next door and find out just how bad the McDs was.

But, the thing some people need to realize is that there is a difference between disliking his plot and disliking him for writing them. His writing is shit, but he seems to be enjoying himself and he is, by virtue of being on the top view/reviews list all the time, is getting more people into the HPFF community. As far as I know, he's never been involved in any sort of drama/bullshit, so I have no problem with him personally. But too many people go out of their way to leave hateful reviews calling him names and whatnot, and that is wrong. If you don't like his writing, don't fuckin read it, and don't leave a shitty review.
