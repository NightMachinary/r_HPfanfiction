First, let me say that I'm talking about of age fics.

I find that giving snape a fleshed out character, like small hobbies and a friendly relationship with McGonagall, him sitting on a dark room near the fire drinking whiskey, it just completes his identity and make him more realistic.

On the other side, you have Harry, a person that has gone through a lot and understands some things about him. He's more optimistic, and is usually really forgiving.

I find that putting them together cultivates the grounds for growth in those two people. Harry helps Snape get out of his own head, and Snape shares moments, his hobbies, and a (somewhat, he's still Snape) patient guidance. So the characters slowly change, and their relationship and companionship are really nice to watch.

I find that older!Harry (like when he's 30-40) works in similar ways, but you find that the companionship and understanding element appears much quicker, as they have a lot more in common by that time.

To sum up, I find that their characters work wonderfully together to bring the best out of each other, something rare in most fics (as well as books). I've sometimes seen it in some draco/Hermione fics, but not in the same frequency by a long shot.
