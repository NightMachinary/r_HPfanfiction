It's the age gap that makes me uncomfortable. He's the same age as Harry's parents, and while they did have him pretty young thats still three times his age when they first meet. Yikes.

I don't understand the people that like Snape/Lily but like, at least theyre from the same generation. There are so many canon characters to choose from so it just rubs me the wrong way when they specifically choose the ones that far apart, even if its an au with closer ages or something.

With the animosity in gay relationships, I have mixed feelings about it. I have seen Harry/Ron and Harry/Neville fics, but then again do I look for them specifically. I don't mind a little rivalry or enemies-to-lovers, especially if it's done well, but it is disconcerting how many gay ships seem to only be based in that
