Honestly, none of the major snape ships make sense for me. Thr only one I can sometimes read and force myself to care about is ... Snucius? Is that how it's called? (Seriously, I changed my mind, that Sn leading into a shipname automatically makes it unattractive. Somewhere between snooze and snot)
