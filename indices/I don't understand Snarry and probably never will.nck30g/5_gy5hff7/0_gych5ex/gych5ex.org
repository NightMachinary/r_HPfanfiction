I thought the explanation made no sense at all. Snape is responsible for everything wrong in Harry's life but how was Harry responsible for everything wrong in Snape's? Snape is the grown man who consistently bullied Harry from the age of eleven before Harry so much as opened his mouth - the very first time they came face to face. What ever he was doing to protect Harry was behind the scenes, their personal interactions consisted of Snape behaving like the vilest of bullies.

And he had a creepy obsession with Harry's mother

And he was literally old enough to be his father.

I can just about see it as an abusive thing, Snape grooming him as a revenge against James, but not otherwise
