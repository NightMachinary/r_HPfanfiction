I agree, though, the commenter specified that “Harry was responsible for everything wrong in Snape's life” from Snape's specific POV.

It's definitely true that Snape was an asshole to Harry a lot. But to be fair, there are a lot of things that I think weren't meant to turn out the way they were regarding the later half of the series. For example, we've seen this with how Harry gets completely fawned over for the Patronus in a few books, but it's portrayed as something much simpler in OotP. There were some hints Rowling was dissatisfied with both Hermione/Ron and Harry/Ginny (or at least unsure about it) at some points but she went with it in the end. She even said outright that at one point she almost killed off Ron in the end.

My point is, I don't think her endgame vision for the series was figured out from the beginning. For the same reasons you mentioned, I think it's disturbing in many ways that Harry would name his literal /son/ after Snape (and Dumbledore, but that's another can of worms), but he did that, didn't he? I think if Rowling had that redemption arc in mind, she might have bothered to make him at least a bit more sympathetic (and less of a creep), but she didn't, so she didn't. The result is that the final arc of the storyline is a bit mismatched, because her final vision for Snape is one that she didn't have in the beginning.

In fanfics, it's easier to reimagine everything so it works out in a way that makes sense. I don't really think there's anything right with going with the entirety of canon and excusing it as a matter of sexual tension, but I do think there are a few stories (some with truly exceptional prose that make it worth reading even if you hate the ship) that reimagine many events in the series entirely to make it work.
