[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/muo6ok/can_someone_explain_the_snarry_fandom_to_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf][This post]] has a couple decent explanations, many of which do actually seem somewhat valid.

Personally, though I heavily dislike the ship itself (unless it's like, a time travel thing where they're different people and know each other in a completely different way, that's ok), I don't necessarily share the revulsion most people have towards it, because there are some truly beautiful works that have that ship and are worth reading even if you hate it. As long as it happens when Harry's an appropriate age for the gap to not matter as much, I can live with it.
