We don't only have slash with animosity tho...? There are plenty of Harry/Ron shippers, but while they're in the minority, Remus/Sirius is the second biggest HP ship on Ao3 with nearly 24k fics. There's also numerous smaller ships that aren't non-existent just because they don't make the top 10 list on Ao3 (which is 6 het ships to 4 slash ships). If you're not interested in enemies to lovers, there's seriously so many options available.
