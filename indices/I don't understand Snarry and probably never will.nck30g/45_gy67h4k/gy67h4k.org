Snape is one of my favourite characters, so I do read Snape ships sometimes, but I wouldn't go near a Snarry fic with a ten foot long pole. No way in hell that could be anything besides some weird hatef*ck type of relationship.

*i just read someone else's comment about time travel with Snarry back in Marauders era, I still couldn't see it though, imagine James and Lily's reactions
