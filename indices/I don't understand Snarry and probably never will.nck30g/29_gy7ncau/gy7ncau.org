TBH it's usually starts with 1 amazing author/story, and they do such a great job of weaving an AU plot (cause by the nature of the pairing, it has be to AU) that you want more like it. And down the rabbit hole you go. And that goes for any pairing or trope.

But you may ask, why does a person even read that first amazing story, when the pairing/trope freaks them out?

Could be boredom, curiosity, maybe the summary is everything you love except the pairing (so you give it a go for the plot not the romance). And for us older fandom members (pre-A03) it wasn't uncommon for fics to have no details about the pairing - so you were half way through what you thought was a gen fic, only to end up in a slow burn slash fic.
