Yeah, I honestly can't remember a hp ship I wanted to read a story about, that I wasn't able to find at least a few stories for. I admit, some ships are more popular than others, but Harry/Ron isn't that unpopular/rare in general. Harry/Neville is maybe less popular, but there's still a decent amount of fics for them available. And I'm saying this as someone who loves to read rare/peculiar ships - I've liked ships before that had maybe 5 fics available for them, a 3rd of which where not in english (for which I had to use Google Translate) - and have still considered myself lucky that someone has thought about and actually writen something for this ship. But for most HP ships there usually are a lot more fics available even on the accesibile sites like AO3 or FF. I think in that reguard we are lucky that the HP fandom is so popular and populous :))
