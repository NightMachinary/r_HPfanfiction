OP, there are literally 2492 fics on AO3 with the tag "Harry/Ron" and 625 fics with the tag "Harry/Neville", and that's only on AO3. Where are you searching for fics if you haven't been able to see /one/ fic with these pairings?

(I myself have read fics with these two pairings and well writen ones. I've also read many fics about pairings that don't rely on animosity - both slash and het ships. Fortunatelly, especially for the HP fandom, there are A LOT of good fics out there you can chose from - I could even say it's one of the most generous fandom in that area, as I was able to find fics for ships that aren't very popular or even not that much thought of).
