I wouldn't mind some Harry/Ron recs myself tbh :))

I've read a few before, but I'm always opened to try more. I actually really like their dynamic and the best-friends-to-more trope going on there. They are so close als friends they just don't realise when the "transition" happens and it still takes them by surprise when they finally get even closer and turn into more-than -friends.

In most of the fics I read I usually try to avoid any Ron bashing, Hermione bashing and Weasley bashing in general, since I loved in the canon that Harry was able to find a family in them.
