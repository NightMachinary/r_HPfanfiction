I read a LOT of Snarry on FFN prior to DH's release in 2007 (over 26, I promise). You couldn't filter on FFN for pairings back then, you could only put 2 main characters and a rating. I remember this clearly cos I wanted Mentor!Snape fics and these were lumped in with Snarry.

In 2013, FFN added the option to filter by pairing, and AO3 didn't exist until 2008. Most old stuff hasn't been crossposted and backdated on AO3.

In addition, Snarry was huge on Livejournal. A lot of LJ content was removed in the 2007 strikethrough. There was also the FFN purge of 2002 and 2012 where they removed adult content.

Snarry ppl also lived on a number of archives: Walking the Plank, Silver Snitch, HP Adult Fanfiction, Glasses Reflect, Harry Potter Fan Fiction, to name a few. Most of these works are not on AO3/FFN.

I'm not surprised your maths is dodgy and the Snarry numbers are small cos you're asking: how many people have gone back to their 6+ year old Snarry FFN fics that have yet to be purged, to add the relationship field? and how many people, years later imported their works to AO3 and backdated it?
