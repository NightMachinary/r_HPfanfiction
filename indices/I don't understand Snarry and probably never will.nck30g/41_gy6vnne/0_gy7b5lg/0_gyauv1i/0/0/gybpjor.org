Okay, I didn't know/hadn't considered most of that.

Still, on FFN, about 6k/22k of all fics tagged with Harry and Snape were published before DH. And on AO3, about half of the 14k Snarry fics were published within the last seven years. So unless every Snarry fic put on AO3 for over seven years after DH was actually a pre-DH fic that just wasn't backdated, the vast majority of Snarry fics on AO3 are also post-DH.

And I don't have an easy way to check all the other archives you mention. But again, unless there were at least 10k-20k Snarry fics on them, then your initial claim is incorrect.

I think you're underestimating the fact that it has been 14 years since DH was published. And Harry Potter fics peaked in popularity in [[https://m.imgur.com/q437v6I][2011, at the very earliest]] (I can't find data for after 2012, and I don't feel like figuring it out myself). There may have been a ton of pre-DH Snarry fics, and it may have dropped in popularity after DH. But the passage of time is working against you, and while it may be true that the vast majority of Snarry shippers started shipping them before they read/watched DH, most of them did not stop shipping it afterwards.
