When I was first new to fanfic and did not know the different terms, I once accidentally stumbled upon a Snarry story. Only for them Snarry seems to be Harry and Snape are father and son *and* in a sexual relationship :O\\
I thought for a long time that Snarry meant incest, so I always noped out of those stories. Still don't look for them.
