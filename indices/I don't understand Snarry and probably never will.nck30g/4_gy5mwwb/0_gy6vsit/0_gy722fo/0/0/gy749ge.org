I really don't think it is due to Alan Rickman... it was definitely a thing before the movies. Weird as this may sound I think it's really more of a personality thing, or a hurt/comfort thing.

I'm not into Snarry (age difference is kinda icky, but they are fictional so I'll sometimes read it if I like the Snape characterization) or really into pairing Snape with anyone, but I do like fix-it stories where he becomes a little happier. I liked his character a lot more before the Lily reveal, tbh. I still like it if I think of the love as non-romantic, like someone would have for their sister, their grandmother, or their best friend who was really the only person who ever believed in them.

I'm sort of rambling here, but a lot of people describing Snape as handsome just want it to be more possible for him to be happy. Bad hygiene is very fixable, and if you fix it, what's left that's ugly, really? A big nose? Lots of attractive people could be described as having large noses.
