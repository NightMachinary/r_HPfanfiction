The greasy part was mainly because of Snape's very poor hygiene (dirty teeth and dirty underwear for starters). But hey, I'm not here to kink shame. Whatever gets the reader off ain't my business. That being said, it still catches me off guard whenever the author describes Snape as handsome despite the very detailed description of him having the looks and hygiene of a common neckbeard. I'm also aware that it's mainly because of Alan Rickman who was a Hollywood actor and are more often attractive people.
