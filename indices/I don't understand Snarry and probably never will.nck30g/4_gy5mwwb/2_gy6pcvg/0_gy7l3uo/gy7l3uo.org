Snape and Draco are far too nice in fanfiction. They have very few redeeming qualities in the books, but the actors were good and look good in leather pants. I do wish more authors based their work on the books rather than the movies.

They could at least read them to get the spelling right. Too much "Stupify", "Alohamora", "Hermoine", "Creature" (or "Kreature" since it's spelled with a K), or egregious spelling of "Occlumency/Legilimency" and I'm out of there.
