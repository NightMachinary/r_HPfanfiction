Yeah it could be uncomfortable to read about but it isn't pedophilia, which is what you said in your first comment.

Also the student-teacher relationship dynamic wears off with age. Tbh I'd be a bit uncomfortable reading about 18yo Harry with Snape, but if say Harry is 30 and Snape is 50? I don't think there is anything unethical about that. Even at 18 Harry is already grizzled as fuck (understandably after all he's been through), doesn't bow down to authority and doesn't let anyone walk over him. I don't think as a mature adult there would be any imbalance of power between him and Snape.
