Just because Harry is an adult in the first instance and perfectly legal doesn't make it any less uncomfortable to think about. This is an older man having a relationship with a significantly younger former student.

In the second case, it could be acceptable only if the time travel happens when either participants is both physically and mentally the same age. IE no adult Harry time travels into the past where Snape is still in school and somehow physically de-ages. That's a mental adult preying on a minor, despite the fact both look like minors. 11yo Harry somehow time travels and meets 11yo Snape? Sure that's fine. They've gotta be similar ages both mentally and physically, with little or no underlying relationship before the time travel, otherwise that's just wrong.
