In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9821300?view_full_work=true][Swung by Serafim]] Snape was best friends with Lily not in love with her. Harry loses his memory when Lockhart obliviates him and Snape gets over himself and becomes good and survives the war. They are implied to get together at the end when Harry is grown up. Snape does a lot of good in this. Becomes headmaster and changes things for the better.
