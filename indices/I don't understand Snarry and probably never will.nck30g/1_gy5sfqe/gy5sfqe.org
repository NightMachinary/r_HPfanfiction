I personally am indifferent to it, but that's because I find Snape unattractive and have little interest in seeing him in a romantic relationship. But I can somewhat understand why other people would find him and Harry together to be interesting. They have an antagonistic and complicated relationship, and some like that sort of thing. If people just want to read healthy, vanilla HP slash, they'd stick with shipping Harry and Ron. And though Rarry is a very lovely ship, it's not everyone's cup of tea. We all have different tastes.
