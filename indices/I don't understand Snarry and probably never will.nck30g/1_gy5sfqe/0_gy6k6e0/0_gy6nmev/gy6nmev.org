It's all a matter of taste, I'd say. Most people prefer Drarry as the choice for an enemies-to-lovers slash ship, but that sort of relationship has a different dynamic compared to Snarry. Draco's antagonism towards Harry is much more juvenile in nature. He's the schoolyard bully. Also, his cowardice and the way he's consistently the butt of the joke may turn some people off.

Snape on the other hand, is a far better antagonist. He's an extremely talented wizard and his quick wit makes him a worthier opponent. Add in all the details surrounding Snape's past with Harry's parents, and Snarry is easily the more layered and complicated ship.
