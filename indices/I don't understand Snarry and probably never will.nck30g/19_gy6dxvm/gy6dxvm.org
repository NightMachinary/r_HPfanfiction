When I was a teenager I was deep into snarry and drarry. Looking back its because I found it very interesting to disect characters in complicated and often toxic relationships from a safe distance. I got all the emotional drama without the real life consequences of having that kind of relationship myself. I think its more like a kink? Like people writing about bestiality and other subjects I find disgusting but as long as its just fiction its okay.
