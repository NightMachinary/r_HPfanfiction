Dean/Seamus I think had a fair amount of movie fodder (things like them always being together and dancing together at the ball). That one seemed a bit like a joke ship tho. I haven't seen it in years.

Ron just doesn't seem to be very popular... there's a few Ron/Harry fans and a lot of people do like him with Hermione, but a lot of people just straight up either hate Ron or don't care about him. People tend to experiment more with characters they like or find interesting, and Ron isn't a strong contender for either.

Neville on the other hand, while likeable, doesn't seem to be very... interesting I guess? Like he's friends with Harry, but the two aren't particularly close... and it doesn't feel like there's a super interesting story to tell about them getting together. I think there's a fair amount of potential between him and Luna that a lot of fans enjoy, but imo there's not really anything between him and the other characters to build upon.
