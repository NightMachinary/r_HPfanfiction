For a while, I was seeing a number of Dean/Seamus fics. Did kind of wonder why it was just them. I'm not into slash really, but I was seeing enough of those I was wondering if I missed something somewhere about them.

Now that it's come up, I wonder why Ron and Neville are almost always depicted as straight, at least as far as I've seen. I've maybe seen one in which Neville wasn't hetero. Almost every other character seems to have had their alignment experimented with.
