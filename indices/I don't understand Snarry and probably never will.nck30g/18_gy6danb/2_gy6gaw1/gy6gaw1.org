That's mostly because the only two fleshed out female antagonists are Bellatrix and Umbridge... and let's say Narcissa. While Hermione is also often paired with Bellatrix or Narcissa... come on, no sane person wants to write Umbridge other than as a nasty power obsessed cunt who tortures kids for fun. So not much of a choice there.
