It's more satisfying to be convinced by a story that has them go from enemies to lovers. This happens in straight fiction too, it's not a slash fanfic thing. Like Mr Darcy and Elizabeth in Pride and Prejudice, Will and Lyra in His Dark Materials, Johnny and Baby in Dirty Dancing, Han and Princess Leia, Buffy and Spike, 10 Things I Hate About You, Tangled, Beauty and the Beast, Princess and the Frog, Frozen.

Imo the more they hate each other, the sweeter the romance when the author has convinced me.

I really love enemies to mentors, too. Going from 'I want to kill you' to 'I would die for you'.

Snape/Harry still has the opportunity for that post-DH growth you describe that's possible for Drarry. The vast majority of Snarry fics are set post-war, not say mid-HBP.
