I definitely understand that exists to an extent - but it seems like the vast majority of slash fic in Harry Potter is of that variety. I don't think it's the same in m/f fics, where we still see Harry/Hermione and Harry/Ginny as the most common, with Harry/Luna, Harry/Daphne (which can, but often does not, use this trope), etc. bringing up the rear. The one real exception to this is Draco/Hermione, which is just as popular as the above. In terms of other enemies-to-lovers pics, Harry/Pansy and Harry/Bellatrix are there and definitely have an audience, but its nowhere near as big a proportion as Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort, or even Harry/Lucius.

As far as Snarry, that might be the case now and will take your word on it. I remember pre AO-3 (before I could exclude fics from the search) it seemed most of them were still at Hogwarts, which eww. I definitely have much less a problem with enemies to mentors
