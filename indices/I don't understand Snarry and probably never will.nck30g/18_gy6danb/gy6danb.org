Snarry suffers from the same problem most slash in Harry Potter does - for whatever reason, the fandom insists that the only m/m pairings that can exist are with antagonists. I will never understand why Snape/Harry and Voldemort/Harry are so popular. Draco/Harry isn't much better but at least has the space post-DH to allow for growth on Draco's part (similar with Draco/Hermione)

Why are Harry/Ron and Harry/Neville, for example, so rare in comparison to the aforementioned pairings? Do male relationships have to come from conflict? It's interesting because I don't think f/f pairings generally follow the same rule
