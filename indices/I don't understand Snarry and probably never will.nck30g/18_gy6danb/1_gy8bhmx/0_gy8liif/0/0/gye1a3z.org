Do we? It's not exactly difficult to make any of the male characters LGBT. They should have similar amounts of people to choose from - why no Harry/Ron or Harry/Neville? That requires changing the canon sexuality (which I have no issues with) of two characters the same as Harry/Draco or Harry/Snape (and Harry/Voldemort if you consider Cursed Child canon).
