I didn't say it was slash exclusive. Dramione shippers are pretty much all women since Hermione is the female si, and lots of slash readers are women too, so female fans have more villains and rivalries to ship in HP.

This sub (majority straight guys) tends to question why Dramione, Snamione, or slash pairings involving DEs are so popular, and I'm saying, we have more variety of characters to choose from than they do.
