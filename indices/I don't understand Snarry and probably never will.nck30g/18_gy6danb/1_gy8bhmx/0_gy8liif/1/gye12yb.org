There's a difference between popularity and near exclusivity though. Dramione is popular, and there are also a large number of Snape/Hermione fics. But we also have a lot of Hermione/Ron and Hermione/Harry, as well as a smattering of other Hermione/male good guy fics.

My point was that in slash its near exclusively Harry/antagonist. Outside of Wolfstar, the most common m/m fics are Draco/Harry, Snape/Harry, and Voldemort/Harry, with Lucius/Harry being a distant 4th. There's no equivalent to the aforementioned Hermione/Ron or Hermione/Harry with, say, a Harry/Ron or Harry/Neville.
