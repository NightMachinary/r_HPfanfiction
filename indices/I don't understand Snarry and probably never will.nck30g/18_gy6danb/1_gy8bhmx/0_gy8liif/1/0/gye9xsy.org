They're hard to compare, though. Hermione/random male characters and Harry/random female characters is bulked up by a lot of self insert shipping (aka people just shipping easy to write main characters with characters they personally want to bang). You're not really going to get the same amount (and variety) of that for queer ships when most of the authors are straight.

The role that Hermione/Ron fills in fic is the same as the role Remus/Sirius fills (aka popular basically married couple who are often tagged as a background ship to the couple the fic is actually about). Harry/Hermione fills the role of "two most popular characters shipped together" which is basically what Drarry is as well.

I just think you really have to consider the context in which these ships are born... not just the relationships between the characters but also their role and relevance in the story, the alternative shipping options available, and how people engage with those ships.

Outside of HP, whenever there's two male characters who are close friends, they're almost guaranteed to be the top ship. But if the guy is friends with someone fans don't like that much, they're not going to be that motivated to ship them and create fanworks for them. Hence why Ron and Neville aren't very popular in ships that aren't either explicitly canon or heavily implied.
