Was fairly bored and curious about the spread of HP slash ships, so I dug through Ao3 to get some numbers. Did eventually get bored of that, but I did get some for Harry at least.

*Characters in a ship with Harry that have over 1k fics:* Draco (39.4k), Snape (10.3k), Tom Riddle (4.8k), Ron (3k), Voldemort (2.4k), Cedric (1.2k), Blaise (1.1k), Lucius (1.0k), Charlie (1.0k)

*Characters in a ship with Harry that have over 100 fics:* Fred/George (749), Draco/Snape (728), Original Male Character (720), Neville (626), George (459), Fenrir Greyback (453), Bill (430), Fred (253), Draco/Blaise (203), Percy (203), Dumbledore (200), Oliver Wood (176), Barty Crouch Jr. (120), Draco/Ron (112), Newt Scamander (112), Dudley (101)

I may have missed a few, but we both definitely underestimated how much ron/harry fic there is. Also I don't know how the voldemort/riddle fics are split but even with those two combined, it's almost less than I'd expect given how much people talk/complain about it.
