  It's interesting because I don't think f/f pairings generally follow the same rule

There aren't as many fleshed out female characters in HP for straight guys and lesbians to find pairings for. Straight guys are also a smaller minority of the shipping community, so it's hard to gauge what type of pairing they would go for. Pansy/Hermione is one of the biggest femslash pairings, and Millicent/Hermione also seems to have a sizeable following.

Just off the top of my head, I know lots of lesbians also love Shego/Kim from Kim Possible, and Villaneve from Killing Eve. There just needs to be more fleshed out female villains for them to choose from.
