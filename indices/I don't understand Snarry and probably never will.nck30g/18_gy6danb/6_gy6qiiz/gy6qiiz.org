Totally agree. I've never been a fan of pairing the heroes with the villains. I also dislike Harry/ Bellatrix and Hermione/ Draco for this reason. Sure, write Harry as gay if you want, but pair him with Krum, Cedric, OC, etc. But noo, let's pair him with the racist, terrorist wanna-be, bully or the abusive teacher who is old enough to be his father and hates his guts and my favourite- the psychopathic terrorist who murdered his parents and is old enough to be his grandfather. This is why I can't take slash fics seriously. The homosexuality doesn't bother me. It's the endless hoops writers have to jump through to make the pairing even remotely possible, let alone realistic.
