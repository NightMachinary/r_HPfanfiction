Remus/Sirius is right there and hugely popular in the fandom. I can't speak for other sites, but there's more wolfstar fic on Ao3 than there is snarry and Voldemort/harry combined.

Scorpius/Albus is another friends to lovers ship that's fairly popular (though they have little canon to go on apart from The Cursed Child, which many fans aren't a fan of).

Harry in particular just has several strong antagonistic relationships with major characters that fans find interesting to explore.
