Honestly, I like Snape and he's my favourite character. Here's a powerful, competent give no fucks person, and fan fiction gives authors the opportunity to take that base of Snape character and build upon it. Some people find the age gap distasteful, personally it doesn't bother me, because the fics are mostly Harry's (or Hermione's) POV, which equals MY POV as a reader. It's essentially me and Snape, but Harry as the POV medium (though I do think Harry should be at least 16+). Do I think that sort of relationship is acceptable in real life? Hell no! Do I need to hold my entertainment to the same standards I have for real life? No (how many movies with murders are rape are out there?)

My favourite Snarry fic is the Marriage Stone (unfinished). Heads up it's a forced marriage fic (I just like this trope, outlander anyone?) where Snape does not take advantage (no sex at all), and they slowly grow to respect and love each other, and over 70 odd chapters builds the culture of the wizarding world in the best way that I have read, you see Snape as person with more social standing, powerful Harry coming to the realisation that he ended up falling for the person he was forced to be with.

I just want to read my favourite characters getting into MY age appropriate adventures. Remember, you asked.
