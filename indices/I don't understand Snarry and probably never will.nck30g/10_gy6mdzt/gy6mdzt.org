But its fanfiction. It doesn't need to make sense. People don't have to write about relationships that are healthy and definitely not ones there would have preferred in canon. Sometimes people write a certain pairing because the idea is an interesting one and they can build a story very different from canon. Harry isn't always canon Harry, and in this example Snape isn't always canon Snape. It's just a story that exists in that world, not a representation of the authors opinions.

The first time I saw the Harry/Voldemort pairing I was like... What?! How?! But then i read it out of curiosity over how they made it work and now it's one of my favourite pairings. Not because I think it's healthy or something I would have preferred in canon, but because it can make a story interesting when they explore that dynamic.

Now in all fairness, nothing about the Snarry or even Drarry pairings has ever pulled me in, but I think that stems from disliking Snape and Draco and having no interest in reading any more about them. The same goes with the Harmony pairing and that's a healthy one.

I think there is still a lot of love for Snape and people who do want to explore his character more, and a Snarry pairing can be a method of that.
