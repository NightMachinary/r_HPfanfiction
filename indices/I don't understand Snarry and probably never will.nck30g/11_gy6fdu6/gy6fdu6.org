There are a lot of great long form commentaries on why people ship Snarry, some of which have been linked earlier in the thread. I think what I find most compelling is the idea that despite their differences, Snape and Harry are quite similar. Both had abusive upbringings, but their choices led them to vastly different outcomes. I, personally, like to believe that Harry became the Dark Arts professor after graduation and that that is when the relationship begins. What I find interesting too is they're both snarky, and Harry is really the only one to ever â€˜give' it back to Snape. I think that in an ideal world, Severus would need someone who challenges him, despite his outward resistance too it. I also love the tension that enemies to lovers brings with it as a trope, and I think Snarry can bring out the best in this. The fact that Snape never reveals his feelings adds this thick tension, and this is where Snarry really shines in fanfic in my opinon. Tl;dr I think its a really interesting ship that allows for an interesting look into the characters. Ship and let ship as they say!
