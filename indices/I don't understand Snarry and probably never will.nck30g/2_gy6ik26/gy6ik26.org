It's okay to not like something and still understand that people may like that thing for one reason or other. You don't even have to understand why they do like it for you to be okay with people liking things different than what you like.

Having said that, I don't like or dislike it. It's one way things could be written, and written well. Fanfiction doesn't need to be canon compliant. If I want canon, I would read canon. My theory about fanficiton is that it is a different world than canon, a world created by fanfic writer for writing their story.

A Snape in one fanfic can be a baby eating, blood thirsty rapist, while a Snape in other fic may be a lovely dove who like to sing and dance. It's whatever a writer wants to write. If I don't like it, I close it and move on. It's fanfic. At the worst case, it's free entertainment that I can close the tab of and read other. At best, I may get a new story with different theme and different lessons as characters of different types engage in conflicts.
