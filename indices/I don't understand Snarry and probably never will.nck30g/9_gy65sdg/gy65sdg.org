Snarry attracted great fanfic authors and has some really amazing fics with depth and beautiful writing better than most books. As a reader I haven't really found that kind of writing in any other HP ship or HP gen. Except maybe the occasional rare pair. I don't want to speak for what got them to write Snarry. But I am so grateful we have their fics.
