Try:

- "The Most Powerful Magic" by cjr2 . IMO this is a great gentle introduction to Snarry. Over a decade after the war, Snape wakes up from a coma and meets the next generation of Potters and Malfoys. Really interesting take on the "love conquers all" theme that is center to HP.

- "Sub Rosa" by cjr2. It is pre-slash covering Harry's last few years of school, so again a great gentle introduction to the genre.

- "Fate is a Four Letter Word" by Philo . 40-something Harry married to Ginny with teenage children. Absolutely riveting and brutal "who-dun-it" murder-mystery-conspiracy-spy story that will keep you at the edge of your seat until the last chapter. If you only ever read one story where the main pairing makes you go "urgh, not my cup of tea", make it this one.

About the only story that can somewhat hold a candle to "Fate" would be cambangst's "Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood", just in case you have read that. Both stories have similar plots, but in comparision I find that "Fate" is funnier, has the better OC's (Kingsley's mom is a hoot) and overall better writing and more plot twists.

- "For Auld Long Syne" by Cybele2013 . Very long and very good. Hard to describe, but basically Harry and Sev orbit around each other, wanting to be together but life interferes.

Some shorter fics:

- "The Boy Who died a lot" by starcrossedgirl

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]

- "Chrysalis" by starcrossedgirl - trigger warning sexual abuse and PTSD [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/304714]]

- "How we were warriors" by writcraft . This story focuses on what it meant to be a young gay man in the 1980s and in the late 1990s and the challenges. Really interesting read and character study.

- The Finder's Series by Gateway Girl. The part on how they get together is a bit yuck and not well done, but I love Ron as an Auror and the exploration of moral ambiguity.

- Nobody's Saviour by suitesamba AU. Harry grows up as a Muggle and never goes to Hogwarts.
