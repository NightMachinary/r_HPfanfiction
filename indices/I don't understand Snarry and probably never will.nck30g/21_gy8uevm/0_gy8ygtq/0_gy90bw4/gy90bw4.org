There's a ton of conflict between them - conflict is necessary for a good story. No one wants to read "Harry and his wife woke up in the morning and agreed about everything and nothing out of the ordinary happened and then they went to bed" because that's boring as hell. That's why animosity pairs are fun to write and read about - it takes effort and creativity to turn them from enemies to lovers. It's not realistic, but if I wanted to read reality I'd buy a newspaper.

Sorry if I am a bit rude, it's just that no one ever asks "why Snarry?" in good faith - it's almost always asked in a way that implies Snarry shippers are bad people, and that if you like Snarry you love molesting kids or some shit. So we tend to get defensive.
