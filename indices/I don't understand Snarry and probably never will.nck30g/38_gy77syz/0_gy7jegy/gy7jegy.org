A lot of tomarry fics are set before Tom's 5th year so the first horcrux hasn't been made. And muggle bombing is terrifying so it's an /explanation/ for not wanting to die (explanation, not excuse) also the whole abused and never knew love thing

Drarry doesn't have to be toxic! Draco has redeeming qualities so post war fics where both are more mature are possible.

If you can have tomarry then why not Snarry? Voldy is even older than snape so make it a time travel thing and the age gape isn't important. Also, wizards and witches apparently live longer than muggles so if they are 40/60 or older age doesn't matter that much.
