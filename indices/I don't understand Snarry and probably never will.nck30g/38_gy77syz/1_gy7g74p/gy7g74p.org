I am not going to say that there aren't horcrux Tom/Harry but most of the Tomarry is set in AU with Tom and Harry going to school together or being on the opposite sides in the political field and there are some absolute gems so dont judge a ship just because you havent read it. The same goes for Drarry and Snarry its set in different times different ages it all depends on the author and the readers who read them. I think the reason most readers turn towards Slash is because of the writing and Tomarry, Snarry and Drarry has some of the best fics, now dont get me wrong I am not saying there aren't good Het fics out there but compared to Slash its very less, I mean the most hit fic on Ao3 is a wolstar fic.
