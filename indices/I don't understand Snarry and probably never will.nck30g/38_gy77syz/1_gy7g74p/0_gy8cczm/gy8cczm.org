Your personal opinion - you like slash - doesnt mean gen/het arent good. it's the audience , as a straight guy i rarely read slash other than some exceptional Aus like Death of today ...

and like i said - with au time travel plot points writers always invent a non canon excuse for their ship - anyway it's their story they can do whatever they want- i Personally don't bother with them unless the focus is on the plot and the pairing
