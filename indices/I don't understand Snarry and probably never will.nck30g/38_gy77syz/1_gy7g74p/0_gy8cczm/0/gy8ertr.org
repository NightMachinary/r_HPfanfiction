I didnt mean to say Gen/het fics aren't good I just said compared to slash there less good Het fics and as far as Gen is concerned I love gen fics some of my favorite fics are Gen. For me personally if the plot is good and no Harry bashing I read it. As for the "non canon excuse" I am talking about fics where the universe is completely different just the characters are same can be magical or non magical AU. Most of them do not follow the canon wars and everything

Edit: I am a straight female and I love reading Snarry and at the same time I also read Snape bashing fics. So in the end these are just fics what I read and what prefer in my personal life are two completly different things
