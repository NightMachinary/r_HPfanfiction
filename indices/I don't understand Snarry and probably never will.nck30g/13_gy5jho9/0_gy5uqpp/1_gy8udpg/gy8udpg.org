I'm sorry, I don't really keep track of fics I read, but if you want to find time travel snarry fics, I suggest filtering "time travel" with snape/harry, or searching for "de-aged snape", on ao3. I found so many gems that way, and I enjoyed a lot of them:)

Also! If you're interested in other Mia_ugly works, I have a link to an old one that is also snarry, but not time travel. It's on a really old archive:) I haven't read it yet, but I love anything by her so I have high hopes.
