For me, Snarry is an interesting concept. I personally don't ship it but I've come across fics (that are very AU) which create an interesting premise.

A lot of ships are popular because of the possibilities the two characters bring to the story. In a Harry/Ron or Harry/Neville there isn't a personality contrast and no significant barriers to getting together unless there is a conflict introduced in the story. So these can seem “boring.” But with Snarry and Drarry there's a lot of stuff to go through, and it can be interesting to read about.
