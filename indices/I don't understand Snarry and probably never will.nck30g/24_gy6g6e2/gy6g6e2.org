I've read a couple of snarrys, and if it's not pwp (which you don't have to /understand/ because porn) its harry and Snape being sad over their shitty lives.

I dunno if they want to snarry to be canon, but these two characters that have a lot in common and I think shippers want them to reach an understanding. (Kinda like mentor Snape fics?)

I also believe there's a self intserty aspect of it too, which im /assuming/ is the main reason snamione exists.
