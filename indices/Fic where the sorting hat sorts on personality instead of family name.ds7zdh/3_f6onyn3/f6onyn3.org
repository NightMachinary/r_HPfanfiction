Personality types often run in families, and if you take the sorting as a kind of psychometric personality test, you'd find that houses do.

It's funny, though, that I'm the only Ravenclaw in my household according to the Pottermore test. My parents are both Gryffindors and my brother's a Slytherin. I think my cousin's daughter might be a Ravenclaw too, but I can't remember with certainty.
