The way I see it, it doesn't sort on personality and traits that one has in the first place but rather on values and traits that one wants or admires, plus an element of personal preference. For example, what Hermione had would make her a perfect Ravenclaw, but what she valued and wanted (Change the World, whether the world wants it or not.) is a Gryffindor value.

Taken together, personalities and traits that are at least somewhat hereditary and the values learned during the student's upbringing would certainly make houses run in the family very much.
