The only way in which a Slytherin would want to change the world is to put themselves and those they consider their own on top. (E.g., Voldemort, the Malfoys.) A Gryffindor, on the other hand, wants to change the world for what they see as a greater good, even if they have to sacrifice to do it. (E.g., Dumbledore, Hermione.)

IIRC Neville wanted to go to Hufflepuff. Anyway, my headcanon:

​

‘Not Slytherin, eh?' said the small voice. ‘Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that.'

‘No doubt?' Harry thought back.

‘Well, it could all go horribly wrong, but they made me to be optimistic and to focus on the positives of each House, so I can't really talk about that. Like, say, that one earlier whose hair could barely fit in me---I could've told her that no one in Gryffindor would like her, but I couldn't, you see? Just like I can't tell you whether one or more of your dormmates might resent you for your role in their parents' boss's demise enough to try something. Honestly, if I were sorting based on what could go wrong, Hufflepuff wouldn't be the biggest House; it would be the only House. So, yeah, Slytherin will definitely help you there, if you can survive it.'

‘Can I survive it?'

‘I'm a Thinking cap, not a Seeing cap.'
