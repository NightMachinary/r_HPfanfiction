Reality though, is that personality is highly heritable. [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25961374][This]] study estimates that the genetic component is 40%. The abstract mentions that actual twin studies indicate a higher genetic component of 47%.

So individual personality traits aren't as heritable as height, but since there are a bunch of different ones you're going to share going to share something like 47% of your personality traits with your parents even if you've never met them and have grown up with other people. People who actually grow up with their parents are going to have share more personality traits.
