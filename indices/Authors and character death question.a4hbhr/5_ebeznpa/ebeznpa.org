Suicide/self sacrifice specifically is a tricky subject that can piss of a /lot/ of readers, or at least turn them off, so I usually only include that unless it is what the fic is built around; it's a topic you have to really commit to.

The thing with MCD is when I decide to go down that route, I think of other options that /don't/ require the character dying that could be equally terrible, and whether or not MCD is actually vital to the story or if I could achieve the same things if they lived. If the story really works with character death, considering the absolute nature of it, the huge emotional impact of it, the implicit understanding of it by other characters that can't be achieved otherwise, then I include it, and it is /always/ a hugely critical moment of the fic.
