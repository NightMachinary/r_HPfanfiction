Often a character dies to remove their skills from the team to force someone else to step up, or to grow someone else's arc, or to escalate the tragedy or seriousness of the story.

I've never had a character kill themself but in-universe and out-of-universe, that could be to promote conversation about mental health or secret suffering, or just in-universe, to impact other characters and move on their arcs or change direction.

For example, using canon as reference, a common character to die is the powerful and experienced mentor (e.g. Dumbledore), forcing characters to find solutions that don't rely on using his knowledge and expertise first-hand. The difficulty is also escalated because without Dumbledore, the enemy can move more openly as there is no longer an equal opposing force to them, and he is no longer insurance to rescue our heroes if they get in over their heads.
