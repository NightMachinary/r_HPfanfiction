I'm not [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] so I can't speak for him, but I tend to think that part of the fallout of someone dying is the people they leave behind.

Harry might not be overly fond of Fleur, but if something bad happens during the Second Task, then it happens when he's concerned with making sure Fleur's hostage gets to the surface safely.

That's some great dramatic irony: Harry helps Gabrielle to the surface, but Fleur isn't there trying to get back to Gabrielle. Harry witnesses a /nine-year-old girl/ realizing that her big sister, who loves her more than anything, is dead.
