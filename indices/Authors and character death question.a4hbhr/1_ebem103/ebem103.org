Well, that depends. When I killed off Urdont Wrex in one of my stories (a Mass Effect story, and Wrex is a fan favorit), I wanted to hit the reader with an emotional punch and make them HATE the people that killed Wrex, as well as understand the blind rage that lead to two reasonable sides go to war because one was framed. Whenever you kill a fan favorite, you have to be aiming for that sort of visceral reaction and sadness.

When I killed off Delores Umbridge, what went through my mind was AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.
