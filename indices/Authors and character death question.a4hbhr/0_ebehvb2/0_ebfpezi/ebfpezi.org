I agree with this. In a story with war or enemies that are supposed to be scary, capable or bringing a nation to its knees etc. Character death serves as a way to introduce risk and tension to the story. MCD does this at a high level by showing no one is safe

In my opinion it makes the story better, so long as the death serves the story.

On thing I kinda dislike is post-DH stories where everyone survives because I feel like it cheapens Voldemort and the fight that happened there.
