Ultimately the author decides if a character decides to kill themselves or not. I always found this "character become almost self-aware" [[/r/writing]] circlejerk a bit over the top pretentious... well, or highly concerning regarding the sanity of the author.

  Much more, what are they thinking about when their character decides to kill themself?

When they decide to kill the character.

I happens that you come to points where the in-character decision making suprises you. The "oh, yea... that really /is/ what my character would do" and it often leads to interesting places in a story (and can easily derail a carefully laid out plot for that matter). Vice versa it can seem wooden at best and out-of-character at worst for the author to glance over a character's consequence. However, the consequence of death is only one of many of equal if not more severe impact. "I'll kill myself" is often the most uncreative of them, and too often in novels, one that means absolutley nothing and only leaves a bad taste in your mouth going onward.

Personally I feel like the death of a character, when it adds to a story, is a worthwhile end for it. It may be a little sad if the character was fun to write, but if the overall end-product gets better with it, I'll gladly accept that.
