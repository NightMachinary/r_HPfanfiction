When it's not Dan & Emma or some variation on that, I usually see Wendell & Monica (from the fake names Hermione gives them).

Until and unless they are "revealed" on Pottermore, I doubt there will be some consensus.

I'm mostly a Harmony shipper so I use Dan and Emma myself, or some variation on it (I like using Damocles as the father's name).
