...I never, until this moment, got the "Dan and Emma" reference. And wondered after reading it in several Harry/Hermione stories if all those authors just went with the first one chose. It even took me a moment after "Ruper and Emma", like "what does it have to do with the pairing?". I feel stupid now.

Other than those names: I think I never read the same names twice (at least nothing memorable).
