Richard 'Dick' and Jane, because they are normal, boring, and mostly unimportant to the story; they need very generic names.

Also, you could have a scene where Jane and Hermione go shopping in Diagon Alley, so Harry and Dick go to the Leaky Cauldron. Tom, Dick, and Harry are sitting at the bar...

However, it would make a Third Rock from the Sun crossover very confusing.
