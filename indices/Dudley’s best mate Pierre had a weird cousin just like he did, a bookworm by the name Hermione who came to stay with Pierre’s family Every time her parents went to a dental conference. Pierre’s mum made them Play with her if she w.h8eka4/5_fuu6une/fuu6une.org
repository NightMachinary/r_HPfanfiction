I wonder if this happened regardless of which member of Dudley's gang ends up related to her. She reads about The-Boy-Who-Lives and because she never saw/noticed Harry's scar when she was in Surrey. Also she and her parents end up believing The Dursley's stories about Harry. So when she meets him on the train, she is all they got the wrong Harry Potter this one is a bully, thief, cheater, juvenile delinquent, ex... She can not believe that both books and adults can lie so instead insists that Harry is lying.
