Maybe, but it's still far fetched. For reasons I have explained upthread, I would expect his associations with her to be positive rather than negative.

Regarding Hermione fan, I have a well-known pro-Hermione bias, and I think that she is a much more interesting character than Harry (but only if you don't forget her flaws). However, for me, at least, all that is independent of her relationship with Harry. Most of my favourite fics (such as /Applied Cultural Anthropology/) have them be friendly acquaintances at best, and I prefer the canon pairing to Harmony.
