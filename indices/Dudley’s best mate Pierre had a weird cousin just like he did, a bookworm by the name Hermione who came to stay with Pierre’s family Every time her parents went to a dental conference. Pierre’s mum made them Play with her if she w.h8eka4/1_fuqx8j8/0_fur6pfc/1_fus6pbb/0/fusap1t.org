I'm a bit divided about how Harry would feel about a Hermione he met pre-Hogwarts.

All the points you made are valid, but early Hermione is also someone who is pretty . . . "trusting" about authority figures. I can as easily imagine her annoying Harry to death because "/I heard you climbed you school wall while playing with . . . (Malcom?) and his friends, you should not do that you could have been hurt, or expelled/."

Worse, when they both go to Hogwarts, she could tries to stuck with him because she at least knows him, or talks about subjects Harry does not want to talk about like his family.

So I feel like, if they met before Hogwarts, their relation could really go both ways. Either a bit better because Harry has some fond memory of her and his willing to bear with her or help her make friend, or worse because he 3 several more years worth of memory of her being annoying compared to the rest of the school.
