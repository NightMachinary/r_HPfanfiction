I can see that happening, though it'd probably have to come from Polkiss's/Malcolm's mum warning her about Harry based on what she had heard from the Dursleys.

I can see this going in one of two ways, then: either she ends up having an unpleasant exchange with Harry and they spend their time together reading separately, or she sees through the ruse and goes an a crusade to help Harry, possibly without telling him (at least if we want to maximise adversity and conflict).

OK, this could be an interesting sequence of events:

1. Dudley, indeed, does not bully Harry in front of Hermione.
2. But, after Hermione sees through the lie, she tells her parents that Harry is being bullied by his peers and possibly abused by the adults in his life.
3. The Grangers talk to the Dursleys, who deny everything, Dudley's friend's parents take the Dursleys' side (since they are committed to the Harry-as-miscreant narrative), and the whole thing culminates in Hermione no longer being invited to the Dudley's friend's house.
4. The Dursleys take the stress of the situation out on Harry.
5. Two years later, Hermione runs into Harry on the Hogwarts Express, having lived under the assumption that she had fixed the problem by telling her parents, and she tells Harry as much. Harry thus learns that she is the cause of his additional misery two years prior, and tells her as much. Hermione is too proud to apologise.

[[/u/CommanderL3]], I stand corrected: your idea could work, and work well.
