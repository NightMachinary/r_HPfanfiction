That sounds more than a little contrived. Early-canon Hermione is socially inept, but she isn't malicious. She would probably end up being the first person in Harry's memory to treat him as a human being, even if she might sometimes be annoying to be around and they would have absolutely nothing in common.

If anything, I'd expect Dudley to be nicer to Harry when she is around, because she can and will tattle to Mrs Polkiss and to her parents, and then Vernon and Petunia might find themselves socially obligated to do at least make a show of punishing Dudley.

I don't expect them to become close friends, but them becoming enemies is a stretch.
