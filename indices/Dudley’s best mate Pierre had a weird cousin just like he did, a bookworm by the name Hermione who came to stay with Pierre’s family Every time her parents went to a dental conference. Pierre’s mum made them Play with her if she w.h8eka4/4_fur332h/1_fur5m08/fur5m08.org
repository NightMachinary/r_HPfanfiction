I disagree. I see no reason they wouldn't become good friends.

By the introduction to Hermione on the train Harry is at least somewhat aware of his fame and is well on the way of making a good friend (Ron). Hermione is an over achiever who is aware she is an outsider from the get go and already trying to prove her worth. If they met before Hogwarts Hermione whole probably still a book worm know it all would probably not immediately be trying to prove that she belongs. Harry is shown as a pretty friendly kid who is lonely and without friends. Two kids who are picked on and outcasts becoming friends isn't really a stretch of imagination.

I like the trope because I think a Harry/ Hermione friendship early on would be beneficial to both. Hermione would give Harry the dash of real normalcy and a friendship outside of the fame / the world of magic. Harry's friendship with Hermione younger would probably help with the self worth issues and her social skills.
