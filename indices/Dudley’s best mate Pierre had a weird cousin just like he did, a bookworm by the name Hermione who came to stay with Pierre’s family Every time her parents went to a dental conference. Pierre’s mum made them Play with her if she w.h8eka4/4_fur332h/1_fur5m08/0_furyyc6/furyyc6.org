I disagree. Hermione, as much as she grew on me, was who she was. She changed a bit throughout the books, but not a lot. She bossed Harry and Ron all the way through and was unerringly annoyed by their lack of certain knowledge. She was 100% Hermione when she first showed up on the Hogwarts Express, and I don't see her being any less bossy and know-it-all(ish) in the few years preceding her introduction to Hogwarts. Besides, how do you explain Harry and Hermione not recognizing each other when they met on the train?
