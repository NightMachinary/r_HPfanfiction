I'm not arguing that it's cannon or would fit in without changing cannon, but that it fits their characterization as pre hogwarts children.

I also think your vastly oversimplifying Harry and Hermione as characters. They change and grow over the series which is of course going to happen because they grow up but also as friends they begin to shape one another. I think they could have some growth and give each other much needed perspective from the beginning without drastically altering their characterization. I think Hermione knowing Harry before hand gives him the ability to start with more information. So he goes into the wizarding world more aware of people's pre conceived notions and how he/ his family fits into it. Sure it's information through books but he'd be less clueless, have opinions, and have the ability to emotionally process some of this information before hand. A more grounded Harry Potter, even if still a bad student and clueless would be nice. Especially because I think it makes more sense, Harry is shown throughout the series as being emotionally reactionary but he just takes in being famous and rich and everyone knowing (fake) stuff about him with barely a comment which I always felt was strange. As for Hermione a major complaint for her earlier characterization is she completely lacks perspective (seriously death or worse expelled ) and tends to be over reliant on books, which is something she grows out of somewhat. She could still be a know it all swot but at least she might be slightly more inclined to question information given her. You've got to think books are her only information on this brand new world. Of course she trusts what they say, it's literally her only source. But if she knows Harry Potter, sees how clueless he is from the start and how poorly his family treats him? But then she reads history books with fake characterizations of him or implying he is off being rich and heroic and she knows he's her friend with a bad home life ? Yeah that isn't a child whose going to just accept information from wizarding books without some more fact checking. A Hermione who gets to the point of using books for knowledge but asking questions and seeking others sources from the get go is a character that's fun to think about.

I think where a lot of fanfic that's pre hogwarts fails is that it doesn't explore subtle changes of characterization and how it might change cannon so much as people try to use it as either a way to start a romance or as an attempt at a fix it fix. It gets boring and repetitive because people forget that the characters are freaking 11. Of course Hermione still going to be bossy and Harry will probably be be reckless and both will make dumb mistakes. But I think the idea of them making different dumb mistakes is fun to look at, or things that turn out the same for different reasons.
