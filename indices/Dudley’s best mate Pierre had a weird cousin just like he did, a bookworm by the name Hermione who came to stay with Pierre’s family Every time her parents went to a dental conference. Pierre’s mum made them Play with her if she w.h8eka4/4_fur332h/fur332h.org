I don't get the obsession people have with introducing Hermione to Harry before Hogwarts... usually through some contrived scenario, or really odd flukes. The idea has been a thousand times to death, and the particulars of HOW Hermione happens to be introduced early is, for the most part, irrelevant.

Even if they did run into each other earlier, I doubt they would "become the bestest of friends 4 evar". I seem to recall that even meeting her on the train, she was pretty much just that bossy, annoying know-it-all that was pretty much ignored up until the whole troll thing happened.

Sure people cry "But they are both magical, and would recognize that!". Well... no. If accidental magic was that common, that obvious, then magic would not be much of a secret what with all the muggleborns changing peoples hair, teleporting to roofs, regrowing hair overnight, etc. Harry is likely an outlier in accidental magic frequency and visibility due to his home life, and/or child of prophecy, and/or horcrux. I expect most accidental magic boils down to easily explained accidents and freak chance. Easy to miss, but obviously magic in hindsight once you know magic is real.

So I expect that even if they did meet before Hogwarts, Harry would be uninterested as he was in cannon, and neither would realize they are both magical.
