the whole character motivation behind James in the story is that he feels like Harry favors Al and Lily because he sees Ginny in Lily and himself in Al and James doesn't see where he fits into that. and then my OC thats his love interest in this enemies to friends to lovers arc over his time at hogwarts is a muggle born witch who wants to help other magical species like centaurs and goblins and house elves and then i wrote this scene this morning as the resolution and realized that i just made Ron and Hermione 2.0
