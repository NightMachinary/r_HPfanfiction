Linkffn(Brother in Arms by SteamGeek01)

This one is a creepypasta crossover and it's got slash, moderate but plot-important bashing, and moderate but skippable gore, but it's got 93 chapters and it's not done yet. The author seems to have writer's block but since quarantine is keeping us inside and bored I'm hopeful.

Linkffn(The Red Dragon by Yes I am using a typewriter)

This one has Gryffindor Draco, Harry x Luna, and Misguided-but-good Dumbledore. It's also got 93 chapters and is sadly on indefinite hiatus.

I can't link series' from ao3 but I'd have to recommend the Well That Just Won't Do series, in which Lily is a ghost and is done with how everyone treats her child. It's got Slytherin Harry and minor bashing if I remember correctly.
