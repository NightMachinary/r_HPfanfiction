Living with Danger + 4 sequels linkffn(Living with Danger whydoyouneedtoknow) It is really long, each part about 200k words or more, but really well written! Especially in the sequels, it shows some traits in Harry that I really enjoyed, like him being more considerate, and less “no one ever understands me”. At the same time it's not all about Harry, but gives other characters some space to develop aswell. A very good read!
