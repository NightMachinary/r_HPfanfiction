Second one. It looks less obvious that you used a filter to give it the "illustration" effect.

Btw, people don't care about covers unless you're posting fics on Wattpad. FFN's cover thumbnail is so small that no one would be able to read your curly cursive word art. It's the summary and tags (if you're on Ao3) that people care most about when looking for new stuff to read.
