The right version is much easier to look at and understand at a first glance since the color choice draws my eyes to the illustration and wording without straining my eyes or attention.

The cover on the left seems much more blurred, less concise, and it's much harder to focus on the words and illustration due to the colors in the background. Since the background is very colorful, the wording is very colorful, and the character is a bit colorful it confuses me on where to look. For instance, I glanced from the illustration to the title a number of times because focusing on them both was a strain on my eyes.
