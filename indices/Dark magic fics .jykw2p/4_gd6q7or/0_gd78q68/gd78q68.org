The only thing that comes to mind is that fic where Harry and Tom keep being reborn into different lives and they regain their memories every time they meet eyes. Sometimes both are girls, sometimes both are boys, sometimes one of them is one gender while the other is the other, sometimes they're siblings or mother/father and daughter/son, sometimes one is way older than the other, sometimes they get married and have families, sometimes they're from different countries or whatever, sometimes they're in the future or the past, sometimes they're Muggles, and sometimes they're witches/wizards. The fic basically goes over these moments where they relive their first life and Harry and Voldemort. Dumbledore's reaction to Voldemort's "son" dating Harry is hilarious.
