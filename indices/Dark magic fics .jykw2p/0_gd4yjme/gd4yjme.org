[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]] focuses on dark magic, and dark magic also plays a pretty big part in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20719073/chapters/49221263][In Willing Sacrifice]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]]. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079][The Art of Self-Fashioning]] isn't technically about dark magic, but it is about Harry secretly doing dangerous magic, so it has a very similar feel.
