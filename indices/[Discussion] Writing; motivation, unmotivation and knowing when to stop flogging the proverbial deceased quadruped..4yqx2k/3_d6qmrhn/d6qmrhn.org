I write because I like it, and my stories aren't popular. In the past I sometimes got depressed about that, but I will continue to write and I don't let a lack of comments spoil my fun. If you think someone else could better write your ideas, you could post a 'story' in which you explain them and let others pick an idea they want to write. That's how I got an idea for a story once as well, but I haven't finished it yet (it was my mistake, I think she could have better written it herself.)
