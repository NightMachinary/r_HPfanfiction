I used to be really nervous about writing fanfiction, and felt like I had to please the followers. I didn't want to update too late and really wanted the story to be perfect and it wasn't fun anymore, so I took a break and began writing on my own. Now that I've grown up a bit and have become more confident in my writing ability, I write for myself. It helps that I have fun with the story. I'm still nervous about what people will think about it, but not nearly as much as before. I say you should go for it. I've had trouble making sure I finish a story, so I began making myself write an outline for what happens before I write the story. That way, I'm no longer stalling about what happens next, but how to write it.
