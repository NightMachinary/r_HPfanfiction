  So do other people struggle with this sort of motivation?

Eh, not really. You aren't running a race. If you end up writing it, dislike it, and throw it away without publishing a word of it, then you should still be happy with what you managed to accomplish. Time you enjoyed wasting is not wasted time.

  Specifically if there is hardly any audience for what you write, do you find the will to keep going or do you give up and move on?
#+end_quote

Take the good, leave the bad. For me, I do it because it's a fun, relaxing hobby that beats sitting on my arse watching television or films. If I ever stop enjoying it for whatever reason, I'll stop.

  You can't please all of the readers all of the time; you can't please even some of the readers all of the time, but you really ought to try to please at least some of the readers some of the time. ~Stephen King, /On Writing/
