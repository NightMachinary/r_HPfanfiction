Well, yes, I don't (except in my darkest moments) regard any of it as a complete waste of time. If nothing else it's been good practise and an exercise in self-discipline (never one of my stronger traits, it has to be said). And I certainly agree that anything creative has got to be better for the mind (hopefully staving off the onset of dementia in my case) than watching tv.

When it comes to pleasing readers it's a bit more complicated. I quite like my own stories; if I didn't, there would be something badly wrong. At least I've always got something to read, I suppose. I am not professional enough to tailor what I write to someone else's taste though; I always twist things back to what I want to see, which is not what most other people want to see. Ha.
