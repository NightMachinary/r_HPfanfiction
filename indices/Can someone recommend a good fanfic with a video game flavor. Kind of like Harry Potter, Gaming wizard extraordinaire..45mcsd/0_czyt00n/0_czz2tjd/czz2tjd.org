Why hasn't the bot linked these? Is it beacuse the whole address is there?

The Adventures Of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited linkffn(9708318) is an old favorite of mine. The problem with them is that they always just stop updating... I'm not sure I've seen a single compete one. I think the authors realize just how hard it is to keep track of everything and for it to remain fresh and interesting. Some others: linkffn(8052743), linkffn(10309134), and linkffn(10563477).
