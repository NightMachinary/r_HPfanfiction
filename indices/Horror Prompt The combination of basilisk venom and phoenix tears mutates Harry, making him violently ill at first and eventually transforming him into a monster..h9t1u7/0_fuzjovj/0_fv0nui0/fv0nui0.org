I continued it a little, if you don't mind :D

Two men in suits were situated a bit away from the cordoned-off section, one of them sitting on a barrel and the other with one hand laid on his shoulder.

"It's... this might be the worst case of homicide I've ever had to witness. They were /torn apart/, whatever got into that house had claws sharp enough to rend bone. These people weren't killed, they were /eviscerated/. I don't know if I can continue after this."

"It's alright, tap out and wait for me at Dave's. We'll drown it out with a bit of the ol' fire-water, I'll finish the examination here." The other man squeezed his shoulder once, then began walking towards the house, blue flashes cutting through the mist.

"John!" came a call from behind him.

He turned around, looking at his partner's ashen face.

"Be careful."

Albus was currently reading through a thick, grey tome whose cover was stained with something black. It had no title, for it didn't need one - The feeling one got while holding out a hand and feeling its aura was enough to know the subject matter.

Suddenly, Fawkes went wild, teetering strange, discordant tones that inspired not hope or happiness, but a confusing jumble of emotions, and shortly thereafter one after another of the small, silver instruments began deviating - one exploded, another began whirring, another simply stopped dead, and one with a crystal at its center began glowing blindingly and then went dark with a fizz.

As soon as the first one had began to make noise, the ancient tome was thrown carelessly aside, and Albus vaulted over his table, wand appearing in his hand. He strode over to the table, wand glowing various colors of the rainbow (and a few others besides), before cursing in both german and english alternatingly and yanking his wand over his shoulder, which made a small pot of floo powder shoot into the fireplace.

Albus barked "FIGG!", and jumped through the flames.
