Harry tried. God, he really tried.

Ever since the Chamber he felt wrong, different, like something was /growing/ inside him. It wasn't literal, of course, otherwise he would have ran screaming to Madame Pomfrey without any worry for her incessant prodding.

He just felt /wrong./

And then Marge showed up, all bluster and fury - pointed questions shot his way like bullets, vicious in their intensity. He could hardly stand her, the woman on her fifth glass of wine and Ripper snarling from between her legs.

The pain in his forehead was new, not the sharp sting that ran through his skull like the end of a nail, Quirrel staring down at him from the end of the Great Hall. This was dull, throbbing, pulsing out from his head and working its way down his spine sparking shivers all the while.

Harry caught himself nearly growling in return, eyes fixated on Ripper and his jaw tight.

"Boy, did you just /growl/ at my puppy?"

"No," Harry uttered thickly, his voice low and strained. "Wouldn't dream of it."

Marge huffed. "All snark." She pointed at Vernon, one sausage-like finger extended from the thin stem of her glass. "You don't beat him enough, do you?"

"He is at St. Brutus'... aren't you boy?"

"Yes, sir."

"Strange. I'd thought an institution like that would still use a cane."

Vernon glared at Harry.

"Every day, ma'am."

"Ma'am? Do I look a day over forty? No? It's /miss/ to you."

"Yes, /miss."/

"God almighty." Marge chuckled aloud, shaking her head. "A little beast, aren't you? Just like your mother, bitch that she was."

In that brief, glimmering moment, the pain in Harry's skull stopped. He blinked, only given a second of respite before it came thundering back, all claws and sharp edges as it chipped at his mind.

He howled, collapsing to the floor as a bestial scream erupted from his throat. The skin on his forehead split, sharp horns bursting from the thin flesh and spraying blood across cheap linoleum.

His hands cracked as the bones in them shifted, extending, reaching forward into wicked points that pulled towards his wrist. Harry screamed again as his back twisted of its own accord, spine lengthening into a tail of pale white, interlaced with ropes of muscle - no skin to be found.

What stood in that tiny suburban dining room was no longer Harry, not truly. Not entirely. Its skin was thick and scaled, subtle patterns running across his arms and just barely catching the light. Sharp protrusions of bone poked out of his flesh in no real direction but /out,/ resembling more of a bramble patch than any living thing.

Marge and the rest of them could only manage a reasonable response to such horror, that of screams and panicked motions toward the sliding door, some primal part of themselves urging them away - to be anywhere but in a room with that /thing./

The noise that left Harry's throat could be described as nothing short of wretched, like falling stones wrapped in flames. It crackled and hissed, echoing out across Privet Drive and sparking real, true fear in its inhabitants.

He lunged.
