Self-promoting here. linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) has him turn into a literal five-headed dragon. That fic's stalled because I'm so damn indecisive about how much more of his humanity I want to take away from him. I must have rewritten the newest chapter like six times and I'm still not happy with it.
