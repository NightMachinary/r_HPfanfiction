As other people said, I also love your setting.

In fact, I just reread the last fea chapters to catch up.

[Minor SPOILERS] To me, a gradual process of the protagonists shifting away from their former humanity sound cool. Like, the more time it passes, the less connected to the rest of humans they are (maybe seeing them as inferiors/annoying? Idk), and the more they embrace their new entity (being five but not really [like tiamat]). But hey, its your story and up until now, it is going great. [Minor SPOILERS] END

Sorry for the rambling, but I really like these kind of stories. Yours specially :3

All in all, great job writting it and I am sure that whatever path you decide to follow will result in a great story.
