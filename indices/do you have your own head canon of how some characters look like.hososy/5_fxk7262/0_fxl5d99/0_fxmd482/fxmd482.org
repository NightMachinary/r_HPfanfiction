He would have been such a good casting choice, I think. He's Danish, so can speak English with a slightly Germanic accent. He's a good actor and has established ability to play a complex villain. He's charismatic enough to play the leader of a revolution. He's attractive enough that you can see how Dumbledore would be infatuated with him (notwithstanding that Dumbledore was most attracted to his mind/talent). And Game of Thrones was popular enough at the time of FB1 that he would have brought some star power to the table at the time of being revealed (though admittedly not as much as Depp).
