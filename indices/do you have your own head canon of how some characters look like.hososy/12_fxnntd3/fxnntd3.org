I always imagine harry to be at least a head shorter that most boys. And after third year I imagine him with shoulder length hair that he ties into a ponytail and messy bangs that fall all over the front of his face. I imagine this for multiple reasons. 1) Harry's hair grows SUPER fast, as mentioned in the books so at one point i imagine he's just goes â€˜fuck it' and just lets it grow out . 2) it makes it easier to hide his scar.

I sometimes imagine snape to tie his hair half up and ware rectangle framed glasses. I also imagine him as tall and relatively slim with a daunting presence. I also think he would look a lot younger than Alan rickman, so like his mid 30's.

I imagine fleur with silvery hair and an almost ethereal beauty as she is part Veela.

Imagine Remus as a man with messy dirty blonde hair and bags under the eyes. I also like the idea of him having a comforting presence but slightly sharp teeth and strong fingernails.

Sirius is a handsome but older looking man with unruly shoulder length black hair and sharp features. I also thong he has a bit of a wild glint in his eyes and smirks all the time.
