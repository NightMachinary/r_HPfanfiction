I have my own idea of how Harry looks because everytime I pick up a fic, it sometimes gets to the point where the author changes his appearance so much (or never describes him at all) that I just drew how I think he looks because I get confused and my imagination starts to fail me.

I know it's a little anime-ish, but it's how I draw lol
