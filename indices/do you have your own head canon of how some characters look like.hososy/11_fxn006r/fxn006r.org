Yes! I have very specific ways certain characters look(i.e, Harry, Draco, Luna). It's a thing I always do.

For my examples, bc I can't draw:

Harry has messy hair, but my main idea is that he actually has really curly hair it's just that, since it's cut so short, the curls don't complete themselves or lay flat, and therefore it gives the untamable hair. In a lot of my stories, Harry actually grows his hair out, and this becomes clear. His eyes change shade in different lighting, so while they do normally appear emerald, they can also look anywhere from jade to a dark, forest green. His hair, is certain lighting, actually turns a deep red, because his hair has a red underlay. It also creates the appearance of his hair being a warm black rather than neutral. His skin is very pale, which makes his scar and hair stand out even more. His scar is a more, almost cartoonish lightning shape. He's very short and skinny, a product of be malnourished. His face is round, and it's very obvious when he blushes. He carries himself very loosely, but if he's nervous his whole body tenses up.

Draco has his hair almost side-swept, but it's all very neat and slicked down with a shit ton of hair products. His hair actually shines is some light due to the amount of oil he puts in it. His eyes are actually silver, but it's not much different than just having gray eyes. His skin is pale and almost looks slightly gray. He's overall a very light color pallet. He's tall and thin. His face is sharp and pointed, and he doesn't blush, not really. He flushes, but only just enough that his cheeks turn pink. It takes more than a second glance to catch it. His posture is generally very tense, so it's hard to tell if he's nervous.

I'll put Luna later.
