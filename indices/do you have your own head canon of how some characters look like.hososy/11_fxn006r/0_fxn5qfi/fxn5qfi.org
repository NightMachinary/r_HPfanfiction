Draco sounds like he ran out of blood

Honestly I have a similar look for him tho, except he uses powder makeup to not look red cos white people can't avoid that naturally. Also I dont slick down his hair because I hate the mental image, he grows it out instead. He's got the Malfoy chin, nose and colouring, but the Black eye shape (large, lidded), bone structure and lips. He grows from looking a lot like Lucius to looking more like Narcissa. Also I make him androgynous looking, and very tall.
