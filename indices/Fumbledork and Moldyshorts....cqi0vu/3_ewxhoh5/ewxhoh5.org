I wish they'd understand that truly horrific villains aren't mocked by their victims. Jews on trains to Auschwitz, kulaks in Siberia, Cambodians in the killing fields, cities looking at Mongols raising a black flag, none of them came up with "funny" and "cute" nicknames for the monsters responsible. It's not so funny when you and everyone you know are going to die.
