It's one of the things that will seriously make me consider stop reading the rest of the fic. It's fine to use it once or twice if the situation calls for it (like in a jokey twin sort of way for instance), but when the characters speech and inner monologue is riddled with it I can't keep reading. The worst thing is that the author somehow seems to think this makes their character more mature and independent, while all it does is show them being petulant and childish.
