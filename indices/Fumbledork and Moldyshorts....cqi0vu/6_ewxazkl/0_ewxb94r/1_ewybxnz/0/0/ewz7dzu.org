I've also read so many fics where a large chunk was devoted to becoming an animagus pointlessly. If Harry is an animagus, but it doesn't really help the plot, it should be background info, nothing more. But if you're going to focus on it, it better be relevant. I have actually a few examples of times where Harry became an animagus form and it was very helpful to the plot.
