The thing about those names is that they just feel so unrealistically tame. I don't know how British teens talk when referring to their betters derisively, but in my experience it's outright swears, not silly little wordplays. Kids I knew growing up would say "that fucker" or much worse, not "moldyshorts". I get that maybe it conflicts with the tone of Rowling's original work but so does 90 percent of all fics written.

That said, I love reading Indy!Harry fics where the author thinks Harry sounds like a badass when he says those dumb names, and not like a huge fucking dork trying to be edgy.

  "You won't manipulate me anymore fumbledork! You meddling fool! You're not my dad!!!" Harry yelled at the mirror as he listened to his blink-182 album for the 13th time that day.
