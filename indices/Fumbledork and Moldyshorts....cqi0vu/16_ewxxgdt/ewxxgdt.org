In fairness, canon Harry does deliberately use Tom's birth name, instead of his chosen title, to get a reaction. And there's an established pattern of creating affectionate or nasty nicknames - Moony and Padfoot, "Loony" Lovegood, the Slug Club, Phlegm. And Dumbledore's stated reason for using the name "Voldemort" is not to show respect, but rather the opposite, to show a lack of fear. So using a derisive nickname like "Moldyshorts" is not exactly far-fetched.
