Yeah, the only time I actually use these is in the plotting phase. Not in my actual fic. And even then it's just Dumbles and Voldy because they are faster to type. I'd drop a fic pretty quickly if this was in it. Although... I could see like a drunken crack!fic scene where they try to come up with the most outrageous names... shit, go away plot bunny!
