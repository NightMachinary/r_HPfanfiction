I'm not a sniper (lol that autocorrect, I'm totally leaving it), but I do read some of the better Dramoine fics. A lot of the time, they bond over academia. While there isn't any canon evidence that Draco was studious, according to Rowling he was an occlumens, he fixed the vanishing cabinet in his sixth year/ made the plan in the first pace/ managed to come up with shitty on purpose plans (which imo sounds more difficult), and there's a quote by Rowling saying he preserved and displayed all of his family's artefacts. So I think he is a little nerdy, he's just got other things on his mind as well.

Btw, kudos to you for writing something out of your comfort zone.
