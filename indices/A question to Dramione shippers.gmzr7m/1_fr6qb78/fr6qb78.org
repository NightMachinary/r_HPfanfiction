Should probably be flair'd as “discussion,” not “request”, as the “request” flair is for asking for recommendations for other fanfics.

I'm not a Dramione shipper, however. My first thought is of forbidden fruit, but Draco is such a daddy's boy he always adheres to his father's wishes to the best of his ability in canon, so unless you change his nature quite a bit...

My other thought would be, since he's a pureblood, and therefore better than Hermione in every conceivable way, he'd be obsessed with besting her, and perhaps this obsession gives way to something else.
