Perhaps I'm biased, but I don't think we should be jumping to conclusions about her mental capacity. Besides, people with high-functioning autism and Asperger's can consent too. Her innocence seems to be more of a coping mechanism than actually thinking that people will not do any harm to her.

Furthermore, though when we meet her she says that her shoes went missing instead of acknowledging that her housemates stole them, at the end of the series she has seen war, the Carrows, her father being captured, imprisonment etc. I'd say she isn't as innocent anymore and certainly has friends.

Due to her frankness I can actually see her saying things like 'you have a very nice bottom, you know' matter-of-factly and making people uncomfortable... she would probably be open with her thoughts and desires.

I do get where you're coming from though. I'd /nope/ at anything below fourth year Luna because it's strongly implied that she has no friends before then, and would be vulnerable (she said that DA is almost like having friends) - and anyway, she'd be 14.
