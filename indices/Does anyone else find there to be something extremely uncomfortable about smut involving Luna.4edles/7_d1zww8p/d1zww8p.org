She only appeared child-like. I always sense an incredibly tough girl underneath that mask.

Once she was brought into Harry's circle, she participated in almost every major engagements. Leading the DA in year 7 was no minor feat, and surviving the final battle without injuries was a huge accomplishment. It was also her who drove away scores of dementors and saved the trio's lives. The fact that she could still conjure up such strong happy memories when the trio could not, should indicate how tough she really was.
