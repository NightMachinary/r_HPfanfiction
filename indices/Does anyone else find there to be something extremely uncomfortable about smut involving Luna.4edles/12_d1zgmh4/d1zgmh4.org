Well, I get where your coming from and I think it comes from this. Luna is eclectic and in some ways possibily has a mental illness, whilst awesome and such it seems like it would be very easy to manipulate her because of the way she is, and that would be wrong. I see it as sex with someone who has limited capacity to make decisions, it's really wrong, and I think that group includes Luna.
