I see Luna as a mile-marker for gauging the growth in the more prominently featured characters.

So from my admittedly strange point-of-view, I see Harry/Luna more as Harry/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver_location_sign][Driver location sign]]. She's less of a character and more of a plot device for me.
