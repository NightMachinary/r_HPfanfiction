I've always pegged Luna as having Schizotypal Personality Disorder than anything on the autism spectrum; she has no trouble reading and interpreting the facial expressions of others, for example (in DH she recognises a polyjuiced Harry from his facial expressions when no one else does).

[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizotypal_personality_disorder]]

"People with this disorder feel extreme discomfort with maintaining close relationships with people, mainly for the fact that they think that their peers harbor negative thoughts towards them, so they avoid forming them. Peculiar speech mannerisms and odd modes of dress are also diagnostic signs of this disorder. In some cases, people with STPD may react oddly in conversations, not respond, or talk to themselves. They frequently misinterpret situations as being strange or having unusual meaning for them; paranormal and superstitious beliefs are common."
