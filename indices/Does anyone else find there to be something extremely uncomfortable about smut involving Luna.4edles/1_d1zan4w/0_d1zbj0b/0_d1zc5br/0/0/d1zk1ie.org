As a high-functioning autistic, I'd have to agree with your evaluation. Luna is potentially on the spectrum in my eyes. But then you immediately follow that with "Luna reads like a child to me", and that... let's just say that hits some personal buttons for me.

Luna has never felt childlike to me. Spacy, disconnected, imaginative, but not simple-minded or overly innocent. I can easily see her in a sexual relationship. Why? Because I am spacy, disconnected and imaginative as well, but I'm not some sheltered little virgin who's innocence must be protected.

Sorry. Again, personal. TL;DR, being autistic or autistic-like does not preclude one from having sex.
