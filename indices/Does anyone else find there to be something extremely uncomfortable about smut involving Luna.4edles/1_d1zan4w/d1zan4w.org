Shall I reuse a statement I made elsewhere? I shall.

Luna can't be done right as a pairing. She can be done very wrong, but for a romantic lead during the time of the novels, she sucks. Why? Because when she's written in-character, sex with Luna seems more like pedophilia than with any other character. Harry screwing with Gabrielle Delacour seems more legitimate.

The girl is painfully shy and socially underdeveloped. She may be insightful, but always seems to exhibit a level of detachment usually associated with Autism (of the Asperger's syndrome variety) or sociopathy. If Harry gets hard for that, he's got more issues than I'd originally assumed.

In the fandom, there seem to be a few key 'variant' Lunas to work around this:

- Var. A: Shag-ready hippie. Popularized in 'Lovegood, Boobs Gooder', 'Larceny,Lechery and Luna Lovegood', 'Sword of Gryffindor' and many others, this is the sexual free spirit that guarantees a rating bump. If Luna's involved, there will be shagging. Not making love, mind you- it will be sport-sex. It has its purpose, but this isn't Luna by a far stretch.

- Var. B: Oracle-Sue. Found in any number of H/Hr/Luna arrangements, most Super!Harry epics (think Sunset/Sunrise over Britain) and the occasional Hermione-bashfest. This version has a thumb on Fate's pulse and arranges for Harry's particular brand of heroic blunder to somehow land on all the bonus squares.

- Var. C: 'Hiding beneath the weird' version of Hermione. This was JBern's take for his Second-person Cursebreaker!Harry duo, though I've seen it used before and since. It demotes Luna to a second-rate Daphne or Pansy. "I'm only faking it because I'm so damned smart. Let me show you how to own the Ministry."

- Var. D: Hermione's femme-slash foil. A variant you won't find unless you look for lesbian erotica, it plays up the contrast between the two as a much more soft-light 'discovering herself' story, usually post-victory. Always, Luna is the initiator and Hermione becomes her adept.

- Var. E: Yandere!Luna. This is really variant 'A' with a psycho killer backup plan. Found in a few DarkHarry fics (as well as the Spiral Path, but there isn't a good idea I haven't mishandled in that story).

- Var. F: Canon + 3oz of courage. A few have tasted this rarefied concoction. I think I came close with 'Retroactive', and the gold standard is 'Contemplating Clouds'. Luna is mostly Luna, but not so damaged- she's confident enough to open Harry's heart and her own. I don't think this works within the context of Harry's fight with Voldemort. She's suited for healing him after, but would distract him from focusing on his unfortunate reality even more than Ron does already.
