Only if it is abusive smut. Even if she has aspergers/autism or is severly traumatized or just odd i dont see having sex in a healthy relationship as something negative, so i dont see a problem with it.

My inner view of the characters if very minted by the movies sadly, and i just dont find the actress very attractive, so im not that big a fan of her in smut or erotica anyways (which is the same reason i dont like sirius, lupin or snape focused fics).
