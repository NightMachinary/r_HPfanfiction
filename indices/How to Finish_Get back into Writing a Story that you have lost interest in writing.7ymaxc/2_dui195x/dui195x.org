If you haven't even looked at it for a long time, read it from the beginning. It will probably fire you up again. If it doesn't engage you after a break, then you should ask yourself why. But the bigger question of "How to finish the Final Daft of a story before losing interest?" Well, you don't really. You keep plugging away even though you don't feel like it and eventually you get it finished. Writing a story Is hard work and anyone who says it's not isn't doing it properly. If you can't maintain a long fic perhaps you should stick to shorter stories and one-shots.
