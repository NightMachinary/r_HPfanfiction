If a story doesn't interest you enough to write it, how can you expect readers to be interested in reading it? Every writer knows how hard it can be to sit down and write at times, especially with a busy life, but if you lose interest and never want to pick it back up it might be a good idea to let the story go.

However, if you're really determined there are a couple things you can do.

First, change where and when you write. If you used to write in the evenings inside, perhaps try writing outside in the mornings. Sometimes a change of scenery or routine can help break the mind out of a rut. This isn't limited to writing.

Skip ahead in the story. Write your favorite upcoming scene instead of writing the next one. Sometimes when I do this I realize that the scenes that are boring me aren't really necessary at all and would bore the reader too.

Hide your outline and write based on ideas you come up with on the spot. Some of it will be usable, most of it probably not, but you still wrote something and it's possible you'll discover a story direction that interests you more.

Write at least one paragraph per day. The hardest part is getting started and you might be surprised by how many times the brain keeps flowing when you didn't expect it too.

Limit distractions. Turn the phone off, disconnect internet, whatever. Breaking immersion while writing is ten times worse for me than breaking immersion while reading.

Write something else for a bit and come back. Some writers function better with variety. I am more excited about writing when I have a serious project and a relaxed project to choose from, depending on my mood.

And finally, if you aren't getting paid don't make yourself miserable. If you want to write 150 words and stop, that's fine. The only thing you'll accomplish otherwise is the creation of memories that further discourage you from writing again.
