Why not? I've seen authors posting a new chapter in a COMPLETED story explaining that they've made changes in chapter X, Y and Z.

If they can do it and get away with it, then you can do it after posting the first or second chapter.

Or... you feel the need for a beta without knowing that's what you feel.
