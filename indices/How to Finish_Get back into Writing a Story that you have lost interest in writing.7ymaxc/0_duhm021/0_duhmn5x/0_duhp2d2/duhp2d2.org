  I like to go back and edit everything every time I finish a chapter(about every 3000 words).and i cant do that if I have started posting it.

You are not shipping printed books, you are uploading stuff to a website and can change it at any time. Otherwise, most stories would be riddled with small inconsistencies, spelling mistakes (spellcheck and betas don't catch everything) and so on. In most cases, people won't even notice minor changes, because let's be honest here, if you change the colour of curtains somewhere, no one will remember how it looked in the first place. 1 out of a thousand readers might go back to look something up, will see that it is not how he/she remembers it (because you edited it) and shrug it off.

I think none of my published chapters hasn't been updated at least 5 times after posting. Sometimes it is just a missing linebreak, sometimes it is an entire scene that get's a mayor revamp.
