Try the in-media-res approach where you jump right in the "action" while supplying what happened before through dialogue and other forms of exposition. That way you get to write the "juicy" bits without having to go through a few chapters of filler. For example, say you want to have someone befriend Harry after OotP but your main plot begins at Slughorn's party, where Harry and the friend show up together. Begin there and drop a couple of lines casually mentioning how they became friends, for example when someone asks this question. Harry became emancipated in Sirius will? Tonks taught Harry Occlumency? Can be explained afterwards, we don't need to see everything in order for it to happen.

You can also use this to write just the part you already figured out. Do you want to write a story where Harry has a nice summer for once? Do just that, limit the fic to the story you want to tell. Writing how that summer would impact Harry's next year lost your interest? Then don't force yourself to write that but limit your plot to the things you already figured out. It's called an open end.

Another approach would be to publish what you have written and use the reviews as motivation, especially if you are planning some surprising twists. That has been a great motivation for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12774582/1/Dawn-of-Darkness][Dawn of Darkness]], because the reviewers all comment on how they already figured out the plot and I am just laughing at them, thinking "Not even close". The desire to see the reactions of people can be a huge motivation, especially if they don't see things coming.
