Well, first you need to ask the basic question: Are galleons "actually" gold coins?

If they are, then the conversion rate between galleons and the British pound would be quite higher than Â£5(JK Rowling stated that a while back). And the goblins would HAVE to follow the muggle world's conversion rates from currency to gold, and vice versa, if they want to protect their economy.

If they are a combination of alloys that "look" gold, well, I'm not an economist, so I can't answer how an economy like that would work.
