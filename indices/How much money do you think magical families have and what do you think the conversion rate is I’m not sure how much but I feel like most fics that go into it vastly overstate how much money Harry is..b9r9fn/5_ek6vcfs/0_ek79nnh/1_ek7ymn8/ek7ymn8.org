Nice theory! And it would add a new depth to the statute of secrecy, while making it a bit more down-to-earth. Protecting the goblin gold from savvy muggleborn would make sense for the wizards and give something important for the aurors to do, other than walking around looking for Mandungus Fletcher or exploding toilets and disappearing keys.

However, can you imagine the logistics of that situation? From enchanting each individual coin, gold /and/ silver, with useful properties to searching for it in the case it's sold to a coin collector or sth. Sounds like an episode of "Aurors - Special Crimes Unit".
