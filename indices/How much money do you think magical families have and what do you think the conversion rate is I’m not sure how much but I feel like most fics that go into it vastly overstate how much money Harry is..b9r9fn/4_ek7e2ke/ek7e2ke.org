My co-writer and I were talking about this in terms of the translated cost of things from muggle to magical and found that things are much cheaper in the magical world, possibly because you can refill things (providing you have something to refill) and it's a lot like a story my Dad used to tell me. That back in the seventies, he could get a very good pair of boots that would do him ten years, sometimes needing a little repairs here and there and they'd cost him around £20 (about £80 today) with a few quid on repairs. When he was in the army, he could afford that but when he got out, he realised he wasn't able to blow that much in one go so he had to keep getting a pair of shoes every 6 months to a year and cost £3 (about £12 now). Over all, he'd end up spending over £50 (£200) getting lower cost shoes over the same time period because it cost about the same new as getting a cheaper set repaired.

I imagine magic is very much like this - if you can afford a large expenditure up front, you can reap the benefits of refills and repairs but if you're not skilled in repairing yourself, making improvements, it's beyond repair like some of the wands or there's something preventing repair, then in the long run, you have to pay out a lot more over time which could account for a lot of the wealth disparity despite magic being magic. You can also just gets things like the 21 galleon unicorn horns Harry see's in Diagon or some of the items in Borgin & Burkes, which will likely accumulate more worth over time as collectors will want them.

But in terms of how much things cost, it does seem like the magical britain is a cheaper place to live. You have to consider that Mrs. Weasley had not two Galleons (around £16 in today's money according to the site i checked) in her vault and had enough to clothe, equip her children and have drinks in the pub later. If this was muggle world money, then that would be impressive - my first uniform alone was £25 in 1997 and that was a regular senior school. Especially so, if you consider that Harry's wand cost him seven Galleons. The Knight bus, a sleeper bus, costs Harry 11 sickles, or £3.19 (£12 now) compared with the old overnight ones I used to take which cost around £28 (around £40 now). Butterbeers may be the exception in that they cost 2 sickles 58p or £2.30 now, not unheard of. Hermione even buys a black and gold quill which costs her fifteen sickles (£4.35 or about £17.50 now) when it's nearest comparison - a black parker pen with a gold trim - would cost around £60 in the shops now.

Frankly, it seems like if you have a lot of muggle money and translate it to magical currency, you'd end up with money that stretched further as well as magic preventing the need to replace many things. If wealth is indeed tied to competency in magic and large one-time expenditures which can be renewed, then it's easy to see how wealth can be stockpiled over generations. Add in that Fleamont's potion quadrupled what they had, it's no surprise that Harry had "mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze knuts."
