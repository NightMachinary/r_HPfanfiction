I feel like there is plenty of rationalization you can make from canon, if not explicitly written proof, that Harry has access to much more than we're aware of.

The Potter family is not part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, however they are a family as old as those who are. Rowling has stated that the only reason they didn't make the list is because whoever wrote it thought that 'Potter' was too Muggle of a name and, therefore, their family line must have been tainted. But given that they were a consideration at all, we can assume that they are, indeed, an old family.

Now, being an old family doesn't necessarily mean anything. The Weasleys are certainly an old family (and are, in fact, a family of the Sacred Twenty-Eight), but have very little wealth to speak of. However, even the Weasleys have family heirlooms.

Why are family heirlooms important? Because Harry's vault, from the descriptions in the book and from what we can see of the movies, are suspiciously absent of literally anything other than a pile of money.

No books, no portraits, no old-as-dirt broomsticks. Nothing. Except gold.

So there are two competing theories:

A: The Vault Harry is given access to is, indeed, some sort of Trust Fund setup until he's of age and could access the family vault.

B: The Potters, for whatever reason, store /nothing/ except Gold in their vaults.

While there is more obvious canonical evidence to support B, that evidence isn't mutually exclusive to A and I feel as though A is the more reasonable assumption of the two.

So we have other people in this thread saying that someone has 'done the math', as it were, and have estimated Harry's network, according to the only Vault we're aware of, to be in the range of $600,000. If we're assuming that's simply a Trust Fund, perhaps one setup before his father knew he would be dying and, thusly, is just a normal Trust Fund Harry would have access to until his death, there's likely much more waiting for him.
