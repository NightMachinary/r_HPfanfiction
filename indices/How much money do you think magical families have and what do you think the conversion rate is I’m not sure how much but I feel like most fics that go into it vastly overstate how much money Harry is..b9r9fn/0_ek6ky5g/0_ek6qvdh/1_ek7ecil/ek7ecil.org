  Ron's quote that always made me roll my eyes about people complaing that FF authors raise the exchange rate

Yeah my head canon has always been that a galleon is something like a $100 bill or a $50 bill - a large enough denomination that a school kid never would've held one before. I grew up comfortably middle class and I don't think I ever had occasion to actually handle a large denomination bill like that until well into adulthood.

Somewhere you've gotta be willing to change canon if you're trying to create a reasonably coherent system. That or contort yourself into knots trying to make canon "work."
