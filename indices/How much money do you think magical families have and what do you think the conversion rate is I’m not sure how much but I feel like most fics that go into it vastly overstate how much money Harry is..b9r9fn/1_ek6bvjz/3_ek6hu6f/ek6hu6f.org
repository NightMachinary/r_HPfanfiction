That always struck me as just about right. It's a goodly chunk of money that means Harry is comfortably off, but not /wealthy/. Especially since as a magic-user he can handle a lot of day-to-day needs with magic. So your typical, safe 4-5% interest would give him a yearly salary that would be middle-ish class in the Muggle world, but since his need for money is lower, would probably be a good upper-middle-class yearly income.
