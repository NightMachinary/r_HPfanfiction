Yeah, certainly right. Although I'll confess that I've got a weakness for one aspect of the "helpful goblin" trope - if the MC actually asks about investments and such, the goblins are more than happy to do wealth management in addition to just lockbox services. In my head, they'd be more than happy to do so for some really outlandish fee (forget Vanguard mutual funds with a 0.5% fee rate, we're talking totally usurious 25% of gross profits type deal).
