Except Gringott doesn't give any interest. While the "bank" do some activity comparable to the ones in the Muggle world, such as exchanging currencies, we don't see anything in canon that indicate that the possibility of interest.

Also, the safe are this, safe box, with the galleons stuck inside, a normal bank use your money to invest and then gives you some interest from the money created, if your galleons are inside a room, they don't create any money and you probably loose some to pay the fees of the safe.
