Well I'd chalk that up to differences in cost in the muggle world and the wizarding world. That or "Rowling have no consistency". Except within the books it is consistent that the Weasley's have very little money, I don't recall which book it was, but one time Harry and the Weasley's go to Diagon together he notes that the Weasley's had maybe a +handful of+ galleons and the rest were *58* sickles +and knuts+.
