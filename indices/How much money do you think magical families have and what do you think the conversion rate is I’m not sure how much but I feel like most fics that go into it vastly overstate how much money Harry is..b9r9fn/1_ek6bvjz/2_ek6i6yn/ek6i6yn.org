5 pounds per galleon might be the rough exchange value, but compared to the costs of living and wages I think the real value is closer to 25 pounds per galleon, considering the price of goods like newspapers, wands, omniculars, etc and how much the manufacturers of these goods can possibly earn. With characters using a wand for years after only paying 7 galleons for it, Ollivander can't really make that much money even as Britain's only wandmaker. So if he has a salary that's well above the poverty line (which he has to have, otherwise he'd raise prices) then the living costs in Diagon Alley are considerably lower than London.
