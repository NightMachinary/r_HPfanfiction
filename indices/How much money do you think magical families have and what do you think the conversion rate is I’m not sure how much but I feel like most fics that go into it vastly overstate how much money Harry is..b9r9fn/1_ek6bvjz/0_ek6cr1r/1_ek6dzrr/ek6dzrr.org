Yeah, you're right. The estimate of $25/galleon is much too high. If we assume an exchange rate of £10.54 per galleon based on the inflation calculation quoted above and Rowling's £5/galleon comment, one galleon would be worth approximately $13.73.

Doing some quick back-of-the-napkin math, we come up with a net worth(based on the estimate of the number of galleons in the vault from that link, the exchange rate quoted by JKR for the worth of a galleon, the assumption this was the exchange rate circa 1991 and the inflation calculation above) for Harry of $659,040.00. as of the moment he visits Gringotts for the first time.
