The worth of a galleon also fluctuates greatly depending on what it's for. 1000 Galleons was evidently enough to rent/buy what appears to be a big store with a great location. If that's the case, his canon vault alone is enough to buy out most of Diagon Alley since I doubt there's that much more than 50 stores there.

On the other hand, people have risked their lives competing in the TriWizard Tournament for 1000 galleons (I doubt the price of a galleon in magical purchasing power has changed much over the years). Pricing and purchasing power in Harry Potter fluctuates a LOT in canon, I'm pretty sure the school books and etc. cost a hefty amount as well, that's heavily disproportionate to how much it costs for other things.

Lockhart's books for example, cost 35 galleons in total. That's the equivalent of 5 WANDS - which Ollivanders probably sells at most 200 or so a year. How on earth does he even afford his rent and supplies when WWW spends Ollivander's entire yearly earnings on just starting up the business? Stuff don't make sense man.
