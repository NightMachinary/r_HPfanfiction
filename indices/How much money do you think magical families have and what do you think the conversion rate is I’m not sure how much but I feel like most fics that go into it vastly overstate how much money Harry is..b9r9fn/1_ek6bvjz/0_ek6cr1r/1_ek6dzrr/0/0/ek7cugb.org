  Lockhart's books for example, cost 35 galleons in total. That's the equivalent of 5 WANDS - which Ollivanders probably sells at most 200 or so a year. How on earth does he even afford his rent and supplies when WWW spends Ollivander's entire yearly earnings on just starting up the business? Stuff don't make sense man.

Lockhart is a gloryhound that requires students to buy ALL 11 of his books. Ollivander is a pragmatic but fair and professional. Now 35/11 = 3.18G's. So yeah, well willing pragmatic vs a glory and wealth seeking SoB.
