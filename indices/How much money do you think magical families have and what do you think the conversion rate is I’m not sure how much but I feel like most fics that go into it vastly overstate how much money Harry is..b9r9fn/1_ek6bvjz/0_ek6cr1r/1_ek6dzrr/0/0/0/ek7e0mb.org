Nah definitely agree with that, I just mentioned it since people were MORE than willing to pay that price for the books which to me is pretty ridiculous considering how much more they cost than A WAND.

Considering the fact that Ron was using his brother's old wand (7 galleons) which later snapped in half in the second book and couldn't get a replacement until the Weasleys won the lottery in book three, how on earth did they afford those books?! What's the priority here. How does money even work in the wizarding world.

Also not exactly canon (even if it's written by J.K. Rowling) it cost 30 galleons to smuggle people between countries (with a 20 galleon charge to not tell anyone Newt Scamander was leaving the country). HOW IS SMUGGLING PEOPLE (A MAJOR CRIME IF CAUGHT) CHEAPER THAN SCHOOL BOOKS!? -Again I stand by my point that the purchasing power of a galleon shouldn't have changed with muggle inflation)
