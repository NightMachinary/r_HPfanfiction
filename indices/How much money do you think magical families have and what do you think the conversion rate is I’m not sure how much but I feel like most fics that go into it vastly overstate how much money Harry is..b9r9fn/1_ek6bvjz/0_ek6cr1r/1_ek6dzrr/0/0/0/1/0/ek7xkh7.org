Yeah if you take inflation and stuff into account it's pretty reasonable but if anything, the worth of a galleon should have gone UP instead of down (as in Newt's 20 Galleons would be worth 5 Galleons today) after two wars which wrecked the economy. They can't just print money since.. it's gold.

Regardless, I don't see a real reason for the change in value of wizarding money since it isn't tied to the muggle economy besides the exchange rate (which makes no sense) set by Rowling.
