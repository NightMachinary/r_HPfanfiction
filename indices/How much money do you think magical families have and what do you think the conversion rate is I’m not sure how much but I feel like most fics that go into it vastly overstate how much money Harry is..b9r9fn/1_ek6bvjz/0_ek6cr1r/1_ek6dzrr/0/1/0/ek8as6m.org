That's pretty interesting for a fic to go into detail like that but was it relevant to the story/plot or was it just there randomly LOL

I feel like having wands worth 49 galleons is a lot more reasonable than 7 haha I wonder if there's a second hand black market for stolen wands

Still odd how the Weasleys couldn't afford new ones though
