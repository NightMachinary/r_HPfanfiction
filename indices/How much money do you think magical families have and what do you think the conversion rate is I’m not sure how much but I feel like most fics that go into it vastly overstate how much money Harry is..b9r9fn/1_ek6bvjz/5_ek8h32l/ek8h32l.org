  Harry's family money isn't meant to be realistic. It's pure wish fulfillment

TBH, I kinda feel like it's that way in canon too. Like everything an orphan kid who's always worn hand-me-downs and lived under the staircase could ever want. And that's not a bad thing, it's meant to take our minds off the money, so we know Harry doesn't have to worry about /that/, at least.
