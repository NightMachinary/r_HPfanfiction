Barnes Potter vs Harry Potter

A typical example of the type of fic you're looking for.

Oblivion

In all seriousness this is a story I've really enjoyed. Hopefully it's updated soon. It has pretty much all of what you're looking for with a few twists. No real knowledge of The Elder Scrolls series is required, although it doesn't hurt to look things up now and then.
