Despite the huge amount of HP fics that exist, I don't find the fics that are Harry-centric and take place in Hogwarts to be incredibly interesting unless there's some twist (AU/dimensional travel/fem!Harry). I really do enjoy marauder era fics (though a lot of them tend to be Remus/Sirius which I don't love bc their characterizations are always a bit weird). I've been getting a lot more into next gen lately...the fact that we don't know have that much established info on them really allows people to get creative.
