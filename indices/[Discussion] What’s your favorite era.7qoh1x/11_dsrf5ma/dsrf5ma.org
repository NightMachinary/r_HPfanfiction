I think you can write an interesting story set in any time period (and lots of people have done), but in terms of canon, as Sirius is my favourite character there is a fairly narrow period between PoA and OotP to explore. But since canon tells us next to nothing about what Sirius was doing when he wasn't with Harry (which was most of the time), it is a very rich vein to explore. Otherwise, I think anything post-canon has lots of potential and I have discovered to my surprise that I quite like adult Harry and adult Draco.
