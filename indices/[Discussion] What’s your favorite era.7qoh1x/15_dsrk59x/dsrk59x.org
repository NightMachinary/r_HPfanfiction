The Harry at Hogwarts years are always going to be my favourites. I'm also quite fond of Harry in his twenties, to see how he copes with the war, how he builds his new life. I prefer an adventurous take on it, a Harry saying "fuck it my life has been shit until now and I'm going to make the best of it while I can".
