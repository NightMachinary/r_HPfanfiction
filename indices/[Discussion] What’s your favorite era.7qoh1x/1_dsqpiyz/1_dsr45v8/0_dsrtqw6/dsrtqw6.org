I don't know what you have read before, but here are my favorite post Hogwarts fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Harry and his friends declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot after Voldemort's fall.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Extreme AU. Lucius Malfoy outmaneuvered Dumbledore after Halloween 1981, but Dumbledore would have his revenge almost 20 years later.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Extreme AU, even in Muggle world as nuclear weapons were not developed. In magical world, James and Lily survived Halloween 1981 and fled Magical Britain, so Harry never went to Hogwarts. Most of the story took place after 2008, and when Statute of Secrecy fell in 2009, chaos ensued...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): It's actually part of a big 80+ fic postwar series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], but works perfectly as a standalone story. It's also fully canon-compliant, and shows Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Harry is the Frank Underwood of Magical Britain.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Things went very badly for Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Luna, until they arrived in an alternate dimension by accident. Very emotional story.
