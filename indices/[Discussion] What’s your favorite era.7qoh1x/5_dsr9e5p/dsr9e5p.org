The Riddle-in-Hogwarts era, /or/ Riddle post-Hogwarts, but before he becomes Voldemort in the public eye. Seeing him rise to power is a cool concept, (though most fics that do depict that era aren't really to my tastes because of the endless shipping).

The Newt era is the runner-up. Huge potential there.
