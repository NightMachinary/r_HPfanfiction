I really like the Marauder's Era because:

a) less canon rehashes

b) characters less likely to be self-inserts (as Harry and Hermione tend to be)

c) no Draco Malfoy (screw him)

d) no Ron bashing (screw Ron bashing)

e) the characters are genuinely more interesting. Harry, Hermione, and Ron aren't really that... interesting (to me)

In conclusion: everything was better in Hogwarts in the 1970s.
