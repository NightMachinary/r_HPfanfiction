Marauder era fics not centered on Snape or the Marauders doing shit. Give me some badass Lily leading the Muggleborn resistance, the Black sisters giving no fuck about the war and trying to stay out of it (and out of the Lestrange/Malfoy marriages), hell, give me Harry travelling to the past to bang his own mum. That time has so much potential and it's wasted on bad romance fics filled with more tropes than the IndyHarry ones or Snape sobstories.
