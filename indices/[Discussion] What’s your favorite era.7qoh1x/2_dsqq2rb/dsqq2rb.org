Personally I really enjoy the ancient era. Exploring the map, finding ruins, trying to found a pantheon, and fighting off barbarians while they are still threatening to me are some of the most fun points in the game. That said, once you advance a few eras and get your UU and/or UB you can really expand and start to shape your civ the way you want. I personally like to rush theology so I can get Borobudur and spread my religion across the land (the Celts are my fav Civ).

I will also say that getting a butt load of tanks/panzers are racing across the landscape, crushing all beneath your heel and and razing the cities of your foes to the ground is amazing, especially if you go autocracy and select Clausewitz legacy.

So I guess it's more the midgame I find boring. Trying to get enough votes to push through the policies that will help you, teching up while not exposing yourself to AI invasion is pretty boring when it lasts 200ish turns.
