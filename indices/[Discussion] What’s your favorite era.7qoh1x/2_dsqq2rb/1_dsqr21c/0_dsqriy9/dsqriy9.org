Religion is just so strong in Civ 5 it's hard not to go for it, and religious civs have HUUUUGGGGEEEE head start. Getting that additional culture/happiness/science early on because you have good founding beliefs is incredible. Plus, if you are agressive and take tithe, you can end up with enough money to buy your way to victory.

The modern era gets tedious until you BLITZKRIEG your foe into oblivion.
