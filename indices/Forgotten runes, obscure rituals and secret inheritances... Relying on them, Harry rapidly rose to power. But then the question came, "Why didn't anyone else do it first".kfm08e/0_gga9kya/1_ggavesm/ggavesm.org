Cue 10+ years later, Muggleborns are running roughshod over every magical nation that wasn't keeping up with the times. With computing power, coding instruction, and astronomical data all readily available, rituals go from near-impossible and suicidally dangerous to just technically challenging and mildly dangerous.

That idea actually makes me want to see a fic where computers suddenly make some of the most difficult aspects of magic much easier. The closest I've seen is linkffn(12087691).

Conversely, maybe feeding Runes and Arithmancy into a computer is a Very Bad Idea. One prompt I came up with years ago was to base Arithmancy on the Laundry series by Charles Stross.
