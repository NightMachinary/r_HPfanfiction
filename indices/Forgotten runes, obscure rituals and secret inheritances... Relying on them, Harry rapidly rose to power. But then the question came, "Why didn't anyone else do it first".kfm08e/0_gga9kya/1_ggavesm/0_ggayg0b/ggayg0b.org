I really want to combine this with some worldbuilding I've seen where the European magic community forced everyone else into Secrecy. The massive death toll from "Scourers" is actually the results of the subjugation war when Native American mages refused to abandon their culture. The Americas nominally enforce Secrecy policies, but tacitly support institutions like Miskatonic in developing weapons to overthrow the European domination of magical communities.

Harry's innovations are recognized by Miskatonic researchers and they get him out of Britain before the purebloods running the government force him into Azkaban. Harry's new dilemma is where he loves his research and getting support for learning and experimentation, but he's uncomfortable knowing his colleagues are applying it to war magic.
