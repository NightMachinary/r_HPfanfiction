I'd recommend taking a look at linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings) - it does an interesting/good way of handling the rituals/rune magic aspect in terms of making Harry very very powerful, yet also come at a clear cost that explains why it's not the standard.

It's an approach I quite like for that sort of ritual/darker magic and the costs associated with it
