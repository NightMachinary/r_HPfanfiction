I'd say: /most people don't care/. They're happy to live their lives in the niche they chose to, as long as their needs (housing, food, partner) are met.

That takes out about 90% of the population if not more, given that unless one violates the Statute of Secrecy by exploiting Muggles, it's perfectly possible to survive on one's own as a hermit using nothing more than a wand - it's not a requirement to have a job. The remaining 10%... 90% of these either have some sort of morals (e.g. like Mundungus Fletcher who's not shy of stealing from comrades but scared as fuck, they don't want to kill, which is a requirement for the most powerful Horcrux ritual) or lack the skill/talent required (easily imaginable with Runes, maths or anything involving broomflight).

Which leaves a total of about 1% that want to achieve extreme levels of power... and here's statistics again: the Wizarding population is shown as extremely small and regularly being culled by wars (Goblin wars, Grindelwald, Voldy 1, Voldy 2). Which means that there are very few in absolute numbers - and of these, it's likely that most fail at some step (e.g. they can't use the Unforgivables because they lack the determination required).

The remaining ones pop up every couple of decades and cause havoc - or silently use their powers without drawing too much attention to themselves, having learned one way or the other that drawing attention always also draws /unwanted/ attention such as stalkers, greedy / desperate people, criminals or law enforcement.

Also: those who currently have generally-unknown powers have a vested interest in keeping them secret - Dumbledore for example removed the Horcrux books from the Hogwarts library, teachers may leave these out of the curriculum (e.g. knowledge about time turners or powerful runes).
