In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6690487/1/Growing-Up-Kneazle][Growing Up Kneazle]], Harry has a burst of accidental magic and ends up adopted into a Kneazle family as a kitten. When he eventually regains the ability to hooman, his worldview remains rather feline (such as his habit of leaving rooms via windows, no matter how high up they are).

A sort-of-similar concept is in the one-shot [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27669059/chapters/67710089][Hermione's Cat]], where Harry-as-a-panther is raised by a snake in the woods.
