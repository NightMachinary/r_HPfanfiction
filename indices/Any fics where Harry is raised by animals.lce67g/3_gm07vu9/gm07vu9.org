linkffn(Harry Potter: Adoptive Kaiju by Gojirahkiin) has Harry raised by Kaiju, which is probably close enough.

linkffn(Little Guy by Clell65619) has Harry raised by George from /George of the Jungle/, and I'm pretty sure there were some animals involved.

linkffn(The Natural Animagus by wsbenge) has Harry turn into a kneazle and get raised by kneazles, which aren't exactly wild animals, but it might still be close enough for you to enjoy.
