Not directly, but your surroundings influence you, especially while growing up. Harry would inevitably spend less time with Ron, Neville, Dean and Seamus but spend more time with the Ravenclaws.

Also, with Harry being in Ravenclaw, the first Halloween could go very differently. Either Ron doesn't make his complaint about Hermione or Harry does not notice her absence, which might have her squashed and/or Ron feeling incredibly guilty for the rest of his life. That could quickly change him, and also Harry if they are still friends (they might simply find not enough time to deeply bond with Harry in Ravenclaw).
