Well the thing with Ravenclaw is that you would have to be smart or knowledgeable or able to think outside the box or have a thirst for knowledge or all those combined or a few of those combined and have those be the dominant personalities and stuff, so then I would need ho have Harry be knowledgeable or have a thirst for knowledge and wisdom, those because they would be probably the easiest to write although it would be fun trying to write a wise Harry that just speaks in wise quotes or something. So in the end I don't know what to do with the Ravenclaw thing.

AND NO HARRY WON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH AUTHORITY FIGURES.... sorry I just hate the fics where Hermione does nothing if an authority figure hasn't said anything and Hermione also seems to think that everything a book says is truth. I just hate those fics so Harry will not have an authority figure problem.

I don't know about Dumbledore being manipulative in my fic, I always thought that if Harry would have disappeared from the Dursleys in canon then Dumbledore would have for sure started searching for Harry in secret along with the order of the phoenix.

And about the phoenix, the thing is that I'm not yet sure it would be a phoenix but I don't wan't to copy The Lightning Lord so Idk what bird or animal it should be. I also don't want to copy the accidental animagus in Harry becoming a kid animagus accidentally at the Dursleys so I decided to go with a phoenix, but IF someone does manage to give me a plausible alternative I would definitely consider it

I think that's it

BTW there's never too much critique if it's constructive criticism and not just like ”HEY THATS SHAIT BECAUSE IM MORE INTELLIGENT THAN YOU” so yes it did help me a bit with my ideas.

Thanks for the constructive criticism!
