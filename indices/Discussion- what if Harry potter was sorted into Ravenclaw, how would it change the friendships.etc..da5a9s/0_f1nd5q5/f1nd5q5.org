There's a lot of ways to go through what might have happened - but it depends on what you mean by 'Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw'. After all, the houses don't really change your personality - they just have an emphasis on different things. So you could have Harry go there with no change to his canon personality, making your entire list of differences... mutable. They're not givens, at least.

What you seem to be asking is not just what would happen if Harry was in Ravenclaw, but if he also respected authority and was more studious. In that case, it could be similar - but I would not hold myself to the canon plotlines in that case. As for friendships, it depends on who is in Ravenclaw of course - it sounds like you've already decided who you want him friends with though.

For a bit of critique, the description of your fic (the whole phoenix part) doesn't strike me as particularly congruous with the premise you're discussing before it. Is there a reason that you're comparing the two? Also, is there a specific need for you to include a Super!Harry like that? Not that you can't do it, of course - it's your fic. But it feels to me like you've got two ideas that you're smushing together in this - one about Harry in Ravenclaw, and one with Super!Harry and his new power and phoenix familiar stuffing it to Manipulative!Dumbledore. The latter would, IMO, overshadow the former heavily. I would consider splitting them.

I would also push back against the description of that as a plot. That is a setting description - the initial changes. But it is not a plot - do you consider Harry going through the stages of canon? What are the challenges he's going to be faced with? What happens? Those are the important plot elements to consider - not the base idea that you've got.

I'll stop here - hopefully this helped you a bit. I don't want to critique it too much, because in the end it is your fic - so the fact that the description of it isn't my thing doesn't matter.
