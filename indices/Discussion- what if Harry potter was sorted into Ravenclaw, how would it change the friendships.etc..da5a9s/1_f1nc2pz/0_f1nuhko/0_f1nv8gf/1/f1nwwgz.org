I agree they wouldn't last because Marietta, but I will say Cho's reaction to Hermione (and Ron) is pretty realistic to me. Imo, Harry's relationship with them is the main reason Ginny and her relationship with Harry are so very shallow. Honestly, Cho, Ginny, /and/ Lavender were all shafted to keep them together.

I think anyone, man or woman, would feel like the odd one out and both Cho and Harry lacked thr maturity to fully understand it. And Ron ending up with Hermione and Harry with the accepting sister is so very cookie cutter perfect.
