yes its hard to apply some muggle prison tropes to wizards for sure... as for the tunnel thing it would be about getting into the prison yard or some other key area rather than off the island itself...maybe they plan tunnel to the yard where the wands are hidden or something along those lines...tbh we need a better writer than me to come up with the finer details haha
