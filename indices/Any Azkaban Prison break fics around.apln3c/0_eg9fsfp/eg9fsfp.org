Would love to see that done properly. Of course, a lot of the tropes wouldn't apply; for one thing, there's not much point in digging tunnels when Azkaban's a perpetually stormy island in the middle of nowhere.

One thing is for certain, such a story would /definitely/ have to have someone knock out a Dementor somehow, steal its robes, and then pretend to be a Dementor in the HP counterpart to the "steal the guards' uniforms" routine.

Also, cut the files. The inmates' allies on the outside would smuggle /the wands/ inside the cakes. (The Dementors, of course, allow shipments of cake; cakes make the prisoners momentarily happy, and thus it gives /them/ a meal.)
