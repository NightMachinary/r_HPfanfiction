  There's not much point in digging tunnels when Azkaban's a perpetually stormy island in the middle of nowhere.

Hmm...well, they dug the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, and that has a ton of water in the way...

And if you were good with an undetectable expansion charm and transmutation, you could probably transfigure away quite a bit of rock and make good time, and with bubblehead charms you wouldn't need to worry too much about air quality...

So maybe tunnelling /out/ of Azkaban is questionable, but tunnelling /in/?
