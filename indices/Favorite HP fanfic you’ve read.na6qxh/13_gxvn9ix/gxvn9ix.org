how has nobody mentioned “make a wish” yet? its on ffn and its ANAZING!! i'm currently re-reading for the 3th time and its one of the best fics i know!

2 others that i can really recommend already got mentioned in other comments (that universe over there and escapologist harry)

the harry potter and the hermetic arts series on ffn is very good too (made by HaikenEdge)

if you have ever read anything related to percy jackson then “harry potter, squatter” on ffn is very good too.

a few others that i absolutely love are: - harry potter and the artificer legacy - the secret life of epsilon brown (crossover with men in black, one of the few rare men in black fics in general actually) - harry potter, unspeakable by kb0 - back to the beginning by burnable (has a sequal thats a crossover with stargate, i was able to follow along relatively well without knowing anything about stargate before that) - barefoot by Zaxaramas - roschach's blot has a few very good works on ffn, some are a bit weird but most are pretty funny - weird fic with a deserved m rating but its very very good: in the mind of a scientist by zenonokyuubi - a second chance at life by miranda flairgold - the diadone method (abandoned but worth reading) - wizarding kingpin by Odin999 - taboo by andrius - pretty sure “moratorium” by Darkpetal16 is very good too but its been a while since i've read it - café by Pleasedial123 - core threads by theaceoffire - blindness by angelastarcat - the perils of innocence by avidbeader (must read honestly) - steve and the barkeep by runaway deviant (crossover with avengers, pretty feelgood fic i think, has been a while since i've read it) - harry potter and the daft morons by sinyk (very good) - harry potter and the rune stone path by temporal knight

okay thats nearly all on ffn and most of the fics i can remember honestly

enjoy!
