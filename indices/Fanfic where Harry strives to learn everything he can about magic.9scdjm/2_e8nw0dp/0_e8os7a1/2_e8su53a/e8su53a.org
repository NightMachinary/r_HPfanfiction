I actually lost steam later. It basically becomes a book about a wizard no longer named Harry Potter who behaves OOC at a magic school that is very much not Hogwarts. It's okay, but it's just an original fic that had a first chapter that was fanfiction, and it didn't hold my interest as an original fic. Maybe it comes back around to familiar people and events, but it lost me.
