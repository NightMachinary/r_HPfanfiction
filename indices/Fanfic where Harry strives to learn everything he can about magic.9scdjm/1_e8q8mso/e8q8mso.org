There was a fic I read where harry figured out how to change his hearts desire and used the Mirror of Erised to a ludicrous degree, ultimately losing interest in the rest of the world because all the information he could ever hope to find could be found through the mirror.

I cannot, for the life of me, think of enough unique information to actually find that fic, though.
