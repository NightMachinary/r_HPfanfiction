While my first sentence might be understood as me condoning puppy torture, I think most people are able to understand from the rest of my comment that I merely have nothing against a fanfic containing puppy torture (or any torture at all, or murder, rape and whatever other bad things you can imagine) as long as those things aren't depicted in a positive light.

That I decided to write it in such a provocative manner is owed to the fact that /you/ made an equally outrageous claim that fanfics containing Bad Things shouldn't be recommended even when most fanfics contain murder and quite often worse.

From what I remember of my reading of Black Luminary, the puppy torture is performed by Bellatrix Lestrange, a character known to be deranged and quite possibly mentally ill. I think Harry might even make a mental note about how torturing puppies isn't so great, but it's been a while and I don't remember it very well.
