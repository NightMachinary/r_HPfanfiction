No, I read all the books several times over. Albeit when I was a child, so a little under a decade ago.He burns the man to a crisp, this is what Dumbledore says when Harry wakes up."No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. *He left Quirrell to die*; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. "

I guess, if you really wanted to optimistic, you could assume that while Voldy left him to die, Dumbledore saved him. But honestly I didn't think into that much depth on that one. I have always assumed that was to be taken directly: Quirrell died.

Edit: perhaps murder is the wrong way to put it. Accidental killing? Manslaughter? Either way, he burned his face off.
