In reference to comment 3 (??) I did concede that you could call it accidental killing instead. However, my original comment did not need the specific word 'murder' to make sense. It was more about the nonchalant manner the wizarding world reacts to the death of a teacher.

If I am entirely honest, I mainly debated with you because I was unjustly offended with the assumption that I had not read the book haha
