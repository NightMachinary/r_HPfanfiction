It's not murder when the other person is trying to kill you. Harry had no intent to kill him, just stop him, but he did deliberately go on the offensive when he realized that Quirrell got burned from touching him.

I think the worst he could get charged with (in the US at least) is Wrongful Death, which is when your actions cause somebody to die who shouldn't have. (Even in self-defense, you are legally obligated to just leave if your attacker stops attacking you.)

Note: IANAL; do not take this as legal advice.
