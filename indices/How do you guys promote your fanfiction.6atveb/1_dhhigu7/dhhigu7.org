I self-promoted on the subreddit twice - once when I published chapter one, and once recently in a comment because I thought it might be relevant to what the OP was looking for. In general, though, the story sort of picked up attention on its own, and nowadays I'm getting about 60-70 views a day, even when I haven't updated in weeks.

The thing to keep in perspective is that it's not about making your work popular - fanfiction should always be a labour of love, and your main efforts should go into producing something you want, and can be proud of. As the others have said, engaging with the audience by replying to reviews (I don't bother with guest reviews though) and updating with decently-sized (say over 2/2.5k word) chapters without /too/ long a wait between really helps keep your work at the forefront of peoples' attention.
