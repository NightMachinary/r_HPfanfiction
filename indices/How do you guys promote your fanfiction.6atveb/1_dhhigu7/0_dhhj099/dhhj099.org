Oh I know, I write because it's fun, but I am proud of it and want people to at least SEE it. Whether they like it or not, well, can't please everyone, right? My chapters are almost too long (like 8K words) and I only update every 2-3 weeks bc of school, etc.

I think my next story's chapters will be shorter. 8K seems ridiculous.
