I post on this sub occasionally. I've also made TV Tropes pages for a few of my stories like [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LikeARedHeadedStepchild][Red Headed Stepchild]] and [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/AndTheMeekShallInheritTheGalaxy][The Meek Shall Inherit the Galaxy]]. Putting a few wicks on relevant fanfic tropes on the TV Tropes main site can drive a few readers to you (and I spend too much time on there anyways). You can also look for places where they play review tag if you want to try that, though that never resulted in more readers for me.
