IMHO the most effective way is posting regular updates on FFN. It puts the story at the top of the "Just In" list, and there's always an influx of views. Now if you're being unscrupulous, I suppose you could always split your fic into smaller chapters to maximize the effect, but I imagine the readers won't be very happy about that.
