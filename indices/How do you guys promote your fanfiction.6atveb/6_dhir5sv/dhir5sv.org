Use ao3 and tag properly. If your fic is decent, you'll usually get decent hits. I rarely update things and am not a /great/ writer, and I still get a few kudos a day or so.

I mean, as a reader, I don't read anything with terrible grammar or awful formatting (skip paragraphs with every dialogue start, oh my god!), but that's just basic housekeeping.
