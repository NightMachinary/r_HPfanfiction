Again and Again by Athey is utterly fantastic. Really, it's got such a bizarre pairing (Harry/Voldemort), but it actually works really well and makes perfect sense. And Athey is good at using canon details to stregthen her fics. It's definitely plot focused, not smut focused (although Athey has written [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/513388/chapters/905559][PWP Outtakes]] for it that are entirely smut, if you'd like to read more about their bedroom adventures).

If you want more Harry/Voldemort, I've got plenty more favorited, but none of it's as awesome. Most of it's still pretty fun though.

Also, TIL that I read a lot of non-HP centric rare pairings.
