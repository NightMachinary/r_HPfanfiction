Ah, ok. The OP doesn't specify what kind of story they are talking about, so when I saw rare pair, I thought actual rare pairs.

On AO3, a very quick search finds of about 20,000 slash Harry fics, close to 60% are Harry/Draco, 30% are Harry/Severus, 8% are Harry/LV(or TRJ), and just over 5% are Harry/Ron. Everything else I would count as a rare pair in some ways(those numbers don't add up as many include more then one pairing, and I'm rounding up).
