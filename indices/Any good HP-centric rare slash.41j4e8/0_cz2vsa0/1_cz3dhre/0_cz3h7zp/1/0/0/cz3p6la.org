  Teaching is no easy profession. Albus Dumbledore just wants to support his students. Even the bad ones. Even Draco Malfoy. In a world where the dark lord was defeated, Harry's generation grow up without the looming threat of war. Which means they have to be regular teenagers and make their own trouble. Fortunately, Draco is very good at that! Perhaps he just needs someone to be a good influence on him...?

      This is just a little AU scenario I dreamed up\.  Yes, it's Dumbledore/Draco\.  Yes, it has explicit content\.  Yes, I have a kink for older men\.\.\.\. \#sorrynotsorry\! Explicit sexual content\.  Teacher/Student relationship\.  Age gap relationship\.  Bad language\.  Mild school yard violence\.  Some angst\.  Some humour\.  It's not too angsty and emotional, because they are not my OTP, just a naughty little diversion\.\.\.My plan is to upload one chapter per day for the next 9 days\.Enjoy\!  x

  A sequel to Teaching & Learning. Harry Potter knew that Malfoy had been Dumbledore's lover while they were at school. He had never quite approved of the fact but he had learned to accept it. Only years later does Harry finally realise the true intensity of their relationship and he finally begins to accept that there might be more to Draco Malfoy than he realised.

      I apologise for this right now\.  Especially to 'Razorblade Romance', who might never forgive me\!  Please, bare with me\.  It's bittersweet, yes, but it will be happy in the end\!
