It's not as rare as some pairings (I read an Albus Dumbledore/Draco Malfoy fic recently that was surprisingly sweet. That's a pairing that very barely exists), but it's rarer than Harry/Draco and Harry/Snape. I figured it was a reasonable suggestion given that OP only requested no Draco and no Snape.

Also, a lot of the rarer pairings, like Harry/Rabastan or Harry/Marcus Flint, have stories that are fun, but I'm not sure if I'd rec them to someone who wasn't asking for that exact type of fic, because Harry is pretty much always massively OOC in them.
