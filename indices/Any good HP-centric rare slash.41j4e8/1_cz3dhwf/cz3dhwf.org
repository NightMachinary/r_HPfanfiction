What kind of story are you looking for exactly? Harry/Any Dark but Severus or Draco is pretty broad. You want a little smut but not only? So Hurt/Comfort? Mystery? Creature Fics?

As for a rare pairs, there isn't a lot of Fenrir/Harry that isn't also involving someone else (normally LV), and almost all have strong dubious consent issues. Lucius/Harry is pretty common, and so is Lucius/Severus/Harry, but by simply moving a Malfoy up: Abraxas/Harry is rare (but still out there!). There is a few Rabastan/Harry out there which are ok, but they tend to have Abused!Harry for some reason. There are a few Orion Black/Harry's and like Abraxas, time travel galore!, as well as a lot of let's fix the future/redeem everyone. Not sure if it they are really 'dark', but there is a lot of Theodore Nott/Harry and Blaise Z/Harry out there too, as if there Viktor Krum/Harry. In fact the only pair I can think of that I have never seen is Peter/Harry.
