I read Fire Keeper a what seems like a long time ago linkffn(8791602) and thought it was ok. It does have Mpreg, and quiet a few what amounts to OCs. The Red Strokes is not just smut linkffn(5380993), but it is rather short (and not exactly a happy ending either). Seven Cardinal Whats is a Theo/Harry from Ron's POV which is pretty good (or at least not bad) linkffn(9225124). There is a number of Theo/Harry's which are also harems or dragon!Harry, probably inspired by the massively popular The Rise of the Drackens linkffn(8022667), which doesn't have Theo, but There Be Dragons, Harry is quiet well known (I haven't read it myself, I'm not a fan of dragon!Harry) linkao3(There Be Dragons, Harry by Scioneeris), as well as Dragon's Heritage linkao3(Dragons Heritage by Doragonkage).
