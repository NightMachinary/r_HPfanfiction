  Harry comes into a very unexpected inheritance. He is a creature both rare and very dangerous, a creature that is black listed by the British Ministry. So now he must avoid detection at all costs, whilst choosing his life partners and dealing with impending pregnancy at just sixteen. With danger coming not just from the Ministry but even other creatures, what was he supposed to do?

  Harry's sixteenth birthday dawns with new changes...and change always brings about new adventures to undertake. Follow Harry in his new journey to life.The concept for the creature in this fic has been borrowed from AFF-writer Starlight_Massacre, and her approval for its use has been granted. Also some characters will be out of character as far as comparing them to the original masterpiece, and some changes will be explained later on in the fic.Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter, and i make no profit from writing this. I write primarily for my own entertainment as well as that of my readers. Harry potter belongs to the ever talented J.K Rowling and all credit belongs to her.

  Harem!Fic Harry inherits a creature "thing" from both sides of his parents and somehow that leads to weird sleeping habits, conversations with Theodore Nott and finding himself caught up in a world of Dragons, elemental powers and new creatures he's never heard of before. Dragons? Mates? Very AU. Contains all kinds of slash.

  AU. Slash. Ron wasn't sure how this whole Harry dating a Slytherin thing would work out. Hermione was convinced it was a sham, but Charlie said you know it's love when you're not afraid to indulge in seven cardinal somethings. Ron didn't know much, but he was pretty sure they'd done that. TheoxHarry pairing from Ron's POV.
