  A look at how things could have gone if people were human, adults were adults, and if Harry ended up in an actually supportive environment when he got to Hogwarts.Also, Harry becomes a girl, because fuck you JK.Pairings are eventual, I plan to take this clear through 7th year.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else.
