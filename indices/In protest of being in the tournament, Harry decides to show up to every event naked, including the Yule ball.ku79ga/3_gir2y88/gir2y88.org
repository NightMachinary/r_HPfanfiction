There was one that I can't find right now, a one shot or part of a series of one shots, in which Harry deliberately breaks the deep or fundamental rules of Hogwarts, to escape being in the Tournament (IIRC). McGonagall realizes what he's doing and begs Dumbledore to stop him before he went below number 10...at which point he did, as rule 2 or 3 is not going skyclad. She moans something along the lines of "now that they've all seen him" the girls will be chasing him and causing disruption. He is finally excused from whatever and therefore resumes normal behavior. Thought it was by Clell, but can't seem to find it.

EDIT: Found it! Chapter 6 of "Harry Potter and the whimsical drabbles" by slytherinsal [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12926561/6/Harry-Potter-and-the-whimsical-drabbles]]
