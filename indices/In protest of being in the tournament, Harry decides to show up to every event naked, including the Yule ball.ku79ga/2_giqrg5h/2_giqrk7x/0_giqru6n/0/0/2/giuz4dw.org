in fanfiction there are different categories. some are strict canon where events dont deviate like if you were to write a story about a scene between events or from another point of view than the usual (like if you wrote the story of how Barty Jr and his mom traded places in detail and wrote out the thoughts and feelings of Barty's mom in her last days...it's estabished what happened but Rowling doesn't give details, you could write those details and stay in canon). then there are those that try to follow the basic rules of the universe and follow what some call "in characterness" but deviate from established events which is what i'm guessing is what youre imagining...but strictly speaking these stories are not canon because events are already moving off track. then there are whole hosts of concepts of alternate universe where, if you're careful, you can move pretty far from canon and "in character" behavior to explore different possibilities. marvel comics famously did it with their own stuff with a series of comics called "what if..." which itself was hit or miss in quality. this story could go either way. it depends on how far reaching you think Harry's choice to do this would be. I can see the value of strictly in canon fanfiction, but the best stories i've read in fanfiction haven't been afraid to ask, hey! what if...
