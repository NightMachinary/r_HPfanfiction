Potter's ever after has my favorite set of lines about Luna.

"You should listen to Luna. She's a Seer."

"A Seer? Lovegood?"

"Yes. She can see into the future."

"No, Ginny, she can't. Authors can't stand the idea of a decent person with flaws - Luna can't simply be weird for the sake of being weird - so they have to turn her pronouncements into something prophetic."
