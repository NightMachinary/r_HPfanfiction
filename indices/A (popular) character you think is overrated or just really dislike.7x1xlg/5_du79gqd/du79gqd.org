It's Hermione too for me. She's kind of written from this ~not like the "other" girls perspective in the books and has a tendency to come off as self-righteous and judgmental, which I think carries on to a lot fics. They tend to gloss over her more problematic qualities. An example being her sort of "I know best" arrogance that reflects on how she disregards the feelings of house elves when she crusades for them (which makes her activism more about her feelings than theirs). And also the way she doesn't seem to have female friends? Usually when a woman doesn't get along with other women, I'm more inclined to think it's more about her rather than all the other females being trash? It really irks me how Ginny/Fleur/Lavender/Parvati/etc. are all characterized as stupid, horrible, shallow, & vain in comparison to her in so many fics (and sometimes in the books too). Also in fics, it's like ALL the male characters are always in love with Hermione...like, why?
