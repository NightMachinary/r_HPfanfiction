I think too many people get caught up in that he's a well written, fully fleshed out complex character...and overlook all the problematic aspects that contribute to his complexity. I also blame a lot of this on Rowling who was willing to throw an equally complex character (Sirius) under the bus for her pet favorite: Snape. She also has fed into fandom by almost deifying the man, and very rarely touching upon his not so good qualities.

To glorify Snape, in my opinion, is to think that Joseph Gordon Levitt was the good guy in /(500) Days of Summer./
