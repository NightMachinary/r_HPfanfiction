Snape didn't know that Lupin was a werewolf though. He just knew that these people who he dislikes routinely go out of bound, and he spotted an opportunity to get them in trouble. Sirius knowingly sent Snape into a building with a transformed, incredibly deadly werewolf, without stopping to consider the effects on both Snape and Lupin. That can't really be blamed on Snape.
