I'd have to disagree. His reasons are revenge, selfishness. He only ever cared for Lily. He is doing what he is doing not out of love for humanity and to save people but out of hate for Voldemort. That's why he is still despicable and abusive.

Okay, no, he is not a villain, but I wouldn't he was a good guy at all.
