That he is a fucking prick? In the third book he threatened to poision Neville's pet /just because/ he hadn't quite gotten the potion down. Neville got that pet from his uncle when they realized he was magical. It's the first proof and reminder of him having magic and how the fuck can Snape think to harm a child's pet. Oh, because he is an asshole.
