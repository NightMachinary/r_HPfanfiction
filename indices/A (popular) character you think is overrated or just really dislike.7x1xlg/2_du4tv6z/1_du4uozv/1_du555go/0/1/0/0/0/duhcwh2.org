You said the opinion, as in that he is selfcentered and an asshole. If you mean that specific point that that he isn't doing it to save people, I could base that on the fact that that's the only reason Dumbledore trusts Snape. Out of his love for Lily. He didn't turn spy for anything else after all.

You do realize it's heavily implied how much shit they have to do to become death eaters right? Again, I would argue it's only the death of Lily that makes Snape change his mind, nothing else.

Arguing otherwise seems more based on speculation and wishful thinking.
