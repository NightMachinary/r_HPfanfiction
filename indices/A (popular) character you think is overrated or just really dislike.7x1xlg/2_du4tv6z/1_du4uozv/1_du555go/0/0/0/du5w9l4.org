Depends how you define good, really.

If you define being good as being "anti-Voldemort", then sure he's good.

If you define as good as being a caring individual who tries their best to help others and not make the world a worse place? Then Snape is almost certainly evil by both words and actions.

As far as I'm concerned, you can want to kill Voldemort and still be an evil git. There's no evidence to say that Snape ever cared about Harry beyond his "mother's eyes".

That being said, he has an incredible strength of will and natural talent matched only by Harry and Dumbledore himself to keep up the double agent lifestyle for god knows how many decades. That's what makes him fascinating.
