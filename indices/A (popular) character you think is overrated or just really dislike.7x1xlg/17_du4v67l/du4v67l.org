Completely agree with your assessment of Hermione as a character ! She's completely one dimensional ! Her positives are blown out of proportion ! She comes across as a bit of a control freak but nobody confronts her on it in cannon ! She just doesn't seem real ! Ron on the other hand has his faults and as a reader if i put myself in his position I can understand where he's coming from ! He in my opinion is a much more complete character !
