Haha I love that you suggested that. I was reading this one just a week ago. Harry is still friends with Hermione though, I kept reading, but then I had to drop it at this one point where she is doing the crying routine and Harry starts telling her how he is so good at magic because he can die and come back.

1. Why do you have to tell her? WHY

2. After that she keeps using it against him to cement the fact that she is smarter and he is cheating. Completely ruined the fic.
