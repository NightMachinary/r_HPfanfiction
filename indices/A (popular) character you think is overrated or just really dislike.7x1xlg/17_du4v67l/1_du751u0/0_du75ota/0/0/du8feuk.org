Still probably the second best fic I've read ! I like how paranoid harry is in the beginning ! I believe somebody as emotionally and mentally isolated as Harry would have a hard time trusting someone and would always keep things to himself ! Cannon Harry latches onto Ron and Hermione pretty quickly !
