I was actually rather repulsed by the amount of people that were clamoring for that while I was writing Vitam Paramus. It really altered my view on a chunk of the community.

Not only did they call Gabrielle repeatedly by a name that is never used in the story, but as a whole she was treated as nothing more than an object for Harry to do as he wished with and her problems were utterly ignored. So I can imagine it's only worse with Fleur.
