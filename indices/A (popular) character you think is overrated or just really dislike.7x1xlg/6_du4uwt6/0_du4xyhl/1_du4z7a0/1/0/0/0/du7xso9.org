There are just more men in fanfic communities than there used to be. The shift to harems and the like happened quite starkly when the gender balance moved more to equal.

I also don't think the movies helped, especially the later movies. I suspect having Harry and Ginny as the designated couple, but also dropping a /lot/ of ship tease of Harry with Luna and Hermione might have done a lot to get people thinking 'why not all 3?'
