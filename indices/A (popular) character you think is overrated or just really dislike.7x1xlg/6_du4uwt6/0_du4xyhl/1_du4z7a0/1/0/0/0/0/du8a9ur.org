I was more referring the real world as a while rather than just fiction communities, but the latter certainly seems to be reflecting it. Saying that it happened in that way kind of makes it sound like men can't help but write this stuff, which I'm sure wasn't the intention.

Was there shippy stuff with Luna? They went to one party as friends. Hermione only had that horribly awkward dance. So I wouldn't really call that a lot in either case.
