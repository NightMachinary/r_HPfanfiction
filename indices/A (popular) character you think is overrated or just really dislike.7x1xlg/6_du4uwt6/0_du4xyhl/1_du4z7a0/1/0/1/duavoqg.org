While I agree that harem are actually made for or written by a male audience, I (a probably good human female) actually enjoy reading fanfiction with harem ships that aren't ridiculous (like ones with about fifty girls who aren't attracted to the main character at all) and don't objectivise and completely destroy the personalities of the participants. You could say that I don't really ship harem because I like all the characters having relationships with each other simultaneously, but that all depends on how strict you are with the definition.

I don't know whether this is because I want all the girls to end up with the main character and have a happy ending, but not all harem fix are trash +even though 99. 9 reoccurring percent are+

And yes, I'm aware that I'm probably a small minority, but I just wanted to put it out there
