What I don't like is her characterization as this poor misunderstood maiden. "I'm drop-dead gorgeous and every man wants me, but no one understand the /real/ me". I don't buy it. In my head she's confident, comfortable in her skin, and proud of her looks and heritage. Her wand core is at least indirect proof of this.
