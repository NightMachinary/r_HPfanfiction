Not original poster here, but I can totally agree. People use Fleur often, but they keep reducing her to the idea that she's part-veela, and ooh, everybody thinks she's so pwetty, and she kind of manipulates those cute boys with that Awesome Veela Allure^{TM,} but at the same time she's so bored of those mindless lustful boys and what she /really/ wants is someone immune to her Powerful Veela Charm^{TM,} like, y'know, Harry.

And all of this is... blatantly not what Fleur is about in the books. Veela "Allure" in the way it's usually presented (an aura of lustfulness) doesn't exist; Veelas are simply ungodly beautiful, and an effect somewhat like the "Allure" appears when they dance and sing. The rest is just fanon. But moreover, Fleur /does not/ identify as Veela. That she has some Veela blood is really secondary --- she's usually just treated as a witch who happens to be very pretty. And a competent one at that.
