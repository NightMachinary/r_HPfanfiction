Dumbledore. I dislike him greatly in canon, and worse in fanon he is either unreasonably greedy and narrow-minded or completely negligent. Sadly, the latter characterization is truer to his canon portrayal... who the hell doesn't check up on an orphaned child they left on the doorstep of magic-hating muggles??? But most fanfics I read don't change him, and if anything make him worse since unlike JKR they explore (however poorly) how you would actually think about him if you were subject to his machinations without the assumption of his pureheartedness.
