I have come to hate the almost guaranteed Hermione inclusion in most stories and that no matter the type of story, she pretty much has to be either harry's friend or, in a few cases where he manages to be smarter than her, jealous of him. The near constant inclusion of her has lead to me feeling drained in most cases just because she is present as a major character in stories
