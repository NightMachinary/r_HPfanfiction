It's called Harry Potter, not Hermione Granger. Of course if people want to write a Hermione centric fic it's all good but then you as a reader know what you're getting into. Some would say you can't write a fanfic without a major character present, I would disagree. She is only essential to the story because she meets Harry. She isn't in a position to have any influence, like say, Dumbledore, if she hadn't become friends with Harry.

Do you by chance have any great fics recommendations where she doesn't play a major role?
