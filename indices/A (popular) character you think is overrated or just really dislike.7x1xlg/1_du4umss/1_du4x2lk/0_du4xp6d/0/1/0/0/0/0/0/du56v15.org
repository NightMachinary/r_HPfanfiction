There are a /few/ others, but if I had a request for you at all, it would be to consider a sequel with a redemption arc or something.

All I'm saying is that fem!Voldemort is displaying an unusually high pedigree of value compared to any other character, inverted or otherwise. For all the fem!Harry fuss, it seems a villainous witch is the taste of the season for more sophisticated authors.
