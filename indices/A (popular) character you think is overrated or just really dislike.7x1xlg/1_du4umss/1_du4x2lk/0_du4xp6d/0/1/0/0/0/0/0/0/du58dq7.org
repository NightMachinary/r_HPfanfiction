I have an idea for a sequel. Dunno if I'll ever write it as I have what I think is a pretty interesting idea. I just don't have anything that resembles, you know, a plot.

While I'm reasonably confident I could put a story together based on the idea and conclusion I have. I don't know if it would be worth it to do so.

I also don't know if I could deal with two stories of people asking me if it's going to be Harry/Emily or not.
