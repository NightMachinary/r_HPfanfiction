  Hermione is probably my favorite character in the books, but I absolutely agree that her rate of appearance in fanon is stupidly high, and the rate at which she is shoehorned in into fics of genres like Slytherin!Harry, or AUs is making reading some of these fics a rather tiring experience. I'm at a point where I'll throw out a fic in which a Slytherin!Harry goes to save a Gryffindor girl he has never even spoken with from a troll.

i tried doing something rather different with Hermione in my current fic. Really wondering what the opinion of Non-Shippers is on it. The comments have mostly just been 'grr I hate Hermione' or 'OMG YES HARMONY' which mostly makes me think no one is actually paying attention.
