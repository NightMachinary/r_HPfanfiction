I'm a non-shipper. I just like good writing about complex characters and this story delivers.

Fair warning: I've read the story piecemeal as chapters come out, so I'm probably building up mental models that don't quite match the author's intentions. (When it's been over two years since the story started, I'm sure key plot elements are fuzzy by now.)

I think the Harry/Hermione relationship you've presented is interesting, confusing, and oddly authentic--much like watching my sixteen-year-old son fumble through his own attempts at dating and intimacy. I asked him once whether Sylvia was his girlfriend. He thought for a while, then said, "I don't know." Harry would likely answer similarly with Hermione, realizing that what he shares with her doesn't cleave to the classic definitions, though there's closeness, sexual overtones, and a sense of love that's somewhat ephemeral, yet present.

They themselves don't quite know how to define their relationship and that's fine with me. It's intimate, physical in the literal sense, borne out of shared experience and need after trauma, yet not sexual (yet). There is a sense of sexuality, trauma, and complexity with the Emily back story and the banter (and breasts). I could see it going that way, toward a sexual relationship (and buying it); I could see it not (and also buying it).

There's something to be said for your making it not matter in the larger schema. The contrast with the complexity and triumph and pain of his relationship with Emily (including the persistent mind-screw she's putting him through and enduring herself) is what makes the tender moments of intimacy between Harry and Hermione work for me as a reader. Without either, the story would be much less.
