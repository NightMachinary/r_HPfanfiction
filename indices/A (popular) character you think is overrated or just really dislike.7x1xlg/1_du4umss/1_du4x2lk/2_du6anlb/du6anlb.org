DISCLAIMER: Massive LDS spoilers. If you don't want to be spoiled, minimize my comment.

Regarding feedback, the people who have more moderate opinions (like me) are probably less motivated to make their (dis)pleasure known. On top of this, the story is completely character driven so romantic interactions are vitally important no matter who they're between, which makes opinions much more inflexible.

Me specifically, I'm reluctant to comment on Harry and Hermione's interactions because their current character arc isn't complete. The story has a lot of people avoiding talking about a lot of things and I don't feel comfortable making judgments until the characters actually lay out what they want from each other.

For example, Harry and Hermione are clearly aware of the implication of sleeping in the same bed, even to the point of joking about it, and yet there's been no discussion about what they want from each other. That's fine because as I've said elsewhere, I don't think even they know what they're doing. Fifteen/sixteen year olds, and all that. Harry also isn't talking to her about Emily, and Hermione hasn't said anything about what makes her want to sleep next to him in the first place. The situation should come to a head eventually but neither of them seem particularly interested in getting there.

Harry and Emily aren't exactly communicating either, leading the story to feel like it's come to a high tension stand-still until something breaks. Both Harry and Hermione have been through a lot of emotional trauma in a short time and their refusal to talk about it both realistic and volatile, and the situation is only compounded by Emily.

There are many questions and no answers and I don't know how to comment while only knowing half the story. If you're looking specifically for a non-shipper opinion on what the romance looks like, there's a giant flashing sign toward Harmony with a higher than average chance of disaster.

The only real issue I've had with the story so far is how Harry and Hermione draw emotional comfort from physical intimacy, platonic or otherwise. But that's more of an opinion I'm setting aside because they clearly do in LDS.
