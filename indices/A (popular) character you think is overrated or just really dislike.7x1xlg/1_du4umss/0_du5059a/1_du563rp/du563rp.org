I agree about the wasted potential of Sirius in canon, but I think the big "mistake" (it's ff, everyone can do whatever the hell they want) a lot of writers make is making him magically powerful instead of psychologically complex. I often read fics in which he coaches Harry in dueling, even though he didn't even use a wand in more than a decade.
