It's also possible that Sirius was always the person he's portrayed to be in book 5, but that a) Harry was seeing him through a child's eyes and looked up to him, and b) perhaps the readers also idealized him before his depth was really explored. Personally, Sirius always came across as kind of a bully to me, so I was more so surprised that Rowling acknowledged this in book 5 instead of sweeping his behavior under the carpet.
