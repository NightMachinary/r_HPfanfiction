  I think Sirius Black is often overrated. So overrated that authors seem to not be able to stomach hurting him in any way, devolving him from an interesting, albeit broken and tortured character, to a bland character of a few variations.

It's because Rowling threw him under the bus. He had the potential for being a really great, complex character (he ran away from familial indoctrination at a time when such things got you /hunted down and killed/...and also tried to accident a fellow student into murder), yet was sacrificed in order to show...I don't know. Life isn't fair? His house needed to be used as a macguffin later? Simply to write herself out of the box she'd written herself into?

So a lot of writers have responded by trying to fix this void of a character that got Snoke'd, but because there is so very little to go on he's become Flanderized. I agree with you assessment, mostly. It's one of the reasons I more or less wrote him out of my story.
