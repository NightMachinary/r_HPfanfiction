Dude/dudette. You speak the true true. For someone to have a favourite character and yet still agree with my critique, at least in the frequency of her appearance, kudos to you. And /fuck/, how I hate the whole "I'm gonna fight a troll and save you though I've never talked to you before and now we're best friends. Ugh".

Agree with everything else as well, Evil Dumbledore especially pisses me off. Dumbledore is pretty much the god of the HP world. People reading Canon might get pissed off at every wrong thing to Harry because in their eyes Dumbledore is so powerful that he should be blamed for everything wrong in the magical world, forgetting that he might not have had better options. It's like when people are mad at God for a disease or something. Do I make sense?

No matter the reasons, it makes for such shit writing. Have you read Dagger's Rose? Now there's a good depiction of Dumbledore.
