Hermione is probably my favorite character in the books, but I absolutely agree that her rate of appearance in fanon is stupidly high, and the rate at which she is shoehorned in into fics of genres like Slytherin!Harry, or AUs is making reading some of these fics a rather tiring experience. I'm at a point where I'll throw out a fic in which a Slytherin!Harry goes to save a Gryffindor girl he has never even spoken with from a troll.

I absolutely despise a few popular fanon characters like "Evil and manipulative Dumbledore" or "Ice Queen Daphne", even if they're written very well.

I think Sirius Black is often overrated. So overrated that authors seem to not be able to stomach hurting him in any way, devolving him from an interesting, albeit broken and tortured character, to a bland character of a few variations.

I heavily dislike what a lot of fanfiction made of Lily Potter. I'm somewhat indifferent about James Potter, even if the "lol omg so randum"-dad thing gets old very soon. But I despise this stereotype of Lily Potter as a calm housewife that blows up into ridiculous, choleric outbursts at the slightest misstep of /anyone/. I get that she was described as "having a temper" (or something like that), but there is a big difference between having a hot temperament and devolving into rage filled screaming at the slightest provocation - scratch that - at the slightest /annoyance/.
