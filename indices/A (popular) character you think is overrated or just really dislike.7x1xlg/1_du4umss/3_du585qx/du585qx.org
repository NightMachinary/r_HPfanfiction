I like the Lily from "Too Far From Home" she's chill, and somewhat fearful because of shit that happened with Harry and her daughter, but she isn't a fucking banshee when she's mad, just extremely concerned. In that fic her temper is closer to Tonks's than anyone else (from canon), but with the fact that she's traumatized.
