It's a bit more complex. Technically the age of consent is 14, but below 16 it is limited to non-exploitive sexual acts, which I've now read several times about and still can't really find concrete definitions of. It's a rather blurry kind of grey zone. However, if someone at the age of 14 or 15 complains about a sexual act with someone above 21, even after the fact, the above 21 year old may face legal charges and the benefit of the doubt will in all likelyhood go towards the 14 year old.
