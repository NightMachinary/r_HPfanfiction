Only 3 of the 25 front page posts are directly looking for smut. 4 if you count the teacher/student one. That being said that can be written in such a way that the character is considered adult enough to not fall under that guise.

I've read your treatise in the other posts and thought it missed the point.

As a whole I figure this subreddit would be better off without a lot of the random smut requests. The discussion posts are far more popular anyway. No one is going to report a story where organic sexual relationships develop because that isn't child pornography, that's just literature. If someone is to request a story where there's an orgy of eleven year olds, then I have no issue with that post being removed.
