In Class (Grade 8 Germany) we covered "The Reader", which has a relationship between a 15-year-old boy and 30ish woman. And not even the teacher spent more than two sentences on the age difference. Apparently, your rule does not apply to any actual writing.

That relationship would be rather illegal in real life but that did not stop people from putting it on our reading lists in a public school.
