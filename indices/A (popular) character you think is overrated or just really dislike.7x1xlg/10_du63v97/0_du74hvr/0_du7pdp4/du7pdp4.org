  Your examples of fanfics are terrible.

They're what I recently read. There was also /The Denarian Renegade/, in which Harry was a jerk and the only thing I particularly wanted to read about him doing was dying.

The fics that do better generally do so by making Harry unrecognizable. Like /Emperor/, or the Sacrifices Arc, or /A Second Chance at Life/, or /Seventh Horcrux/, or /Stages of Hope/.

  Harry in HPMOR or Dark Prince or well, generally a lot of fics is an amazing character.

Maybe if you're a guy he's better?

The concept of HPMOR Harry was, to my tastes, good, and it was almost good enough to excuse the character itself. At least when I first read it. My opinion has changed over time.

  Harry is far more interesting, and not proactive? Really? He leads a war against a major villain.
#+end_quote

Harry was proactive when sneaking into the Ministry under Polyjuice Potion. That's a plan that he came up with and executed without a pressing and urgent triggering event. It took about a month of staking out the place for them to do it, and the whole thing was still poorly planned, but what the hey. He tried, and he even saw some success.

When else did he come up with a plan and then execute it?
