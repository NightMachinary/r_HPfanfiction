Generally, Harry does what other people tell him (the spiders, the DA), or he responds in an obvious way to something that someone just did (going to the Department of Mysteries to save Sirius, going to the Chamber of Secrets), or he just kind of drifts. No self-improvement to be better prepared to face Voldemort, even.

That's not enough to be interesting to me, regardless of whether you categorize it as being proactive or not. It leaves months of plot where Harry's just not doing much that's interesting.
