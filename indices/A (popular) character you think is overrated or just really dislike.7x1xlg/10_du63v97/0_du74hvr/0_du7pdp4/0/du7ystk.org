Denarian Renegade is nto to my taste but I suppose that is one of the higher quality fics at least. Personally I'm not too much into dark Harry because he often comes across as an asshole. Actually a huge asshole and yet other characters in the fic still cater to his every whim and that's annoying. Again, that to me, is a badly written fic, not just the character.

Ectoplasm for example is a fic where the author writes VERY true to his character and it's one of the most amazing I've ever read.

I suppose it would come to that, wouldn't it. If I had read The Hermione Granger series, I would be as equally annoyed by her role as the protagonist be pushed aside to include a side character. It wouldn't make sense. In fact from a feminist point of view this would probably piss a lot of people off, I imagine. Just think, a female protagonist has this perfect handsome, altruistic, driven and intelligent friend who does everything for her and basically demands to know her secrets and pushes her into new movements he starts at his whim. Sound kind of demeaning? Yeah, I think so too.

Honestly I don't have a problem with her because she's a girl and I want to read from a guy's perspective. My problem is that Harry is the protagonist, not Hermione. Hermione doesn't have to be shoehorned into every fic. You're criticizing Harry's character but perhaps you're doing that exactly because no one wants to see a complacent character. While I don't agree that Harry isn't proactive, I DO think he tends to be less so with Hermione in the picture. And that combined with all my other aforementioned points is why I truly dislike Hermione. She is a Mary Sue and one dimensional and if you can't see it, you do you, but it seems obvious to me.

Harry takes action countless times. He is the one who attempts to solve the mystery. Going into a forest of huge spiders, going into the chamber to kill a snake, going after the stone etc etc. And btw. the definition of proactive isn't just to have a well considered plan, it's to generally take action and do something to improve a situation.
