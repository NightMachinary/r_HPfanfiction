You make good points but all your points can easily be disregarded with one simple statement: Your examples of fanfics are terrible. This might disrespectful since you wrote so much but I don't see your point. I can easily bring up fics where Hermione or any other character is written terribly. That shouldn't prove my point in that that character is essentially overrated.

Harry in HPMOR or Dark Prince or well, generally a lot of fics is an amazing character. This is the responsibility of the author, not the character. However that is not to say that we can disregard the entire discussion with this one core argument.

Which leads me to the question, is there a trend of Harry written in this way? I don't believe so, but of course this depends. Some people want for the boring wish fulfilment slave/harem/godlike Harry fic. Personally I believe the protaganist having it too easy kills the soul of the story so there it is. I don't believe there is a trend at least to the degree where the more.. Well, qualified population of readers are into this genre.

Finally and most importantly your points on canon Harry. That's where we truly disagree. Compared to Harry Hermione is a one-dimensional, rule-abiding, pro-authoritarian girl. Honestly she is by far the bigger side character, however she is given the skills of a protagonist with her intelligence. It's like Rowling was in doubt about who she wanted as a protagonist.

Harry is far more interesting, and not proactive? Really? He leads a war against a major villain. He has fought him since he was 11. He is only not proactive when it's something concerning himself because he is not egocentric, maybe he could use a bit more of that but he is certainly proactive when it concerns the wellbeing of others? He decides to learn the Patronus. He wants to go to the ministry because of Sirius. Time and again he offers his friends to bail. His guilt, his selfdoubt whether he can actually defeat Voldemort and save people, all of that adds to his interesting character.

Hermione is always commandeering him, she pushes him into the Dumbledore's Order, she finds a project like houseelves and demands everyone else acts according to her whims. Once she realizes Harry has a book helping him in potions she can't handle anyone else being better than her. She is honestly, by far, the most overrated and overblown character in the series. Both canon and fanon.
