Compared to Harry Potter?

Canon Harry is a good side character: he doesn't have many emotions or attachments to muck things up, he has his own plot points, and he mostly goes with the flow. (A teacher torturing him isn't enough to get him to be proactive, fercrissakes.)

Fandom Harry actually gives him a hero's journey a lot of the time, which is an improvement. They give him angst a lot of the time, which is actual emotion, and that's also an improvement. But that's papering over moldy plaster. And he's the protagonist in the vast majority of fics.

When authors come up with interesting ideas, they use them on Harry Potter pretty much every time. In the few exceptions, they erase any motivations the characters have in favor of slavish submission to Harry fucking Potter. I read a fic from Hermione's point of view where she heard of a powerful artifact that would grant its owner success in all things, or near enough -- she was focused on getting it so she could give it to Harry. (Harry's canon quest is rather important, but she could have used the artifact to aid him and then advance her own ambitions.)

I read a fic wherein a person with access to magic came across a holocron and learned to be a Jedi. Who was it? Harry Potter. Did he do anything particularly interesting with the ability? Not really; he just beat the stations of canon more easily.

If it were Ron, he'd have plenty of opportunities to be tempted by the Dark Side, and we'd potentially see Darth Weasel. That would be fun. If it were Tom Riddle, that would potentially be interesting. A Jedi Hermione would have severe problems interacting with normal people, which wouldn't be as good as Darth Weasel but wouldn't be utterly bland. Some random OC? You'd have to make them an interesting character and couldn't lean on the stations of canon. No such luck.

...dammit, I'm totally going to write Darth Weasel now, aren't I.
