Her royal supergenius: Hermione Granger!

I do generally like that character, but fanon makes her out to be this super-genius (she's smart and well read, but no prodigy like Dumbledore or Voldemort - she could be if she keeps up her academics, but she isn't during school and neither on the horcrux hunt...sure she took preparations more seriously (tent, wards, her expanded bag etc.) than Ron and Harry, but in the end? She doesn't have a plan either and follows Harry just because, even when he's just bumbling along like the lazy fool he is! Damned, I sound like Snape, but I just don't like anybody of the "golden trio"...Ron the least, Harry and Hermione a bit more but still not really all that much!)

Also: Harry Potter - damned, I know it's childrens books at the start, but those books send the message that it's ok to be a lazy asshole because you'll pull a victory out of a hat if you need to (even if tons of people you might have been able to save if you had only payed more attention and applied yourself more are DEAD!), you only need to be ready to die for the people you love...I absolutely despise that message! Give me a hero's journey every god damned day over this!

Finally: Ron Weasley - gets away with too much in canon (without some punishment, like Harry not talking to him for a few months or something...maybe Arthur really should have died, then Ron might have grown up faster (if he ever did, because to me it doesn't look that way!))...abandoning your supposed best friend twice (remember: Ron leaving/not talking to Harry could have meant Harry's death!), being jeaulous of somebody who doesn't have a family (damned, I was Ron when I was younger and I despise my younger self for that! I was jeaulous of two of my wealthier friends, but I didn't see that both of them didn't have a close relationship with their parents (who gave them goods and money to try and make up for their lack of time!), but at least their parents aren't dead, Harry's parents are and Ron is still a jeaulous little shit!)
