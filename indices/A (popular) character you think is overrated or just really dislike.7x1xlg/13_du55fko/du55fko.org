Tonks. She was a minor character, and I didn't even like her very much, so I don't get why everyone keeps putting her into starring fanfic roles. Also, the stories that make her into a fucking pedophile who has sex with 11-15 year old Harry Potter's like it's something to be proud of, like it's something OKAY. If you're going to write a relationship between a twenty year old woman and a teenage boy, write about how it fucks him up mentally, and how it's NOT SOMETHING HEALTHY. Even write about Tonks needing to get counseling or something about it after she goes to prison. Don't romanticize and glorify that disgusting bullshit, because that says clearly that YOU'VE never actually been in that situation before as a child. You have no idea what it does to you.
