Daphne Greengrass. Not only is she used to often in fanfiction in general, she is also always the same. Its really incredible, considering that almost nothing is known of her canon-wise, that most of the time she is that nearly-Fleur-like-beautiful-Ice-Princess-but-morally-totally-superior bitch that hexes every boy that advances her, but somehow still falls in love with Harry and it gets out that she isnt some evil Slytherin and actually is quite nice and "supports" muggle-born rights or something like this. Then there is also that Harry is easily cowed by her every fucking time and does not dare to speak up, because Daphne apparently is more frightening than a fucking dementor. In the beginning I still liked her, because she was a new unknown character and had so much potential in fanfiction because of that, but I still see her in fics mostly as described above. Its actually kind of sad, but what to do... what to do...
