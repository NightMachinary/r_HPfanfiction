I also don't feel a lot of things taken as flaws in Hermione /are/ flaws. (Yet a lot of fanfics remove them anyway)

For example, my favorite thing about Hermione is her vindictiveness and ruthlessness. That makes her such a complex character, especially as a former good girl who trusted the rules implicitly until that trust was betrayed. Taking that away from her just makes her boring and a wet blanket, literally taking away character-defining character development.
