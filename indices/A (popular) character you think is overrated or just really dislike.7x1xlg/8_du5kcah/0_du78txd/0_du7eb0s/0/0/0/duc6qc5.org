Palatable as in very safe, non-controversial. Doesn't really challenge gender roles in an extreme way beyond the ~a girl whose more intelligent than all the boys~ which may have been a big mold breaker back when it was written for a children's story, but I don't think is that impressive anymore especially when the other female characters are contrasted as shallow and vain. Just my reasoning for why Hermione is glorified so much.
