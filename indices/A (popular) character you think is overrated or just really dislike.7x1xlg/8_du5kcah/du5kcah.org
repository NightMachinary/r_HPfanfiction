Hermione comes across as the bad guy in a fair bit of Philosopher's Stone, Half Blood Prince (with the book and Malfoy) and clearly goes about her House Elf protest in Order of the Phoenix/Goblet of Fire the wrong way as well.

I would also pick Hermione to be exceedingly overrated in fanon.

Hermione's capabilities are blown out of proportion in fanon whilst her flaws are ignored. She panics in dangerous situations and is at times a detriment to the group. She's nowhere near as powerful in the books as she often is in fanon.

Harry doesn't criticise her cruelty and vindictiveness (towards Luna, Ron and Marietta Edgecombe) but several characters are critical of those aspects. She also has a 'black and white' morality, particularly in the early books.

It's a shame that many of the fanfics miss the more complex aspects of her character.
