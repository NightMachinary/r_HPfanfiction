She will make her first appearance in the next chapter (the tenths, since the romance isn't the main focus) but I intend to make her playful but a tad innocent (she had a normal time at school so far, unlike Harry). She doesn't want to be in the spotlight but ends up there due to Harry either way and will struggle with that. Her boyfriend may not care about fangirls, but they will make her life difficult. She will neither be the smartest nor the prettiest girl but instead have balanced strengths and weaknesses.

One of my biggest goals as a writer is to have characters be more than tools for the protagonist, people who have a life besides doing stuff for Harry. Therefore she will be spending time with other people and, for example, Lisa will have different electives and be quite passionate about them, even if Harry can only nod dumbly whenever runes are mentioned.
