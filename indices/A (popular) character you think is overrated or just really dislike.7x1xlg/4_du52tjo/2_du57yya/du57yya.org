I am writing that kind of story and it will actually have a conflict between Harry and Neville, mostly because I grew annoyed with the way he is characterised in a lot of stories. The premise is Sirius getting in touch with the Tonks family and getting them to take care of Harry after a slightly AU PoA, where Hermione's academic drive and Ron's theatrics involving Scabbers drove Harry away from them. Katie Bell and her friend Leanne play larger roles and the eventual paring will be Harry/Lisa Turpin.
