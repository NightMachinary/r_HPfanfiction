I always feel Dean is a missed opportunity in fanfiction. He's always been loyal to Harry, even over his best friend Seamus in Order of the Phoenix.

It would be nice to see Harry become friends with Dean instead, they are both raised in a Muggle culture and are both Half-bloods. He was even meant to play a more important role but Neville's storyline was chosen instead.
