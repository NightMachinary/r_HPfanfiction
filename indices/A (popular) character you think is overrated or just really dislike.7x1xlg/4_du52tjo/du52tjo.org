I hate Neville Longbottom. In every fic that Harry isn't friends with Ron and even when he's in Slytherin he always becomes friends with Neville! It's annoying because I don't like how bumbling, forgetful and impotent Neville is or how his story of coming out his shell. In canon it's whatever because Harry only interacts with him in a minor way, but when he's a major side character it's annoying. I would rather people write someone else be Harry's friend if it isn't Ron.
