I don't necessarily dislike her, but I don't like how Luna is portrayed. She is either some kinky sex freak, a mystical seer or secret genius. My favorite portrayals of her have been as a scared girl who saw her mom die, her dad had essentially a nervous breakdown and her whole world is screwed up. She is bullied because she is a little odd, and that just makes her retreat more in to her fantasy world.
