I'll agree with you on the "overhyped" part, she is an ideal vessel for a mary sue and is often written in a very similar way(beautiful, smart, rule-abiding, always screams at James, "force to be reckoned with" ). But as a canon character, she is an amazing woman, who sacrificed her life for her child, was indeed very smart and kind. So I don't think she is overrated and deserves some praise.
