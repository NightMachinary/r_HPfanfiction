Nah, she's extremely overrated too. She might have been exceptional at potions, but that doesn't mean she wasn't average at other subjects and yet people act that way. 'Oh but Slughorn praised her a lot!' Slughorn didn't teach her all subjects, only potions. When people do bring up the evidence that James /was/ smarter (along with Sirius) it's more often than not ignored or 'James was dead so people are trying to make Harry feel better!'

That argument isn't used for Lily and yet it's just as applicable for her as it is to James.

I'm not saying she wasn't kind, or decently smart and had a wonderful personality. She might have been' flawless' for all we know and she knew it. But thats arguably a flaw itself. Her personality is commonly rid of every single flaw. I mean come on, she was dead and people praise the dead a lot. She was human, therefore she had flaws and she's ripped of off them.
