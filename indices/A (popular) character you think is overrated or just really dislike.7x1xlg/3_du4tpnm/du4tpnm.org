Remus Lupin. A 17-year-old virgin (Harry) had to save his marriage after he ran away from his pregnant wife. Marriage vows include some variations of "in good and in bad times" and he broke those vows. Realistically speaking, that would have destroyed a lot of trust and would take years to heal, if not done irreversible damage.

He also did nothing for Harry outside of his job and he was getting paid for that. Even Sirius Black, facing summary execution, tried to help Harry during the tournament, while Lupin has absolutely 0 excuses for doing nothing. And he seemed to value his "connection" to Harry since he made the boy, who hasn't yet gotten his dick wet, godfather of his own son.

Yes, he had a rather difficult life, but outside of the Weasleys, who didn't? Harry was abused at home, his parents murdered, Sirius was abused to a lesser degree as well and falsely incarcerated for 11 years, James lost his parents before 20, Hermione was bullied, Andromeda was thrown out of her family and even Snape had abusive/neglectful parents.
