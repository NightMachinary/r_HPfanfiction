- Magic per se definitely doesn't make electricity fail; we see Arthur magically repair an electric fireplace in GoF.

- In general, the HP series does not employ unreliable narrators: if a character tells us something about magic, you can generally take it to be true. This is /especially/ the case for Hermione and Dumbledore, who JKR [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0302-newsround-mzimba.htm][explicitly]] tells us are used to info-dump worldbuilding to the reader.

  Steve: Yeah, I mean, I like writing all three, but I've always loved writing Hermione. Because, I just, one, she's a tremendous character for a lot of reasons for a writer, which also is she can carry exposition in a wonderful way because you just assume she read it in a book. If I need to tell the audience something...

  JKR: Absolutely right, I find that all the time in the book, if you need to tell your readers something just put it in her. There are only two characters that you can put it convincingly into their dialogue. One is Hermione, the other is Dumbledore. In both cases you accept, it's plausible that they have, well Dumbledore knows pretty much everything anyway, but that Hermione has read it somewhere. So, she's handy.

- Electricity may well break at the Ministry or Diagon Alley; there's no reason to think that it would spill over into Muggle London. It's not like it's some physical "field"; we're told it arises out of a place being magical. Diagon Alley is magical, Charing Cross Road isn't, therefore the effect would be in place in Diagon Alley, but not in Charing Cross Road.

- Technically Hermione's quote isn't limited to electricity, which is just quoted as one example of "All those substitutes for magic Muggles use". I suspect the effect prevents any object that is too "Muggleish" from working, not just electricity.
