1. I am not saying that magic is sapient, I am saying that certain concepts are built into magic. Magic treats Muggleish objects as a natural category in the same way that it treats "food" (Gamp's law), "secrets" (fidelius charm), "DADA Professor" (Voldemort's curse), etc. as natural kinds to which magical effects may attach. Magic operates at a conceptual level, not a physical one, and frequently treats concepts that we consider subjective or human-relative as objective parts of the universe.

2. Yes, the magicalness of a place is what determines whether or not the effect occurs; this is what we are told - it only occurs in highly magical places.

3. There's no reason to consider Hogwarts: A History unreliable; the publication date is a poor argument as we know there have been innumerable revised editions. The general rule is that if we're told that magic behaves a certain way, then we should believe it unless there is some other textual evidence to make us doubt it.

4. I never said anything about buildings. I was talking about places. Are Hogwarts' grounds part of Hogwarts? Yes. Therefore any magical effect which is a property of "Hogwarts" will have effect there. Is Charing Cross Road part of Diagon Alley? No. Therefore any magical effect which is a property of "Diagon Alley" will not occur there. The phrase "in the air" is a common idiom to describe the character of a locale; it is rarely a literal reference to the air.
