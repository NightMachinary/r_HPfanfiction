If magic in general doesn't make electrical items fail, as in the case of Arthur Weasley repairing the electrical fire - and also when he's modifying his car - why would just the presence of lots of it interfere with them? Are you suggesting that some non-specific aspect of magic is sapient, and hates anything too, as you put it, "Muggleish"?

Hermione is absolutely an unreliable source in this case, because at this point she still hasn't had her complete trust in authority and books broken yet - that happens in the following year thanks to Umbrige and her Defence text - and also because her source is unreliable. As I said, she's taking her information from Hogwarts: A History, which was written by someone who predates the modern development of electricity as a power source.

A lot of the things which initisally make Harry think Skeeter might be using electronic bugging of some kind - and which Hermione refutes because "electricity . . . all those things . . . go haywire around Hogwarts" - are things that happen outside. These include that Skeeter somehow listened in on a conversation between Hermione an Krum that happened next to the Black Lake, Harry seeing Draco talking into his hand, as though holding a walkie-talky whilst outside under a tree, and that she also knew the content of the conversation between Hagrid and Maxime in the rose garden during the Yule Ball.

Hermione refutes electronic bugging as possible in instances outide of the Hogwarts building due to something "in the air" in not only the building but it's grounds that interferes with electricity. So if this mysterious disembodied force which you imply exists, identifies "Muggleish" objects and futzes with them, it's not limited to the inside of magical buildings as you suggest.
