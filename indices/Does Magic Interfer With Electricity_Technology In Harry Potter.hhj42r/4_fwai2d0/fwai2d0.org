I read a story that postulated that a previous headmaster used "wards" to ensure that electric items couldn't work at Hogwarts. This was due to how unstable and unsafe electricity was when it was first invented. These "wards" were placed in other magical areas like diagon alley, etc. Of course once being taught that electric items don't work due to magic the magicals don't try.

Now the reason I believe that magic doesn't cause electric devices to fail is that Diagon Alley, Kings Cross Station etc is in the heart of downtown London and if magic caused problems the mundanes would notice because it would cause too many problems (think commuter trains at king cross and office buildings overtop and around of the ministry).
