Lights, washing machine (dryer as well ig), kettle, radio, alarm, phone, heating/cooling system (I'm not sure if in cannon those charms last forever/until canceled or overridden I've read too much fanfic), sink, tub, shower, water heater, fridge/freezer, toilet.

There are so many things that we take for granted without realizing that they require electricity. Maybe the castle filled with plenty of adults could handle keeping everything running (doubtful, otherwise what was the point of filch), but there is just no way two parents can in such a huge house, honestly it would be a struggle in a small townhouse, especially when one works all day and comes home tired, and the other is busy taking care of 7 kids, and chickens, and magical garden pests
