The only thing there that absolutely /requires/ electricity is the telephone. (strictly speaking, you can have lanterns for lights)

People did this all the time before electricity. They even had iceboxes /in summer/ before electricity (people would gather ice in winter, store it underground with sawdust, and then bring it up as needed).

Now, the A/C and shower /would/ be too much of a hassle for a seven-person household with only one stay-at-home parent, even when the kids are all old enough to help out with the chores (the shower in particular would be one of those "feasible, but why bother?" things), but otherwise this is all pretty plausible in one form or another. There might not be, say, a washing machine, but there /are/ a variety of ways to wash clothes without an electric washing machine, by hand and otherwise.

Heck, the heating systems that people /used/ to have before electricity were actually more energy-efficient than what we use today.

It would take work, sure, but (1) magic and (2) it isn't beyond the scope of "one homemaker and five adolescents" to manage (or "one homemaker" when the kids are at Hogwarts, but there's a lot less work that has to be done then, too).
