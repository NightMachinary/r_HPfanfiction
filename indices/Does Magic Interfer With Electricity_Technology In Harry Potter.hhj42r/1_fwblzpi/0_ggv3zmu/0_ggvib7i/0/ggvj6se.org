People come across old comments all the time, especially on a subreddit full of discussion threads on topics that people will still be looking up in the future. I'm not posting this for /you/ so much as posting it for anyone who comes across it in the future and wonders, "Yeah, how /does/ cooking work without electricity?"

Well, it works with gas (or wood or coal or...).

There are gas ovens.

(An argument could be made for a coal or wood oven, too, but there are natural gas lines in Ottery St. Mary, for which Ottery St. Catchpole is almost certainly a stand-in, so I wouldn't be bothered to learn that the Weasleys had a line)
