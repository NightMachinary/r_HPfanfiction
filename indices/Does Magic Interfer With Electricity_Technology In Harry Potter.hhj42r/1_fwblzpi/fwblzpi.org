If electricity dosnt work around magic then how does /cooking/ work. Yeah adult wizards could start a fire on a stove or use a warming charm in an oven, (although it is a /warming/ charm not a /400 degrees F heating/ charm) but underage wizards and witches wanting to cook wouldnt be able to. In a wizarding family theres magic everywhere. The burrow is held up with magic. By this logic if Ron wanted to make some cookies he couldn't without Molly or Arthur
