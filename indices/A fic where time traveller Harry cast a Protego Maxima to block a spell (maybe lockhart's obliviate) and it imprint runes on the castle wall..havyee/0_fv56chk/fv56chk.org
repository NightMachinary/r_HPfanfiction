/The overdressed charlatan whirled back toward the mostly stunned students, but Harry's wand was already out. The Boy Who Lived held it out sideways, clenched in a fist shaking with rage. “/Protego Maximus/!” he roared as Lockhart finished his spell./

/A semi-translucent wall of light spread out from Harry's fist, expanding until it reached the floor, walls, and ceiling with a loud crunch. Beyond it, he could see Lockhart snapping his wand forward to erase their memories as well. This was one spell the man could perform with great skill, having never been caught once over the course of his entire career. If the bastard succeeded, Ginny's life would probably be extinguished before they even remembered she was in danger. Harry panicked and reinforced his shield with everything he could put into it. The stones around them groaned and a suit of armour flew to pieces./

/There was a bright flash of light, visible even through the shield, and Lockhart was violently thrown backward. Harry held for a moment, and then let the shield drop. He stepped forward, but kept his wand on the professor the entire time. Gilderoy Lockhart lay perfectly still on the hard flagstones, his head turned to one side. His eyes were staring glassily into space, the only signs of life the slow rise and fall of his chest and a thin line of drool creeping down from the corner of his mouth./

/“What did you do to him?” Ron asked quietly./

/“I think I reflected back a memory charm strong enough to wipe all five of us at once,” Harry said. “Hermione, now we know why he's never been caught before. He probably let someone else do the dirty work, Obliviated them, and then took all the credit.”/

/But the bushy-haired witch wasn't paying much attention. She was staring at the floor. Where Harry's panic-driven shield had touched the millennia-old stones, a groove three inches wide and at least an inch deep had been gouged. She looked up at Harry, her eyes wide. “What did you do?” she asked./
