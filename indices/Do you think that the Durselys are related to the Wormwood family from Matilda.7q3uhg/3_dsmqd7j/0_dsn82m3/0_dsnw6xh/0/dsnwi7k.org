The movie is a really good adaptation of the book (though I got a little miffed that they cut my favourite character, Nigel), and Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman are great as the Wormwoods... but perhaps it doesn't quite capture how much the Wormwoods do NOT LIKE Matilda.

While she's generally more neglected than downright abused, and certainly doesn't get locked in a cupboard the way Harry did, she does get her fair share of verbal abuse (in true Roald Dahl-fashion, the Wormwoods can get really creative in thinking up insults and belittling things to call someone), and her father does at one point tear up a library book she borrowed and gleefully tell her that SHE'LL have to pay for it.
