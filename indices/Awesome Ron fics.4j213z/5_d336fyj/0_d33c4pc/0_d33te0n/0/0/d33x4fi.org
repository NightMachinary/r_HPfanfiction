It's an AU. PTSD is a thing there. And it assumes that you can't simply turn a country into a replica of Nazi Germany and start to genoicde muggleborn without a significant part of the government and at least the elite supporting that. It further asusmes that Magical Europe did not advance after 1690, but was stuck in feudal and monarchistic systems, and even those who had a nominally democratic regime were more an oligarchy than a democracy. And everywhere muggleborns were oppressed, which was a reason why many of them supported Grindelwald decades ago.

People were not executed for "thought crimes", but for rape and/or (mass) murder, or for helping others to rape and/or (mass)murder.

I also don't know why you think revolutions cannot work out. There are numerous examples where people shook off the yoke of aristocrats, and didn't end up in a grimdark corrupted country. The American Revolution comes to mind.

With regards to the competency and "easy mode": I used history as examples for the conflict. The foreign nations were stomped because that happens to corrupt regimes when the majority of the population can't be oppressed anymore and demands equal rights. The other nations were not stomped by the protagonists, they were stomped by the population rising up - in France, in Prussia, in Bulgaria, and ultimately, in Russia. The British helped there, but in each case, the majority of the "stomping" was done by the natives - with France being an exception, at the start at least.

With regards to incompetence: the purebloods were fighting with magic, against an enemy using magic and technology. That's a doomed course of action from the start. But in order to use technology, they would have had to abandon the very ideology they were fighting for.

The purebloods were doomed just as the nazis were doomed when the USA entered the war in 1941. Overall, the nazis were about as competent as the purebloods in the story - outclassed, but doing their best (or worst). They bloodied the Western Allies a few times, caused casualties all throughout the invasion and drive to Germany, but they had no chance at all to win. None.

The story wasn't meant to be a tale where victory was snatched from the jaws of total defeat with a trench run by rogue squadron, seconds before everyone died. It was modelled after WW2, with the Western Allies marching through occupied Europe. And overall, that worked out well for Western Europe. Even the execution of nazi criminals after the war didn't lead to a new dark age.

So, yeah, I don't get the problem people have with a story where wizard nazis ruling over an oppressed Magical Europe suffer the same fate as real life nazis did when they were ruling over an occupied Europe. Unless they want to complain that WW2 was unrealistic.

After the first invasion was defeated, the question for the New Wizarding Britain was never "will we win?" but "what will victory cost us?" And of course: "How will we get along with the UK once the war is over and we don't have a common enemy anymore?"

Are the British muggleborns and blood traitors in the story the good guys? They did a number of evil things, but overall, they were not worse - not even close to - than the Western Allies in WW2.
