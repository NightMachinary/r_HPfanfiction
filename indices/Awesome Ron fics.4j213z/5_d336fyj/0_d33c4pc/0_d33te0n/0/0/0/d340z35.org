The technical aspects of the writing are good, and most of the story is decent. The writing isn't bad. What we're disagreeing on is, I suspect, mostly subjective reactions to the setting and tone.

Also, I completely forgot that you were the author, which makes this discussion a bit awkward. However, I'll give you my honest opinion and hope you take it in the spirit it's given.

  It further asusmes that Magical Europe did not advance after 1690, but was stuck in feudal and monarchistic systems, and even those who had a nominally democratic regime were more an oligarchy than a democracy. And everywhere muggleborns were oppressed, which was a reason why many of them supported Grindelwald decades ago.
#+end_quote

This, coupled with muggleborns not having (successfully) fought back earlier, just doesn't seem realistic to me. The setting seems contrived and rather unlikely to occur naturally.

  It was modelled after WW2, with the Western Allies marching through occupied Europe.
#+end_quote

I definitely didn't draw any WW2 parallels when reading it. Part of it is, of course, the statute of secrecy - it's almost impossible to have a serious land war, and instead you'd expect more assassinations, coupled with fear and occupying a few key buildings. Voldemort's attempts to take over Wizarding Britain seem closer to what I'd expect to happen. None of the individual ideas are bad, they just don't seem to mesh well with the setting you used (at least in my opinion).

  So, yeah, I don't get the problem people have with a story where wizard nazis ruling over an oppressed Magical Europe suffer the same fate as real life nazis did when they were ruling over an occupied Europe. Unless they want to complain that WW2 was unrealistic.

The Nazis had control of Germany and Austria, the Sudetenland and Alsace, iirc. Everywhere else they were foreign occupiers, and imposed their rule from above as opposed to being the 'local' government. Speaking of Wizard Nazis, look up the 'Night of Long Knives', as well as the aftermath of the 'Reichstag Fire'. There are parallels to be drawn to both sides of the conflict in your story.

I suppose the point I'm getting towards is, your story is a good example of what I'd call Grey and Black morality - the heroes aren't the noble defenders of the oppressed who want to create a wonderful world for everyone, they're just fighting for the least shitty cause. There's nothing wrong with that, but it feels like the whole setting has been fine-tuned to make them look like the shining heroes. Whether that's what you were going for or not, that's the impression I got from it in the end.

#+begin_quote
  And it assumes that you can't simply turn a country into a replica of Nazi Germany and start to genoicde muggleborn without a significant part of the government and at least the elite supporting that.
#+end_quote

If Voldemort really had that much support, he wouldn't have needed to fight from his resurrection until he killed Scrimgeour. He could have just taken over immediately.

Everything that happens in the story follows logically from something we are told, but it often feels unnatural and manufactured - of course the enemy are all evil, and of course the mass-murders of diplomats was justified, but it seems to be by fiat. You can't have a whole government of Darth Vaders - more than one or two overtly evil guys doesn't really work, imo.

#+begin_quote
  I also don't know why you think revolutions cannot work out. There are numerous examples where people shook off the yoke of aristocrats, and didn't end up in a grimdark corrupted country. The American Revolution comes to mind.
#+end_quote

The American Revolution was a side theater of a larger war between England and France, where the locals were opposed to the foreign (and remote) rulers of the land. While technically a revolution, it wasn't like the one in your story, as the forces they were fighting were not 'local', for lack of a better word - it wasn't a civil war in the same way. And organised killing of political opponents is generally a very bad sign for the quality of the new government - the fact that coincidentally all the political opponents in HGMLR were Evil with a capital E feels contrived.
