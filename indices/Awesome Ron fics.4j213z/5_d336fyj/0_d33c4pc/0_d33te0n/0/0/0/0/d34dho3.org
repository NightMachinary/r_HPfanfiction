I think you have a very biased view of some points. "Mass murder of diplomats"? The delegation demanded the surrender of Britain, and when that was refused, drew wands to attack the Minister. That's when the British forces opened fire, and killed them. That's not "Mass murder" by any sane definition. That's self-defense. If a diplomatic delegation tried to draw arms on the Prime Minister, his security details would shoot at them as well - would you call that "mass murder"? I hope not.

With regards to the muggleborns not fighting successfully back until then, I have to point out that popular revolts often took several attempts to succeed. In this story, Gridnelwald attracted a large number of muggleborns (which explains why he managed to invade other countries so successfully), but his defeat set back their cause as well. I modeled that after Napoleon, who was welcomed by many, and the restoration of the old Europe (with great influence by Metternich) after his defeat as an example for that. Several rebellions and revolutions in Europe followed, but it took decades for them to finally succeed.

For the setting itself, I assumed that until 1690, there was no separation, and afterwards, the magicals copied the systems they were used to and continued - with a magical Duc in France, for example, a Tsar in Russia, etc. Some countries had shake-ups, most importantly Prussia, who ended up with a Chancelor after Grindelwald, the old system having been destroyed. And the Magical Ottoman Empire was pushed back from balkans as was their mundane counterpart. But overall, I simply assumed that the countries were kept going as they started - a not really weird assumption, I think, given how conservative dress modes were in canon.

I am very familiar with Nazi Germany and WW2. I don't need to look up how Hitler came to power. I really hope you do not actually equal the massacres nazis did to the trials that led to the executions of nazi war criminals after the war. Harry and Hermione had trials for the captured purebloods, with veritaserum. They didn't massacre prisoners. It's just that in this story, far more purebloods were all too ready to massacre uppity muggleborns or at least help with the genocide than in canon, and so more people were executed for those crimes. Of course those who willingly helped with the raping and murdering were also political opponents - but calling their executions "organised killing of political opponents" is so skewed and wrong, it's on the level of calling the nazi trials after the war as "murder of political prisoners". Once again: Political opponents were not killed. Only murderers and rapists and their willing, eager helpers were executed, after trials. I really do not get why people keep claiming things that never happened in the story. I even show, in several scenes, that the pureblood opposition is still alive, and working on their own candidate against Harry and Hermione.

I maintain that in order to take over as quickly as he did, Voldemort had more support in the government and the elites. I assume that only Dumbledore, being his equal, was what held him back from simply taking over. As soon as Dumbledore was dead, the government fell.

I draw parallels between the Nazis occupying Europe and the pureblood aristocrats oppressing muggleborns since effectively, pureblood wizard nations are separate countries - at least they see themselves as that - and the muggleborns are all citizens of muggle countries. For them, the local government would be the muggle government, not the one that came to them at age 11 and told them to submit to the new rulers now.

With regards to the actual war, most of it was mobile strikes against wizard enclaves or enemy camps.

And yes, compared to genocidal racists, the good guys look like shining heroes. I did show though that even among the bad guys, people cared for their family, and the Tsar went as far as to sacrifice himself to end the Russian civil war to save his country further destruction, after sparing his son who had tried to end the war by a coup against him.

With regards to "a whole government of Darth Vaders": I did style whole governments after historical examples. Whole governments were ready to crush the French Revolution to restore the god-given rule of the monarchy. Whole state governments, whole states, were ready to fight for their right to keep slaves in the ACW. And the idea that colored people were subhumans was shared by a lot of people in the 1850s, and for decades afterwards. That's what I used as examples for the enemies.

I am glad you consider this attitude Darth Vaderish, but it doesn't change the fact that it was very, very real just 150-200 years ago in real life.

And fighting against them, fighting for the freedom of your fellow muggleborns, is not exactly "fighting for the least shitty cause". At least IMHO.
