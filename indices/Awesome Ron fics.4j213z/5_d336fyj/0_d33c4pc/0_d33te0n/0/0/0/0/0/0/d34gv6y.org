I think you are projecting attitudes from other stories on my story. I never really played up the pureblood regimes as particularly honourable. But even if they were, they wouldn't extend that to mudbloods. The pureblood aristocrats see mudbloods as the Southern "gentlemen" saw African-Americans prior to the ACW, and Colonial powers saw "Lesser races" in Africa. They didn't really treat them with honour.

The "diplomatic delegation" was composed of the dauphin of Magical France, and his "companions" - two dozen of the most skilled duellists of France - and had come to take over the country in the name of the ICW's mandate, not to negotiate anything. With the apparent leaders of this "mudblood regime" right there, they thought they could stomp out this little rebellion easily - the rest of the mudbloods would surely run once Harry and Hermione were done for. Or at least wouldn't dare attacking once the leaders were caught.

I'm not exactly certain that we're coming from two different points of views when it comes to morality, I think we simply see the world in my story very differently. You simply do not seem to accept that in my story, a lot more people were Death Eaters in deed, if not in name. I've equated the pureblood regimes to the nazis, and with good reason. They consider muggleborns as subhumans - just like nazis saw other races, and many white Americans in the south saw African-Americans. The British had been faced with an actual genocide, and then - as shown in the prologue - saw that the vast majority of the mass-murderers were not punished by the new regime. They saw that the same thing that had happened 20 years ago was happening again: The bulk of the criminals were getting free, and nothing really was changing.

Faced with this, faced with in their eyes sufficient proof that the "legal" way wasn't working, that the new regime was as corrupt as the old one, they saw no other valid choice to protect themselves and their families, and to prevent a third blood war, than a violent revolution. That's, in my opinion, an ethically acceptable choice. If fighting Voldemort was acceptable, then fighting his heirs who are protecting Voldemort's followers from punishment for their crimes is acceptable too.

And, again - it's not "puppy kicking evil", it's an attitude that was widespread among Western countries in the 19th century when it came to other races, especially Africans and African-Americans. Colonial powers committed the first genocides in response to rebellions. And no one really cared.

I'm sorry if you prefer a grittier, "everyone is evil" story, but when one side is fighting for their lives and freedom, and the other is fighting for their "right" to oppress and kill them, that's simply not the case. That wasn't the case in canon either, by the way.
