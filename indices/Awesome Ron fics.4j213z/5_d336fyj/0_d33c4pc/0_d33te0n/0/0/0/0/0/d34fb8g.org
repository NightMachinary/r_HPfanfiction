  The delegation demanded the surrender of Britain, and when that was refused, drew wands to attack the Minister.

I must have misremembered that - I can't remember when I read it, but it was at least a few months ago. Still, that sounds rather strange - send a diplomatic delegation and then they open fire? It doesn't feel realistic at all, especially when you play up how the purebloods value their honour. I'm sure there's an explanation, but that just makes it feel like authorial fiat decides that they're the bad guys so they have to kick puppies. I'd like the story more if there were morally questionable decisions made by the main characters that felt morally questionable, and were treated that way.

I feel like we're talking from two completely different points of view when it comes to ethics and morality. I think I was reading around this area [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/uu/why_does_power_corrupt/]["Why Does Power Corrupt?"]], [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/uv/ends_dont_justify_means_among_humans/]["The Ends Don't Justify The Means (Among Humans)"]], [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/v0/ethical_inhibitions/]["Ethical Inhibitions"]] of the lesswrong sequences when I started HGMLR, but I'm not 100% sure. Nevertheless, you might find it interesting reading, if for nothing else than to see where I'm coming from when I say that HGMLR feels somewhat unrealistic.

I see that we have different impressions of what happened in the story. I'm not foolish enough to think I know better than the author, but regardless of what you wrote, this is the subjective experience I still have from it, several months later.

I read it with much the same feelings as Saruman of Many Devices - it was interesting, but not gripping or tense, and it didn't feel too much like the original source at all, either in characters or setting. That's not a criticism - I generally like AU stories, it's just that this one lacked a few of the things that I personally enjoy. I'm trying to phrase this in the least confrontational way possible, but I wouldn't rate your story as highly as some others I've read, and that's for a range of reasons, most of which I've tried (with only limited success) to write down. I can understand it must be annoying, as I'm willing to bet to you it feels like I'm missing the point repeatedly, but written communication over large [[https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance][inferential distances]] - you know more about the military history of Europe, for example - is always difficult, especially with the added difficulty of imperfect memory.
