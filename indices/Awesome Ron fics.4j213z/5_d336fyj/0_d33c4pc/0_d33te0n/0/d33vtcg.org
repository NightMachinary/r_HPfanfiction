I don't have a problem with people who've committed crimes (e.g. raped, murdered, stolen) are tried and punished but killing people for 'thoughtcrimes' - as in, for their beliefs /even if they don't act on them/ - is something I find repugnant. Then again, in the UK there's no death penalty and our police aren't even usually armed so I suppose it's a different culture with regards to crime and punishment. There's typically also not many people with fantasies of violently overthrowing the government and replacing it, as we don't have recent civil wars and haven't been invaded or had another country 'own' us since 1066.

I don't remember all the details from the story but I remember that the author goes out of their way to make a bunch of characters act out-of-character compared to canon so that they can feel justified in having Harry and Hermione kill them in cold blood. I also think the story is quite unrealistic in a lot of ways, and very AU, despite claiming (iirc) to be close to canon.

As it's been over half a year, I don't remember all the details, but I do know that after I finished it I was confused about how the plot started at the end of canon HP and ended up where it did. I would recommend it to people if they liked rather bloody and action-heavy stories, but not to people who want more justification for the plot and political consequences other than "now the good guys are in charge".

I originally thought when reading the story that it was going to turn into a dark look at how power corrupts, because pretty much all the actions Harry and Hermione take look like the sort of things that start out with the best intentions and then lead to something like the French Revolution, or post-revolution Communist Russia. Instead, everything went their way, all the enemies are incompetents and idiots who can't cast spells properly, and every foreign european nation gets stomped by the protagonists (at least that's the impression it left me with).
