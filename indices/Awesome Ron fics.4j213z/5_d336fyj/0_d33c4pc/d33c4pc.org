Gryffindors Never Die is great. I like how Ron ends up as Minister instead of Harry (not a spoiler, it's a time travel story and that much is revealed in the first chapter), although the ending is a bit anticlimactic.

I didn't like the Marriage Law Revolution *(spoilers ahead)*. I read it the whole way through, expecting at every moment that reality would assert itself and the main characters would realise that a massive bloodbath of their political enemies doesn't normally lead to a strong or moral government (see, among others, the French Revolution), and for the massive muggle weapon wanking to stop. It just broke my suspension of disbelief really hard, and felt more like either an Aesop or a dystopian sci-fi novel than anything to do with Harry Potter.

I've not read Sum of Their Parts, but I'll add it to my to-read list.
