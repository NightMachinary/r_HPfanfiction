This really was a breath of fresh air. Such a simple yet different way to tackle HONKS pairing. Really enjoyed the way the story progressed. it seemed realistic and the motivations behind the actions of the characters really rung true for me.

I also agree with the authors take on Remus as he never approached harry in his third year which I never understood.
