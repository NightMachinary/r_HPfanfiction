  Harry Potter in the Dark Destiny Series is a lot similar to his original self from the original series for most part however come differences have some apparent, his Gryffindor persona is only one side of the coin that hides his other more shadowed side, this side would be his hidden Slytherin persona and his affinity for the Dark Arts. Despite being called Harry Potter, he changed his middle name to Harry James Florentine Potter, he is the Patriarch of the New Potter Family.
