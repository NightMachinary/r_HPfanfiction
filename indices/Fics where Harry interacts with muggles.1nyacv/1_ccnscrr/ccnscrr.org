Slight spoiler as it gradually reveals this over the first few chapters, with some hints of it early on, but the premise is that Harry is kicked out by the Dursleys at the age of 8 and adopted by an older Muggle who is investigating the Wizarding world (he is not aware that Harry is a wizard initially).
