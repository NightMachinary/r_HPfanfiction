I mean, there's the stereotype of more females writing fanfiction and the weird thing of people tending to write characters of their own gender more often (I find it far more interesting to write and read people who aren't overly like me - I've been me for 23 years, I've never been them, so it's interesting to try relate to that).

Perhaps also the wider trope of Father-Daughter bonding that seems to be in vogue at the moment - the Last of Us sort of dynamic has been more present in my experience than any kind of Father-Son bonding tropes, but that might just be my taste in stories.

Could also be a perception that Dudley's son would turn out more like Dudley (and thus Vernon) where his daughter would turn out more like her mother (and thus not one of the people who abused Harry).

In short, I have no idea - but there's a lot of possibilities. :D
