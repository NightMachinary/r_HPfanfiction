Good point. Magical people would probably end up worshipping the relevant god of Magic in their culture - Marduk, Hecate, Odin, Isis, etc. Don't think they'd go with Christianity, given the whole witch-burning thing and the general anti-magical sentiments of the Abrahamic religions, but I could see them going for some religions, at least.
