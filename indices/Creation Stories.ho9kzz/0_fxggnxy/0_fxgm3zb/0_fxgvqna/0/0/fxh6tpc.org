  Hell, I remember a few people in my A-Level theology classes angrily talking about the Curse of Ham and how Christianity was complicit in the slave trade.

Well, of course, I know about William Wilberforce (who I guess was who Hermione dreamt about when founding S.P.E.W.), but there is also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery#The_Bible_is_not_against_slavery]] and I had in my hands the book “Biblical Foundations of Slavery” (sometime from 1820s or so), which proved by the Bible study, that slavery is not only most-Christian order of things, but that nations based on slavery are more civilized than the barbaric ones, which don't have it. I think, we Christians (and I am the practising Christian), should be very humble.

  People aren't all idiots, sure, but there are enough around to be statistically significant. :)
