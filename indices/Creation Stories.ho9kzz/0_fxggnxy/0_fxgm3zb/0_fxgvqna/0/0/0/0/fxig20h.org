  you specifically need to be humble about it is a bit self-blaming for the actions of other people - actions that you had absolutely no input into or control to stop.

I think I understand what you mean. I don't take personal responsibility for actions of somebody else, I really don't pretend to be Torquemada, but I am always wary of people who thoughtlessly follow the path of “Christ is always right and virtuous - Church is always right and virtuous - I am always right and virtuous.” There are too many of them around and they look completely ridiculous to any non-believer, and that is one of the most common acts of /Chillul Hashem/ I can see here.
