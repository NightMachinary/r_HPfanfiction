Fair enough. Apologies if that came off as patronising - I really struggle with phrasing my thoughts properly when I'm tired, and I've been talking mostly to mental health people for about two months now, so I'm still defaulting to reassurance and rebuilding self-esteem mode. :D

Also, completely agreed on the wariness note - thoughtless adherence to anything is rarely a route for people to live their best lives. Especially since believing yourself perfect seems to be sacrilege to most monotheistic religions anyway. Most Holy Books and Churches tend to be firm on the idea that only their God is perfect, after all, and we are but imperfect sinners. :)
