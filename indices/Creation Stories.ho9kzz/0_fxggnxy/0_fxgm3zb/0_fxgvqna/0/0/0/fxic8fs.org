  I think, we Christians (and I am the practising Christian), should be very humble
#+end_quote

I dunno. I mean, I personally think humility is just the easiest and most effective way to go through life (With pride comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom and all that :D), but I don't think that the actions of other Christians necessitate your specific humility.

Christianity is a very diverse religion full of diverse beliefs and diverse levels of commitment about those beliefs. Taking the blame for those power-hungry idiots and arseholes (both those who are active now and those who and deciding you specifically need to be humble about it is a bit self-blaming for the actions of other people - actions that you had absolutely no input into or control to stop.

But that's also really not what I meant in my last message. Literally all I was saying is that some people see Religion and the bad things the Religious have done as linked. Whether they're right or wrong to do so is quite far above my metaphorical pay grade, and I wouldn't be comfortable making that value judgement anyway. That kind of thing is frowned upon in Psychology. :)

  Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that
#+end_quote

Heh. Good quote. :)

Though I will say that I don't believe in stupid people - just people who haven't learnt the things that will make them understand yet. It's all about what you experience and how you develop as a person from that. :)
