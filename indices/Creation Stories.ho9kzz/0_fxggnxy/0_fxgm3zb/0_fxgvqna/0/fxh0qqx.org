I mean, I very much disagree with the first point - the very existence and semi-prevalence of anti-theism alone would point to that. I'm not saying they're right or wrong to link the 'idiocy' and Christianity - I don't have an opinion and I'm vehemently unqualified to have one, never mind offer one, and I really, really don't want to be the kind of person who debates religion on the internet anyway - but to say people don't distinguish Christianity from the bad things Christians have done is highly inaccurate. Hell, I remember a few people in my A-Level theology classes angrily talking about the Curse of Ham and how Christianity was complicit in the slave trade. Whether they were right or wrong, they definitely believed it was true. People say similar things about most religions. People also believe the Earth is flat and that man never walked on the moon and that mental health is a sign of demonic possession. People aren't all idiots, sure, but there are enough around to be statistically significant. :)

It's like interpretations of Harry Potter characters. Right or wrong, canon or fanon, some people will wholeheartedly believe that and back their interpretation with something from the books, often with the same words being used to back completely different conclusions. That's Humanity. If there's an opinion on something, someone somewhere has it and will fight to the internet death to defend it. :)

I can see your point about muggleborn-immigrant conversion of Magicals to Christianity, though. Just by sheer weight of numbers, probability would mean there'd have to be at least some Magicals converting to Muggle religions.

And yep. Hunting Magicals is a worldwide hobby (:D). And I didn't mean to imply it was specific to Christianity, I was only naming it specifically since you used them specifically in your earlier post. Academic habit. Really though, pretty much every terrible thing you can think of has been done by pretty much every culture to at least one other culture at one point or another. If only he who is without sin can throw the first stone, nobody on the planet is ever throwing anything ever again. :)
