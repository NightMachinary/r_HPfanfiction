I don't think so.

First, people are not idiots, and they are able to distinguish between idiocy caused by stupid mob or bunch of power-hungry idiots, and what the Christianity is truly about.

Second, there was continuous trickle of Muggleborns and Muggle-raised (or outright Muggles) as spouses coming into the magical world. Until roughly the Second World War even in Europe almost everybody was at least professing Christianity (or Judaism and some other minority religions), so I guess this continuous (albeit perhaps not very strong) pressure would turn at least some wizards and witches towards Christianity. I could imagine some traditionally fiercely Christian families and some (probably some ultra-anti-Muggle pureblood ones) who would keep some Celtic/pagan rites.

And that's just in Europe/America with regards to Christianity. In cultures where no witch-hunts happened ... actually, I don't know whether they really didn't happen elsewhere ... hmm, [[https://wikiislam.net/index.php?title=Islamic_Witch_Hunts][they exist in Islam]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt#India][in India]] (or [[https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/12/13/witch-hunt-women-india-real-and-deadly/930270001/][here]]) “The practice of witch-hunt among Santhals was more brutal than that in Europe.” Hmm.
