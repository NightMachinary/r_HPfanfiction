About Number 6, in the brazilian portuguese version of the books, she's constantly called Mione after book 4, IIRC. Not saying its acceptable and right, just that it happened here, so I wasn't that shocked when i saw they called her that often. And yes, this is probably the translator/editor/publisher's fault and not the original. Seeing as I hate fanonHermione, I really don't care much either way.
