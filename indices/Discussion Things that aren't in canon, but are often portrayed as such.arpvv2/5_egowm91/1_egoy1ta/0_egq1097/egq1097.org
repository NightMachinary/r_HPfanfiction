Well, consider the part of the line from the book which is "you're less like your father *than I though*". Which strongly suggests that, while the rational part of Sirius is obviously clear that Harry is not James, there is a part of Sirius which misses James and is hoping to relive some glory days through Harry.

It's not uncommon for parents to project their hopes and dreams onto their children, so why not this variation of a godfather projecting something onto their godson? It makes sense.

Even if you don't interpret it this way, I do think it is a very valid interpretation of the text that's there. With that in mind, I feel like this part of movie script is reasonable. It portrays the same underlying dynamics between Sirius and Harry, just in a slightly adapted way.

Parents often can't even get the names of their own children straight (calling a child by a different name before immediately correcting themselves), so it's quite natural for Sirius to mix up the names of two people who are very closely associated in his mind. Heck, I could realistically see Sirius mixing up the names in the heat of battle even if he *didn't* have an unhealthy obsession with reliving the past, though obviously such an accident wouldn't make it into a screenplay.
