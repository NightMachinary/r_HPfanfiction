Absolutely agree with you that Sirius missed James and much of his affection towards Harry stemmed from his love for his friend, and was a projection of those feelings. I'd maybe even buy the argument that for Sirius it wasn't about protecting Harry so much as it was about not wanting to let James down again. Where it fails for me is that the movies don't really develop this idea before his death, so that one line then needs to shoehorn in all these complicated emotions---and it's too literal and too blunt to do it well. In the end, it comes across as though he's just plain mixed them up. That would be the sort of oops/slip moment you describe for any other character, but for the one you're already suspecting has gone a bit mental after his ordeal. So, it just comes across as Sirius having lost touch with reality---and it's the final thing he says to Harry.

But I also have issues with just about everything the movies do so there's that too...
