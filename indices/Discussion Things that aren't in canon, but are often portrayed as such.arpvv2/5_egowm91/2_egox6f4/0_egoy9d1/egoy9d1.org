I do think that part of Sirius's character (thinking of Harry like James, being reckless, living vicariously through the Trio) was present in the books, but it's certainly flanderized in fanon to the point of ridiculousness (The "Prongslet" moniker... honestly). In the books, it was less a core part of his personality, and more a result of being cooped up in Grimmauld Place, after a year of being on the run and over a decade in Azkaban.
