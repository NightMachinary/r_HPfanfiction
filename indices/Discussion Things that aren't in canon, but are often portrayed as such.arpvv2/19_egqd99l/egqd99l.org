Remus and his werewolf tendencies. It's so widespread that I want to scream whenever I see him getting violent, agressive, or unable to control his sexual desires before the full moon. I never understood what people found so exciting about it. So men apparently have to be violent after all. I don't see why his condition has to have such an effect on him. Also, it's not a canon fact or anything, but in nearly every fic I've read, Tonks is portrayed as sex-positive. I'm not saying it's bad thing, it's just that she seems unable to control her desires and her being sex-positive is shown to be such an important part of her character. Even people who seem to love her don't focus much on her other traits. And instead of making me admire her, they make me wonder if she is really an adult and not a teenager. And it's sort of sad when this becomes a prominent part of her character, when things like being friendly or kind are far more admirable.
