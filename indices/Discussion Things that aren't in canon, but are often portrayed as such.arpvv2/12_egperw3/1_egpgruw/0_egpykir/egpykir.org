I think the American books are basically the same as the British just with long words like Philosopher taken out and a weird mention of Dean being black at the sorting.

We are probably more sarcastic than Americans. You tend to think of sarcasm as being rude whereas when I was 10 my English teacher taught us about sarcasm being 'the backbone of humour' (or something like that).
