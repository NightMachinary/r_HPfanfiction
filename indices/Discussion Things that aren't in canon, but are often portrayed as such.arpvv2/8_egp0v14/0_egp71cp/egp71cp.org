Fanon's "Notice Me Not" charm isn't the Disillusionment charm, though. The Disillusionment charm makes the target sort of invisible, while a Notice Me Not is usually portrayed as more of an SEP field charm. That is, it's a mental thing of making other ignore someone that they see rather than a physical thing of making people unable to actually see them.
