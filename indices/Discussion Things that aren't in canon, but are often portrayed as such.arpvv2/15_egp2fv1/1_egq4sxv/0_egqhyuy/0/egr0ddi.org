I wouldn't call it a war between two teams. What I would call it was a campaign of relentless four-on-one bullying that included sexual assault and attempted murder. (relentless bullying, by the way, is JKR's own description of how the Maurauders treated Snape at school)

And Lily is not the arbiter of all that is Good and Right in the world - after all, she did marry someone who 'earnestly' threatened to hex (ie. Attack) her if she didn't stop trying to interfere as he was assaulting her friend. She did also take James' side against Snape after the werewolf incident. Admittedly, she didn't have all the facts, but a true friend would have made an attempt to find out the facts, rather than assume that their 'best friend' (her words) is lying and taking the side of an 'arrogant toerag' (her words again) over him. Lily might have been a nice person, but she certainly wasn't perfect.

As for what Sirius and Remus have to say - I mean, I guess you can believe it? I mean it's not like Sirius had a vested interest in getting Harry on his side and maybe had the thought that admitting to Harry that he and his friends attacked another student and he, Sirius, personally set up an attempt to murder said student using another student (his friend!) as the murder weapon. Obviously Harry would be just fine with that, right? And it's not like Remus is shown throughout the series to withhold information or outright lie when it makes his life easier (as a totally random example, what exactly is his excuse for not bringing Sirius' animagus form to Dumbledore's attention? I mean, for most of the book he thought Sirius was evil and wanted Harry dead, and he didn't think it was a good idea to at some point during the year go 'um, Albus? Did you know Sirius can turn into a dog?'). I mean, those are totally trustworthy sources with no motive whatsoever to lie, right?)

If the one incident that we are shown in Snape's Worst Memory is indicative of how the Maurauders usually treated Snape, then yes, it was exactly as bad as fandom makes it out to be. SWM is one of the most disgusting portrayals of bullying I have ever read. At least the people who bullied me never graduated to sexual assault.
