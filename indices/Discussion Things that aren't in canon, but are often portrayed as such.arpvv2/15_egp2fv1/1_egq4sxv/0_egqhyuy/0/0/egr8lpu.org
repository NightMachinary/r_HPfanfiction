I personally wouldn't call it that but that's just my opinion. I don't think lily is a symbol of purity or anything she can obviously make bad decisions but I also think the fandom victimize Snape way too much. Just because you got bullied at school doesn't mean you can turn around and bully kids. He joined the death eaters and showed absolutely no signs of remorse. The only reason he stopped being a death eater was because the woman he had an obsession with was killed by them. He never acknowledges that voldemort was a pure blood elitist who wanted to kill muggleborns. We know that Dumbledore, and the rest of the order and wizardjng world have tremendous respect for James and Lily. The series is told from third person and even at that the only persons head we get remotely close to being in is Harry's so it's hard to tell who's telling the truth and who's not. Personally I prefer to believe the characters who are known as being reliable and have Harry's best interests at heart than the characters who actively make his life hell for no reason. We know from Slughorns memories that memories can be manipulated, I'm not saying that Snape wasn't bullied and that it didn't like affect his character massively but I just find the fics where Snape is like this poor little misunderstood victim is sooo out of character. The thing Neville is most scared of is Snape for god sake, how could you make your students so scared of you you're their boggart!? I just feel like some writers like to hype up the victim thing a bit much and forget that Snape is morally grey and has done some awful things, and the marauders are also grey, they've done awful things to Snape but literally gave their lives to fight for the light
