In most fics I read Ginny's character does nothing other than be used as a love interest. I know she is Harry's love interest but in the books she does other things too. It's like her soul purpose in fan fiction is so the author can write in some sexual scenes. There's always long descriptions of exactly what she's wearing “tight jeans, short skirts/shorts, tank tops etc” which she never had in the books and none of the other female characters get described this way. She's either only used for sex or sexual descriptions in canon or in other fics to break up with Harry so that Harry can get with a girl who's less “slutty” like hermione or Luna.
