The magical core thing is really annoying and just makes no sense in the contexts of the books. also Harry having random burst of magic when he's angry (not like aunt marge stuff, more angst filled explosions)

Sirius being a womanizer for sure (he literally just had a couple of posters on his wall to piss off his mother)

“The noble and most ancient house of potter” stuff

When people just assume Harry's name is actually Henry/Harold etc

Making the Snape vs James thing into a bigger deal than it was

Tonks being able to change into literally anything at will (she can change her appearance) she's not a human version of polyjuice potion or an animagus

When people hype up the relationships between the pureblood families Sirius and tonks weren't close and they weren't close with Draco either.

How the room of requirement works

Every character who's not in hog warts is supposedly in the order

Also on a personal note- I don't remember Ginny as being a total nympho maniac
