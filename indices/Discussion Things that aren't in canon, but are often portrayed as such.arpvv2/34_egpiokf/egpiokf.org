I believe, as far as this is correct in pointing out how uncanon all of this is, fanfiction in entitled of changing things to create different concepts. If not, it would just repeat canon, and no one would pay attention to it. Yes, fanfiction devices are not supposed to be canon and some stuff (Ron's character, lily/Ginny similarities) are weird but in some occasions people might have a different point of view or try to invent which is totally okay, it's their story. For example for me there's nothing wrong with fanfiction creating names for Hermione's parents, changing secondary characters plots and other stuff. Like putting a half-blood slytherin as one of harry students we've met; they're only named and it brings something new to the story.
