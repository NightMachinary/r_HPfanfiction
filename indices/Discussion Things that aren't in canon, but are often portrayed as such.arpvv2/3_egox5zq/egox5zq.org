- lily was never stated to be a prefect (i think this one is interesting, because i kind of think jkr either forgot about or soft-retconned that lily and james were head boy and head girl, because it isn't mentioned by any official source, as far as i know, *anywhere*, in or out of canon, apart from hagrid's lone statement in PS. no mention of lily being prefects with lupin when it was revealed he was one in 5th year, no mention of james being head boy either, only that sirius and james would have never made prefect. no mention by slug. no mention when harry was looking up old prefect and head records in CoS)

- remus was never described with facial scars

- lucius isn't described with a cane or long hair (if we're going by draco in the epilogue, he's more likely to have /less/ hair than usual. also- several pureblood men are described as bald or balding. i don't think this is a minor point either, really. conservative and traditional wizard grooming still has men with short hair, which is why molly pesters bill to cut his. a lot of the men described with long hair are 'rebels' or eccentrics in some way e.g. bill, sirius, the dumbledores, severus, xeno. lucius and draco are described with slicked back hair and that's how he portrays himself- as a clean-cut, conservative rich guy)

- sirius doesn't know DEs have the dark mark on their forearms in GoF. whether or not fudge knew, or if it was widely known, is unknown
