I find it HIGHLY unlikely that both the Head Boy and Head Girl during Lily and James' years were both not Prefects. There's just about no chance of that happening, IMO. I get that we're talking about things that aren't listed in the books, but I feel like that's something that is just more logic than anything else.

I'm writing a fic during GoF timeline right now that makes a big deal out of the fact that Remus and Sirius don't know about the Dark Marks. :) I feel like that's something that too many people just assume is a thing, that everyone knew about, I mean.
