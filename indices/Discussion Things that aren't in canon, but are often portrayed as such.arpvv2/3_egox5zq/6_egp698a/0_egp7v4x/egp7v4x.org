but there isn't, lol. if a head boy can be so without being a prefect, so can a head girl. something being unlikely doesn't mean it's impossible

you can easily come up with headcanons for why she wasn't made prefect. here's two:

some people mistrust her because she's best friends with and defends a literal dark wizard. no such complaints after she and severus stop being friends

mary mcdonald was the prefect. she caught mulciber fucking around, tried to reprimand him, he did something to her, then he got in trouble. he kept on hounding her, her grades slipped/her behaviour changed, lily was then made head girl in 7th year
