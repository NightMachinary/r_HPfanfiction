Right, but the stuff you made up isn't, either. You're conflating ‘this probably almost never happens' with ‘this is impossible.'

I understand what you are saying about it not being canon. I'm saying look at logic, you are saying ‘look how much I can make up to explain away her not being a Prefect.'

It's ridiculous to think a school with an established student hierarchy would ignore it to that extent. TWO non-Prefect students from the SAME HOUSE get Head Boy and Head Girl?! Edit2: it was unusual enough for James, is my point. Also people are gonna write her as a prefect and it's not tantrum level ridiculous to do that.

Edit: it's also clear no minds will be changed here. Read me on this: yes it's not canon. I don't give a shit about your arguments against it entirely and you don't give a shit about my arguments for. So it's not worth any more time, IMO
