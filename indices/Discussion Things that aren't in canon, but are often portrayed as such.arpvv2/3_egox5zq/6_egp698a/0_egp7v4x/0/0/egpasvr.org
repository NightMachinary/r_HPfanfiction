her being a prefect /isn't/ in the actual books.

you said that there was just about no chance of that happening, which isn't true, which is my point. something being unlikely isn't the same as it being impossible. since the books don't state that she was a prefect, her being a prefect isn't canon. which, like you said, is the topic: things that aren't in canon
