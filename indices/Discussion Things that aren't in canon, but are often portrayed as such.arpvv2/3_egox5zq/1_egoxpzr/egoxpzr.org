I had always thought that Lily had been a prefect... Or at least Head Girl at one point and time, huh. (Probably from reading one too many fanfictions).

And yeah; I never really understood why Remus has facial scars is seen in stories so much, explaining them away would be rather difficult. He might have had other scars like on his back or stomach or whatever, but in places that would be easier to hide.

I'll admit that I'm guilty at liking the idea of Lucius having a cane, even though that was movie only; from my memory.
