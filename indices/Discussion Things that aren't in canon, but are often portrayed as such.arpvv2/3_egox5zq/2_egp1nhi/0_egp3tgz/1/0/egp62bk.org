  there is a considerable scaling difference between the tattoo and the Mark - the latter is huge and can be seen from a considerable distance, while the latter fits on an arm.

that's true, but i don't think that's enough to say he won't recognise the mark at different scales.

also, the mark being cast as a large projection in the sky doesn't mean that that's the only way fudge has seen it. people could have taken pictures or transcribed the image due its infamous association with the DEs, so fudge could have become acquainted with a miniaturised version of it through other means
