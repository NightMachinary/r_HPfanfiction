Well the SS -did- all have bloodgroup tattoos on the inside of their left arms, and it was considered good evidence of membership in the SS postwar, for judicial reprisal, with some having gotten away due to missing marks. And there was literature distributed in the military on how to identify vandalized marks on those who tried to remove their Blutgruppent√§towierung. I imagine Rowling took the idea from the Nazis to apply to the DEs, with less practicality and more transparent symbology.

This wasn't perhaps very common knowledge among the general public though, especially not until after the war when people with the knowledge had time to spread it into public knowledge. Sirius, having gone to jail before many of the DE trials, might not have been aware of the immediate implication.
