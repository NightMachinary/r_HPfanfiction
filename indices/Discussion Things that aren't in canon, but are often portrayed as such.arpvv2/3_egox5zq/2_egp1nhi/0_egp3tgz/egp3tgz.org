this actually /is/ a discussion we've had before. my answer is the same: of course he knows the /symbol/. sirius likely also knew the symbol. DEs cast it when they kill. fudge can have an instinctive response to the mark, without knowing that it was branded onto the DEs with its own specific functions. 'the dark mark' refers both to the brand and the symbol cast in the sky by 'Morsmordre'

this isn't like people not knowing what a swastika is. this is like if hitler ordered all nazis to tattoo the swastika onto their left calves and /that/ was a secret. you'd have a response to symbol anyway
