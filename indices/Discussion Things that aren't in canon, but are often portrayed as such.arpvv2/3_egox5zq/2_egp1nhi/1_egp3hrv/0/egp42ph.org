True, but there is a considerable scaling difference between the tattoo and the Mark - the latter is huge and can be seen from a considerable distance, while the latter fits on an arm.

Since the thing has a relatively complex shape and design (nothing like a swastika, for instance), a person who is unaware of the idea of such a brand - a brand that is supposed to denote membership of such an organisation - would not recoil immediately upon noticing a tattoo.
