Regarding point 2 - iirc that wasn't stated in canon, but Tom Felton apparently told fans that JKR told him that Snape was Draco's godfather. So like, it's not canon, but it's not NOT canon, see what I mean?

And the bit about Sirius - I believe that came from Hermione's concerns in OotP that Sirius was treating Harry as though Harry were James.
