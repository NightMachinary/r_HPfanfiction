Yeah, as a Ron girl it can get really annoying. I'm a multishipper(Harry Potter is the fandom that introduced me to fanfiction, fandom, and multishipping, and shipping). There are a lot of fics for certain ships I have to avoid(whether the ship be Drarry, Dramione, or Harmony) so I don't stumble upon that. I always wonder what books they're reading or movies these writers are seeing when they make the Weasleys gold diggers and Ginny and Ron rapists(using the love potion).
