Sometimes fics and fandom act as if Ron is an idiot. He isn't, though. He just has a different type of intelligence than Hermione. Where Hermione can sometimes be too logical or book smart, Ron can really think on his feet while Hermione and Harry are freaking out. See the Devil's Snare scene in the first book.
