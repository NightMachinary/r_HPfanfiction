Yeah, unfortunately, the movies kind of erased some of his best scenes(like him explaining to Hermione what "mudblood" meant and why he, Fred, George, and the quidditch team reacted the way when Draco said it. Or when he told Hermione that she was a witch when she was freaking out about the devil's snare. Or when he told Sirius he'd have to go through he and Hermione if he wanted Harry. Or when he defended Hermione when Snape called her a know it all).
