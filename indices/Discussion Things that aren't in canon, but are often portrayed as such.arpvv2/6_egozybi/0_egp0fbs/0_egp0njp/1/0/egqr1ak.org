Yes! Exactly. I love Hermione, but it was Ron who wasn't panicking. It was Ron who got her to stop panicking enough to do the spell. I also think there's a bit of an issue with the second movie not allowing Ron to explain to Hermione and Harry who both grew up in muggle households and most certainly wouldn't know what a "mudblood" was what the word meant. Hermione read a lot but I doubt that term was in Hogwarts a History. And of course, them not having Ron defend her against Snape for answering a question really bothered me.
