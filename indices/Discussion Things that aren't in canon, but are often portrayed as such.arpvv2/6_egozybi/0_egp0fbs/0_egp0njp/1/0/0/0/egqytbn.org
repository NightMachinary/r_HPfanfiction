Yeah. She'd never interacted with other witches or wizards(as far as she knew) until she got her letter/she was told she was a witch. And like I said, the books Hermione read weren't likely to talk about that word. It's enough that she knows it's rude, even if she doesn't know what it means. And how very against the word the Gryffindor quidditch team are.

Yeah. I feel like that probably didn't help people's opinions of Ron if they just watched the films.

It's like the movies ignoring the reason Hermione kissed Ron in the first place. Sure, she had romantic feelings for him. But it was his worrying about the house elves that made her do so.
