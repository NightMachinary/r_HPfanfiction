  there's a bit of an issue with the second movie not allowing Ron to explain to Hermione and Harry who both grew up in muggle households and most certainly wouldn't know what a "mudblood" was what the word meant.

Yup. That's even a point in the book in that Hermione comments that she has no idea what the word means, though she can tell it's something very rude - and Ron chimes in with the explanation. Instead, the movies let Know-it-all Granger(who would've had no way of knowing what the word means) show off again.

  having Ron defend her against Snape for answering a question really bothered me.

"He's got a point, y'know." (Movie-Ron on Snape calling Hermione an insufferable know-it-all). That bothers me too.
