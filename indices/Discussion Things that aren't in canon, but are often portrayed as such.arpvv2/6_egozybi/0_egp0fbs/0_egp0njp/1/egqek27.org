The most egregious example of the movies screwing over Ron that way IMO came in the first one, during the Devil's Snare scene.

*"HAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?!"* (Book-Ron, when Hermione panics while they're caught in the plant)

Instead of course, we get Movie-Ron panicking like a moron while Know-it-all Granger saves the day. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like Hermione. But the movies went way too far IMO in glorifying her intelligence at the expense of the other two, and especially Ron.
