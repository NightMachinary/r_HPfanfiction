I think that is more of an inconsistency/Rowling forgetting her own system rather than anything else.

Harry and Hermione practice the Summoning charm for 6-9 hours straight after lunch the day before the First Task. They only stop when its getting late.

In Book 5, he's casting spells throughout the fight, all the while running and dodging, but doesn't really feel any exhaustion that's limiting his spells. Same with Book 6, he fights in the cave, then fights at Hogwarts and doesn't really feel tired from the spell casting.
