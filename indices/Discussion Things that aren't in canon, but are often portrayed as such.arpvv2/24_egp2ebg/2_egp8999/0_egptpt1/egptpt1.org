It's the Dementor draining him, not the spell. Lupin gives him chocolate afterwards to rid him of the feeling, the same effect is described in other encounters with Dementors, the same feeling is never described when Harry casts the Patronus successfully, and when Harry casts the Patronus against Malfoy pretending to be a Dementor, he specifically tells Lupin that the Patronus must have worked well because he felt nothing.
