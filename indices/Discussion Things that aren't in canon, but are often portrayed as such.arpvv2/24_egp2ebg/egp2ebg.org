When they break into Gringotts, Hermione manages to disguise Ron with some spell/combination of spells, like so:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of Ron's appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility Cloak.

  "There," said Hermione, "how does he look, Harry?"

  It was just not possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought because he knew him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.

Also, spells can be invented. Just because you do not see a spell in canon does not mean that you shouldn't use it in your story - you'd be greatly limiting yourself if you do.

  Magical Cores aren't a thing
#+end_quote

They're not, but the way the system works in canon is that a wizard theoretically has an infinite mana pool - if he wants to, he can keep casting spells all he wants and never get tired/want to take a break, ever.

Something to limit that isn't a bad idea, which is where the magical cores and magical exhaustion thing came from. But obviously, they are done in absolutely shitty ways in too many fanfictions.

  the only Purebloods who call themselves ancient house of... is the Black family
#+end_quote

Technically true, but the narrator is usually narrating things from Harry's POV, and he doesn't generally hang around other purebloods. As for the Black family making them up part, that could be Sirius' attitude towards his own family that makes him say that.
