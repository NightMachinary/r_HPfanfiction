I've always thought of a spell as comparable to playing or singing a piece of music. To get the best results you have to play it exceptionally well, and to fail at casting a spell you make a mistake in the performance. More powerful spells are like more complex pieces, and mistakes are more likely unless you are exceptionally skilled and/or are exceptionally practised at that particular piece.

Just like everyone has different singing voices of various levels of power and range and different singing voices are good at different songs/styles, so it is with magic. Theoretical understanding and practice can help, but only so much. It is canon that many adult wizards and witches can't cast the protego charm, which is an OWL level spell.
