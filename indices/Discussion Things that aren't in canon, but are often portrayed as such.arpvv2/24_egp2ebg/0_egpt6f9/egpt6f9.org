But you don't need some sort of artificial "mana limit" on the characters to make things interesting- instead of using innate traits like "magical strength" that characters are born with, duels are decided via skill alone.

Duels don't end when the duelists are /magically/ exhausted, they end when one person is /mentally/ exhausted and drops their guard or lets themselves get distracted. This lends a whole new dimension to dueling- smoke, harmless flashbang spells, and casting rate can all be used to mentally trip up an opponent and create an opening.

That's what made Beatrix so dangerous- not her raw power, but the brutality of her spell repitoir and her ability to use her taunts to break the focus of her enemies at crucial moments- which is exactly what she did to Sirius.
