Which is fine. Because physical exhertion takes the toll. Spells in Harry Potter involve hand motions and speaking, though not always, both of which naturally have their limits.

Harry himself certainly couldn't keep it up for too long as he does not silent cast (and that itself requires skill, one can easily lose concentration when exhausted). It simply doesn't need a magical core solution, the limits are there in canon and it only takes good writing to implement it.
