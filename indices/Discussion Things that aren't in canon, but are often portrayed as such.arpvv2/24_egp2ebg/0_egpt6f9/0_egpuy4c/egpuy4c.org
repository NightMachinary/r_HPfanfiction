Don't think of dueling being the only application of magic.

Take the cave for instance - suppose Harry is in the cave with no way out. He can stand there, cast incendio and other fire spells all day and not break a sweat, at all. If none of the inferi catch him by surprise (say his back is to the wall), he can maintain this as long as it needs be.

That's a sign of a broken system IMO.

But since you did use fighting, canon duels don't last that long for the mental aspect to come into play - even Albus' duel in the Ministry does not take more than a few minutes. Sure, you could make them that long, but...I don't know, that would feel more artificial than having a mana pool IMO, especially if one duelist is good enough to take a hit to win the duel.
