  That is my problem - that Rowling's system has made all magic equal in terms of the load on the caster. In her system, magic has no cost. None at all.

But this is not a problem? The cost of magic lies not in a singular execution of it but in acquiring the ability to cast it proficiently and reliably. This is not an RPG where you have to balance various classes. Werewolves aren't some mobs to exp upon, and they aren't actual enemies from the narrative perspective, transformed werewolves are just bigger wolves after all.

No, the main potential enemies for wizards in Potterverse are other wizards. And there is no problem here - "the other side has magic too", they are subject to the same rules.
