  Using that one wand-lighting charm will have the same effect on me as using Fiendfyre to kill a hundred werewolves and vampires. As long as I have the cursed fire under control, there is no drain on me from using it at all. It takes the same effort as casting a lumos charm.

Look at it this way: Casting lumos is like doing basic arithmetic. But controlling fiendfyre (which is not as easy as you're making it out to be) is like doing advanced algebraic geometry.

You don't have a "maths core" any more than you have a "magic core", but you're still going to spend much more effort on the later than the former.
