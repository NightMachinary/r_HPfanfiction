I disagree. Rowling gave no evidence of magic costing mana/energy, etc except for a comment by Moody that the Killing Curse takes "a fair bit of magic behind it." What exactly he meant was left ambiguous, probably intentionally.

The fact that magic doesn't seem to cost mana or energy is prevented from being overpowered by what I was getting at: focus. Focus is hard to maintain, especially under stress.
