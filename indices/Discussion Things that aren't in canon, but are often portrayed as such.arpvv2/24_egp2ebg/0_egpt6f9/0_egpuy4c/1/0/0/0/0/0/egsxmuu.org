Ugh...I cannot believe I have to keep repeating myself.

Suppose I use the wand-lighting charm, Lumos.

Then suppose I decide I value my life a lot less and go hunting for dementors, werewolves, vampires and other creatures and proceed to fight them all using magic.

Using that one wand-lighting charm will have the same effect on me as using Fiendfyre to kill a hundred werewolves and vampires. As long as I have the cursed fire under control, there is no drain on me from using it at all. It takes the same effort as casting a lumos charm.

Ergo, I will not be drained at all. The only effect it will have on me is the very situation I'd find myself in, of fighting for my life - which has nothing to do with the magic I use, but rather the scenario I find myself in.

The need for food or water and mental stress - all of that is secondary. Assuming I'm a superb occlumens (so that those potential issues are nullified), my magic is unimpeded.

Or I can develop one spell that will turn the earth into planetary dust, and fire it from outer space - and it would not cost me any more than using a Lumos charm.

/That/ is my problem - that Rowling's system has made all magic equal in terms of the load on the caster. In her system, magic has no cost. None at all.
