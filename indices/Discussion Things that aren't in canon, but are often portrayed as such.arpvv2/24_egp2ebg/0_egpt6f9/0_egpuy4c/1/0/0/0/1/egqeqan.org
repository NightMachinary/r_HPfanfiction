I do understand but I'm just pointing out that it's not necessarily overpowered. I see your issue with Rowling's system, and I acknowledge that very little about how magic works is explicitly stated (likely a good decision by Rowling tbh), but I think we can draw conclusions from the books that the magic system is not /necessarily/ overpowered, even though you could argue that it /could/ be. We just don't have enough evidence to have an indisputable answer.
