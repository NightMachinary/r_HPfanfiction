Looks like you lost the initial point of my comment.

  Rowling gave no evidence of magic costing mana/energy

I know, and that is my main gripe about the magic system, and why I think that magical cores/mana pools isn't inherently a bad idea, if they're done right.

As for focus, magic involved in menial tasks does not require focus. Take cleaning for example - it is something that requires next to no focus. With the current magic system in place, you clean and clean for hours on end and feel just as fresh as you've woken up after a nap.

I hope you understand the point I'm trying to make here.
