This is a non-argument. We're talking about the use of magic costing you energy/mana/whatever - mental stress is not a part of that.

Sure, your pronunciation might suffer after a while, but that only affects your verbal casting. Silent casting is not affected. I know that the trio are absolute imbeciles regarding this - yelling out every spell doesn't make that spell any more potent than normal.

And wand movements started losing importance and priority back in Book 3.
