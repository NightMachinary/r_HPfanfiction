You have to take into account how much precision is required in magic. Sure, an Expelliarmus or a Lumos may not take a lot of precision in your wand movements, but what about pronunciation? We heard from Flitwick that pronunciation is important, and also from Charms that wand movements are equally so.

If you've been casting a hundred Incendios, I am pretty sure your pronunciation starts to suffer. Your wand movements get sloppy. And soon, if we take Baruffio's example, you could end up on the floor with a buffalo on your chest!
