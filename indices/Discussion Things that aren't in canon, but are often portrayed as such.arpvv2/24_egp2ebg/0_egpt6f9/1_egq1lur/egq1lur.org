It makes sense for magic to be exhausting on its own. Maybe it is the same as mental exhaustion, maybe it's something slightly different. Maybe you can be either magically exhausted (due to the sheer power and/or duration of spells) /or/ mentally exhausted (due to the complexity of, say, an elaborate transfiguration), or both. That would be even more interesting.

The real problems I see with most appearances of "magical cores" are that:

1. They're often handled in a way that feels like importing an RPG magic system into a piece of literature, and that just doesn't mesh well.

2. They are a divergence from canon that basically never adds to the story and is therefore entirely unnecessary. If you need to limit what your characters can do, just say that they were exhausted! Magical cores are basically technobabble, and a form of technobabble that just doesn't exist in canon. That's what makes them so grating.

The best use magical cores I've read is in the linkffn(Princess of the Blacks) series, where the protagonist has a unique difference to how her magical core works, which leads to a risk of her secret being detected. And even there, I felt like there should have been a better way to tell the story, without the technobabble.
