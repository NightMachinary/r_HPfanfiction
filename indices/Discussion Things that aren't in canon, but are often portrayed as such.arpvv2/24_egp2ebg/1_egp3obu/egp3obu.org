I don't think that was what fan fics think of as glamours, where it's like some mental illusion, I think that was just plain old human transfiguration, like in book 6 where they change each other's eyebrow colors and stuff. Transfiguration can change body features. :) Human transfiguration like that is like sculpting with a scalpel, and then Polyjuice is a complete uniform body makeover to copy someone else down to the smallest identical bit. :)
