No, it's transfiguration actually. I was surprised too, but it is. I will quote the line.

  They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration; working in front of mirrors , they were suposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Profe s sor McGonagall asked a question

And I think it kind of makes sense that ANY aspect of physical change can be affected by transfiguration, even color, because isn't color decided by like physical things called pigments or something? So if you changed how those were arranged you could change what color it came out as. :) It's not like paint, it's decided by the physical insides of it.
