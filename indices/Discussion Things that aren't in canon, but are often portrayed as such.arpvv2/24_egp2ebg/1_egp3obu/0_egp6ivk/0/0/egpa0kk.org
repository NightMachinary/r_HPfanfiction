As for colours, well, colours are perceived by the human eye due to light, not because of their pigmentation. We see colours because of scattered and reflected light off objects. If you change the colour of the light rays that enter the cornea, you would change the colour of the object as it is perceived - this is what happens when you wear sunglasses.
