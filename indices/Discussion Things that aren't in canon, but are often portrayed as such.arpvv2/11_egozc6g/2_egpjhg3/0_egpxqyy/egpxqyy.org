Well it's implied because there's no Weasley/Black/Malfoy etc. seat or anything of that sort. In fanfiction people potray it similar to the House of Lords, with each member of the Wizengamot being a pureblood family member. In actual fact neither Dumbledore nor Umbridge, both members of the Wizengamot, are purebloods. Lucius Malfoy in particular not being a member of the Wizengamot means it's unlikely to be hereditary.
