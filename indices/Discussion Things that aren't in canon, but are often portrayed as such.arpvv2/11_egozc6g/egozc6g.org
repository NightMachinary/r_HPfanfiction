1) The purposes of Ancient Runes and Arithmancy are never specified in canon, but I like the fanon interpretations of Arithmancy being used for spellcrafting and Ancient Runes for enchantments and wards.

The only issue I have with those interpretations is that they give these subjects an importance that should make them core classes at Hogwarts rather than electives, at least in the case of runes.

2) The seats on the wizengamot are never shown to be hereditary, in fact canon implies that they aren't.
