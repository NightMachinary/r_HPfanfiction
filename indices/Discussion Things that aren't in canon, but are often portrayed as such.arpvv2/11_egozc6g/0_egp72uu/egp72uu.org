  The only issue I have with those interpretations is that they give these subjects an importance that should make them core classes at Hogwarts rather than electives, at least in the case of runes.

I don't know. Spellcrafting and wards are rather niche activities so the average wizard might not be interested in them. Enchanting is not, but we know the Twins know how to enchant objects while Harry never learned that particular skill, so enchanting being either extracurricular or optative subjects fits canon.
