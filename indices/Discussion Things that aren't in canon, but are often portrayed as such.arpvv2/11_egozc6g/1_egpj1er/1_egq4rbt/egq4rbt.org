I have a fanfiction where arithmancy can be used to compute the past. Like, if you enter the data of things that have happened, arithmancy can tell you what the outcomes would have been with different actions. Also what actually did happen from the results. Arithmancers in the US (in my fic) are often used as expert witnesses in trials, because arithmancy can determine every possible course of action that could lead to x result, with the likelihood of it actually happening . If that makes sense.

In my version its useful for potions and spellcrafting as well, since you can use it for theorycrafting - you can set up an equation that states that you added these ingredients, and arithmancy will be able to show you what the result would have been.
