1) I actually like fanfiction that goes out of its way to make Ancient Runes a language course and Arithmancy a method to predict the future in a way reliable enough to be scientific but that has so many requirements as to not matter much and so few requirements as to be teachable in a classroom, even giving numbers specific properties within Arithmancy. Perhaps the number 7 having magical properties was actually a misconception that Tom Riddle learned.

2) Canon also implies that people can be disappeared by the Minister of Magic on a whim, so a fanfiction with that premise in mind would be cool.
