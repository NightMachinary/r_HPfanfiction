Same. If the fic is good or the nickname makes sense(say, baby Teddy or Harry and Ginny's children calling Hermione Mione because they can't say her name yet). But...Mia? I don't even know how that became a nickname for her. It didn't come from her name. Her name has no "a" in it. Mione is actually a part of Hermione.
