Like I can even be okay with a nickname for Harry, but it has to be when Harry is rather young enough for it to be okay, not when he is like 13/14/15 years old and they come up with it.

I'm also not okay with nicknames like Prongslett and the like. That's too overdone, not original and just doesn't fit Harry. And drives home the Harry is just a James replica thing that fanfiction likes to do too much.
