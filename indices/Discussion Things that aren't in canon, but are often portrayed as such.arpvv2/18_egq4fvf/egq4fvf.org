An interesting one that I saw once in a Harry Potter quiz (and not one for people who are likely to deep dive in things like Pottermore, etc.). The question was: "What is James Potter's Patronus?" Their answer was "a Stag". However in canon James' patronus is never mentioned in the books, we don't even know if he ever even cast one. I think this goes for a lot of Patroni, most we never see in canon. Some Patroni are later confirmed via Pottermore to be a certain animal, so that's how we know it's a stag. But it's not actually in the books.

Another common one is the thought that Durmstrang is an all male school and Beauxbatons an all female school.
