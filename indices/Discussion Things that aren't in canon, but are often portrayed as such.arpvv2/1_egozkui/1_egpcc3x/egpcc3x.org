  first-year can't cast complex spells for the same reason they can't bench 300 lbs. But /everything in canon/ suggests that a first-year can't cast complex spells for the same reason they can't do multivariate calculus.

Why not both? My headcanon is magic need knowledge, intuition, experience, and internal growth to use it. First year can't cast complex spells because they don't have the knowledge and their body just isn't used to casting spells.

Personally, I don't have a problem with "magic is a muscle". My real problem is when Harry somehow has a very big magical core without doing anything. I mean, you're not born with big muscle nor you suddenly get a big muscle than anyone else after a specific incident; unless you're Steve Roger ofc.
