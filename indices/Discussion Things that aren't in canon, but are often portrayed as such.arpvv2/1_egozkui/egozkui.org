Magical cores are a big sticking point of mine, to the point where it's almost /more/ excusable to use them as a cheap AU way to power up Harry, than to stick them in an otherwise-reasonable setting where they don't belong. Because it's so clearly a misreading of the kind of magic system Rowling was trying to build.

The metaphor I like to use is: "magical cores" suggests that a first-year can't cast complex spells for the same reason they can't bench 300 lbs. But /everything in canon/ suggests that a first-year can't cast complex spells for the same reason they can't do multivariate calculus. They don't have the /knowledge/ required to understand what's involved. This just seems so clear in canon that it's frustrating when an otherwise perfectly good fic goes the "mana bar" or "magic is a muscle" approach.
