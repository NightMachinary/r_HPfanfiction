  Harry was not physically abused or starved by Vernon and Petunia.

Actually he was, just not to the point that fanon likes to do.

He was forced to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs, when they at least had one extra bedroom to use.

He was forced to cook, and do other chores while Dudley wasn't. Petunia threw a frying pot at his head; at least once, Vernon talked about stamping out his magic, or trying to; which sort of implies that he had at least hit him at least once before. Later on bars were on his window, his door was locked, and a cat flap was installed.

He was often forced in his cupboard or the second bedroom they had been forced to give him, with no food. He also was given less food then the Dursley's.
