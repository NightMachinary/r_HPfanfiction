I wouldn't put it past Vernon to try and punish Harry through a slap or two when he had been younger. Though he likely stopped, in fear of his house being watched or the like.

He at least had been forced to go to his cupboard with no food more than once as well. Likely not as often as fanon likes to portray, but occasionally.
