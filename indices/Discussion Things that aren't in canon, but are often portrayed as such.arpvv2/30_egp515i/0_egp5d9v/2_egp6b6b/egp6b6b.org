Agreed.

But we can all agree that Harry in the books or movies was never whipped bloody, branded, had limbs broken and ignored, or any of the even more unpleasant things that many authors like to not only insinuate but outright depict in their stories.

Harry's natural book-personality was nowhere near what something like 70% of fanfic authors make him out to be.
