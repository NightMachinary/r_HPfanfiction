He was not starved and I am livid people think he was. If he was starved, people would notice. There is a difference between being underfed and being starved. He was given food regularly and the only time he was not given food was when he was clearly misbehaving and sent to bed without food. This is a common punishment and is done on television and in movies.

He was given chores, yes, but I do not truly believe they went from 9 am to 7 pm. Children like to exaggerate and I believe it was purely this. I can guarantee you that people would pick up on this instantly and child services would be called.

One time, I was asked to weed the garden for a few hours and the neighbours were peering over the fence and watching. In a neighbour like is what is described in Harry Potter, I cannot see this being the norm. No one would watch a ten-year-old boy slave at a garden from 9 am to 7 pm and not say anything.

We went from starved to given bread and cheese. Make up your damn minds.

Hand-me-down clothes are not a form of abuse. Ronald Weasley wore hand-me-downs.
