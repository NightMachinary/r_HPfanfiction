Wow, I didn't think such a ridiculous comment was possible.

This is a very strange argument - being unable to afford new clothes by virtue of poverty isn't the same as handing off the cast-offs of your overweight son's to your nephew.

The Dursleys have enough money to buy multiple presents for their son on his birthday, have a 4 bedroom house and a car, but they can't afford clothes for their nephew? Are you fucking serious?

  but I do not truly believe they went from 9 am to 7 pm

You're being ridiculous. I quoted verbatim from the book - you can't say it isn't the case and say that it's an exaggeration because *you don't think so*.

  We went from starved to given bread and cheese. Make up your damn minds
#+end_quote

2 slices of bread and a lump of cheese is starvation, especially when there is a whole spread out there that Harry cannot eat. I don't know how puerile you have to be say that giving one child a full meal while giving the other child a measly sandwich for dinner isn't selectively starving the other child.

  I can guarantee you that people would pick up on this instantly and child services would be called.

  No one would watch a ten-year-old boy slave at a garden from 9 am to 7 pm and not say anything.

These /are/ the same neighbors that thought Harry was a hooligan, even though there's little evidence to that. The same child services didn't pick up on one kid wearing new stuff tailored to fit, and the other kid wearing stuff several sizes larger even though they came from the same house, or that the second kid had no friends in school.

Read the damn passage.

  Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.

  While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn't have any friends at Hogwarts...

  Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now , he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.

  It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.

You can't go against the book and say shit like exaggerating children because *you believe so*. This is not a first person POV, it's third person. You can't argue against canon verbatim. Ridiculous.
