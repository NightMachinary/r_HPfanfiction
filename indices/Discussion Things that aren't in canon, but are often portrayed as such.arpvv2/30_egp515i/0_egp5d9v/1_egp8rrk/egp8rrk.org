He was starved as well

#+begin_quote
  Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.

No meals. Fun.

He was regularly given much smaller portions/helpings for meals. While the Dursleys ate full dinners, he had to make do with a couple of slices of bread and butter/cheese.

  As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.

The above scene happens in the morning, because it's clearly mentioned that Harry's eating toast for his meal.

  It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.

  "Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!"

  Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.

  "Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!" snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.

  Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. "Upstairs! Hurry!"

So, he works from 9 or 10 in the morning, to 7:30 at night. Without food. Lovely. (I can easily go days without food if I'm lazing about, but even I need sustenance when I'm working).

He was fed 3 bowls soup through the cat flap, half of which he used to give Hedwig, so that she wouldn't starve.
