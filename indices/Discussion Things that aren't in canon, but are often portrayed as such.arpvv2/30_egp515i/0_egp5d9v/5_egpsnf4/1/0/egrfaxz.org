Way to resort to abuse because you lack the wit to get your point across without downvoting or reverting into a child. I do not expect anything less from this subreddit and its awful and biased community.

Also, I cannot imagine being pathetic enough to be an apologist for characters that do not exist. My goal was to clear up some misconceptions and stop people from taking one-liners from the book and twisting it into a mockery of itself.

We go from being locked in his bedroom to being allowed out. We go from being starved to given bread and cheese. There is no indication in canon that Harry Potter was abused. He was neglected, yes, emotionally and mentally, but that is all. However, this generation is wack and if you sneeze near someone, they scream abuse. Why am I surprised people are misusing the words?

At the end of the day, if you desire to poke fun at child abuse, then be my guest. I guess we can put it into the â€˜troll' category for the internet, alongside autism, depression, and OCD.

If he was truly starved, he would not have shared his food. People would have noticed that he was starved. Baggy clothes or robes do not hide it like you think they would. He was average weight, a little on the short side, but not everyone is tall and we have no indication that James and Lily were tall people.

He was underfed and neglected, yes, I admit, but he was not abused.
