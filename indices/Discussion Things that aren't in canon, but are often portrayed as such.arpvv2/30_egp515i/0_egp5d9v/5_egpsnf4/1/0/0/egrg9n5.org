Your definition of abuse is much narrower than mine, and apparently most other people's on this sub. Or rather maybe it's just more specific? I can't imagine how a person could sincerely believe that a person calling another stupid constitutes abuse, but an adult locking a child in his bedroom for three days, only letting him out twice a day to use the bathroom and feeding him so little that he's in physical pain even after a meal, all of which Vernon and Petunia explicitly do in canon, doesn't.

My dad has a saying I like: if you walk out the door and someone calls you an asshole, they're the jerk. If everyone else has joined in by the end of the day, then it's probably you. I think enough people in this thread have objected to your comments, most of which seem boil down to "it's not abuse because I don't consider it to be abuse," for you to maybe take a step back and wonder if you might be in the wrong here.
