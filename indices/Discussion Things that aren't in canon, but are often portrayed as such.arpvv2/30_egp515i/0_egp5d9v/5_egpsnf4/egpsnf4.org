  He was forced to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs, when they at least had one extra bedroom to use.

Again, not exactly abuse. It is neglect and a serious strict on your ability to parent, but not abuse. He had a bed in there, some toys, and a blanket. There was not dried blood on the mattress or on the walls and there was a vent on the door that allowed fresh air into the little bedroom.

  He was forced to cook, and do other chores while Dudley wasn't.
#+end_quote

That is not abuse, either. Being forced to cook, while slightly unorthodox for a child, is a valuable life skill. Also, there is no evidence that he was cooking five-star courses or anything above eggs and bacon. At ten, cooking eggs and bacon /is/ reasonable.

  Vernon talked about stamping out his magic, or trying to; which sort of implies that he had at least hit him at least once before.

Making assumptions is the worst thing you can do. Saying something does not mean that the person do it. If Harry was described as limping with a broken arm and a black eye, I could believe it. It was most likely said in passing, much like some men say they will beat the gayness out of their sons. Half of them do not even attempt to and it is an idle threat. The book was set in the 1990s and the word was a lot less... snowflakey, I guess.

  Later on bars were on his window, his door was locked, and a cat flap was installed.
#+end_quote

Not abuse, not abuse, and not abuse. The cat flap was to give him food without interacting with him. Petty and, well, neglectful, but not abuse.

  He was often forced in his cupboard or the second bedroom they had been forced to give him, with no food. He also was given less food then the Dursley's.

Already addressed this.
