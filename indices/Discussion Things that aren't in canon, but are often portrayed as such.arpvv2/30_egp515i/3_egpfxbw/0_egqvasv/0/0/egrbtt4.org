I think everyone deserves to be given context. It's too easy to take one isolated event and go "this person is a total monster." People are more complex than that. Even though the Dursleys are among the worst-written characters in the series, I think it helps us as fans, AND as writers, to look at the contexts and maybe even try to see things from their point of view sometimes.

We don't have to agree with what they say and do, of course. We can and should admit that their actions were bad, and that there wasn't any excuse for treating a child the way they did. But that doesn't mean we have to let the knee-jerk "CHILD ABUSERS!" reaction blind us to what was ACTUALLY going on in the books, or stop us from considering them as characters.

At least that's what I think, anyway.
