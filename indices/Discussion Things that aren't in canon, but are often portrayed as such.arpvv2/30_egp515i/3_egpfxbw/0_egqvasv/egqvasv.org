The frying pan thing is often brought up, and I agree that Petunia took it too far... but I think people forget the context here. This is Harry's first summer back with the Dursleys after starting Hogwarts, and it's the only time in the series when:

1: Harry knows he is a wizard and can do magic, but 2: The Dursleys DON'T know that he isn't allowed to turn them into frogs or something, which means that 3: Harry has quite a bit of fun scaring Dudley by threatening to do magic.

Things are REALLY tense in the Dursley household during this time, with the Dursleys pretty much treating Harry like a time bomb ready to go off... and Harry, being twelve, is stupid enough, and frustrated enough, and thankful enough to have some form of power over them, that he begins threatening Dudley by pretending to cast a spell on him. And Dudley is the Dursley who has already BEEN magicked before, when Hagrid gave him a pig's tail; he FREAKS.

And THAT'S why Petunia swings at Harry with a frying pan... the only time she so much as lifts a hand to him. And keep in mind, she didn't go to pick up the frying pan to take a swing at him; she was already holding it in her hand because she was doing the dishes and likely just struck out in a moment's fit of rage with whatever she was holding at the time. Which happened to be the frying pan.

'Course, this is a pretty bad thing, and if child services saw this happening Petunia would be in a lot of trouble, but I don't think you can take that scene as evidence that Harry got regular betings. I think Vernon and Petunia were more likely to THREATEN to beat Harry than to actually DO it.
