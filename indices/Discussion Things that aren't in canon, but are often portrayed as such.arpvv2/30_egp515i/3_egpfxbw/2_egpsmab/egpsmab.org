I know more than one young child and pre-teen who has been hit with an object. My own mother was often hit with a wooden spoon. Heck, she even had an apple thrown at her face. A classmate was hit by a shovel from his father one time and missed three days of school. I remember being envious of that, to be honest.

The point is that one example of Petunia swinging a frying pan is not an excuse to notch it up to fifty and have it occur every day. Sometimes, and I mean this as best as I can, people forget they are holding something and go to swat someone. I hit my nephew in the back of the head with a TV remote because he was being mouthy and it was simply meant to be a light swat to the back of the head.

Also, so I do not have to repeat it, children often exaggerate what happens. Words of my own psychiatrist, who has been dealing with abused children for thirty years.

As for the cupboard, I slept under a chair for most of my own childhood. Really, it is neglect at most, not abuse.
