The way the scene is written on the first one to be fair, it seems obvious to me it was a whack that she expected him to duck. It's not acceptable, but she wasn't going to actually brain him

Also the cupboard itself is absolutetly fine (it's not /that/ small those sorts of cupboards, particularly for a small child). It's that they had a bedroom and still had him in the cupboard that's unacceptable and shows the Dursley's character. If they had no where else it wouldn't be such of a problem, most kids like having their own rooms after all.
