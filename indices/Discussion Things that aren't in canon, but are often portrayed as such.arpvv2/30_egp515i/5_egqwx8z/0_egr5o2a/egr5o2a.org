Eh, probably true, but the Dursleys aren't always logical. It took more time, effort, stinking up the house, and I wouldn't rule out money to dye Dudley's old clothes gray instead of buying Harry a Stonewall uniform. They sent a letter and 50p for Christmas rather than just ignoring him. There are times when the Dursleys absolutely went out of their way to make Harry miserable.
