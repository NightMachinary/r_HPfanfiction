Let's see. In no particular order:

1. Hermione's parents have no names in canon.
2. Lucius Malfoy is not on the Wizengamot.
3. The Wizengamot is elected, not hereditary.
4. Daphne and Astoria Greengrass were blood-purists just like all the other Slytherins.
5. Harry was not physically abused or starved by Vernon and Petunia.
6. He also wasn't punished for getting better marks from Dudley.
7. House elves don't need to be bound to survive.
8. It's not confirmed (and I think unlikely) that the Goblet of Fire would have killed Harry (or stripped him of his magic) if he didn't compete in the Tournament. No actual consequences were mentioned.
