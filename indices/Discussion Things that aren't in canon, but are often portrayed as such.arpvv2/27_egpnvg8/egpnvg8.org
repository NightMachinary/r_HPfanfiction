The big one that comes to mind is Daphne Greengrass being portrayed as 'Ice Queen' in fanfiction. I don't think I remember the character ever having a line of dialogue in the series but she's got this accepted backstory thanks to a fanfiction trope that somehow stuck. That said, I'm rather fond of the 'ice queen' model in a lot of stories so maybe I'm a hypocrite.
