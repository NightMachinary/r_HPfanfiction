I have one... it's not a huge thing, but it's a small thing that irks me a bit when people take it for granted that is in canon: Fred and George never actually call themselves "Gred and Forge."

George said it, ONCE, as a joke responding to Molly having put letters on their Christmas jumpers but not on Ron's. "You haven't got a letter on yours. I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid, we know our names are Gred and Forge."

It was ONE joke, a humorous commentary where he pretended to have forgotten his and Fred's names. It doesn't mean they were constantly going around calling each other "Gred" and "Forge." It doesn't really fit their characters to have done so, either... say what you will about the twins' sense of humour, but at least it was VERY rare for them to tell the same joke twice. They usually thought of new ones.
