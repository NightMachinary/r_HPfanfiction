The idea that Harry is a defence against the dark arts prodigy. And scores an O*** on his OWLs; the highest marks ever received by anyone in the history of forever.

In terms of magical prowess Harry never really shows much at all.

In the climax of the first two books he doesn't use any magic at all.

In book 3 he casts the patronus which is supposed to be very difficult but he's been practicing it for several months by that point. Also how often does anyone even try to teach it to teenagers. It might be easier than people realise but nobody ever bothers because it's not necessary to know.

In book 4 he is struggling in class with the summoning charm and he and Hermione have to spend hours practising it before the first task. This suggests that his magical ability is about on par with the rest of his age group.

He's a decent teacher, but he's not some defence genius. The only thing he really has over everyone else in the group is that he has some experience in real life or death situations due to his end of year adventures rather than just in the classroom like everyone else. And in those situations it was usually his good instincts and ability to improvise that saved him rather than magic.
