I have a two-syllable name which people consistently try and shorten into something outlandish. So I am personally offended on Hermione's behalf everyone time someone does it in a fanfic. The only exceptions are when it's a small child (because that is pretty realistic) or when Ron says it in a rush like 'mione. Having it as a full fledged nickname just feels wrong.
