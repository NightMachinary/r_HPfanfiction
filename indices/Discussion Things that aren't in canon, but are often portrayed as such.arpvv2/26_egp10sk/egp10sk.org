Thought of two more:

"Wards" are never referenced in canon. The idea of protective spells for a home are, but seeing it referenced ad nauseum is annoying.

Sirius didn't play beater, so far as we know. He may have. But he references flying only to say that Harry "flies as well as his father did" (and not to say, I was swinging bats three feet away from him).
