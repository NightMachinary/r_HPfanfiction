My point is that Rowling never uses anything like "Peter shifted into Wormtail." If you want to keep it in the style of her writing, it's as simple as saying "Peter transformed." Or if you're writing from their POV, you don't need to say "the part of his brain that was Padfoot..." it's just "Sirius thought."
