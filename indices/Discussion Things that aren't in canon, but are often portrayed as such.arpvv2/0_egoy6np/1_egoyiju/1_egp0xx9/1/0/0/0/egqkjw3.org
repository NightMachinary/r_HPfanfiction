Well that's not impossible but then does it even count? Both potters and Weasleys are pure blood families but they weren't in the order or at school together so why would they have met? I'd say they definitely knew of each other because everyone knows the weasleys and the potters. But I doubt the Weasleys knew about lily until they heard she'd died. They might have known the potters heir was called James but I think if they had known each other in any sense it would have been mentioned in the books
