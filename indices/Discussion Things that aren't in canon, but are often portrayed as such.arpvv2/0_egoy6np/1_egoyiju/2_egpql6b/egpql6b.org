They weren't in the order during the first war. In OotP at one point I believe Lupin said something to Molly like “you weren't in the order back then. You don't understand” when she was all upset. Maybe around the time she saw her boggart? For Arthur it wasn't mentioned, but I don't believe he was mentioned as being in the photo, as has been said.
