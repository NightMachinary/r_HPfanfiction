And they certainly weren't at Hogwarts together at any point of their life! I've seen far too many Marauder era fics (and I don't even read much of those) where James, Sirius or Lily fondly remember Arthur and Molly who are supposed to be a couple years older than them and recently graduated, and all I can think about is how hard it must have been for Molly to finish her schooling while having at least two kids already. I distinctly remember one fic where Molly and Arthur were only two years Marauders' senior, and by that logic they must have had Bill at... what, twelve?

Same with Andromeda.
