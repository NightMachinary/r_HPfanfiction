Right, and to be honest I don't think we see much evidence of Lily being particularly strong anyway - she doesn't appear in the books much, but she's almost always crying. I think people saw that one scene in OOTP of her being quite rightly aangry and thought she was a fiery, angry person in general. But she makes up little nicknames for people, cries, and stayed friends with Snape for way too long.
