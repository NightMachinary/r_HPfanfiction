I think most people liked my OC but there were a few who said it would be impossible for her to continue being an Auror after she cried. Like... no, it doesn't work like that. If she can ofnthe job she can do the job. Has she toughened up over the course of the story? Of course. But very few people are born so resilient that they don't react emotionally to shocking or upsetting things, and simply crying does not mean a lack of resilience anyway.
