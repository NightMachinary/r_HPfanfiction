I mean honestly I totally agree with you. But when I wrote my OC as quite emotional and tearful it was shocking how often I got accused of writing a weak character, even though she continued to show resilience. I feel quite strongly that it's healthy to cry and that rather than saying women are being over sensitive sometimes people just shouldn't be complete twats. I don't want to see women become emotionless robots in order to be considered well written or strong. But...

If we are honest with ourselves about what people mean when they say "both Lily and Ginny are strong characters", what they actually mean is that they are both fiesty. But Lily is a maternal angel type with little agency in canon (and I do often criticise Rowling for writing her this way). The cutesy names, the tears, the fact that her biggest act of bravery is something any loving mother would do (i.e, inherently tying it to her portrayal as a maternal angel) - none of that is what people mean when they compare her to Ginny, that's all forgotten. They are swept up in fanon. The fanon portrayal of Lily as a firecracker just isn't backed up in canon.

I think there's a happy medium and 99% of women fall within that median. Unfortunately that is not how fanfic writers always see it.

Rather than using the word strong I should have just emphasised that their personalities don't seem that similar either, but obviously will leave it up for transparency.
