I've always wondered what would happen if I wrote an OC who was emotional. I don't need to wonder about it any longer. It's true that when people say they are strong characters, they mean that those two are fiery. and someone like Cho is considered weak. When they talk about how cool Molly is, it's all about how she killed Bellatrix, and not about how she managed to raise 7 children or how she had to recover after losing her brothers. It seems to me that people believe crying=weak. I've been listening to a podcast where one of the hosts said she didn't understand why Hermione was so emotional after she learned Buckbeak will be killed. I was honestly confused by this. Like, you need a serious reason which would give you a right to cry? Then they went on to say that Hermione lost her faith in the justice system, so apparently it's alright to cry because of that.
