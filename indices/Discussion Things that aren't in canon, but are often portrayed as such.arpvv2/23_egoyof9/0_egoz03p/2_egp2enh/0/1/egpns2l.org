Everyone knows Sirius was in Azkaban. It was a big thing. She knows he was there. Everyone panicked when he escaped.

She has also been living in the same house as him for weeks. His house. With his stuff and his mother's portrait. His childhood friend was also living there. She has seen his childhood enemy visit.

She has spent more time with Sirius than Harry ever has.

Maybe she's overstepping her boundaries, and is being over protective, but that doesn't mean that she's going to make that up. She may have a history of being overly credulous but she doesn't tend to make things up.

If your interpretation of canon is that she's wrong, that's cool, but there is the canon basis for the idea of Sirius confusing Harry and James. It's a valid reason for other people to suppose that with greater exposure to Sirius, Harry might see what she sees.
