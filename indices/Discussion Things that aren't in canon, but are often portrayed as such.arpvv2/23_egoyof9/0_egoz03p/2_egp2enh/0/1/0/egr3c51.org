The thing is, Molly is shown to be wrong about a whole lot of things throughout the series, so to many readers this is just another thing she's wrong about. She's wrong about Hermione being a "scarlet woman", she's wrong about the twin's business being useless, she's wrong about Fleur not loving Bill... What's to say she's also wrong about Sirius being confused?
