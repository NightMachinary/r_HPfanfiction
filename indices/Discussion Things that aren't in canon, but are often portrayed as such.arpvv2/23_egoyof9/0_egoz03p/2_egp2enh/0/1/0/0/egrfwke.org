I mean, there is no one true interpretation of any book.

There is a bit of evidence that Sirius is unhinged in OoTP. There is a bit of evidence that Molly is not being the most hinged herself.

You can go either way.

But it's right there in canon, so if you want to play it straight, you can write Sirius as having issues with Harry and James.

It's like Dumbledore being a cruel Machiavellian consequentialist- you have the evidence for it in the books if you look at his actions.

You can also look at what you're told by various characters and have him as a wholly benevolent if somewhat neglectful mentor figure.

Both are valid.
