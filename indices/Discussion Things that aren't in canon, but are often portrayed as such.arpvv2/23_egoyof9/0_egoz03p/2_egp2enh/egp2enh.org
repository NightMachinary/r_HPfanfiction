The question is â€˜why that?'.

Previously Sirius has been presented in an almost uniformly positive way, and his relationship with Harry has been shown as a good and healthy thing. At the point that OoTP was released if anyone was reading this type of transference into the text, it was definitely an outsider view. If JK Rowling didn't want people to think that there was something twisted in Sirius and Harry's relationship, she shouldn't have had Molly say it.

As I say, I don't think they meant to suggest delusion so much as a bit of... mental conflation.
