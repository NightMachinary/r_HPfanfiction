I don't know, I love Molly, and think she's great, but she just didn't seem to like Sirius at all, and wanted any kind of thing to complain to him about.

Like how she pretty much said about Sirius being thrown in Azkaban and the like. That was cruel and simply uncalled for.

Sirius and Molly both have very independent personalities, and their own ways to protect the people that they cared about, I'm not saying Molly was wrong in her way in caring for Harry, but she was wrong with how she handled Sirius.
