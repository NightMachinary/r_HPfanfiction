To be fair to Molly she warmed up to Sirius after Arthur was attacked in the Ministry. I remember something about her genuinely thanking Sirius for looking after her kids and then helping him prepare food.

It's possible that Molly had trouble mentally separating actual Sirius from the image of the ruthless, murderous, traitorous Sirius Black that the Prophet and Ministry had portrayed for 12 years. I still think she overstepped the boundary at times, but maybe this is the reason why.
