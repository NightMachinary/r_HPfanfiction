I think Sirius did see Harry at least a bit like James in the books. Though Sirius wanted the right thing by saying Harry needed to know too, it wasn't for the right reasons. I think this is meant to show the kind of mental state he's in because of being locked up in the house.

Sirius always wanted Harry to keep himself safe in GoF. He's always telling Harry to be cautious and keep his head down. So for him to make a complete turn in OotP is indicative of his mental state - which is being quite reckless since he's holed up in a place he detests. We're meant to feel some sort of closure this way - that Sirius was suffering being alive and death was kinder. I think that's what JK intended.

I don't like that of course.
