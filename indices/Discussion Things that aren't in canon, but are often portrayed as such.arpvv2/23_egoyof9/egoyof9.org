There was an implication in OoTP that Sirius was not 100% clear, emotionally at least, on the Harry-not-being-James thing.

“What's wrong with that?” said Harry.

“What's wrong, Harry, is that you are not your father, however much you might look like him!” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes still boring into Sirius. “You are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it!”
