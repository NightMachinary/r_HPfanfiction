  4: Head Boy and Head Girl quarters aren't a thing
#+end_quote

Actually never saw that one, though it seems like it's mostly a thing in DM/HG fics (which I don't read in general), and Marauder era James/Lily (I never got far into any).

  7: Harry was a very sarcastic person. Too often I tend to see angst-y Harry or Saving people Complex Harry, people tend to forget that he was sarcastic as heck to people.
#+end_quote

There is also a bland super-nice Harry, which is the worst. I will take angst over lack of anything.

Also: We never learned what Scrimgeour house was. The killed Bones from the Order weren't Susan's parents and she didn't live with Amelia.
