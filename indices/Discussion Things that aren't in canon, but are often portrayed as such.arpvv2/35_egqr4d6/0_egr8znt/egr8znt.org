The only time that "trio" is mentioned in all seven books is in reference to the Deathly Hallows:

  I thought that, if we ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean â€˜invincible.'

Edit: "Golden" is mentioned several times, in reference to tableware, snitches, the moon, and Fawkes among other things.
