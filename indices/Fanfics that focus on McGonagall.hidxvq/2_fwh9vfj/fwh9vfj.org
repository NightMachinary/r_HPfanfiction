Linkffn(We, Harry Potter by wille179) is my creation. It has McGonagall working herself to the bone to invent an entirely new transfiguration discipline - a reverse animagus transformation - in order to help Harry, who's been turned into a giant, five-headed dragon. It's definitely more of a mentor relationship than a parental one.
