I took a look at the first few chapters. This may be my personal preference regarding his character so not sure how much this really matters but I find Snape to be very out of character in your fic. He just seems so nice, polite, helpful and I just don't believe that reflects his character at all. In both books and movies, he comes off as strict, insulting, intimidating, critical, sarcastic, cynical, often not saying anything at all or giving one word answers. Asking "Are you alright", "your welcome", helping out new students seems out of character. It would work better if instead of helping her, he observed her and you went through the process of him deciding what it is about her that made him notice her as a slytherin.

Why does he think Hermione would be in slytherin? Muggle born in slytherin would need to be ruthless, manipulative, cunning, she seemed kind of bookwormy and awkward. Not sure that seeing wandless magic would convince him to have a good opinion of someone. Also, don't think that seeing that Harry was taking notes would reverse his opinion of him, his hatred of him is unreasonable, he would just focus it on something else.

His main criticism of Hermione is that she thinks all answers can be found in books and tells everyone random facts instead of relying on her brain and coming up with her own unique conclusions and knowing when to say things at the right time. Giving answers word for word from the book would do the exact opposite of impressing him.

Anyways, him behaving this way does seem to be extremely common in fics with him as a main character so I guess a lot of people like him acting this way, but just keep in mind that this may turn off some people from reading your story. The writing itself was good though, did not see any problems there.
