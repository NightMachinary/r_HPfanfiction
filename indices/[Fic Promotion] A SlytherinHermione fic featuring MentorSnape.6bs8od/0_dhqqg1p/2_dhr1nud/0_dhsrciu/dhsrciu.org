You know what? I was lurking and logged in just to comment on this comment that's commenting on another comment not only because it was unbearably rude but because there are two things that really bothered me about it:

#+begin_quote
  Sir, your comment is completely and utterly out of line.
#+end_quote

Actually, [[/u/Satanniel]] gave a pretty decent crit in my opinion. It wasn't sugar and light, and yes, it was a negative review, but it was nowhere near a flame. He (or she) gave his opinion and then proceeded to explain said opinion thoroughly.

Negative reviews â‰  crappy reviews.

(Also, that quoted comment is pretty rich considering the personal stuff about him you've written.)

Oh, and this was the best part:

#+begin_quote
  From this, sir, I can conclude you are not a writer, but consumer of fan fics.
#+end_quote

This is utter tosh. You do not have to be a chef to give your opinion on a meal, you do not have to be a director to air your opinion on a movie, and you certainly do not have to be a writer to form an opinion on writing.
