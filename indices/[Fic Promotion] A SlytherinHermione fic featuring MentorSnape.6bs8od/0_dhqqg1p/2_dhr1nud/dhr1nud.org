I have to agree with the author here.

Sir, your comment is completely and utterly out of line. It takes balls to post your fic on the internet, then more to post on reddit to promote it. I've looked through your posts, and you're the guy (or girl) that shits on everyone's fics. From this, sir, I can conclude you are not a writer, but consumer of fan fics. Most writers, I've found, are happy to give /constructive criticism/ rather than a rude tirade.

I've read this fic, and while the author might not be the next Rowling, the writing is pretty solid, it's free of grammar and spelling errors, the relationship between Snape and Hermione is rather cute, and all in all, it's a fairly good fic that looks like it's heading towards a happy ending. It's the author's first fic. Who am I to judge them?

I looked at the anime you recommended, and it seems pretty fucked up. I don't know your story. It's not my place to judge you, but based on your rudeness not only towards the OP but towards many of the authors on this site, I find myself doing so.

Please, do yourself and all of us a favor: clean the shit out of your mouth and get the stick out of your arse. I'd like to see you try to write something as good as any of the fics you routinely degrade.
