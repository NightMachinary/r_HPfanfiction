Considering that this is the only comment of this author, it's probably a multi-account and I should ignore it. But let's think positive! Maybe someone was actually outraged by my post that he stopped idling and made an account.

  Sir, your comment is completely and utterly out of line. It takes balls to post your fic on the internet, then more to post on reddit to promote it.

If you are publishing something publicly, then you have to be prepared for public criticism of various kinds.

#+begin_quote
  I've looked through your posts, and you're the guy (or girl) that shits on everyone's fics.
#+end_quote

Nice ignoring of all those posts with recommendations.

#+begin_quote
  I looked at the anime you recommended, and it seems pretty fucked up.
#+end_quote

You looked at it so well that you didn't even notice that what I recommended isn't an anime. Maybe I was wrong earlier and you haven't ignored my other posts, and you just don't understand what you read. That would explain much.

#+begin_quote
  Please, do yourself and all of us a favor: clean the shit out of your mouth and get the stick out of your arse.
#+end_quote

And it's me, who is supposedly rude.

#+begin_quote
  I'd like to see you try to write something as good as any of the fics you routinely degrade.
#+end_quote

This is one of those absolutely stupid ways of deflecting criticism that ranks along with "we shouldn't discuss tastes" which try to sidetrack the discussion from arguments about the quality of the work.
