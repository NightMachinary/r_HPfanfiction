I probably could phrase this nicer, but let's not beat around the bush - this fic is awful.

Going into this I expected poor man's Applied Cultural Anthropology, but what I got was completely different and not really describable as "a Slytherin!Hermione fic featuring Mentor!Snape". Because it's not really Hermione fic, she is mostly a plot device, it's the story of Snape (who doesn't really do much mentoring).

Now, Snape is a very interesting character, but this actually isn't Snape. His characterisation fails from the start, with him thinking like a hormonal teenager in love when he notices slightest similarities between Hermione and himself. And it continues from there. Snape is nice, caring, and at the mental level of fourteen years old. Also, he did nothing wrong during his school years, it was all those Marauders fault.

It's not like he got a taste of his medicine when being embarrassed by his own spell - Levicorpus. It's not like he ran around throwing insults at muggleborns, and doing nothing when his terrorist-sympathising friends bullied them. It's not like he became terrorist himself and only felt regret when it turned out that family he sentenced to death included his unrequited, obsessive love. Oh, poor, poor Snape.

You actually can make Snape nice and good guy, but for this, you need to establish an AU with big enough divergences like Wit of the Raven did. Here there is nothing for us to treat it differently than complete OOC-ness, and even if it was this rendition doesn't make for interesting character due to his complete one dimensionalness. Also, he lost his competence, as shown by his method of dealing with the troll. Really, levitation?

But you know who is bad and evil and all that? Dumbledore. He is also stupid, incompetent and cares only for the Greater Good. Yes, it's the classic Dumbledore bashing galore. Which is even more annoying when it comes a chapter after recommending Prince of the Slytherin, which aside from the unfortunate prologue has decently written Dumbledore.

This OOC-ness and general lack of any depth to characterisation is a continuing trend. Harry is meek, Draco is nice, etc.

That brings us back to the Hermione. She also is barely Hermione at all, with her family situation being transformed to Harry's one, but with biological parents. Boring and unoriginal? Boring and unoriginal.

As you could guess from what I mentioned, the story is full of angst, and basically, lacks anything else in term of content. Angst is hard to write well and require a certain level of skill in handling characters' emotions. Skill that Flye clearly lacks.

It's driven home by the very badly written inner thoughts (well, the dialogue too). Initially, I wanted to recommend her The Changeling and On the Way to Greatness, but then I noticed that she already has the first one in favourites. Which means that I should recommend reread (just after rereading of books). Reread and thinking about "what makes this fic good?", "what makes those characters interesting?", "what makes those thoughts not annoying to read?". Because this:

  Thank goodness I asked Professor Snape about Houses - Hogwarts, A History had been terribly biased against Slytherin. Imagine if I'd gone in thinking all Slytherins were dark evil bastards in the making - that would have been quite embarrassing.

This is embarrassing to read.

At least I can appreciate an attempt on the "stream of consciousness" mode that Hermione goes in when she breaks. But it fails too, something like that, when used in pure text, needs a certain cadence to not be just a collection of randomly thrown together sentences.

Despite there barely being a plot, and the short length of the fic, there are two obvious plotholes. The first is Dumbledore hiding the troll's existence from Aurors. It's a school where almost all magical kids from Britain learn, of course, it would leak. The second is the Snape's shock on Moody discovering that Hermione is muggleborn, despite Snape himself telling him her blood status.

Lastly is something that I usually start my rants with - magic system. But considering the small role magic played here I left it for the end. Consistently with the rest of fic, it's bad. It's all about wand movements and incantations. Surely, that's why there are many books about spells as required lectures and why both Charms and Transfiguration last seven years. And why there are so big differences between different power levels of magical practitioners. Why the Protego with super-simple downward slash wand-movement and easy incantation took Harry so long to learn. Yeah.

There are good stories about bullying, but this isn't one of them. 2/10, go read Onani Master Kurosawa if you didn't do this yet and want something on the topic.
