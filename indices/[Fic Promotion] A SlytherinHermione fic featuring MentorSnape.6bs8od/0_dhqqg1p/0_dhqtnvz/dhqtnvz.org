While I certainly appreciate the time you spend to type out all of this vitriol, I would like to note something I said at the top of my post. I am looking for /constructive criticism/ , not a general tear-down of my fic. For example, look at dehue's comment where they explain what they didn't like, why they didn't like it, but in a respectful manner. Furthermore, they do explain that while they aren't in favor of my characterization of Snape, they do think my writing is mechanically sound.

You do have a fair point with the second plot-hole - I will concede that to you. However, many of your points, especially regarding the competence of Snape, seem ill-thought through. Firstly, about levitation - does it matter how you incapacitate something as long as it's permanently out of commission? No, it doesn't, and, as a matter of fact, when faced with a high stress situation, we humans tend to resort to reflexive skills -- hence the levitation charm. Secondly, in response to some of your other points -- you forget that Snape is an inherently biased narrator. He (obviously) is going to think that the Marauders were terrible evil gits and that Dumbledore is an awful person caring only for non-Slytherins. Some of your other "points" raise other questions in my mind...have you ever spoken to an eleven-year-old?

I'm not going to continue this tirade any further, and I do respect your opinion, but I (as well as the many people who have followed/favorited my fic) strongly disagree with you.
