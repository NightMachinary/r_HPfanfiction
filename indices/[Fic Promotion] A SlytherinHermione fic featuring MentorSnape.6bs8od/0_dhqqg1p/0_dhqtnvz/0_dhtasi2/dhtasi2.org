  I would like to note something I said at the top of my post. I am looking for constructive criticism , not a general tear-down of my fic.
#+end_quote

The definition of constructive criticism is pretty fuzzy, but I consider the key element is showing specific issues, and explain where the problem lies. Which I've done. Not exactly in the nice way, but I didn't aim at being nice.

#+begin_quote
  they do think my writing is mechanically sound.
#+end_quote

Which only shows that they have even lower standards than I in this field. That doesn't make their criticism more valid, to the contrary, they are ignoring the biggest problem with the fic.

  Firstly, about levitation - does it matter how you incapacitate something as long as it's permanently out of commission?
#+end_quote

Because hitting something in the head isn't surefire method?

#+begin_quote
  No, it doesn't, and, as a matter of fact, when faced with a high stress situation, we humans tend to resort to reflexive skills -- hence the levitation charm.
#+end_quote

This is ex-terrorist, double spy and one of the most skilled characters in the series in terms of combat.

  Secondly, in response to some of your other points -- you forget that Snape is an inherently biased narrator. He (obviously) is going to think that the Marauders were terrible evil gits and that Dumbledore is an awful person caring only for non-Slytherins.
#+end_quote

That explanation doesn't work when we see Dumbledore's words and actions. He himself goes "For the Greater Good!", he notes similarities between situations of Hermione and Snape, he barely punishes students who attacked their schoolmate and left her locked without the way out and way to contact anyone to help get her out. Unless everything will end with this being Snape's delusion or lie, it can't be explained by his unreliability.

  Some of your other "points" raise other questions in my mind...have you ever spoken to an eleven-year-old?
#+end_quote

Unfortunately, despite my best efforts to not speak to anyone below 15 years old, it sometimes still happens. Your point here?

#+begin_quote
  many people who have followed/favorited my fic strongly disagree with you.
