Okay then.

Let's try nicer.

Your description is misleading. It's not Hermione's story, she is more of a plot device here. We see most of the events from Snape's perspective. Additionally, Snape is not a mentor here, or rather he is only for a brief moment, later plot progress quickly lead to lack of concrete contact between him and Hermione.

Your characterisation, in general, is off. I recommend rereading books.

Let's take Snape here. In canon, he is an asshole with a superiority complex. Which is partially warranted by his skill. He is not in the league of Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindelwald, but he still is one of the most powerful wizards we see in the series. It's very visible in his fight with McGonagall. Your fic fails by making him nice, barely having him showing his superiority to others and by diminishing his skill. Also his role as a double spy with a terrorist organization makes him unlikely to quickly involve himself emotionally.

Another good example is Draco. He specifically mentions in PS that he dislikes muggleborns because they are outsiders, not raised in their culture. He wouldn't take to "maybe half-blood" Hermione.

Also, characters lack depth, they are very one dimensional, with their personality existing only in to a degree that story requires to progress. Surprisingly, Ron comes here the best. He is almost two dimensional, with his actual interests shown as separate factors for his actions.

The other problem is the plot. It centers about Snape quickly taking interest in Hermione because she reminds him of himself. But at the beginning, there is not enough information for him to reach that impression. Yet he acts like a teenager in love almost immediately upon seeing her. It's badly established and rushed and it doesn't work with Snape.

Hermione's home situation is too similar to Harry's to be engaging. Blah, blah you should be thankful that we are raising you, blah, blah. Also cupboard.

The story relies heavily on Dumbledore being a complete idiot. Of course, characters acting like idiots for a sake of the plot was also a problem in canon, but this isn't the part you are supposed to copy.

In the end, the story isn't engaging because it relies heavily on characters which are very weak, and writing which also is weak upon which I will touch in a moment.

Magic in HP fics is something I care greatly about, and here is a combination of usual bad magic tropes. With mana spending and spellcasting success being based solely upon incantation pronunciation and wand movements.

Well, I think it's time to come back to writing. I'm not a good writer, so I can't help much there. But, there is way too much of repetitive and uninteresting inner thoughts. We don't need to read Snape going hundred times "Our situations are so similar, oh" or "Dumbledore is a dick".

The stream of consciousness moments lacks anything that would connect them, there is no cadence so they are a mess. That may reflect Hermione's state of mind well but doesn't look good in text.

There is a clear lack of descriptions, both of the characters and the places. For example, we are never told where the hell are professors betting and how they look. Secondhand bookstore, a new location is never described etc.

Characters should be given certain personal flair to dialogue. As it stands, there is no real consistency to how one character speaks, and at the same time, various characters speak in the same way.

You might've noticed that I referred a lot to canon. Of course, fanfiction can, and often should change things from canon. But the result of those changes should be more complex and more interesting than canon is. They also need to be followed to their logical conclusion. Changes have consequences and those should be observed. Here we lack this.

In the end, making this nicer don't change a verdict. Basically every aspect of the story is faulty - 2/10.
