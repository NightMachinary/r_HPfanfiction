Look, I'm not trying to start an internet feud with you. My main issues with your response to my post are: a) politeness

#+begin_quote
  I probably could phrase this nicer
#+end_quote

Not the best lead in to a critique -- while I appreciated your directness, your (at least how I read it - might not be what you intended) rude tone was really off-putting and honestly quite upsetting.

#+begin_quote
  As you could guess from what I mentioned, the story is full of angst, and basically, lacks anything else in term of content. Angst is hard to write well and require a certain level of skill in handling characters' emotions. Skill that Flye clearly lacks.It's driven home by the very badly written inner thoughts (well, the dialogue too).

Yet, you don't specifically say what can be improved here -- you bash the writing yet offer no examples on how to fix it or state what's specifically wrong. I truly want to improve your writing, and this gives me nothing to work with. It's easy to point a proverbial finger at a fic and say "bad!" but I would really appreciate if you would tell me /what/ is wrong with the dialogue. Is it unnecessary? Have poor flow? Seem unnatural? etc. This is the first fan fic I've written, so I'm looking for ways to make my writing in the future. Part of what was hurtful about your post was you went one after another of the things you believed I did wrong, yet you didn't offer any positives or any solutions. I'm not trying to be rude to you here -- just trying to communicate that when you make a post like this, it's hurtful to others and it's something of which you should be aware.

b) not actually presenting constructive criticism

#+begin_quote
  Constructive criticism: "A recommended set of instructions that aims to collaboratively improve the overall quality of a product or service. Often containing helpful and specific suggestions for positive change, constructive criticism is highly focused on a particular issue or set of issues, as opposed to providing general feedback on the item or organization as a whole."

While I don't deny that you presented a very through /critique/ of my fic, and a scathing one at that, I do not believe you presented constructive criticism. Now, if you had said something along the lines of: "Your writing and descriptions are good; however, you need to improve on your characterization. In my opinion, this is where you went wrong, and here is one way I would recommend fixing it." That kind of goes back to my first point about being polite. We're on the internet. I don't know who you are, and you don't know who I am. Regardless, it's nice to show at least a bit of kindness and encouragement to others.
