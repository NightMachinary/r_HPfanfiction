Yeah, I can't say that I entirely agree with you on all points, but you've put into words a lot of my problems with this fic.

Slytherin!Hermione fics -- how I love and hate them. I love the idea of them. Who wouldn't? A clever Muggle-born sorted into the house of ambition is a ready-made conflict.

But I hate the execution of most of them. Why? Because they tend to fall into certain traps: nice!Draco or Snape; overly friendly Slytherins; OOC Hermione; super-duper-smart Hermione; characters written as sounding and/or thinking too old for their ages; the Dark Arts aren't evil, just misunderstood; Voldemort Did Nothing Wrong; etc ...

This fic, sadly, falls into some of those traps. /Some/, not all -- though I can't be sure of that as I only read to chapter 12 and could go no further.

The writing is technically decent, which puts it above most fics right off the bat, but it's the characterization -- hers, Snape's, Slytherin house in general, Dumbledore's -- that is my biggest issue with this story. It's too OOC for me.
