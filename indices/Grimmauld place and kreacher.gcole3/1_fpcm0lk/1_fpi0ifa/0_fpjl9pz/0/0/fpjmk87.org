The main plot of linkao3(Starting Over by serendipity_50) is the attempted rape of Ginny by Fenrir Greyback. I emphasize *attempted* and there is not much unsuitable described, so it is probably still T (or PG-13, is that a rough equivalent?), but yes it is about the rape, so it deserves the tagging.

Why the author of Inner Demons decided not to mark the story I have no clue. But it is a way more gore than the first one. The main plotline is centred around Ginny's struggles with PTSD, which includes attempted suicide (or perhaps it was an accident, but it is really cutting it close), a lot of standard adventure violence, but also one horribly cursed and tortured child (that made me not sleep for couple of nights), some families burned up alive (in distance, no detailed description), another attempted rape (which really goes nowhere, Ginny is just pinned against the wall fully clothed before the violator is beaten down by Harry), and Harry and Ginny are in some parts of the story so screwed up they are able to communicate mostly only through sex, so there are some rather graphic scenes (it is all lilly-vanilla heterosexual consensual sex, but some detailed descriptions of human anatomy in action are included). So, yes it is definitively M (or R, if that's the equivalent), and it should probably deserve appropriate labels, but as that label says “Creator *Chose* Not To Use Archive Warnings”.
