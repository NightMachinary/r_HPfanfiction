Definitely something to consider, especially if you go with the idea that the Horcruxes made Voldemort mentally unstable and that's why he's a mass-murdering psycho instead of a charming and intelligent bloke who overtakes the wizarding world through politics and manipulation of the law. With only the one Horcrux, and a much stabler mental state, he could be a much bigger and more different kind of threat.
