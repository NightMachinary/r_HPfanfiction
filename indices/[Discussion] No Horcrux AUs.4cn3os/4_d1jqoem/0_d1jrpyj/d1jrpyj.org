The same way we did pre-HBP -- just a different kind of magic, unusual or unique perhaps, but not related to Voldemort's immortality. In CoS, Dumbledore said that Voldemort unintentionally transferred some of his power to Harry when he tried to kill him. You can keep with that idea, saying that it is just some of Voldemort's power without being a part of his soul.
