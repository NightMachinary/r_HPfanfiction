As someone who tends to write canon divergent AUs, I should really be more open to tossing certain canon elements, but I definitely fall into the canon-stations trap. I think I'm getting better with each story, but the Horcruxes are definitely one of those things that you think /needs to be there/. Them, and the resurrection ritual. (Which I'm now thinking I might scrap as well and come up with something new...)

I see your point re: not explaining Voldemort's non-death, but I already have ideas for that and how it affects The Plot and certain characters' actions after his rebirth, so I'll be explaining it in this fic anyway.
