As long as there is a /purpose/ for explaining his non-death and isn't just useless exposition or filler it's most likely fine, great even.

It's probably my biggest pet peeve when authors just rehash canon for no other reason than 'I had to say something!'

Well no, you really didn't!

Good luck with you story though!
