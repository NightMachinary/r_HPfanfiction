Hi, I saw on an older post from you after searching Google for Save Me by SaraEK, hoping that maybe it would still be somewhere. I tried to reply to that post, but it wouldn't let me because it was to old. I tried to figure out how to PM you, but I couldn't. My inbox only had one message, and it seems like I couldn't send any messages yet, except to reply to that one message from Reddit.

So I'm very sorry for this roundabout way to ask, but this is the only thing I could figure out lol. The links from the older post didn't work, so I was hoping you could email me the PDF or Word doc of Save Me. Email is [[mailto:megdan99@gmail.com][megdan99@gmail.com]]. Thanks! Meg
