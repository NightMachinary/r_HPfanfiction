In regards to the diary I think it's best to just consider it like you would the Marauder's Map. Through lots of use and a few choice charms, the personality of the owner(s) was left imprinted on the object. Like how the Marauders can differentiate between people and insult who they like, the diary contains bits of Riddle's personality.

I think a lot of people who write HP fanfiction fall into the trap of forcing horcruxes into the story. If it's AU then it's AU and horcruxes don't need to be a part of the story. Lots of writers get caught up by them, and treat them as this immovable plot object.

When it comes to why Voldemort didn't truly die on Halloween night, you really don't need to tell the reader anything. Stephen King said, "Nightmares exist outside of logic, and there's little fun to be had in explanations; they're antithetical to the poetry of fear."

You can just as easily say something vague like "it was Halloween, there is a lot of wild magic in the air, no one really knows" etc etc.
