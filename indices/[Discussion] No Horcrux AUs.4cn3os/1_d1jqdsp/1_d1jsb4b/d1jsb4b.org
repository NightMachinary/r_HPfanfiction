That would be interesting to see, and I'd be surprised if such a thing isn't written somewhere (or at least started and maybe abandoned) but I'm not good enough to handle that level of alternate universe and world building.

Like NaughtyGaymer said, the Horcruxes don't have to exist if a story's AU. As someone who's fond of canon-divergent AUs, I see no reason why the Horcruxes should exist even in that. And it gets boring to cover the same issue repeatedly, even in a c.d.AU that hits a couple of other canon stations. It's more interesting, at least for me as a writer, to explore a new idea than keep writing about Horcrux hunts. Plus it gives me better chance to exercise my creative skills. It means I actually have to come up with new answers to questions like /how did Voldemort survive in 1981/ and /why can't we just shoot him now he's reborn/, instead of falling back on the canon explanations.
