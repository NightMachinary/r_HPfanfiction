I've read a few but can't remember what they were called, and I don't think I have them on my favorites list. They can be good, just like any other plot point.

The prophecy can be left to explain away why he didn't die. He marked him and now they have the real fight later. It's fairly flimsy but whatever.

Diary was never explained iirc. I'd personally rather use it as a sole horcrux than cut horcruxes altogether. They're an interesting bit of magic, unlike the hallows.
