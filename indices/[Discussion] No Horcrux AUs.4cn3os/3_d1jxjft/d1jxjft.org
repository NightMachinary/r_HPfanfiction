  What sort of alternatives have you seen people use for the reason Voldemort didn't die in 1981?
#+end_quote

I'm writing a story that diverges from canon in the last chapter of PS. I've imagined that the story takes place in a universe where there are no souls. This means, no horcruxes, dementors, or Hallows.

I've explained Voldemort's appearance in PS as the desperate act of a necromancer that cannot be repeated, effectively making TMR well and truly dead.

With no dementors, there's no reason to keep Azkaban, so I've come up with an alternative that lets me diverge more from canon.

Harry's cloak is just a cloak like it was for the first six and a half books. The other Hallows don't exist. Dumbledore is exceptionally talented because of decades of experience and a desire to work hard, not because of the Elder Wand.

  How did they handle the diary
#+end_quote

I /tried/ to keep the diary and explain it away as having the power to imbue a person with the magically enhanced memories of a young TMR, but that plotline went nowhere so I cut it thanks to some excellent advice I got on this subreddit.

The CoS storyline /begins/ the same as canon with Dobby delivering a cryptic warning about a mysterious danger, but for a wholly different reason. I'm trying to avoid running the 'stations of canon,' so that's pretty much where the similarities end. Getting rid of the diary really freed up some space to try out some (hopefully) new ideas.

  Given the hate HBP and DH sometimes get, do you think stories without Horcruxes are better?
#+end_quote

I don't dislike the second half of the series because of JKR's worldbuilding. In fact, I think she makes some really excellent additions to her already interesting universe. It was the characterizations that went downhill fast, mostly fueleed by bland and cliched interpersonal relationships.

After OOtP, I didn't care if Harry lived or died.

After HBP, that feeling spread to Ron and Hermione.

After DH, I wondered why anyone would bother to save the magical world.

These are probably extreme, minority opinions and I don't imagine that anyone else shares them.
