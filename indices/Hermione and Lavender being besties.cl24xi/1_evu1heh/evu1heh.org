1. I am really a big fan of post-War Lavender in the [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Btitle%5D=&work_search%5Bcreators%5D=northumbrian&work_search%5Brevised_at%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bsingle_chapter%5D=0&work_search%5Bword_count%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bfandom_names%5D=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search%5Brating_ids%5D=&work_search%5Bcharacter_names%5D=Lavender+Brown&work_search%5Brelationship_names%5D=&work_search%5Bfreeform_names%5D=&work_search%5Bhits%5D=&work_search%5Bkudos_count%5D=&work_search%5Bcomments_count%5D=&work_search%5Bbookmarks_count%5D=&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bsort_direction%5D=desc&commit=Search][stories by Northumbrian]], so I a way prefer Lavender actually surviving the Battle of Hogwarts (yes, I know there is [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Talk:Lavender_Brown/Archive_1][the endless discussion]] on whether she actually did survive or not), although she is severely traumatized from it.
2. I think there must be some relationship between Hermione and Lavender with Paravati: you don't for six years with somebody in one room and hate them all the time, besides, that charm throwing Fenrir Greyback over whole hallway had A LOT of intent behind, it didn't like from somebody who has no positive feeling about Lavender. Of course, we know nothing about that relationship because all books are only from the Harry's point of view (and we also know nothing about Hermione/Ginny relationship).
