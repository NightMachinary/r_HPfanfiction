I truly am not going to copy the Harry Potter books. There is no dark lord here. None, zilch, nada. No scars, no lightning bolts. Albus is going to be decent at quidditch, but he's not going to be a seeker, and he's not going to magically make it in thanks to McGonagall watching an amazing catch. Etc, etc.

And yeah, I guess it'll be kind of bland in the beginning...half of the enjoyment for me in writing it is just exploring the world more and trying to figure out more about how magic works, or more about creatures and such, things Rowling never truly covered. I also want to sort of set up Albus' character. But later I want to bring in things the adults (and kids) are doing to "fix" the ministry and wizarding law, or how attitudes are changing, things like that.

Apparently nobody seems to be liking it, but ah, well.
