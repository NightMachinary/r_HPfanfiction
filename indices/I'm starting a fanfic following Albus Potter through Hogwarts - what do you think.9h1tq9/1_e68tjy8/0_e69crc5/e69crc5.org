The description isn't very good then; I apologize. When I say "prevent the rise of another Voldemort" I mean in terms of government and things, not that there's actually another Voldemort to take down. And I said in the author notes in Ch.1. that it isn't going to be using Cursed Child. Anyway, Harry can be kind and understanding but there's plenty of other ways he needs to "find his place".
