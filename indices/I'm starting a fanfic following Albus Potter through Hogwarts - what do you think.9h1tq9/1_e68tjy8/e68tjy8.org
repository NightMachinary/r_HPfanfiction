It's a no just from reading the description. Why would next gen kids need to take care of the next dark Lord when the current generation is still alive and well? And unless you are using the shit called Cursed Child as basis, Albus would not really struggle to find his place since Harry would never act like that in canon. And if you use CC as base, it's a no either way.

Also, your description has two counts of "follow" in the same sentence. Rebuild is the wrong tense (rebuilding or remove the of)
