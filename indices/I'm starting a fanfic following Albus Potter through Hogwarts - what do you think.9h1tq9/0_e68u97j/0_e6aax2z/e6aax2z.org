  The second chapter I didn't make it through. An eleven year old punching a seventeen/eighteen year old over a girl, tipping fedora and all.

Wow I thought you were kidding and had to read that one for myself. Hey [[/u/Nerd1a4i]] , what were you thinking?

It's kinda besides the point, considering the ridiculousness of that punch, but why exactly is a 7th year Gryffindor treating the son of Harry Potter like this? Why is he mocking Luna Lovegood or her daughter? These are all war heroes.
