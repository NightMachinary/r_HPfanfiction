Congratulations on publishing something.

Given that Ginny named a poor innocent owl Pigwidgeon I think a case can be made that it was her who created that god awful name.

You've picked an incredibly bold title. Considered one of the top ten books of the 20th Century by some and one of the more thought provoking stories, its a legacy that you cannot hope to match. Considering the expectations you've set with the title what I've seen does not inspire confidence.

Luna lived a short distance away from the Weasleys. Luna was their friend and yet they've never had a get together?

The second half of the first chapter is nothing but telling with no showing. There are also several grammar issues.

The second chapter I didn't make it through. An eleven year old punching a seventeen/eighteen year old over a girl, tipping fedora and all.
