I'm not German, but I would assume it's because Germany as a 'nation' wasn't united until the late 1800s, well after the Statute was put into place. At the time of the Statute, the German States would've been coming out of the 30 years War (during which about a fifth of the entire population of the region had died, up to half in some areas, and most of Europe was a complete nightmare of political and religious warring at the time. Basically, they wouldn't have been stable enough until years after to have a proper magical government, nevermind a Great School, and they were nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire, so Catholics would've been witch-hunting and such too. They could've had something before the war that collapsed, interestingly, but afterward they would've been too ravaged and looted a land to keep too much going.

On a meta-level, it's probably just Rowling's complete lack of interest in worldbuilding beyond what she absolutely needed for that particular book and the general English lack of in-depth knowledge about other places.
