There is something weird about Germany ... I will let German folks fill me in, but how come there is no mentioning of it in whole JKR books, and how come the Durmstrang-Institut für Zauberei with the coat of arms which is somewhere between Byzantine, Russian, and Holy Roman Empire eagle, and all that is located somewhere in the Northern Scandinavia.

However, that is not mine story to tell. What is more important for me is what happened at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeč]]), where sometimes after the murder of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslaus_I,_Duke_of_Bohemia][Saint Wenceslaus]] this whole hillfort (which was the capital of the Czech dukedom before) is abandoned. That's the Muggle history, proven by evidence.

The explanation (originally from the community around the server [[http://budec.net/]]) is that the biggest part of it, which contained the magical school, was hidden from Muggles, and the school continues there until our days.
