Russia is a magical empire that started on the constitutional monarchy path in 1896 when Tsar Nicolas II gave up the rule of the magical community to his distant magical cousin now known as (the late) Peter IV. The Russian Empire started to take a Muggle-born children from their families once they were detected by the book of acceptance in Koldovstoretz and the Muggle Act of 1920 made it a criminal offence to live inside or near Muggle areas and to be in any form of contact with Muggles except for authorised members of the magical government.

The Empire is divided between the Tsardom of Russia, the Baltic Duchy, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Principality of Crimea, the Kingdom of Ukraine, the Duchy of Caucasia, and the United Kingdom of the Central Steppes. Ukraine and Lithuania also have diplomatic corps in the ICW alongside Russia. The only difference in terms of borders compared to the Soviet Union's in 1991 is that Kaliningrad and Memel are German and not Russian and Poland still has its ‘Ukrainian' territories from 1936. The Principality of Crimea acts like Wales and the Dauphiné in France which is basically used for the Crown Prince/Princess to ‘practice' ruling before succeeding to the Imperial throne. Everything that used to be in Petrograd and Moscow like magical districts and seats of magical government were all destroyed/abandoned and moved out to Siberia and vast and abandoned territories in the Steppes.

Please keep in mind that I know this is not canon. I have also have a AU government for France but i'll see how people react to my Russia before posting it.
