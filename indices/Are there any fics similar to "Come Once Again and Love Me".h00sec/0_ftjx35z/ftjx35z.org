Now I really want a fic where Snape goes back to fix everything and becomes even more depressed because he's forty-ish and this Lily is a child... He loved the Lily he grew up with, the one who fought Death Eaters and who was as (if not more) mature than he was. Now she acts like a child and grumpy old man Snape can't stand it.
