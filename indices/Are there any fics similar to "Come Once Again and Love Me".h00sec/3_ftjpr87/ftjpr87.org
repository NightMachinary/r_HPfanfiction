Does it count if the point where Severus traveled back to was six months after their estrangement, and he has to prove himself reformed before she gives their friendship another chance (but she does want her friend back)? I came across linkffn(The Peace Not Promised) recently and really liked the characterisation of Severus and Lily.

Edit: Ok, I've finished reading Come Once Again and Love Me. There are definitely a lot of parallels in the two stories, with Severus traveling back from his own death and reuniting with Lily. However, The Peace Not Promised just sends Severus back, not Lily, and he knows he's being given a second chance, so he's a bit more purposeful about it. He also has much more of a "hopelessly devoted to you" vibe; he doesn't keep her at arm's length once she accepts that he's reformed, he can't stand to stay away from her. Plus, it's around four times as long, with the majority of the story taking place after their wedding.

Come Once Again does a great job of showing how those decades of angst and spying produced a harsh and bitter man who was nonetheless devoted to Lily's memory. Peace Not Promised does a great job of showing how those decades of doing everything for Lily's sake produced a man who prioritised her safety and well-being above all else, while still being generally harsh and bitter.
