I don't, but I will say that she's my favourite fanfic writer. You can tell that she has a literary background with her rich language, use of imagery and well thought out prose. What I wouldn't give for that standard to be more common in fanfic.

If you are interested, she has The Never Ending Road linkao3(536450) which is supposed to be Snarriet but there's still no pairing after 700k words (it's basically wonderful genfic). I initially balked at the Snarriet tag but its there for future pairing apparently. I can't emphasise how well written it is in terms of technical literary ability.

Also she updated this series recently after many months of hiatus and it made my day.
