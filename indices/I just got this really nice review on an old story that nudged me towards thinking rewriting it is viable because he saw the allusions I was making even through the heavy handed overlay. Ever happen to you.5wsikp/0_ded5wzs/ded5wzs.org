I still get a lot of reviews on my old stuff, mostly praise. Usually, I can't help but think how shitty their taste is if they think that nonsense is good.

On the other hand, I do get people pointing out various mistakes in the old stories and giving a genuine critique, and all I can think of is that it's 8 years old and I state the story is bad right in my profile so the effort expended to review is literally pointless since I've come a long way since then.
