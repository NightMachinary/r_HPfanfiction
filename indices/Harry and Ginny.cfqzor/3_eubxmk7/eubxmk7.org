linkffn(The Arithmancer) Hermione's the main character but the Harry/Ginny stuff is cute AF

linkffn(Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake) This author is my vote for "Secretly JKR writing fanfiction for shits and giggles" You should read all of her stuff, it's all canon pairings so there are some Harry/Ginny moments in most of them.

I'm a big HHr shipper so that's kinda all I got.
