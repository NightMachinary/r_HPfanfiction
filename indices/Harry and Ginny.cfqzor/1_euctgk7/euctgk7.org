would recommend an old one The Coven of Echoes by hwimsey (found on PhoenixSong), anything by gryffindormischief, hgfan111 (youll need to find a link, check out the harryand ginny reddit page, or a great series by jenorama. Mostly one shots at first leading up to California Dreamin; and several small stories set after. Healer Ginny, teacher Harry, its a must read!
