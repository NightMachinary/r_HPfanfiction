I like to believe that Harry gets his Dada Mastery, and opens up a few orphanages (12 Grimmauld Place is used as one).

He'd work at the orphanages as equally as possible, have monthly outings with the kids and a junior quidditch league or something. If not a league, then just have pick up quidditch games.

Occasionally, he'd do some contract work for the aurors/ministry.

Or he works with wizarding child services + muggle social workers and he picks up magical kids in bad homes (both magical /muggle).
