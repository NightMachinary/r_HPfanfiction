I think it's bullshit that Ginny gets to play quidditch when Harry was the prodigy (youngest player in a century) & the only way he could lose was if he got knocked out of play somehow.

After all the crap Harry went through in the books, he should have had a chance to enjoy a career instead of spending the rest of his life trying to slowly fix the incredibly corrupt ministry.
