  I think Harry should've created an orphanage. There were probably many children after the war and given that Harry is an Orphan I would think he would use the Potter and Black Fortune to make sure these kids didn't go through what he went through

Orphanages are not good things and I'm surprised how often I see this in the fandom considering the books make that pretty clear. It is very unusual that a child does not have family members to care for them, and if not another family can step in as Foster parents, as the Weasleys did for Harry, as the Potters did for Sirius. Avoiding the harm that institutions like the Orphanage Voldemort grew up in is very important when it comes to protecting children, and it's why orphanages do not exist in countries with established social care systems. I know that Rowling is a curse word in the fandom these days, but it is worth looking up her charity Lumos for more information on this.
