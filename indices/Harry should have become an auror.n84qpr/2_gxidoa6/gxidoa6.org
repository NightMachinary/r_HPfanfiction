Orphanages are bad for children because even though they offer living conditions, they still deprive the kids from the affection so necessary for their development. That's why most of the children from orphanage never properly adjust to adult life and end up with shitty careers best case or criminals/alcoholics/junkies in the worst case.

I think Harry realistically would have moved on from fighting Dark Arts (as he puts in the last chapter he had enough troubles for a lifetime) and would have done something less stressful. I doubt he could settle for a boring life but I'd have imagined him, more than Ron, to join George in the WWW shop especially that he had a few shares in the business.
