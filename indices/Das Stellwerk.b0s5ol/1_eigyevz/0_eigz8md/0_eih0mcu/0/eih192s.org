It would not help the club if people knew who the boss is. And since it's not only England I think it would be possible for them to not know

Also most people do not know the club exist. Slughorn knows of it because he is such a great networker. He knows every one in magical brittan that has achieved something. And one might think that he knows people over the borders.

Also if the whole trio would be invited it would water it down. The idea is Harry gets the invitation also due to some inheritance from his parents. Altho not overly much, quite a modest amount.

As for the time it is when Hermione is in Australia with Ron to get her parents. Why without Harry i am working on

Hermione might get a invitation. Altho to a later achivment and not because of grades. If for that Tom would have been invited as well.

All in all no more than 200 People know of the club. And that is a small number if you over see the somewhat unrealistic and changing implications of numbers of wizards we get from the books and films
