You don't talk about secrets and deals in a place owned by someone you don't know. Certainly not after 2 civil wars in 20 years. You don't even meet in such a place when you're not sure if the owner wants you dead. I don't get why no one would know or care about the owner's identity.

And who decides who's trusted with the secret, aka gets an invitation?

Also, how is the secrecy ensured? Are members expected to lie to their families and sneak out for meetings? Or do they know that mum's in a club, but not which? Either way, the families will know something. And they'll talk to others.

Not to mention I don't get why the club would be a secret in the first place, if nothing embarrassing is done there. It's not a brothel, after all, just a private club. Such clubs are generally not secret like a cabal in the real world. There's no reason to hide it, or its members.
