Why would people trust a club run by someone they don't know? Trust them with their secrets and plans, mayhap their secret desires? "Mysterious Patron, just trust him" is not how smart and powerful people run. Certainly not in a country that had two civil wars in 20 years.

200 people is huge in the Wizarding World, especially if focused on Britain.

If beating Voldemort is not enough to get an invitation for Hermione and Ron, but Quidditch Stars get an invite, then the club's obviously bigoted (or whoever makes the calls - you haven't answered that either - is stupid.)

Even if the secrecy works, Voldemort would have been told by one of his spies, and Dumbledore will have known about it for certain - he would have been a member or the entire club is a farce. And that would have had consequences during the first and second wizarding war.
