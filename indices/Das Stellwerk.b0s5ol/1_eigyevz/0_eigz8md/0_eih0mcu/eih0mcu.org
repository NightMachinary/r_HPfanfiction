I would think the owner of the club is of utmost importance. Given the size of Wizarding Britain (pretty much a small town, not larger), this club pretty much is the heart and head of the country - everyone important will be meeting there. So, who controls who gets invited? Who listens to the deals? Who ensures there's no assassinating done? Who stocks the cellars? The club owner is incredibly powerful in the country. If you run afoul of him or her, you're pretty much finished it seems. So, yes, you should decide who runs it. And what Slughorn's relationship to them is - he's the quintessential networker, after all.

Also, at which time does Slughorn take Harry there? If it's after the war, Hermione and Ron should be with them - the trio pretty much saved the country. If it's during the war, you need to decide how the club reacted to Voldemort. If the club's powerful enough to keep Voldemort at bay and guarantee its neutrality, that's a huge change in the balance of power. If it isn't, what happened to it during Voldemort's reign? If bigotry isn't important, the club's an enemy to Death Eaters merely by not bowing to their bigotry (and, Hermione pretty much would get an invite any way as the brightest student of her generation and a war hero - anyone with a brain can see that she, far more than Harry, is the kind of witch the club is seeking: Smart, passionate, willing to work to change and reform things.)
