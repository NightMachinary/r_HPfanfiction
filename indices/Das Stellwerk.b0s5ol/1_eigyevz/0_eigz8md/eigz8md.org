Well first of all kind of services

Offices that you can work from if you wish, halls that you can dine in, cellars that you can taste sitting by the fire if you get the spin.

I am not sure about the money aspect but I might want to place it as a original set up of money that since here collected money by interest and giving. Owner of the club might be a bit unclear and for the story not important

For the people, it's famous people. A few politicians, some scientist as far as that goes in the wizard world. Some interlectualts. And old money which goes together with buissenes men.

It's all sort of place. For networking, deal making (there are extra rooms for that as it would be against the rules to do that out in the open club since it's neutral ground)

The club ist older than Grindelwald. But it is open not only to the English therefore some German wizard used the club to flee.

The club is for the forward thinking, a hub of new ideas but also mostly intended for people to not feel the attention as on the outside

The club isn't known outside the members and therefore has no storefront. Also it cherry pics all members for the benefit of the club. Therefore bigotry is not relevant
