Well, a couple of questions:

What services does the club offer? That decides what staff is on hand. Are there Escorts/Courtesans or just waiters? Some sort of "Concierge" organising all sorts of things? Is there a cook? Or a sommelier?

How does the club make money? Member dues? Or services? Entrance fees? Food and drinks?

Who owns the club? An individual, or an association? What kind of people are they? Do they use the club like Slughorn merely to socialise and network, and make deals, or is there a more sinister side to it? Information brokering? Or ties to criminals? Strictly "neutral ground", or biased? Did Germans fleeing Grindelwald found refuge at the Club? Or Grindelwald's followers fleeing Europe after his defeat?

What's the club's stance on blood bigotry?

What kind of security does the club have?

There are a number of ideas that wouldn't fit certain takes on the club.
