Honestly, it sounds like a brothel, and I am saying that as a German. I get what implication you are trying to go for, but no club for respectable men would choose that kind of name. First of all, the name is way too short to work as anything but a "nickname". Second of all, I doubt that magical people are really into railroads that much to go for that analogy.

And perhaps most importantly, if you have a story set in Germany you have to come up with some history of magical central Europe and the corresponding border changes since it makes no sense that the magical government would have split up in east and west or even followed any change after the initial reunification under Bismarck. Which might not even have happened since the factors which broke up the HRE (Napoleon, the Reformation) are kinda irrelevant to the magical folk so that should still be around. Likewise, the expulsions from Prussia and Silesia would not have happened to those who had magic.
