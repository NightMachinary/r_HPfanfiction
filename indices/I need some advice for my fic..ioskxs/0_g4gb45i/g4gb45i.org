The excuse for the German wizards to join seems very forced. There was no antisemitism in the middle ages since antisemitism is the hatred of jews due to racial reasons, something only really invented in the 19th century. What you had before was antjudaism, which was based on religion rather than a concept of race (since the Jews were the ones calling for Jesus execution, or at least that's how their narrative goes).

If you want a common ground between the Third Reich and Wizards, go with anti-Bolshevism. Given that the Red Revolution was carried by dissatisfied peasants and workers while even the poorest wizards would be considered class enemies by revolutionary communists and quite a few would still have ties to the old aristocracy, it would be reasonable to presume that the USSR would have modern witch hunts, at least in the early days (howeeffective tthey'd be is a different question , but with authoritarian methods it would be easy to "recruit" Muggleborn into the secret police/NKWD.

So if someone with a deeply anti-soviet agenda like Hitler comes around, that would be appealing for wizards who want to settle a score with the Soviets. This works especially well if Grindelwald has ties to the Baltic and already cooperated with Imperial Germany for their liberation only to have his achievements reversed by Versailles (which cancelled Brest-Litovsk) and then had his home annexed by Stalin early into the war. Or if Grindelwald has ties to Karelia.
