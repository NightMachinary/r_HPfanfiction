In the game I am basing it off of, Germany enslaved the undesirables, which is quite economically advantageous.

Also, Germany won in 1945, just like the Allies in the Second World War.

In the game, or rather a mod for a game, President Roosevelt died of polio, and Bukharin won the Soviet election instead of Stalin, in addition to Grindelwald being a stillbirth(In the fic). Joseph P. Kennedy, an isolationist, becomes President, depriving Britian of the resources it needed to fight the war. Pearl Harbor still happens, and the US declares war on Japan, followed by Germany declaring war on the US. The US tries to fight in Britain, but the Germans defeat them. A similar thing happens with Japan, due to Kennedy's isolationist leanings. The war ends in 1945, with the atomic bombing of Pearl Harbor, the annexation of Hawaii, and the indefinite leasing of the Los Angels and Sanfrancisco ports to Japan. Russia, meanwhile, collapses into warlord states after the invasion, becoming a hellscape in the process.

Germany dominates Europe, with a collaborator government in England(The UK broke up, with Wales and Scotland staying free from German domination), and most of Europe bowing to them. However, Heinrich Himmler attempts a coup against Hitler during the West Russian War, an attempt by the Soviet remnants to reclaim the Westermost portions of Russia, taken by Germany after the war. The coup fails, and Himmler is given a state of his own in Eastern France known as Burgundy. Burgundy eventually becomes the villian of the story, a dystopia worse than Nazi Germany. It is run by the SS, and I can best describe it as if Orwell's Oceania was run by Nazis. It is said that Burgundy contains more labor camps than houses.

One event which will be crucial is the bombing of the International Confederation of Wizards's General Assembly. The German delegates hid several magical bombs in their seats, detonating them after they snuck out for a minute. Every delegate was killed, leaving the Wizarding World without leadership. The Statute was not abolished. There was no one left to give a shit.

In the fic, Tom Riddle fights alongside the British Ministry against the Germans, and is taken to a Labor camp. He escapes, but the experience radicalizes himself and several of his fellow Slytherins against Germany. They form the core of the Death Eaters.
