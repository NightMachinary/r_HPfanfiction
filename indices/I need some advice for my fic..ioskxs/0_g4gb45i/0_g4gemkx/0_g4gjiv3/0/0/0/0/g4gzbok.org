  Remember, Operation Sea Lion was a thing.
#+end_quote

I am German and rather familiar with our braindead plans.

Sea Lion was completely infeasible since most of the "planned" landing craft were unpowered barges. And that's before the Royal Navy destroyed most of them with a nighttime raid carried out by HMS Revenge. And even if they landed a division or 3 in the UK, their only avenue for resupply was across the channel, which meant facing the Royal Navy again and again.

The UK had 15 battleships and battlecruisers, with 5 more building and 1 sunk early on by Submarine. Germany had 0 ready, two being repaired after Norway, 2 under construction, and that's it. 7 Aircraft Carriers vs 0. 66 cruisers vs a dozen. 184 destroyers vs 20, half of which were sunk during the Norway campaign.

  The mod is basically the worst scenario possible.

Short of the UK deciding to scuttle the Royal Navy and melting down the RAF, Germany cannot defeat the UK. Force them to terms maybe if the Battle of the Atlantic is more decisive, but even then it is an honourable peace for Britain rather than some kind of imposed measures scenario that mod came up with.
