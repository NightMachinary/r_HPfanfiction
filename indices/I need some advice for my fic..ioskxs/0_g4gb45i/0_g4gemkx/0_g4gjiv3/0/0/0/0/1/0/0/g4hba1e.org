Kind of, but its more personal. Stalin and Roosevelt were never exactly friends. In this world, however, there is no reason for them to hate each other. Muggles aren't hated by either group, heck I have Bellatrix maryr a young muggle Lieutenant. Seeing their fellow wizards turn against them anihilated any lingering anti-muggle sentiment. Now, its just kill-all-germans, VS. kill-all-nazis.
