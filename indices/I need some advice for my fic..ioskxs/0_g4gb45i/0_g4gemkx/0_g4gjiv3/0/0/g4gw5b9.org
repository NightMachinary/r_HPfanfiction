Food? Oil? Because I don't see the US embargo any of these since, unlike Japan, the UK was not the aggressor in a war where they had execution competitions for fun. And as long as food and oil come in (neither of which has to come from the US), the UK can fight on indefinitely by the sake of having the Royal Navy and Germany having nothing to counter it even after 5 more years of naval building at 1910 levels.

If you want a realistic Germany won scenario, it is Britain accepting a honourable peace in 1940.
