If you go with anti-bolshevism as motivation, that loops back perfectly to the "dare to become hellish to fight hellish evil" question since those who made the Pact with Hitler already answered the question for themselves.

Also, one thing to keep in mind is that the final solution would have looked differently had Germany won. The original plan were large scale deportations out of Europe, not extermination. If Germany won, there would be no Wannensee conference. Although that raises the most important question. How did Germany win? Because the Royal Navy reserve alone would have been enough to prevent any invasion, even if Dunkirk failed completely and Germany somehow won the Battle of Britain.
