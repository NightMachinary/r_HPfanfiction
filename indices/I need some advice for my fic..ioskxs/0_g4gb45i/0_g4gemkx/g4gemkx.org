Grindelwald never existed in this world, although I agree that anti-Bolshevism would be a good reason for the wizards to join the Third Reich. But only German Wizards. BTW, in this fic, the Dark and Light wizards of canon are allies against Germany. They're apart of the Wizarding Resistance, under the larger British Resistance. The Death Eaters are the more radical group. They hate Germans as much as they do muggles in canon. While the Order are more moderate. This is the main moral quandry of the fic. When faced with hellish evil, does one dare become hellish as well to fight it?
