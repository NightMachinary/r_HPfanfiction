Oh, I'd probably read something like this regardless - you just seemed to be wanting some clarification of what that 'militaristic wank' term might mean and how to avoid it.

My only real advice about writing something like this otherwise would be to ask yourself questions. In one fandom, why is something the way it is? How is it different in the other fandom? How could you combine two ideas from the two fandoms? What would A be like if B we were true? That sort of thing. You're writing an alternate history story, essentially, so try look into Turtledove or Harrison or Flint and see what advice they give on this sorta thing.
