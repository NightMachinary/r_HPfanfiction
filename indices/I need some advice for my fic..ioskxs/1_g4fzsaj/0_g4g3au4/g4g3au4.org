Well, I am a huge fan of the old Star Wars Legends novels. That has a lot of military stuff, but also personal aspects, social issues, lots of politics, tons of character development, etc. TNO actually already has a mystery in the form of Burgundy,on of the most evil nations in fiction. They're responsible for most of the trouble in the game, and make the Nazis look like nice guys. There is an unstable coalition between MACUSA and the no-maj Goverment. Unstable not because Wizards dislike no-majs. No, hatred of Japan and Germany overrid that. But because when it comes to the government, they still haven't figured out who does what. The Supreme Court did decide that the MACUSA President and the no-maj President act like the Consuls in Rome, but everything else is still being sorted. But yes, I will add personal aspects. That was kind of why I wanted to write this in the first place.
