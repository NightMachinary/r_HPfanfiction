Militaristic Wank, IIRC, is used a little differently in other fandoms to how the HP fandom uses it. It's usually used for that 'Starship Troopers'-'Halo' level of "Ooh, rah! We're the Marines! The Marines are the greatest thing since sliced bread, and a marine invented that too!" sentiment and usually means you're overly glorifying war and soldiers in an unrealistic way.

At a guess, I'd say alleviating that would be done through not just writing a novel version of a 4X strategy game. Add drama and plot other than just armies charging at one another and various battleground events going down.

A book series called The Lost Fleet by Jack Campbell is a pretty good example of how to do this. While the main thrust of the plot is military battles to win a war, there are plots other than warfare going on. The main character has personal concerns going on (actual genuine personal concerns, not just 'oh no, I'm killing more people'), there's plots and politics, social issues coming up, development of characters, and a background mystery that develops over the course of the series, plus a few others I'm probably forgetting.

But yeah. Think about adding in the smaller stories of war (Anne Frank, Oscar Schindler, Hanns Scharff, Liesel Meminger, Vera Atkins, etc), and some stories that have nothing to do with actual martial battles. Make sure your fic isn't just battle scenes and people talking about and planning for doing more battle scenes while making 'ooh-rah' noises, and you'll probably be alright on that note.
