One question. How do I make well-rounded characters? One of my ideas is for Tom Riddle to be a leader of one of several British Resistance factions under the leadership of a General. His reasons include, witnessing his friends killed by German wizards, and spending several years in a labor camp. But how do I make him a good, well-written character?
