The premise is not necessarily bad. It's certainly not objectively bad like a WBWL fic or bashing fic. The execution of this story will be what matters. Do I think the premise is a bit stretched? Yeah. Do I think good writing, excellent plot, and great worldbuilding could see this story through? Yes as well.

My only cautions about taking inspiration from a video game are that you should be careful transferring any mechanics from said video game and against having muggles be equal to wizards in the new Axis regime.
