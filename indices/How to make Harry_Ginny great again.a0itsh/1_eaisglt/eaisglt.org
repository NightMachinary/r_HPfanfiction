Disclaimer I prefer Harry/Hermione and never liked the Harry/Ginny ship as I felt Ginny was more of a trophy than an actual character. That being said I think there are ways to do the ship better. Here are my suggestions for things that can or should be done.

1. More character building for Ginny I know others in the thread have mentioned canon does build her up somewhat but to me she always felt like a side kick to the main trio instead of a hero in her own right.
2. Make her closer to Harry's equal. Hermione and Harry especially in book three are with each other step by step in the climax. Ron and Ginny lack that and you could do this in several ways. The boring way is to weaken Hermione so she seems less like Harry's equal. But the more interesting way to improve this would be in Book 5 have Ginny be the last DA member left standing outside of Harry. This would set up an interesting dynamic between Hermione and Ginny where Hermione does better in formal classroom settings and duels with rules but Ginny is more effective in a fight.
3. Find a way to bring Ginny along for the Book 7 story arc if the story even remotely follows canon. For example, maybe the Order as part of their efforts to protect Muggleborns sabotage the trace and other forms of magical detection (which would also explain why Voldemort decided to use the Taboo) which would let Ginny use magic without worry.
4. In book 6 skip the Dean/other character romance sub plot and have Harry and Ginny start flirting in book 5 which could led to dating in year 6. This combined with point 3 would avoid the end of year 6 breakup and potion problems. And would give them some more things in common.
