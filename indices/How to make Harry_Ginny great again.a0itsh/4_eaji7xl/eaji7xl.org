Canon Harry and Ginny is awful, but there's a lot of potential in it if it's written well. Most of that depends on the development of Ginny. In an HBP/DH rewrite I've been working on, she has a bigger role (for example, when the trio need to spy on Malfoy, she provides a distraction, and from thereon they start including her in things). Later on, during "DH", she never returns to school and instead "helps" at the twins' shop.

The whole Dean saga is completely pointless, too. In my story, Ginny is never with Dean. Harry and Ginny see Michael and Cho together, make a few jokes about it, etc., etc. There is absolutely no "chest monster" or room for a love potion theory.

Really, the key is to actually /see/ Harry and Ginny interacting. HBP fails at this. The few scenes we /do/ see them together, Ginny is being a b*. That doesn't exactly make the pairing endearing.
