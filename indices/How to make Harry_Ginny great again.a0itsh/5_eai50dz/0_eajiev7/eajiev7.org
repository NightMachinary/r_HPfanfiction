Have you ever read [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2004/10/28/dyou-really-think-theyre-suited-why-hermione-is-not-the-right-girl-for-harry/][this]] essay about H/Hr? It's thoroughly referenced and makes a lot of points that I found convincing. Executive summary: Harry thoroughly respects Hermione and needs her help and friendship, but she fills a motherly role rather than a romantic one, and that's unlikely to change.
