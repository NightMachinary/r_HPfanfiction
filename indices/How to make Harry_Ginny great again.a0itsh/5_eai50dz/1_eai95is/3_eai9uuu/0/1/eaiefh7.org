  Bellatrix Black

That's her birth name, don't you know that?

Considering how her sisters had turned out, I highly doubt Bellatrix was born an evil insane psychopath. [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/andromeda-narcissa-and-bellatrix-a-tale-of-three-sisters][Pottermore article about the Black sisters]] sort of confirmed my doubt.

In fact, Ginny seemed to have a lot in common with Bellatrix:

- Completely loyal to her love

- Absolutely devoted to her cause

- Reasonably intelligent

- Magically powerful

- Easily angered

- Prone to aggression and violence

Voldemort, in his earlier times, was charismatic, convincing, persuasive, and handsome. What Voldemort preached was also in line with Bellatrix' family ideology, so she was probably groomed to fangirl him (just like Ginny was brought up to 'like' Harry). As a result, she chose Voldemort as her love, and she became a monster herself.

Of course, they had some major differences too. For example, it's Ginny's Weasley temper vs the Black mental instability. Ginny also seems to have significant leadership skills, as her actions in Year 7 showed.
