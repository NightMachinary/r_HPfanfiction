Technically you're correct that its her birth name, but she is always referred to as Bellatrix Lestrange, especially in canon. So why did you randomly refer to her as Bellatrix Black? Genuinely wondering?

Also, your list of traits could easily pertain to Hermione or Neville or countless others. The comparison with Ginny falls especially flat because of that, the fact that unlike Bellatrix, Ginny can criticize and make fun of Harry to his face, and she is not in anyway insane or lacking of empathy or traits that make someone a good person.
