Both Hermione and Ginny exhibited significant level of aggressiveness, cruelty, ruthlessness, and vindictiveness in the Books.

The difference however lies in that Hermione had her own (political) agenda and was really the mastermind type, while Ginny was a follower type who fought fanatically for her hero.

They are both dangerous though.
