No, her loyalty lies firmly with Harry. But if the circumstances would force her (eg the war lasts longer), she might as well become the "light-side" equivalent of Bellatrix. They share the ruthless streak and are quick to resort to violence (Hermione torched Snape on a suspicion, decked Malfoy for being a little shit and so on). Hermione would draw the line at innocents, but her definition might be a little narrow (people working for the Ministry under Voldemort are guilty and therefore valid targets). It would also be easy for her to turn Harry on a darker path through emotional blackmail (eg "Do I have to die before you will fight them for real?").
