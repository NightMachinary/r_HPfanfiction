lol. The idea of Hermione in this situation must be popular.You know, in a fic I read, she did exactly that-stormed off and was ready to sleep in a hotel. But later she decided to ignore this rule on the night before they had to leave. After reading that I was a bit confused, since I don't think she would ignore her parents rules even if she didn't like what they said. She definitely breaks the rules, that's true, but after reading this I thought,so where's Hermione's obedient side?' Do you think she'd ignore the rule and do as she wanted in this case?
