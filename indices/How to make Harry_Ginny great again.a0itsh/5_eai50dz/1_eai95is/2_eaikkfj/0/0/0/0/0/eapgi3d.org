It really depends on the surrounding circumstances. I'm going with a sixth year Christmas scenario, so the Hotel scenario is not an option. After the war it depends on the relationship between her and her parents. And then she also would try to keep peace with them at all costs, so not going behind their back. Or don't give a fuck if their relationship is beyond salvation.

I guess it also depends on who the boyfriend is. Harry would probably get a warm welcome, as would someone like Justin Finch Fletchley. Ron would be tricky, Malfoy would be instant disinheritment for Hermione.
