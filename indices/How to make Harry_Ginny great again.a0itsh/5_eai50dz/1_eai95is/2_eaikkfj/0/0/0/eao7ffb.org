Funny you mention Hermione bringing home a boyfriend, I had that in a WIP literally just yesterday.

Honestly, I cannot see the mother actually minding as long as it is someone she knows (eg Harry). Not so sure about Ron since Ron and Hermione did not get along for most of Hogwarts and Hermione would mention that in letters (especially 3rd/4th year). And Parents tend to have long memories.

That being said, I imagine Hermione would try to argue that separating them would be pointless since they are intimate either way. Maybe point out that it would be less safe to have sex in some back alley than her bed (infections, messing up the protection, technically illegal). She would however not throw a tantrum or storm off.
