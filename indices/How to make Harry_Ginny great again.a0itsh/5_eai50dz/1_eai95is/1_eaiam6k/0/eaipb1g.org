  even if her and Dean lasted longer it would not have prevented her and Harry getting together

What if they lasted until the last match of the season and then Harry does not have the balls to randomly kiss her? What if some other girl threw herself at Harry and he forgot about his crush when Padma Patil or Katie Bell had him in her throat? Harry, at that point, had an infatuation, a crush. Those can die pretty quickly.

Or suppose Romilda succeeds with one of her plots and rapes Harry. I doubt he would be eager to get together with Ginny immediately afterwards (he might even pull a Mr Weasley, consent to his rape afterwards and enjoy the resulting relationship because he just needed a "nudge").
