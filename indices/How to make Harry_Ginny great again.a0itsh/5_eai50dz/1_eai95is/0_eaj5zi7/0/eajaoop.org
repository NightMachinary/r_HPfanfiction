Umbridge was the worst of the worst. She tortured children entrusted in her care (which is even below Voldemort/Lestrange). And, as later proven, she happily organised a genocide. She was at her happiest when she sentenced those she perceived beneath her to concentration camps. There is no punishment cruel enough for her. And since the Ministry actually covered her arse, I'll take what I can get, be that rape by mythological creatures infamous for that or squashed by a giant (which was Hermione's original plan). I would not object to "being torn apart by giant spiders" either.
