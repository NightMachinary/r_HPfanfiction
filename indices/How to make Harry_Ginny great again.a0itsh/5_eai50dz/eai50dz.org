I think to make Harry/Ginny great again, we should edit the movies so Hermione doesn't come off as the main love interest for Harry. There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/9zga7v/harry_potter_spoilers_ron_weasley_used_the/?st=joyeo9od&sh=1cce0f4f][this thread]] in [[/r/fantheories][r/fantheories]] the other day that outright says that they don't take the books into account while stating a theory that Ron Imperiused Hermione into falling in love with him, and that Hermione was romantically interested in Harry. What the fuck? Tent dance was not a book thing, Ron was not a moron, Harry was not some kind of magic whiz, and Hermione was never a love interest in the books.

Additionally, there is an alarming amount of fanfiction portraying Hermione as this perfect goddess with perfumed farts, which incidentally demonizes the Weasleys. If those were to suddenly go up in flames, all of them, I suspect that Harry/Ginny would be much more popular.

I would like to end this by saying that I am not against Harry/Hermione. I am against Harry/Hermione that is one-dimensional and would be a sorry sight to behold in a pulp magazine. I am against Harry/Hermione that comes at the expense of other characters. I am against the bullshit trope that is bashing. That's my take on the thing, for what it's worth.

Oh yeah, and I don't consider the movies canon, just so you know.

Edit: What are you talking about when you say potion? Where is that ever even stated in the books?
