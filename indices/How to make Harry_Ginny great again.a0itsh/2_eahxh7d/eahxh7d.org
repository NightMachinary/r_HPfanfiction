When is it reignited before Fred's body is cold? We have no idea how soon they picked things up after DH, their reunion is not in the books.

Also, all my teenage relationships came out of nowhere. I snogged my first serious boyfriend in the bus park of my school after a little group of us broke in (in something I now find cringey rather than rebellious), and I had only known him very vaguely prior to that. We then dated for two years. In that respect, almost a year of fancying Ginny seems like a reasonable build up, though Rowling could have done far better.

Personally I would have established more one on one scenes far earlier in canon, even if they aren't necessarily romantic. I love the chocolate in the library scene in ootp, for example, and we could have seen more of that sort of thing.
