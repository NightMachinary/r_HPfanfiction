At no point I had the impression that Harry had an actual interest in Ginny. If you are writing about teenagers, the monster urging him to do things would be in his pants, not his chest. And I'm not asking for explicit details on Harry's wanking fantasies, but some sort of actual interest would not be out of place.

Then again, Rowling had some odd ideas about romance (James obsession, the whole Tonks/Lupin thing).

I agree with the non romantic scenes. Where was Ginny during the tournament? With Ron (temporarily) out of the picture, that was the golden opportunity for Ginny to actually befriend Harry. Or have Harry play some Quidditch with Ginny in OotP after he had been banned from the house team (borrow Ron's broom or take one from the school ones). Have Ginny advise Harry about Cho or talk to him after that ended.
