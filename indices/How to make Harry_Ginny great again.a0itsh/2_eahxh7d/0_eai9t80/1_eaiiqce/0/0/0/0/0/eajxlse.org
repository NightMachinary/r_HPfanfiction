That's not what they said. Look:

  I'm not asking for explicit details on Harry's wanking fantasies, but some sort of actual interest would not be out of place.
#+end_quote

Clearly asking for more beyond "Would you fuck them?"

And no, it comes out of nowhere. Where is the interest in the previous five books? At best Harry is perplexed or doesn't pay it any mind (even in OoTP, just one book prior). I have no idea if they'd work well together because Ginny's characterization is everywhere. OoTP injects her with new traits not previously mentioned or shown (I challenge you to show me where in books 1 - 4 where she is or is said to be spunky, assertive, "in" with the Trio or good at Quidditch).

Much like Harry's interest, these just show up out of the blue and even then some of them are contradicted later so I can't really understand what she's supposed to be like.
