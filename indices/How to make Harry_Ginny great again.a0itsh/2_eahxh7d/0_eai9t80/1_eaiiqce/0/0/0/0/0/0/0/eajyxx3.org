Read the end of what you just quoted:

  And I'm not asking for explicit details on Harry's wanking fantasies, but some sort of actual interest would not be out of place.

"Actual interest", as in beyond wanting to fuck. The mention of sexual interest is, in your very quote, just a correction about the silly "monster in his chest" description.

So in HBP, exactly as I said.

  It makes sense we actually start seeing Ginny's personality in Book 5 since this is truly the moment where she has fully grown comfortable around him and sees him as a friend. I would argue you do see a bit of Ginny's actual personality in book 4 when she makes fun of Ron and Harry for their failures getting dates
#+end_quote

The book 4 example is, I think, so trivial that calling it her actual personality showing through is silly. And saying it makes sense that her personality is finally (abruptly, more like it) revealed is exactly my point. Try this: why did she suddenly feel comfortable around him? What led to this? They spoke one time in GoF (the instance you mention; maybe a bit at or before the World Cup too. Was just a greeting, I think). That's it. Why did we only then get told anything about what she's like? A Quidditch wiz? No one mentions it? Spunky and stubborn, but no hints of it?

This is what I mean when I say it's just random. For its many many flaws as a ship, Ron and Hermione are very clearly hinted to be romantic interests from book 1, and Ron is hardly a developed character himself. But for Ginny we don't get really anything developed, it basically just happens because. A great chance would have been to drive home the whole possession thing as something they shared, but that got one mention in the whole series, and even then only after Hermione breaks him out of his isolation.

Honestly, I'd probably find the ship more interesting if it actually had the subtlety you mention. Bit by bit, building up something between them in the background. But it never really happens that way.
