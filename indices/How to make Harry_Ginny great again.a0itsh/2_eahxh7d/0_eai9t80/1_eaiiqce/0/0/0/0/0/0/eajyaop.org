  At no point I had the impression that Harry had an actual interest in Ginny. If you are writing about teenagers, the monster urging him to do things would be in his pants, not his chest. And I'm not asking for explicit details on Harry's wanking fantasies, but some sort of actual interest would not be out of place.

He complains that he never got the impression that Harry had an interest in Ginny and then immediately says that said interest should be shown through sexual interest, to which I gave him an example.

It comes out of nowhere if you aren't reading the subtext, which is rife with Ginny being good for Harry. Now Harry's overt interest does appear suddenly in Book 6, but supporters of the ship argue this is fairly realistic. His interest in her romantically comes from finally spending actual time wither her the summer before his 6th year. Harry's 5th year we see Ginny actually become someone he can be friends with, which really is the true beginning of seeing her not as the shy little sister with a crush on him but an actual person. But he is still hung up on Cho so he doesn't really give Ginny that sort of notice. Once he's moved on from Cho, and spends time with Ginny, he finally starts realizing he is into her. Seeing her kiss Dean fully makes him realize she is a sexual being and he figures out what his feelings are.

It makes sense we actually start seeing Ginny's personality in Book 5 since this is truly the moment where she has fully grown comfortable around him and sees him as a friend. I would argue you do see a bit of Ginny's actual personality in book 4 when she makes fun of Ron and Harry for their failures getting dates.

In books 1-4 we don't exactly see the true Ginny, but it is deliberate. Rowling wants to have Ginny grow. I agree we should've seen it more on the pages. I'm with you there. But Ginny being different from book 1 to book 5 is deliberate. You're supposed to think Ginny in book 5 is different than Ginny in books 1-3.

I don't really agree that her personality changes much from book 5 to 6. I'm not saying you are arguing this but it's a common complaint. We just get a bit more of her personality. They work well together because we see them work well together. They share a sense of humor, which we do see. They are comfortable with each other, which we do see. Harry doesn't shy away from her touch, which we do see. She can give Harry the business when its needed, but has his back when needed. We see this.

Again, though, I do agree the overall romance could have been written much better and given much more page time. We probably don't actually disagree too much on the failures of Rowling in this way.
