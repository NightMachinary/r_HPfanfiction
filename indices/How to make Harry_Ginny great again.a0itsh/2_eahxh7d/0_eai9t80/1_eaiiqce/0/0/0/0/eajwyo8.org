If that was literally it then I'd agree. But obviously there was more than just that. The OP mentioned that because there was not also a sexual instance of Harry being into her that the overall story was lacking, so I pointed out that in addition to everything else that showed Harry's growing feelings for her, there was the thing he felt was missing.

I'll agree that the romantic subplot could've have been way more fleshed out. But it's not as "out of nowhere" as people like to argue and it does not detract from the fact that the two do work well together.
