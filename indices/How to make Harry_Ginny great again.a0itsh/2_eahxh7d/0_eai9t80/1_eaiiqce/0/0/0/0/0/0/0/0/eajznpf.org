You can't just separate out the quote to suit your needs. I stand by my interpretation; if he wants to say its not what he meant, ok. But that's clearly how it comes across. But this is probably a dumb thing to argue over.

Honestly, I'm fine with it. I would have liked to get more Ginny in book 4, but we got it in book 5. Oh well, good enough for me to understand her character but I can understand your issue. But I assume you have the same issue with Luna, right?

I don't really need to have Harry show his growing feelings for Ginny from book 1 onward. One could argue Ginny takes care of that from her end. For me, I was just happy Harry found someone to make his life a little better, and the Ginny we learned about in book 5 and 6 was really great for him.

But I agree that it could've been done so much better. The chamber stuff could've been a great way to make it better.

Ironically, I think all the lack of fleshing out makes them a better couple to ship since fans of the ship can fill in the holes, which is fun.
