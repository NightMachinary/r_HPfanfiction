There were a few scenes sorta like this, like Harry imagining Ginny weeping over his injured body after he gets knocked out from Quidditch, and when he is about to die he definitely has those thoughts, plus the staring at the dot scenes.

But during HBP, I also do wish we got more. I don't disagree with you there. But I argue that is different than what you originally argued, that there was no hint of interest from him. There absolutely was and probably enough to get the message across.

I wish we got a good convo between them while they were officially together. Something about everything that came before that led them to finally being together. One of my favorite types of fanfics are the one-shots that show their conversation after the kiss. I also enjoyed one where Ginny absolutely knew the break up was coming and just kept pushing it off. I think canon scenes like that would've done wonders for the portrayal.
