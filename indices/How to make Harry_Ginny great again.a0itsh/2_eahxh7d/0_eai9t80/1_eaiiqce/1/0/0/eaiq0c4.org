  Did you want every 10 pages to include a reference to how Ginny gave him a hard-on?

No, but something more than "he had an inappropriate dream" and "she looks pretty". Maybe Harry thinks about what dating Ginny would be like. Throw in some fantasy date of his, or maybe the thought of them imitating Ron and Lavender. Use a proper description, and not the "monster in his chest". Give the relationship more screen time than a few lines about spending time together. Show a date or something simiar.
