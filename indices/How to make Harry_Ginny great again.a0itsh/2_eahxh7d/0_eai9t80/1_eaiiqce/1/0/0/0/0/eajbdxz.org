  But I argue that is different than what you originally argued

Not really. I mean, let's be honest here, there are plenty of attractive people around, but the difference between simply noticing "oh, she is hot/pretty/whatever" and an actual interest is what kind of thoughts you have and what you do with them. What Harry did in canon was pretty much in line with "well, nice, but also unavailable. I wonder what she looks like naked". But I guarantee you that he had the same thoughts about pretty much every other girl, from Hermione and Lavender to Demelza Robins and Ginny's dormmates. Any guy who says that he has not imagined every woman (aged 16-40) he knows naked or thought about having sex with her lies (or is gay).

And sure, there is some interest in Ginny, but not enough to fall in the serious interest category. I mean, in at least half the "jealousy" moments you cannot tell what exactly he is jealous of. Dean for having Ginny, Dean for having a girlfriend in general, his lack of girlfriend, lamenting his previous shitty experiences with Cho, (Ginny for having Dean). "Monster in his chest" is not really a precise description. Nothing which indicates "that's the one" at any rate.
