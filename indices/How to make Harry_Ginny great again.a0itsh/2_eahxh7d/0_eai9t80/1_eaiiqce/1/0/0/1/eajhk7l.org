  No, but something more than "he had an inappropriate dream" and "she looks pretty".

It seems to me that that kind of attraction is the key difference between friendship and romance, so if you want more depth, then likely what you're looking for is evidence of friendship. And there certainly is that, though really only from partway through book 5 onward, and even then I could wish for more. They spend time together (eg in the DA), he respects her abilities, and her personality seems like a good fit for his. So the skeleton is there, it's just a bit underfed and neglected.
