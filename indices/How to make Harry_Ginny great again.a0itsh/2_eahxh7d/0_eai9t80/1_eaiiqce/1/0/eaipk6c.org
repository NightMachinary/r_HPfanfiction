Except there were countless references to his feelings for Ginny in HBP, but you demanded a specific sexual reference, and felt the lack of one meant he had no romantic interest in her. I gave you the specific example, which when combined with all the other references to his feelings for her, prove that he did have a romantic interest. Did you want every 10 pages to include a reference to how Ginny gave him a hard-on?
