You don't need to tell me Rowling us bad at romance, I have freely admitted it several times. It's something she's still bad at in her Strike novels. I definitely read the interest Harry had in Ginny, despite its clumsiness. My point is, if you looked at my first relationship that would have come out of nowhere too. There was no build up or attraction, it was a spur of the moment thing. I think a lot of relationships are like that.
