  My point is, if you looked at my first relationship that would have come out of nowhere too. There was no build up or attraction, it was a spur of the moment thing. I think a lot of relationships are like that.

I think you're really missing the point. Their point was that the relationship was done pretty badly. Your (correct) response was that their friendship was too. But I think the relevant response would be to do their friendship better from the get go, which is why [[/u/Hellstrike]] suggested they bond when Ron leaves during GoF.

Really, the problem is it's difficult, if not impossible, to believe JKR had the relationship planned from the beginning like she said. Ginny's characterization on OoTP is often liked by her fans, but objectively it introduced many things that weren't hinted at previously or shown. Suddenly she's a Quidditch all-star (she always was, apparently, just no one bothered to mention it), she's suddenly "in" with the Trio, a bit spunky (which felt jarring after the little established character she'd had in GoF and prior) and is very attractive.

Like this isn't really a critique of a ship, but a problem of character foundation. Like there's literally nothing there, then a dump of random character traits, then a relationship from sudden interest on Harry's part. Like had the other stuff been built up bit by bit in the first four books, I could read OoTP and be like "Ah yes, this is Ginny alright" and then the HBP would have some grounding here. But it's just a fact that it didn't, and HBP even has her contradict her previous characterization by immediately caving to Harry wanting to break things off. So there seems to be plenty of room to do better in a fanfic, even if it wouldn't be of interest to me to read it.

But the real life comparison doesn't seem to make sense to bring up. People often at least pay lip service to the idea that good friends can make great partners. And in this case, it's not like Ginny was introduced in HBP, she existed even in Book one. She's just all over the place and so it feels odd to me.
