Ginny is provoked into several confrontations, which she is justified in feeling a need to respond to, but the mature thing would be to walk away or handle it differently.

For example, Ginny is justified in not liking how Fleur treats her. But her response, to mock her behind her back and call her Phlegm, is an immature way to respond. She is only 15 so its not like this is some huge character flaw of hers, but there it is.

Also, when she wants to stay for the order meeting in OOTP but her mom forces her upstairs, she stomps up the stairs, throwing a fit. Again, I get her frustration and it makes sense since she is only 13, but it's there.

All that said, she can also show incredible maturity at times, such as her acceptance of the break up because Harry needed her to be strong.
