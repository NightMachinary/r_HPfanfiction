Alright a lot to unpack here. Basically, I think you're overall wrong about the way the relationship was handled, yet there is some truth to a lot of what you said. Let's start with specifically what you said:

- Harry's attraction came out of the blue - in fact the attraction was built up throughout the entire series. Harry is always describing Ginny in flattering ways, and always seems to be aware of her presence. But he does seem oblivious to his own feelings for most of the series. But the point of his sudden feelings is that he finally spends time with Ginny. Harry was into Cho purely for her looks, so the way he falls for Ginny is meant to show maturity. He falls for her not just because she is beautiful, but because as he spends a lot of time with her, he realizes how great they are together. Harry spends significant time with Ginny over the summer, and then once he sees her kissing Dean he realizes exactly what he's feeling and there ya go. It really is realistic for a teenager to develop feelings in this way, especially considering that Harry saw Ginny in a specific way for most of the books while also being hung up on Cho (Harry also tends to be singularly focused so as long as he was into Cho, he wouldn't be noticing other girls). Also the relationship didn't come out of nowhere if you consider Ginny's POV, which Rowling clearly shows.\\

I do understand the frustration as a reader though. We are conditioned to see the main romantic relationship\\
between the hero and the love interest written a certain way, and Rowling did not do this, preferring the very\\
subtle build before whacking you in the face. To fix this, I'd have Ginny just date Corner or Dean, and have her and\\
Harry grow closer and him notice his feelings for her in OOTP, then get them together midway through HBP or\\
earlier, not push it off till the very end.

- They don't have common interests outside of Quidditch and Voldemort- This is not true. They also share a sense of humor, which is HUGELY important to their compatibility. They share a sense of morals, family, and loyalty. Both are fighters who hate being kept in the dark and out of the fight. They both like pranks. They both have similar friends and treat those some might consider their lessors as equals. Truth is in terms of hobbies, Rowling doesn't give us much of anything to go on with any characters. There is Quidditch, maybe gobstones, and studying.
- Ginny lacks characterization - Everyone says this but we actually learn a great deal about Ginny's character. She is brave, fiercely loyal, has a bad temper when provoked, craves independence and being seen as an adult yet can be quite immature, understands Harry in a way no one else does, has a wicked sense of humor, enjoys picking on Ron but stands up for others who are picked on, is amazing at Quidditch, can be prone to jealousy, hates to be treated like a damsel by boys, yet will allow Harry to protect her, fought Riddle on her own and handled the aftermath virtually alone, still bares the scars from that experience and is quick to remind Harry of it, can become vicious when defending herself, and attacks others where they are most insecure in fights. She has a dynamic story arc, which is overcoming her shyness to become the equal Harry needs, and overcoming a traumatic childhood event to become incredibly strong.

But I wish we did see more of all that, and I specifically wish we got a better conclusion to her various story arcs.

- He used a potion to break them up -clearly they were heading there and maybe Harry sped it up by a couple days.
- the staged break up makes no sense - agreed based on the idea of protecting her. But the subtext to that scene is Harry didn't think he would survive and didn't want her waiting for a dead man. He wanted her to move on and be with someone who deserved her, because after years of abuse Harry still doesn't think he deserves happiness. And the scene is doubly ironic and sad because despite Harry's desire, Ginny would not ever move on from him and she feels he does deserve happiness. So the break up is futile on that front, but in a more meaningful and poignant way.
- Fred's cold body - I'm sure Fred would be the first person to tell them not to waste time and get back together already. They just survived a war. They can get back together while also mourning Fred. Those two things are not mutually exclusive.

With Harry and Ginny, there were things Rowling needed to accomplish and things that would have been nice to have added. Rowling needed the reader to see Harry and Ginny as well-suited for each other and she definitely accomplished that. Whether or not you feel the build up to them getting together was handled correctly, it's tough to deny they work well together. But since Rowling was focused on the trio's friendship and the overall Voldemort plot, things like Harry's love life got pushed aside to a point. We are not really used to that in fiction.

If it were me, I'd include a couple more scenes of Harry and Ginny interacting one on one prior to them getting together. I would have actually shown a scene like that in the summer after Sirius died. I think they needed one real heart to heart that wasn't about something else, but actually subtly about them. I would've liked a scene where Ginny kinda hints she is into him and maybe he hasn't lost his chance, or at least something that better explains why she dated Dean for so long. I think that never made sense based on Ginny's character (she is a strong woman who clearly wasn't too into Dean, so why date him even when the relationship was dying by Christmas) but clearly Rowling did it for plot purposes, just to not have her and Harry together for that long.

I think Ginny was handled poorly in Deathly Hallows. She needed to play a larger role in the final battle, since she was touched by Voldemort but never got her vengeance for it. She should've destroyed a Horcrux, instead her big story was being kept out of the battle by her parents and having a row with them, then needing to be saved by her mom, thereby proving her wrong and everyone else right that she needed to be protected. And of course, we get no reunion scene between Harry and Ginny, even though she was his last thought before dying.

I would have LOVED for Ginny to get more page time, to show more scenes with them both before, during and after their relationship. But the writing /was/ effective at showing the two are meant to be together and it made me invested in their success. Harry/Ginny has always been great, we just needed to see a bit more of it.
