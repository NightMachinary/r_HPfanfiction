I'd sprinkle a few more scenes of her before Harry thinks, "She hot. Me like," which is basically all we get out of their relationship in HBP. Great for a teenage infatuation, but it wouldn't last for the long term. (And to all the others knocking on OP, he's right: Felix Felicis means "all your endeavors succeed." Ginny and Dean would've broken up eventually, but it would've happened at a later point when Harry might've lost interest in her already.)

The best divergence would be to have Arthur die in OotP. Ginny has no concept of loss. This sounds callous, but she lost /one/ brother out of six of them, and a twin at that. It's very different to lose a parent. She also might be able to understand Harry better, that's he's fighting Voldemort because he doesn't want this to happen to other people, instead of thinking he actually /wants/ to hunt down Voldemort.
