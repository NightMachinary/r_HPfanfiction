Never read this fic, nor have I seen it recomended much. I'm not a huge fan of H/G, but I don't have many issues with it, mostly because I find both movie and book romance between the two horrible, and I dislike the the fact that Ginny is so easily incensed and prone to violence, as if that resolves any sort of issue. Also, when writters go on about her Bat Bogey just cringes the fuck out me, like, it funny once, but later, as people use it as if its a baby AK, just annoys me.

I'm in a massive drought of fics, so seeing as this is TT and 400k+ words, it sparkled my interest, but could you tell me if this is close to completion or in which book this is. Is it canon rehash with one or 2 diveregences that don't actually diverge shit (see Potter and Black series or Black Bond) and just go through the book written differently ?
