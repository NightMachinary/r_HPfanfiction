Nightmares of Futures Past holds the distinction of being the most favorited HP story on ff.net, and I consider it my #1 favorite on-hiatus fic. It's "Harry lives through an awful future where everyone else dies and everywhere is destroyed, and he comes back determined to avert it and save the people he loves." So, plenty of divergence, but never at random; things change because Harry changed something. Although the ripple effects quickly get away from him...

Criticism of it generally centers around the fact that it's relatively old, and unfinished. However, even most critics will agree that the author does very good characterisation, and a great job of balancing foreknowledge vs Butterfly of Doom. TVTropes refers to it as an example of Peggy Sue done right.

It's currently near the start of fourth year, although it's not at all certain that it will take the full seven years to finish. Last updated three years ago, but the author continues to assure that it isn't abandoned, and just in the past few weeks, his progress meter for the next chapter has moved up to 94%. He's recuperating from serious health trouble.
