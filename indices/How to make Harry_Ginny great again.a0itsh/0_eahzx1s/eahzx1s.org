I think my favorite Ginny depiction is from linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) - but that's based on Harry having future knowledge, and they're not (as of the start of fourth year) actually dating, because that's ethically problematic. But I really like how the story fleshes her out as a character.

Anyway, although actual shipping would need to be driven by some other motivation than time travel, I still think that a key part is to start building up their friendship sooner. Harry might not have a very wide circle of friends, but he does come into frequent contact with Weasleys - yet he sees a lot more of Ron's older brothers than his little sister. Just do something to get them holding proper conversations earlier than fifth year. It really shouldn't take much more than that, honestly. She's a Weasley through and through, and Harry loves being around Weasleys.

Maybe have him show more concern after her Chamber of Secrets ordeal, and take the time to follow up and ensure she's properly recovering, thus breaking the ice and getting them properly talking to each other in his third year. Maybe something could prod Ginny to pluck up her courage and approach him about something; she might want tips on trying out for the Quidditch team, or to get to know Hedwig better. Or like NoFP you could have Harry end up living with the Weasleys, through whatever combination of circumstances, and thus put them together enough to overcome Ginny's shyness.

Harry/Ginny makes loads of sense in theory, it's just that canon Ginny is hardly present in the story. Bring her in, and Harry will fall for her easily.
