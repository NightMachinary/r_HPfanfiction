Naw not really, I think Harry would have still gotten with her either way. Just maybe later that he did. Dean was not going to stop that. I think Jo drug out their relationship too long as it is. It was quite clear Ginny lost interest in Dean long before that time. Even if they did last longer and Harry didn't get with her, doesn't mean she would have stayed with Dean. Her and Harry could have started dating in DH. Or like sometimes in real life later than that, if her and Harry are meant to be they would end up together anyways. Whether or not her and Harry ended up together, her and Dean wouldn't have last much longer and she would eventually end up with someone else, whether Harry or another person in general.
