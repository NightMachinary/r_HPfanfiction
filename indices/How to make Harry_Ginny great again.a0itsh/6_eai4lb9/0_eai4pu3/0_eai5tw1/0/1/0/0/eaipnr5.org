  Even if they did last longer and Harry didn't get with her, doesn't mean she would have stayed with Dean

Obviously. But what if one of Harry's fangirls threw herself at him and when his cock was in her, he realised that perhaps this was not at all a bad idea? Or Romilda raped him? Or what if Lavender decided to get back at Ron by seducing Harry? (see example 1 to where this might go).

#+begin_quote
  Whether or not her and Harry ended up together, her and Dean wouldn't have last much longer and she would eventually end up with someone else, whether Harry or another person in general.
#+end_quote

Never doubted that. I just poited out that without the potion, they might not get together in the canon way.

But a relationship with Harry is not guaranteed either.
