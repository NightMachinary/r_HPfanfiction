Talk about making some unfair assumptions.

First off, Harry didn't intentionally do anything. He bumped into Ginny on accident, and the rest is history. Who cares if Dean actually didn't bump her as she thought. Two people in a good relationship don't let a misunderstanding end a relationship.

Seriously, honest question: Do you think if Ginny didn't get bumped, she would still be with Dean, or that they would've dated for many more months at least?

Regarding my assumptions, it's actually totally fair to make logic and evidence-based assumptions and then base an argument off of it. That's kind of how this all works.

No, please explain. Because nothing I said was wrong. Clearly, Dean did have a habit of trying to "help" Ginny which she didn't appreciate. Ginny and Dean did fight a lot. The fight that was caused by the bump was clearly not the first time they had had this type of fight, or fight in general.

I want to be clear so as to make any unfair assumptions. Do you believe Ginny and Dean had, up until that point, a good relationship that wasn't in danger of ending?

I don't care if you don't care about her intent. It still must be considered. And you again have to ask yourself, does Rowling really want us to believe that Harry and Ginny only got together because of a potion, and that if that never occurred, she would have still been with Dean?

Finally, I think we need to also consider the fact that magic is simply part of the world and thus if magic is involved in the coupling of Harry and Ginny, well that doesn't de-legitimize the relationship. I was very lucky to meet my wife, and it was the result of a series of lucky events. Maybe Ginny and Harry did get together in part because of some magical luck, but so what?
