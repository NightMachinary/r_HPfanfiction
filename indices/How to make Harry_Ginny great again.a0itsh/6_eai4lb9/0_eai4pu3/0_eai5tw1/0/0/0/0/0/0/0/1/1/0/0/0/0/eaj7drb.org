Then you completely missed my point with that argument.

The argument Dean and Ginny had was one they had many times. This was nothing new for them, something Ginny clearly hated, yet Dean had done before again and again. So it's not like saying the potion made the two act differently or put an otherwise great relationship in peril. Put another way, if it wasn't Harry bumping into Ginny, it would have been something else Dean did to annoy her. So to put their breakup solely on the potion ignores the entire context of their relationship and gives it way too much power.

Also, while yes we do not know exactly how Felix works, it is fairly logical to surmise is that since Harry was the only one who took it, the potion cannot actually affect other people. It's not like Harry takes the potion and suddenly Ginny's mind is under his control. No magic, be it a spell or a potion, has been shown to act that way. So yes, Harry bumps into Ginny likely because Felix set him on a course that would allow for lucky happenstance to occur. But her reaction was not influenced by the potion in such a way that she was acting out of character.

Also, surely you can agree that Ginny would not have dumped Dean if his only transgression was being chivalrous a couple of times.

Is that the fundamental disagreement we have here? That you think the potion can control the thoughts and actions of those who did not take it? Because if that was the case, I could see your point. But I really don't think it works like that. In all honesty, I think all it does is convince Harry to take a right instead of a left, which leads to a series of fortunate events for him.
