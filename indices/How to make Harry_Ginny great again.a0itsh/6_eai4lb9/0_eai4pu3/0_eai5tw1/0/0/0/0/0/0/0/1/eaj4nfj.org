I feel like you're missing my point. It doesn't matter if Harry intended to break them up before he took the potion. It doesn't matter if they would have stayed together or not. It doesn't matter if they were fighting. It doesn't matter if their relationship was dysfunctional. It was influenced without their knowledge by a third party who then took advantage without ever revealing the lie.
