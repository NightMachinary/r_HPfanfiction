I think you're right about our fundamental disagreement, and having looked back at the text it's less clear than I remembered. Ginny says, “everything seemed to just miss us,” after the attack at the end of HBP, which is plausible with the potion only affecting those who took it (I interpreted it as the Death Eaters being influenced to miss, originally). It is never stated whether the friendly fire among the Death Eaters was influenced by the potion. I suppose it's likely that, given an obviously absurdly powerful potion, I just followed the most powerful interpretation of its abilities.
