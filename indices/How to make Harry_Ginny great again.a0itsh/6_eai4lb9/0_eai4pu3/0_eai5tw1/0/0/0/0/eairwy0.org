We don't know what the potion did. It made Harry bump into her, yes, but we know from later in HBP that it can affect others as well (it made Death Eaters miss). The potion could have made Ginny react more aggressively than she otherwise would have. It could have made Dean less responsive to Ginny's problems. It could have had separate effects that Harry never saw. The potion alters reality to better suit the user, you can't say that it didn't cause their breakup.
