But we have context to know the relationship was already really rocky by that point, that Dean had a habit of doing the exact thing that caused Ginny to snap at him, so the potion didn't cause Dean or Ginny to do anything they hadn't already done by that point. I like the think liquid luck puts a person in the right place at the right time. The potion perhaps only sped up by a couple of days what was going to happen anyway.

You also need to consider the writer's intent. Do you really think Rowling intended us to believe that if not for an external incident, Dean and Ginny would remain together? That even though Rowling considered Harry and Ginny soulmates (she has said they were in at least two interviews), if not for Felix, Ginny would have gone on to marry Dean?

Felix works in the randomness of the universe, where it might compel you to stare at something an extra second, thereby causing you to just miss the roof that caves in, which was always going to happen. That roof was destined to cave in.

Ginny and Dean were destined to break up. They were clearly heading that way. Felix allowed Harry to arrive at the portrait at just the right time to cause the event that sped up their ending. But they were always going to break up. And judging by how inconsequential the cause of the fight was, it was also quite clear the break up was imminent. Felix did not cause Ginny to have the reaction she did.
