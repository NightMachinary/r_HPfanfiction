The argument I'm referring to is the same thing I originally quoted, “the potion didn't cause Dean or Ginny to do anything they hadn't already done by that point.”

I initially avoided mentioning the exact reason to avoid, as you said, throwing a bomb in the conversation, and I thought that just drawing attention to it would be enough to explain. Doing something once is not justification for someone to force it to happen again.
