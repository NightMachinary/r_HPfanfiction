If a Quidditch player uses Felix Felicis and the opposing team falls apart, should the player be excused because their opponents were obviously at least somewhat dysfunctional to start with?

Love is not a zero sum game, of course, but there is some opposition between Dean and Harry and downplaying the fact that the Felicis could have played a part in destroying Ginny's relationship is just willful ignorance.
