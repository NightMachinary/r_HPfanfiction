I am generally on the side of "showing", with one important exception that applies specifically to fanfic: if you're going to rehash a canon scene or dialogue without changes, just reference it. We've already read it one hundred and one times (once in canon, and a hundred in other fanfic that rehashed it).

For example, among good fic, linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) is, IMO, a big offender on this front.
