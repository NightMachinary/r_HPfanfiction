This is something I really struggled with in my own fic, simply because I couldn't find ways of telling without disrupting the flow. Ultimately I think I did end up doing a rehash, but hopefully it's in so few chapters it doesn't hurt the story too much. It's really easy to do, and so difficult to make it different enough to keep it interesting.
