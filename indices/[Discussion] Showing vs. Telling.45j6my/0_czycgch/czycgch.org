For those who don't understand this: showing vs telling is a (slightly misunderstood) concept within writing, about whether you want to directly tell your reader what's going on/what's wrong or you want to imply something without directly telling so.

Telling would be, for example: "the man is dangerous"

Showing would be: "the man drew his gun, and, with a deranged smile, shot the woman dead."

Both ways of writing have their strengths. In general, showing gives you more detail, allows you to paint a picture in your head about how the scene looks. It makes your characters more lifelike, too.

Telling can be used when you want to inform your readers about things. In general, it fits within passages that are written by the novelist, and not from the point of view of the character, or in passages that cover a lot of time, a description of someone's life in a very short time. Like:

"Harry truly felt happy here. He gradually felt his stress ebb away, and he felt less like an outcast, a fugitive, to be hunted down for the rest of his life, and more like how he should feel: like a thirteen year old boy."

Lot's of telling, no detailed descriptions of his actions and thoughts, and you cover a lot of ground.

Now, back to the discussion: I think fanfiction is too different from conventional literature for the same rules to apply here as in literature. Small, bite-sized paragraphs, the publishing form is more like a story in a magazine rather than a book and most of fanfictions are wish-fulfillment in text-form rather than a book.

My favourite stories, which include [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=128050][Bonds of Blood and Magic]] and Backward with a Purpose ( linkffn(4101650) ) have a lot more 'telling' than the books I read, yet they're still really good.

In short: don't use 'showing vs telling' as an indication of how good the story is. If the writer can use both in the right context, then it does make the story better, true, but there's so much more to a story that makes it good or bad.
