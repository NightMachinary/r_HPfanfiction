I remember reading in a plot bunny farm about a Harry who never was told about what truly happened to his parents.

Hagrid, who was meant to tell it, was stopped by Harry who said he didn't want to talk about it, he already knew - He was ashamed about how his parents supposedly died in a drunken accident - And Harry was trapped and scared when people treated him like he was famous. He felt incredibly guilty, and snape was worse this time wrong due to a misunderstanding/mistake between them. Everything combined, snape, guiltiness, dursleys, famousness, and bullying got to him and he commited suicide.
