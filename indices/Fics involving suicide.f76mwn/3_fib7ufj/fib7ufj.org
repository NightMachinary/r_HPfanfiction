I get that too. I tend to focus on crack-fics now, but a few years ago, I used to search on FFN for things like "suicide", "abuse", "neglect", etc to find fics like that quite regularly, to the point where they all began to sound the same. They helped exhaust the angst. I can't remember any specific stories, though; it was about five years ago, and like I said already, everything kind of melded together. But in my experience, you tend to go through a lot of these fics once you've developed an urge to read them, so I'll pass on some advice on how to find them. You might already be aware of this stuff or are looking for specific recommendations though, in which case, feel free to move on to someone else's comment.

Most fics on FFN with suicide attempts in specifically mention it in the description as a warning, so performing a search for that generally yields good results. You can sort the search results by popularity for a degree of quality control. Same for AO3, except on there the warning would be in the tags.

You can also do a fancy google search. For example, searching *site:[[https://www.fanfiction.net/]]* *"Harry Potter" "suicide"* will give results for pages on FFN that mention both "Harry Potter" and suicide. Make sure Harry's whole name is in the same quotation marks so that google doesn't give you unrelated fics with Harrys and potters in. You can only do one website at a time afaik, but at least you'll have another to go to once you've exhausted the first, I guess?

And just to clarify, for anyone getting ready to harp at me: I'm not passing on this info to encourage taking your own life. Reading fics where characters are struggling with thoughts that plague yourself can help you get out of funks.
