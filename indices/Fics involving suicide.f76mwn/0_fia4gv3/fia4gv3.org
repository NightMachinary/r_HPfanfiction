I know this isn't the thread for it, but as a mental health professional, I want to say that that's not a normal or healthy response- are you ok? Are you seeing someone? Please reach out to someone if you're feeling this way- there's even anonymous text help!

Text HOME to 741741 for crisis help

Or call the national suicide hotline at 1-800-273-8255
