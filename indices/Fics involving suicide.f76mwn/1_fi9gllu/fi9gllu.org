Digging For The Bones linkffn(6782408) involves suicide attempts. It's severitis, has a whole laundry list of trigger warnings and while I'm not a fan of a certain storyline (resulting from one of the attempts) it's a rather good story even if I'm a lot more fond of the author's 'Memories' series (which, while it has some similar themes, doesn't touch on suicide).
