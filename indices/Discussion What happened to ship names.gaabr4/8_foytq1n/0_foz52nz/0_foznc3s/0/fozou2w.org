Yeah, I did too until I uncovered that. It's pretty interesting.

The prompt specifically called for bio!dad snape, appearance altering on 16 birthday, and remus to returning to teach. Its divulged to basically include any kind of dad/mentor snape just about though, or gets tacked on as an umbrella tag.

Makes it a little hard to find specific flavors if you want something a little different outside the prompt though.
