I clicked into this ready to say that. That, and with all the ships out there, it's pretty freaking hard to remember all of them. And then there's the ships that have like three different names for them, because it's really hard to standardize a fandom.

That, and Name/Name is easier to read and recognize. Drarry? Tomione? Dramione? Severitus? Sorry, I thought we were speaking English. Or do you need some penicillin to make the burn go away?
