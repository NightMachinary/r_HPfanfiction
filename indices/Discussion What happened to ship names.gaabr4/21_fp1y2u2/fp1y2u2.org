For me, while things like SS Betrayal (Sirius/Lily) are cool and shit, they're not very sustainable- who remembers that shit, especially for ships they don't even like. Apparently "The Government Stole My Toad" is the Neville/Luna one... I could honestly never remember that and I don't even mind them together. What can I say... people like making up new words. Now, because I read so much fanfic, words like Romione, Wolfstar and Drarry are just normal words. Some of them are just ridiculous tho- Hinny? Honks?!
