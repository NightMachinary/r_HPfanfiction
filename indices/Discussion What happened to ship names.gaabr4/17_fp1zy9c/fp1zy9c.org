My personal thoughts on seeing shipnames:

Flowerpot? What is this, Jily? Something Petunia due to the somewhat common forced gardening in the Dursley home?

Ginger snaps.. oh, Snily? I guess that's an interesting ship variant, but why would this one fic portray Snape as devil incar--oh it's Jily, okay. Wait, that doesn't make any sense...

Potions and Snitches is Snarry? But there is a fanfic community also called that that explicitly forbids the romantic versions of the ship...?

"Fancy" shipnames is just confusing. I kinda like the Wolfstar shipname, but really, the only reason it doesn't suffer the same problem is that it's one of the most common fanon HP ships. Had it been a a rarepair, it would be just as confusing (case in point: Starbucks)
