There's been a shift in how ship names are decided upon in most fandoms, really. My guess is for simplicity's sake, as portmanteau ship names are and have been common in fandoms since the days of Star Trek. Portmanteaus are usually shorter and thus more convenient to use, but they also have the advantage of being more obvious as to which characters a ship involves. Although there are still some [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticShipNaming][idiosyncratic ship names]] in place, like Wolfstar, a lot of the [[http://forums.fictionalley.org/park/showthread.php?s=&threadid=4591][older idiosyncratic HP ship names]] were vague or abstract, long, or could easily be applied to more than one ship, even if they were more specific. And then, of course, there are names which, although indicative of more specific characters, would generally be seen as more ridiculous or offensive now than they would have over a decade ago (just look at the ones that involve characters of color, for instance). That said, as someone who prefers idiosyncratic ship names to portmanteau ship names, as, like you said, they are generally more creative, I wish we did see more of it used. Gin n' Tonic and The Government Stole My Toad are both really fun.
