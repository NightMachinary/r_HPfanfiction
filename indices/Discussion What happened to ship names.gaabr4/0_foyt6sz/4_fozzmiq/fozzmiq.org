well the old HP ship names link just sent me down a looong rabbithole at 4 am

ngl it's very disorienting seeing so many threads which were made before i was even born,, and some of them are so ridiculous it's beautiful. but ig the thing that hit the hardest was that "slash" fics had a whole separate list.

i definitely wouldn't have minded being a part of the fandom at that time rather than now because saying i ship (for example) percy weasley and pansy parkinson now is just gonna lead to a bunch of people attacking me oof.
