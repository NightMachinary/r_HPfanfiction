My only guess as to why the more creative ship names declined, and this is pure conjecture, was that the popularity of FictionAlley also declined and/or the newer crowd who got into fanfiction were more comfortable with the portmanteau ship names.

I'm a big fan of the older ship names too, I mean come on: Orange Crush for Harry/Ginny and S.S. Betrayal for Lily/Sirius, H.M.S. Flaming Toad for Ginny/Neville; all of those are amazing! Feels like your speaking a special code disguised as real words, whereas the portmanteau ship names are clearly nonsense.

That said, there is something to be said about speed of the portmanteau ship name when saying it aloud or writing. Nuna or Luneville is way less of a mouthful than "S.S. The Government Stole My Toad."
