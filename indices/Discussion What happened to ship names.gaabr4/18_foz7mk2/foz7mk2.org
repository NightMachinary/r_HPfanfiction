I've never been a fan of ship names. Or using abbreviations and acronyms. Are we so lazy that we can't spend a minute to write full words and form a complete sentence? It seems every fandom has some sort of jargon and I can't be arsed to learn it. Just recently a title from this subreddit contained this: "MC (OC/SI)". How is that supposed to make any sense? What does it even mean? Divide OC by SI and multiply by MC?

Any time someone writes MoD Harry I imagine he is a moderator on a forum. Ooh, and my personal favourite- AK. "Voldemort threw an AK". I imagined him throwing an Avtomat Kalashnikova and was confused for a minute until I realised the author meant the killing curse. Seriously, how fucking hard is it to just type out "the killing curse"? It only takes a few seconds- the killing curse, the killing curse, the killing curse. See? It's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

In conclusion- fuck the so-called "shipnames". Use the full names of the characters so that people know what you're speaking of. Not everyone can spend their free time memorizing useless trivia.
