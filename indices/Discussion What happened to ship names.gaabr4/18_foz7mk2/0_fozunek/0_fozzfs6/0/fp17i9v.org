lol Same. I wrote out the whole thing, read it and realised it was incredibly petty and thought about not posting it. But I thought "Eh, why not?" and did it. I'm honestly surprised I didn't get downvoted.

And I just thought of another pet peeve- accents. Now don't get me wrong- there is nothing wrong with accents, I probably also have an atrocious accent when speaking. But English isn't my first language and sometimes it's difficult to understand what Fleur and Hagrid are talking about. McGonagall is also difficult to understand, though that's rarer. I think some authors use a Scottish accent for her when she's really angry.
