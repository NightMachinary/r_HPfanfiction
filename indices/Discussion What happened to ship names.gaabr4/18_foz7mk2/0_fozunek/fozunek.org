A lot of the abbreviations stem from character limits in summaries. Like on FFN, there's only so many characters that you are allowed to use, so shortening ships and other stuff (like MoD!Harry) is just smart. And yea, the need for it mostly went away with people switching over to AO3, but some people also still use FFN.

And honestly, who wants to read OR write Archive Of Our Own or Fanfiction.net 20 times when you're talking about something? Yea, there's some more obscure stuff, like severitus, that takes a while to understand, but once you do, it makes it a lot easier to look for very specific things. That's why we have stuff like TvTropes. If you want to look for a Snape and Harry Mentor fic you're not going to get super mixed results because most people know that term and will put it in their summary or tags. Then you can look exclusively for Severitus, instead of looking for Snape/harry mentor, harry/snape mentor, snape and harry mentor, harry and snape mentor, harry snape guardian... I think you get the picture.

And really? Stuff like that is just,, happening to internet language. You think most people that AREN'T on the internet a lot know what a 'rickroll' is? No. That's just how language works.

Fanfic language is literally just jargon, and the natural progression of the circumstances and limitations surrounding early fanfiction writing, reading, and discussion.

At this point, so many people are used to it, and most people have at least a base understanding of the meanings, and trying to switch over to everything being fully written out would be way more trouble than it's worth, and it would just go back the way it was eventually anyway.

That's my opinion at least.
