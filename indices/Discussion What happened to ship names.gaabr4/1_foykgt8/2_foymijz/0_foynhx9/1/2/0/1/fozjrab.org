  In Naruto chakra is much more quantitative, as in there's a set amount of chakra you can use before you need to rest/replenish, otherwise you'll collapse from exhaustion.

And that amount will always be "however much makes this scene that much more dramatic". Because for all their statements about having such-and-such amount of chakra, or techniques using however-much chakra, no actual numbers are ever expressed in either the manga or the anime.
