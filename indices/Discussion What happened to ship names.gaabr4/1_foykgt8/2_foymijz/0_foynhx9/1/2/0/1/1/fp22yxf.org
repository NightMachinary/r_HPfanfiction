The only exposure I've had to Naruto is through fanfics (I once tried the series a few years back, but... Well, it was unreadable for me) - and it feels like the way chakra works can give for an interesting set of possibilities.

That might be because I like the idea of a main character with less raw power but more control - so the opposite of the setup for the actual Naruto, but a lot of Sakura-centric fics do have that in there.
