Naruto doesn't have anything like that, the way I saw it, magical cores were more qualitative, as in strong core, developing core, etc. While there was a quantitative aspect to it, it was much more tied to exhaustion to a set amount.

In Naruto chakra is much more quantitative, as in there's a set amount of chakra you can use before you need to rest/replenish, otherwise you'll collapse from exhaustion.
