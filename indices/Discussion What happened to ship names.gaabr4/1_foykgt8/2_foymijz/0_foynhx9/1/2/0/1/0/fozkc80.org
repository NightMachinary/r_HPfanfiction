Hah, Kishimoto can barely make a proper timeline, what's to say placing numbers on characters abilities, Toriyama(DBZ) did that and wrote himself into a corner to such a point he just did away with the system.

The most we have is that such and such have little chakra, so they get tired easily, and such and such have a lot of chakra, so they only run out when drama is needed.
