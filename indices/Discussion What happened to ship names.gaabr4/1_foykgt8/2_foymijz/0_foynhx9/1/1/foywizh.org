Well, it's actually rather simple. It's the term that stuck in the fandom for magic being somewhat internal and used up when cast, and replenishing naturally. The form it takes will vary fic by fic.

The most meme-d upon type of magical core is using it as a perfectly quantifiable measure of strength (It's over 9000!!!) and used to power up Harry to a million - but it's not only that.

As a name, I think it stuck because wand cores are a thing, and it makes some sense to have a 'core' of magic within oneself - and can be tied in nicely with use of focuses (eg - a wand might work by making it easier to connect to a magical core and use it).
