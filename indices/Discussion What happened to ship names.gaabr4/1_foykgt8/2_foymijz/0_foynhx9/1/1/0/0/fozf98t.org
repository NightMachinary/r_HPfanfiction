I've never seen it actually used as a wand core, though that's an interesting thought - I meant more that wand cores are a thing in canon, so the terminology exists (and the 'core' of a wand is usually the magical ingredient) - I imagine it just got lifted.

That would be a rather interesting dark ritual to find in a fic, though - turning one's arm or hand into a wand would be a pretty good trick to have up your sleeve.
