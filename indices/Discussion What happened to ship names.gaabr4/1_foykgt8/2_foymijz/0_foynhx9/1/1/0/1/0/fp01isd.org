Well, not really. Wand cores work based on their symbolism, and how well they match their wood.

The first issue with those cores will likely be that you won't really find woods that match what those substances represent. For example, a basilisk is a very large, very evil monster constructed from dark magic and loyal only to a single master. Finding a wood with connotations of the same kind will be difficult, but not impossible. Conversely, phoenixes are symbols of rebirth, healing, eternity and cleansing fire, which would need a wood of matching purity. Really the only wood I can think of that fits isn't even from HP canon, but LotR - [[https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Two_Trees_of_Valinor][The two trees of Valinor]].

The second, and bigger, issue with these cores is finding the wizard worthy of wielding them. As a wand constructed from extremely dark magic and encased in a matching wood, the Basilisk Wand would be notorious. It would require a similar wizard - one with an alignment to the dark, suffused and loyal to the extreme. Really the only wizard I can think of that would concievably wield a basilisk wand is Bellatrix Lestrange. She perfectly embodies all the qualities such a wand would have. The phoenix wand would be even harder to find a master for. They would need to be unwavering in the face of darkness, a light shining into the dark recesses of life to burn it all to ash and cleanse it anew. At the same time, they would need a capacity for infinite mercy, ready to heal and assist anyone who asks them.

This obviously only adresses the individual cores. I don't believe a combination of the two is possible in any way. They are diametrically opposed, both annihilate until nothing is left. They are aligned on opposite sides of the spectrum.

Any wand you would concievably craft, if it doesn't explode during creation, would need a wood or set of woods that both adheres to the individual components and attempts to bring them into a nonviolent balance. I'm unsure if such a wand were possible. The core would need to either twine or be parallel, with the woods also either twining or running parallel, but then they would also need to be similar enough to blend and stabilize the dual core.

And of course finding a wizard to wield it would be nigh-impossible. The entire wand would be a contradiction, being at once an instrument of inescapable death and boundless healing, infinite mercy and relentless murder. It would constantly clash with itself.

Forcing the two ingredients to work together would be like pressing two north poles on a magnet together. It's possible, yes, but it resists at every step. If it can't annihilate the other, then it will stay seperate. I doubt you could mix the two in any real sense.
