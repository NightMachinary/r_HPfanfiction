In my fandom (Japanese anime/manga) they mixed the languages for the ship name. Like one character is Japanese, the other American.

So they took the initial A from the American name and the first kanji for Ei from the Japanese name (英), so they often write the ship name as A英

I thought that was a pretty creative way of a ship name. More creative than most ship names I've seen until now, at least.

But the ship name with name x name exists as well. In my fandom the names of the two main characters are so short you can't really shorten them.
