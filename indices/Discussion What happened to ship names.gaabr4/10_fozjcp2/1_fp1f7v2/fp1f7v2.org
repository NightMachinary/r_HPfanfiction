WHOA that was a wild ride. And the bit in there about Cassandra Clare having plagiarized mortal instruments from her own draco/harry/hermione love trangle fic which she plagiarized from other authors/shows? And she wrote ron/ginny incest porn?? And now she's a super famous YA author?? And one of the people in the "inner circle", Ebony Thomas, is a super well-respected professor at Penn???
