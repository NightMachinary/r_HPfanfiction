Ship names made more sense (or were at least more justifiable) when things like character limits and very limited search functions were a factor.

Recently---like, since FFN added the ability to tag [character1, character2] as a pairing and since AO3 created a new Wild West of tagging possibilities---making up new nonsense words to indicate a pairing hasn't been necessary. Or even vaguely palatable. Stuff like "Wolfstar" might feel clever to whoever made it up, but it comes across super cringey, in an "I own four katanas" and "I tell everyone I meet that I love yaoi" kind of way.

There's also the issue of clarity---fanfiction is more popular and accessible than ever, and obscure or "clever" ship names make no sense to readers who may be new to the fandom. It's a bit gatekeeping-ish to insist on ship names that only longtime fans or the "in-group" will understand.
