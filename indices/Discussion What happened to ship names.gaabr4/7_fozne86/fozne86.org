Ship naming is a compromise between brevity and clarity.

On the brevity side, you could get initials or even first letter or two: H/Hr, HP/GW

On the clarity side, you get standard slash format: George/Fred, Hagrid/Giant Squid

In the middle you get Portmanteaus: Tomarry, Hinny, Harmonione

â€‹

Then there's the "clever" names: Wolfstar, Flowerpot, Pumpkin Pie

These have the dubious distinction of being neither particularly brief, not clear.

As a rule of thumb, any ship name that has someone ask what it is whenever it's casually referenced is a terrible ship name that needs to die in fire.
