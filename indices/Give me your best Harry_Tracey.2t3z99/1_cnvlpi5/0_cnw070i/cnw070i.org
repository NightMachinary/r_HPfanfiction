Quality of writing is great. All of the Riddle sections are intriguing. One of the better backstory Tom Riddles I've read. The only thing is that I'm pretty sure I've read this story as I particularly remember the end of the first chapter.

I'll keep reading to see if I've actually read it though.

Edit: Well written story, though I soured towards the latter half of it when Harry loses it. I had read it before, but not in a long time. Thanks for the recommendation!
