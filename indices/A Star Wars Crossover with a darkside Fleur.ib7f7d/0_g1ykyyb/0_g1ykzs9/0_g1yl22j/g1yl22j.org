Basically, they interrogate Glon and have some adventures(deepening their relationship and beginning Fleur's training) while they track Gabby to a large Slaver compound, a distribution center in the Mid Rim.

Luckily, Qui-Gon Jin and Obi-Wan Kenobi are in the planet for a training trip, they team up (Obi-Wan is reluctant, but follows Qui-Gon who is happy seeing Harry doing positive things) and manage to rescue Gabby, they uncover how large and terrible the organization is and find out about some future plans to kidnap more children in the Republic neglected Outer Rim, Qui Gon wants to help, but they are recalled by the Council to go as Mediators to Naboo. They part on mostly friendly terms, Qui-Gon apologetic but Harry is well aware of Jedi politics and admits his Master is the best one for the job.

Harry and Fleur, after rescuing Gabby, who was horrified at what they did to the ones they kidnapped(she was treated with a bit more dignity because they were contemplating returning her for a very, very large ramson), decide to dismantle the whole organization, they go back to Veelarin to drop off Gabby and inform her parents of Fleur's decision, they are supportive, always knowing their daughter would someday want to leave.

Harry begins to train Fleur in earnest, she quickly learns the more physical aspects, but Veela are very connected to their emotions, and she powers many of the techniques with them. Harry is a bit wary, but being trained by Qui-Gon and never really buying into the philosophy of suppressing his emotions starts experimenting, he is well aware of the Dark Side, but his ambitions at the moment were protecting Fleur and stopping the slavers.

Harry has several materials he gathered in his travels, one of them is a map to a Holocron, they track it to Dantooine where he finds a Sith Holocron that contains knowledge about some of their more powerful offensive techniques both physical and mind based ones.

Harry quickly learns things like Force Lightning, and more aggressive lightsaber styles(Juyo), Fleur learns very powerful mind manipulation techniques, and some Sith Sorcery.

They fall deeper into the Dark Side, but their disposition is still in the Light, to help others.

They start hunting down the slavers and bringing down their operations, being such a small but powerful unit, with a Stealth Ship(Harry begins restoring and upgrading it with funds taken from the slavers) they are very effective and start getting a reputation.

The Holocron contains a map to Korriban, the Sith Homeworld, where great repositories of knowledge are found. They decide to go there after they destroy the slavers.

Among the end of Naboo Crisis, Harry feels Qui-Gon's demise and his anger and grief push him to finish off the slavers, after months of dismantling their operations they find their last fortress on the sands of Jakku, where he and Fleur eradicate them.

They become something of a legend in the Outer Rim, spread by grateful freed slaves. Palpatine only hears of them later, but is too occupied with his preparations to the Clone Wars to give any attention to rumors.

They return to Veelarin, rich, and marry, after some years of living a happy and peaceful life(but still training), they decide to leave due to a dream from Qui-Gon and wanderlust.

They go to Korriban, finding the ruins of the Sith Empire, and learning much of their history, and about the Old Republic, recognizing that many of their failures are still present. Some of the Ancient Lords of the Sith appear and offer training hoping to restore lost knowledge, among them Darth Imperius.

They return a year later, basically full Sith, but with the ideals of freedom, and the desire to help. They find out the corruption of the Republic allowed for another slaver organization to spring up. And that the Republic is now on the brink of a Civil War.

They've got their work cut out to them.

Wow this evolved fast, I just had to write, it probably needs some editing, but I need to sleep and I always wanted to write a Star Wars fic.
