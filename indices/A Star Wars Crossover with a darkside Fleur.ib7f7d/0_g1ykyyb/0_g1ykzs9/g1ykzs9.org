As soon as Glon was secured in a cell and they were in the upper atmosphere, Fleur turned to Harry, trying to hide her curiosity.

"So 'Former Jedi'? Did they just let you leave?"

He sighed and she felt, through her limited empathic abilities, a spike of anger and sadness from him. Curious.

"They did. We had some 'differences of opinion' and thought it best to part ways."

"And they just let you take the fancy sword with you?"

He smirked, "It's the only thing that truly belonged to me." he looked at the horizon, but she saw he was seeing something far away, "They were /magnanimous/ enough to let me take my clothes and my Master paid my transport to anywhere I wanted." He said that with a fond smile.

"Your Master helped you?" She always imagined Jedi Masters as those stern, uptight people who would sometimes come to her planet to complain and even demand they give their Force-sensitive children to them, she doubted those would do anything more than turn their nose at those that left their precious Order.

Harry laughed, and she was hit with the doubt if he had guessed her thoughts or /read/ them.

"Master Qui Gon is great, totally different from most of them, he did his best to help me and even offered to accompany me until I could get my bearings in the galaxy." he frowned and looked outside the window, "I couldn't cause him any more trouble though, and I needed to do things myself, the bastards already blamed him for it. Assholes" he gripped the control stick a bit too hard before reeling himself and activating the autopilot with the coordinates for their hideout. The ship smoothly adjusted course and Harry pushed a few more buttons, a different hum coming over the ship before reducing until it was barely there.

Fleur looked at Harry in askance, he grinned.

"Cloaking Device."

"Bullshit."

He laughed at her crassness, he loved when she let out the real her a bit, "It's true," he rose from his chair, and she followed him as he caressed the wall, "This beauty here may be old, but she is full of tricks, and has many tales to tell."

"How did /you/ find it? I know our pilots have tried to get it from you many times."

Harry laughed again, carefree, and Fleur had to hold back her smile, she always liked when he laughed, he was normally either serious or sarcastic, never just happy like this, she liked it.

"Of course they did, but that's a long story, but involves me and a surprise trip to Raxus Prime."

She laughed as they entered the main hold, which was the living room, kitchen, and eating area at the same time.

Harry offered her a cup of water, that she took as she sat, she thought about what they had accomplished, or rather, what Harry had accomplished, they had Glon, the man who knew where her sister was.

She frowned at the cup, she had been useless today, more than useless she had almost ruined everything. She had been powerless and she hated that. She turned to look at Harry who was looking at her in concern.

"Teach me."

He was taken aback by her declaration, or more precisely, demand.

"What?"

"Teach me to use the Force, to do what you did today."

He frowned at her, and she couldn't few anything, as she suspected, he could block that too.

"I am no Master."

She placed the cup in the table with a bit more force than necessary and glared at him.

"I don't need a Jedi Master, I need you to teach to do what you do, teach me like your Master taught you."

His frown deepened, "I can't teach like Master Qui Gon, and even then it takes years..."

"I don't need to learn the intricacies of the Force, I can already use mind tricks and compulsion, just teach me how to throw people across a room by waving my hand at them!"

She was on her feet and screaming at him at the end, before stopping herself and sitting back down, she looked at him apologetically.

"I am sorry, it's just that I was so scared today, and Gabby..." she couldn't stop her tears as she covered her mouth, Harry quickly covered the distance between them and took her in his arms, gently guiding her to the couch where he sat down beside her and began to caress her hair and lightly rock her.

"It's okay, Fleur, we will find her, I promise."

She hugged him tighter and tried in vain to contain her sobs.

"I was so stupid today, I could've ruined everything!"

Harry brought her closer until her head was laying on his chest and he began rubbing her back.

"We all make mistakes, Fleur, the important thing is learning from them."

She half laughed and sobbed, "Did your Jedi Master taught you that?"

She heard Harry's chuckle reverberate from her position and found herself comforted by their closeness.

"He actually did."

They stayed like that for a few minutes until she calmed down, but didn't leave his arms. The silence was broken when he tightened the embrace and said, "I will teach you, I have some...materials I found along the way that can help, and you are a quick learner."

She sniffed, before caressing his cheek, they had never been this close, but it felt so natural, she liked it, and they were alone, she could give herself this comfort.

"My brave Knight." she teased.

He snorted, before placing his hand over hers and looking her in the eyes, green met blue and he smiled at her.

"I was never Knighted, my Master said I was ready at fifteen, but the other Masters disagreed, apparently 'Your combat skills, exceptional as they are, do not compensate for your lack of discipline.'" he finished in a stuffy, self-righteous voice. "I left soon after."

Fleur giggled, actually giggled, she cupped his face and looked deep into his eyes.

"I don't care for the opinions of stuffy old men who don't leave their ivory towers, to me, you are /my/ Knight."

She then did something she had always imagined, and unknown to her he too, their privacy, stress, and adrenaline high from earlier just encouraged Fleur Delacour to bring their faces closer and kiss Harry Potter.

He froze, and she thought he would reject her before she felt his hand on the back of her head begin to caress her hair, while the one on her back brought her closer while he deepened their kiss.

Her senses where assaulted by the desire but also by the deep affection for her he was emanating, she couldn't stop the pleased sounds coming from her, who knew Jedi knew how to kiss.

As they separated for air, both were looking disheveled and flushed, but Fleur felt hope soar in her heart, for she had also felt the brotherly care Harry had for Gabby and his utter determination at saving her.

He looked at her with a teasing smile, "So, any chance of you calling me /Master?/"

Her laughter echoed throughout the hallways, and soon she was sleeping in his arms, more deeply than she ever had since her sister had been kidnapped.
