Fleur Delacour was at a disadvantage, a situation she rarely found herself in, ever since she was a child on Veelarin she had learned to cover her weaknesses and exploit her adversaries', a deadly game of power, words, and daggers that was a pastime in her homeworld, her natural prowess with the Force only helped her always come out on top. She was ever so glad of her planet's policy of denying the Jedi Order their force-sensitive children, of course, this also made them disliked and distrusted by the Republic, at least officially, and forced them to deal with all kinds of people for trade.

People like Harry Potter, smuggler and bounty hunter, the closest she had to an actual friend(besides her sister) and she was loathe to admit one of the few people that she had a modicum of trust for, not only was he completely immune to her people's powers of persuasion, both Force based and those more natural, he always fulfilled his part of a deal, as long the other side did the same(and he somehow knew if they did), if they didn't he would show how prodigious he was with a blaster.

But she doubted even that talent would save them now, and outnumbered and outgunned, by these /slavers/, associates of the people who took her sister, he had tried to warn her, but she foolishly walked them into an ambush, and now here she was surrounded by Gamorrans, twi'leks, Droids, and her target, a dirty Twi'lek known as Glon but called himself "The Procurer", leering down at her from the balcony.

"Tsk. Tsk. Not so brave out of your planet now aren't you birdie? How do you noble types say? Ah, 'you overplayed your hand, my lady' " he finished with a pitiful try at a cultured voice, but his lackeys(those that weren't droids) laughed the same way.

"And with all the money you have, all you could bring was Potter? A good shot I will admit, but even he can't take down all my friends here." he gestured his hands at the nearly thirty armed henchmen he had brought. "Not before we gun you down."

Fleur chanced a glance at her companion, he had a Mandalorian chest plate, but no helmet, and most importantly, /she/ had no armor at all. He had one blaster pistol aimed at her target and another at the nearest threat, one of those thin battle droids that were getting on the market.

Her mental math was clear, he would down maybe seven of them before he was overwhelmed, and she would manage two. Maybe if he had a full set of beskar, instead of just a chest plate and bracers, she could use him as a shield, but that plan was discarded too.

Harry looked strangely calm, serene even. He always looked like that, but she thought she would see at least some sweat.

Fleur did her best to not show her panic, hiding it behind her aloof mask the best she could.

She decided to try and bribe Glon, her family would pay a lot more for her than he could get on /other markets./ She would try to include Harry too, if only to convince Glon it wasn't worth trying to get him.

Before she could speak, Harry did, much calmer and even colder than his normal genial and honest(superficially) attitude.

"So, Princess, do you have a plan? A way out?"

She tried to come up with what to say, but apparently her expression was enough, Harry closed his eyes and sighed, cursing under his breath, before whispering so only she could hear, "Stay behind me." What? Was he mad?

Before she could react he shot Glon right in the knee, making him scream in pain, his henchmen were shocked enough for Harry to shoot eight more times, dropping the droids closest to them, the four behind them and the Gamorreans with heavy weapons.

She knew what would come next, the barrage of blaster fire, she refused to close her eyes, but Harry stepped in front of her as the ones still standing took aim and dropped his blaster, further confusing her, before pushing his now free hand forward, and utterly shocking her as the nearest ten shooters in front of them were knocked back, /hard./

She saw some of the henchmen step back in shock but the already primed droids fired. She shouldn't be surprised when the jade green blade came out of /somewhere/ on his belt and deflected the shots, but she was.

She only came out of her stupor when Glon started screaming.

"Jedi! Kill the Jedi!" She wasn't about to let that happen, and started shooting, trying to stay behind Harry as he started slowly /advancing,/ his /lightsaber/ on his right hand a blaster on the left one, he mowed down the droids first, most of them with deflected shots she could barely see, the blaster he used on the scared henchmen, that she guessed were amateurs hired to bolster numbers, given the way they had completely lost their cool the moment they saw a lightsaber.

In the sixty seconds between Harry whispering to her and now, eighteen bodyguards had fallen, all the droids and the more professional looking men, the rest had bolted and run.

All but one, Glon was pathetically trying to crawl into the balcony, but Harry /jumped/ and cleared the three meters height easily, immediately cutting off the coward's pleas with a stunner shot from his wrist launcher.

Fleur almost collapsed when she realized that it was over, her head spun a bit and she had to hold herself on the wall, she had been through a few scuffles in her homeworld, but nothing like this.

"Are you okay?"

She flinched in surprise when she realized Harry was back down, holding an unconscious Glon by the back of his collar.

The Veela took some deep breaths before sliding down on the wall to sit, she looked up at her companion, she was used to betrayal and lies but never from him, it hurt more than she thought it would.

She scowled up at him, "So, Jedi spy?"

Harry scoffed, "I doubt they have something like that with how uptight they are, but no, not a Jedi, not anymore."

She raised an eyebrow and looked pointedly at the lightsaber still in his hand, now deactivated.

He glanced at it, before shrugging and raising it for her to see, it was finely crafted in chromium and durasteel, but it was scuffed and dented. "What? This? Do you know how hard I worked to make this? And I spent practically all of my childhood and bit more learning how to use it, might as well not let it go to waste." he looked at her, and she could see the barely concealed fear of rejection on his eyes. "And it saved our lives today."

She raised herself, and swiped the dust from her clothes, she should've known better than to wear white on a desert planet.

She looked at Harry, "That it did, and now I finally know how you are able to resist our talents, Mr. Potter." she pointed at him with a triumphant expression, and almost smiled back at the relief on his eyes, she would never recriminate him for it, not after he saved her life, she was practical like that.

He snorted, "It's more will than anything, Fleur."

She harrumphed, but said nothing as they silently walked to his ship that was parked close by, a sleek silver craft that had seen better days, but still had some charm, a relic according to Harry, X-70 or something that Harry called Firebolt for some reason. Smugglers.
