  If you know of other stories where someone besides Sirius raises him

I am writing a story where Andromeda adopts Harry after Sirius fails to clear his name. It is focused on family and friendship moments, with an emphasis on character interactions over action scenes. I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel but show how the initial divergence would change things further down the road. Eg Harry still has to get around a dragon, but he does not face the horntail or tries to outfly it.
