Lol, imagine Harry dissing adult Sirius and supporting adult Snape because he supposedly hates bullies. Sirius didn't turn into a child abuser even after 12 years with literal soul sucking demons, but we're supposed to sympathize with Snape bullying his own students because of his suffering due do to choices he himself made as an adult.
