I've posted a plot bunny along these lines that features a Harry like that (well, not obese or glutinous, and not so much dumb as intellectually lazy, but selfish and a bully), and also deconstructs the Slytherin Persecution Complex. I don't have the talent or the time to write it, though.

When Dudley is beating up other school children for their lunch money, Harry (who can run much faster) is right there cutting off their escape. When Hagrid takes him to the Diagon Alley (without having to track him down to an island in the middle of a lake), Harry almost dies of embarrassment having to be seen next to that uncouth oaf.

And, when Draco offers to help him find a better kind of friend, he takes one look at Draco's expensive new robes and at Ron's hand-me-downs, and he knows exactly whose friend he wants to be and in which House.

Once there, he invariably chooses what's easy over what's right, following Draco's lead in sneering at the Gryffindors and bullying the Muggleborns and the blood-traitors. He mocks Hagrid, badmouths Dumbledore, and ingratiates himself with Snape (the latter with mixed success). He exploits his Quiddich talent and his BWL status to the hilt, thinking himself clever because he gets a lot---to the point of people doing his assignments for him---for doing very little. On those occasions when Harry is absent, Draco riles up Ron by rubbing the fact that Harry chose Draco over Ron in Ron's face.

All the while, the Slytherin Persecution Complex would be on full display. Young Slytherins would parrot their parents' lines about "good old days" before Dumbledore ruined the country, when newcomers knew to respect their betters. They would complain about Ministry persecuting upstanding citizens, then turn around and flaunt their parents' wealth and influence. They would cry oppression when McGonagall justly takes House Points from them, and revel in Slytherin superiority when Snape takes every excuse to award Slytherins points and penalise and punish Gryffindors. They would, in short, complain about stereotyping of Slytherin, then behave in exact accordance with the stereotype.

But then, things begin to go wrong. The friendless Muggleborn girl in Gryffindor who doesn't know when to shut up and has the gall to get the best marks in their year and the pudgy blood-traitor who is good at Herbology and is practically a Squib otherwise---they seemed like logical targets for Draco's and Harry's ire and entertainment alike. But they begin to fight back, and they turn out to be surprisingly good at it.

At first, the vaunted Slytherin cleverness prevails: Draco and his gang use magical items, gang up, and make sure that Snape is nearby to interrupt the fight and punish the Gryffindors if the fight does go badly despite the precautions. But, the Gryffindors also become increasingly well organised, recruit more of their year, and they even begin making revenge attacks, apparently with that annoying Muggleborn in the lead.

And so, the Gryffindors quickly become too dangerous to bully, but even when Draco and Harry take out their frustrations on other targets, the do-gooder Gryffindors have the gall to intervene.

And then, Voldemort returns. Harry is eager to make a deal, but it turns out that the Dark Lord isn't the libertarian meritocrat that Draco had waxed poetic about, and he isn't particularly interested in recruiting or even a truce with Harry. It also turns out that Harry's Slytherin friends value their own safety far above their friendship. The most he can get from Draco is a whispered, "Sorry, Potter. My family's more important. It's been fun."

And so, Harry has to swallow his pride and go to Dumbledore and the pesky Gryffindors for help, beginning his redemption arc.

One twist that I do envision is that when Voldemort gathers intelligence about Harry, he finds a lazy, unambitious follower, an unsubtle bully who lets others do his thinking for him; someone who is brave enough to laugh at the stuttering Professor Quirrel behind his back, but would never confront him over the Philosopher's stone. He despairs over having such an unworthy nemesis.

He also investigates Neville, whom Hermione and Ron will have taken under their wings when Draco and Harry had gone after him, and who comes into his own perhaps earlier than in canon. Having not heard the second half of the prophecy, Voldemort wonders if perhaps he had been mistaken about which of the two children the prophecy had truly been about, and whether magic had punished him for the wrong choice.

And so, he would have little interest in taking Harry's blood, nor in testing his wand against Harry's. That, in turn, would deny Harry his canonical escape clause: to destroy the last horcrux, Harry must truly die. Can he become the sort of person who would?
