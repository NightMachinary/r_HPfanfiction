The wand and incantation method of magic was invented by the Roman's. The only places that use it as their primary magical method are countries that spent centuries under Roman control. Other countries that use wand magic do so as a result of colonization efforts of those countries and don't use it to the same level, such as Native Americans, Africans, Japanese etc who use both wand magic and heritage magic.
