Slytherins Basilisk was never supposed to leave the pipes of the school. It was created as a defense system for the school in case of invasion. Its piping system was designed with enchanted one way windows into the halls so the basilisk could incapacitate invaders without risking death to students potentially caught in its gaze. Salazar Slytherin didn't hold to blood purity, he was just a paranoid man convinced that muggleborn students would turn on the magical world because of Christianity and would inevitably lead a horde of angry muggles to Hogwarts seeking to cleanse the world of Witches. His son was the racist bigoted Slytherin and most tales of Slytherin are based off of him, the father and son becoming merged in stories over the course of history. He was driven out of the castle by his father and Godric when he tried to turn the Basilisk on the students.

The basilisk remembers its purposes and fought against Tom and DiaryTom when ordered to kill. It intentionally petrified students rather than killing them as ordered, even then it was only driven to do Tom's bidding through magically enhanced starvation. The only time it killed a student was Myrtle, which was an accident.
