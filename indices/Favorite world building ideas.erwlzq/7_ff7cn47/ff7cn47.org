I enjoy these, I have so many but no ability to weave a narrative around them.

The reason that there is no continuity in naming conventions for spells, eg curses jinxes etc, is that there are actually three different naming conventions used. The first is the oldest and in some ways the most correct with different spells categorized by what they targeted and the effect they have.

Eg, jinxes target the relationship between a person and something else, like a tool that they are jinxed to not be able to keep track of or a broom that then tries to buck them off. These old jinxes are related to the concept of the "witches evil eye" and require eye contact to establish, refresh, or maintain. There is no beam of light or any visible sign from a wand when cast.

The second is an attempt by some magical theorists and arithmancers to categorize spells by the magical principles of syllable count, wand movements, etc. In this sense charms are related to the numbers 3 and 6, while hexes are related to the number four. This system didn't work really well as there is too much overlap between different spells, but it was used enough by some spell creators that there are many spells in circulation that are named accordingly.

The third is based on how the spell feels and sounds. Jinxes are minor annoyances, hexes moderate attacks, curses violent and offensive magic, charms things that are nice or positive etc. A spells are called by these names based on how they are perceived by the general populus and nothing else.
