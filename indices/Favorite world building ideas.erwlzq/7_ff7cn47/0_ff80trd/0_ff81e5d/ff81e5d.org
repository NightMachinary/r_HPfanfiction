I'd like to think that the Killing Curse is actually an old style Jinx in this way. The whole point of the Killing Curse is that it is unblockable. Which I don't think fits well with a beam of light or a star wars laser blast that can be ducked under, dodged, or blocked with a piece of rock levitated into its path. It works best as an instantaneous spell that automatically affects its target. It doesnt fit with Rowlings Deus Ex Machinas in the graveyard and final battle, but fits better with the description of it.
