Vampires are not villified the way werewolves are in HP, evidenced in the Slug club and blood lollipops. I headcanon a well reputable bar off of Diagon Alley where vampires can order drinks.

Options include differing blood types and muggle vs squib vs magical, specialty drinks such as fattier ones from humans with high cholesterol, exotic ones from humans with various blood conditions, etc. Magical blood donors are kept anonymous by the owner and paid for their donation, which, is allowed two to three times a week as long as at least a day has passed since the donors last dose of blood replenishing potion. Muggle "donations" are taken from muggle blood banks.

Certain donors are pub favorites and become popular "vintages." There is a strict code of honor among the regulars which includes restricting themselves to donations and most definitely not killing anyone. Someone once tracked down a popular donor because they wanted to have their favorite from the source. The others killed them for their offence.
