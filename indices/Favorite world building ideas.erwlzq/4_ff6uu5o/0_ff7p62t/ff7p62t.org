EVERY GODDAMN TIME I bring up the fact that Dumbledore is stupid for not just asking the Unspeakables for help or knowledge about the Horcrux in Harry's scar, they moan, whine, and complain about how they only do "love, time and prophecy". Which is so asinine it equals the incompetence of Fudge AND Lockhart put together.

Why would the Ministry (especially Fudge) allow the budget for a department that only studies time, love, and prophecies? That's a money sink with no conceivable benefit for society.
