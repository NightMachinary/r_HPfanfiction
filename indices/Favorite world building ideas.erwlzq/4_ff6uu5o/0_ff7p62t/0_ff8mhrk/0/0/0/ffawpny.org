I didn't mean that. I meant between him being killed because he's a horcrux (thus allowing a speedier resolution of everything with as little death as possible) OR 16 years of being abused at the Dursleys, being treated like shit in the newspaper, almost dying every year you are in the allegedly safest place in britain, bullied by your peers at school, your teacher (thus allowing a Pyrrhic Victory and a lifetime of guilt).

I'm not talking right or wrong. What would you pick as a "Leader of the Light"?

Now let's murky the waters even further. What if the first chance didn't have a 100% chance that Harry dies? The Unspeakables /could/ have a solution to the problem. We are now looking at a /possibility/ Harry could die vs a definite Pyrrhic Victory.

This now becomes a Trolley Dilemma.
