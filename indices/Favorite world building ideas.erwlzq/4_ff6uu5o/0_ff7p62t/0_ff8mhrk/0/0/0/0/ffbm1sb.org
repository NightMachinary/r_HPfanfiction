First of all, "Leader of the Light" isn't a thing, because there isn't a "Light" in HP. People talk about the "Dark Arts" or "going Dark" on occasion, but in this instace "Dark" is somewhat of a blanket term for magic, creatures and people who are dangerous harmful and/or evil. There isn't, and doesn't need to be, a corresponding "Light," much less a "Leader" of it. Dumbledore has a pretty high status and several important and influental positions in wizarding society, but he doesn't LEAD it... and even the position he does have is surprisingly weak and fragile. We see several times in the series just how easy it is for outside forces to undermine him or even temporarily remove him.

"Leader of the Light" is a term that fandom made up, and it's not a term I like because it's always used as a way to bash Dumbledore... and character bashing is something I detest.

Second of all, this really isn't a trolley dilemma at all. You don't go for the solution that's LEAST likely to succeed, especially not when that solution includes (possible) child murder and the other one doesn't. And the "16 years of being abused at the Dursleys, being treated like shit in the newspaper, almost dying every year you are in the allegedly safest place in britain, bullied by your peers at school, your teacher (thus allowing a Pyrrhic Victory and a lifetime of guilt)" was not something Dumbledore could have predicted at the time, certainly not something he would have KNOWN would have happen. Again, it's NOT kinder to kill a baby because you think he MIGHT have a sucky life. It just isn't.

Yes, yes, everybody obsesses over his "dark and difficult years" line, but Dumbledore isn't omnipotent. He was going for the solution he thought had the best chance of leading to a happy ending. He knew Harry was marked for death because of the Horcrux. He tried a desperate gamble to arrange things so that Harry might not have to die after all. You might say he went about it in a stupid way, or that YOU would have handled the situation better... maybe you would. But I think you're seeing a moral dilemma that really isn't there.
