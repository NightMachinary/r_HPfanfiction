Eh, I'm of the opinion that he believed he was infallible and his way was the only way.

To be brutally honest, murdering Harry would have been kinder than all the crap he had to go through with the Dursleys, Hogwarts, the Camping Trip, and the Final Battle.

And if you bank on the prophecy, that means that nobody BUT Voldemort could kill Harry, so it couldn't happen. Speaking of that, Dumbledore could lead on with that "Hey, you have a prophecy about killing Voldemort down there, but the person who has to do it has a horcrux stuck in him. Can you help a brotha out?" And then he banks on Harry's prophecy induced immortality or them actually helping.
