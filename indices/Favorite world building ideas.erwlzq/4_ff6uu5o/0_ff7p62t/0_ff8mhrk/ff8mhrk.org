A simpler explanation would be that Dumbledore plain doesn't trust the Unspeakables. We know that Death Eaters that walked free often ended up getting jobs at the Ministry, so there's nothing to say that Death Eater influence couldn't have spread with the Unspeakables.

Or maybe the Unspeakables are all just a bunch of immoral mad scientists whose reaction to learning "I fear Harry Potter has a Horcrux on his forehead" would be "Cool! Bring him here, we'll cut his head off so we can perform the proper tests. You didn't need him for anything, right?"
