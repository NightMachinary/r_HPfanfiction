There were two Merlins, Merlin the Greater (King Arthur's court wizard, lived in the 5th and 6th centuries) and Merlin the Lesser (Attended Hogwarts, was a Slytherin, died shortly before Geoffrey of Monmouth first penned The History Of The Kings Of Britain)

Both were the magical titans of their respective eras and slowly became interchangeable in most people's minds as their exploits became mythologised.

It's a handy explanation for why Merlin supposedly attended Hogwarts despite predating it by about half a millennium.
