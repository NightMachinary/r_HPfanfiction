Grindelwald, and later Voldemort, targeted magical infrastructure around the world, setting back knowledge and research by 100 years each.

Imagine destroying all semiconductor manufacturing plants and assassinating all scientists with silicon knowledge. There would still be computers, but not necessarily the industry or knowledge to make new ones.

Take out engine manufacturing as well, and now cars exist, but their secrets need to be rediscovered.

Harry Potter takes place in a magic apocalypse, a dark age. Power and knowledge increased from the time of the Founders, but it was passed along guarded master-apprentice lines. To consolidate power, Grindelwald launched a global campaign to recruit or destroy masters and apprentices of all magical industries. The magical world had just begun to rebuild when Voldemort--being just a step fresher than the new, magically crippled, generation, is nearly the peak of pre-dark-ages magic--does a repeat performance.

Spells that are known are learned as a matter of technique -- "Swish, flick, say OOOH-sa, not ooSAH", rather than derived arithmantically. Just as you may learn to drive a car, and a car is powerful, even if another car will not be produced for 40 years.

School is mostly an exercise in learning techniques anyway, so the school system has endured. But adults are essentially older, working children, in terms of magic.

The world is filled with powerful, unreproducible magical artifacts.

Dumbledore is himself a relic of that bygone age. He is doing his best to perform original research, keep society together, defend against the resurfacing of Voldemort, and find more geniuses to help rebuild magic. Even if some of those geniuses are Evil.
