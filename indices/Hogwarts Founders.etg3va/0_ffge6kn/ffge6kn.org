Here's some of my favorites.

Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance - Salazar Slytherin is reincarnated as Hermione Granger. Great premise, great writing. It's ongoing but updated fairly regularly and is already the length of several novels covering each year at school.

Of a Linear Circle - I love this series. It's a bit of a slow build and massive but absolutely worth it. It involves time travel with some of the stories set in the canon era and others in the founders era, with the best founders era worldbuilding I've seen.

Why to Sort a Student is a Horrible Job - Reincarnation, very funny.

Basilisk-born - Time travel, Harry is Salazar. The author isn't a native English speaker so the writing can be a little iffy in places but the story is fantastic.
