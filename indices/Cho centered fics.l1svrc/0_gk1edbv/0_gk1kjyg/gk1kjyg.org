I have always dreamt about the story, where somebody adult (Lupin?) would explaining Harry that if he waits and sticks with Cho while she is grieving (and there is no rulebook how to grieve, everybody does it in their own style and time frame), he can get very solid foundation for the relationship in future.

Otherwise, “The Stag and the Swan by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14031036) is one lovely rewrite of their date in Hogsmeade (unfortunately, it is just a one-shot without much any longer story to it), and linkao3(26066122) is just a small complaint against (yet another) stupidity in films.

Also, “Harry Potter and the Gang of Giggling Girls by Glee-chan” linkffn(11268925), which despite its unfortunate name is neither stupid nor porn (as would fem!Harry suggest).
