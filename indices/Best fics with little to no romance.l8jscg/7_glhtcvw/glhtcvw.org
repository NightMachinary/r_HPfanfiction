I have always enjoyed sorting AUs or stories that be begin in first year, so my recommendations reflect that.

My first recommendation would be "Becoming Harry Potter".

It is about Harry being sorted into Slytherin together with Ron. It has no romance so far and should there ever be one, there are no signs that it will be a central aspect.

There is also "On the Way to Greatness", but I assume you already know this one as it is quite popular.

"Old Blood" is another one, though it has not been updated in a while. Harry is in Gryffindor, but from the very beginning it is clear that there are several clear deviations from canon. Like the other stories I recommended, it is well written and does not feature bashing of any kind or riddiculous characterizations of Dumbledore.
