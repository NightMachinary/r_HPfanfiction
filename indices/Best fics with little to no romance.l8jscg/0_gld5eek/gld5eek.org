[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28991619][Still Standing]] linkao3(28991619) - Percy-centric, post-war. I'd say it's background Percy/Oliver, because this is really a character study of Percy and coming to terms with himself.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26243248][Beneath This Mortal Earth]] linkao3(26243248) - Andromeda-centric, post-war. Retelling of the myth of Demeter and Persephone.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23576830][sometimes we've gotta let it go to waste]] linkao3(23576830) - Remus and Sirius (sort of) raise Harry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22103842/chapters/52754038][Dear Mum]] linkao3(22103842) - the Weasley kids write home to Molly.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255][Employee of the Month]] linkao3(14842689) - Remus-centric, post-first war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27049720/chapters/66040888][Bad Education]] linkao3(27049720) - Tom Riddle-centric. He gets the DADA teaching position, chaos (and hilarity) ensues.

And if I may throw one of my own fics in... [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24095437][is this hell?]] linkao3(24095437) - Regulus-centric. Exploring his and Sirius's relationship if he hadn't died in the cave.
