  Andromeda did not weep for her daughter. She could not. It cut deeper than tears, deeper even than pain. She felt nothing as she watched a yawning crevasse open where moments ago the Hogwarts stone had kissed the edges of Dora's body. The vines and soil of the next place rose up and engulfed the body, the last remnants of Andromeda's husband and child. The tendrils wrapped around Dora and wrested her from her mother's grasp, swallowing her beneath this mortal earth. A magical realism retelling of the myth of Demeter and Persephone.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)
