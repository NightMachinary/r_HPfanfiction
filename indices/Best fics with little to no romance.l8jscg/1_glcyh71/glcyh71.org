Anything by TheDivineComedian. Their writing is incredible, they really expand the world and delve into little stories about Dementors and boggarts and Remus and it's all great... Wolfstar is assumed but never the focus. linkao3(They're Hiding Inside Me by TheDivineComedian)

linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) is an adventure story where Harry is sent to 1978. He doesn't find his parents but gets dragged into the war in his own way. There's vigilantes, pirates, a prison break. It's just absolutely fantastic! Every character is there for a purpose and watching them all grow throughout the story is so satisfying!
