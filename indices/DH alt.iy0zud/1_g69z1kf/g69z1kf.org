I'm currently reading The Bureaucratic Error by Iniga - it is a Remus-centric AU starting in PoA.

So far Ginny and Harry are just friends, no clue where the author is taking this, but the story is very good. WIP, but 88 chapters / 386,042 words and regular updates by an author who has been writing for 15+ years.
