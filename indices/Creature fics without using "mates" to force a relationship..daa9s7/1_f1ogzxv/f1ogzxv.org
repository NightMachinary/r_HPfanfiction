There's "Enter the Dragon" over on Questionable Questing (it's PG-13 despite the sites reputation) where Harry turns into a dragon a young age. He proceeds to dragonish things (at least acording to ayoung child)

I'd link it, but I'm on mobile.

Also, it's definitly not mate or die, but Harry does accrue a collection of "Maidens" (dragons are always kidnapping them, so they must be a particularly valuable for of treasure) throughout the fic, but being a dragon, Harry matures much slower than a human and the relationships are all along the good friend/big sister line. It's actually noted as likely to be a problem in the future when Harry goes through dragon puberty.
