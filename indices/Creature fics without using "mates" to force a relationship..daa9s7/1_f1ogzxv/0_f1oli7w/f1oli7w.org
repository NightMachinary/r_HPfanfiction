Is there a policy on direct links to QQ here? I know some forums have a strong 'no never' on QQ links, if not I am happy to go get it.

I really like this story, it is a fully authorized continuation of another author's work. Its a bit uneven in tone, there are some chapters that are just poop and fart jokes and crack, and others that are completely serious. It is a good story anyway and being a dragon is taken to its appropriately horrifying bounds at times, which is a refreshing change from 'oh, how nice.'
