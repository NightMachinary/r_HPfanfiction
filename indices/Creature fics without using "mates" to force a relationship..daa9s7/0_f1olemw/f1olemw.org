Saphroneth: Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/]]

It's not finished one, but I found it satisfying read as it is and looks to be updated regularly. Harry changed to a dragon in his childhood and thought it was a perfectly normal thing that sometimes happens, but that's because Muggles didn't see his true form. The story deals much with the rights of magical creatures and how to deal in the world of humans when you are differently shaped. To me, it also feels cosy because Harry hoards books and he loves reading the same books I read when I was a teenager. No ships, everyone is so young and Harry is different species.
