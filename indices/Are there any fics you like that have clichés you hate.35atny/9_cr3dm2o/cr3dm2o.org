in general I loathe Harry/Ginny. I hate in canon too. I feel that Ginny was just a little fangirl that when she couldnt get her dream guy became well easy would be the best way to put it. That being said. The Soul of the hero stories, and the story before the epilogue, were both good. Not saying they didnt have their issues, SotH had Harry as a complete badass who could not do wrong, while Before the Epilogue made it sound as if Harry was unaffected by the war. both really worthy reads tho.
