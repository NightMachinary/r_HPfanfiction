Yeah, I've seen a few that just mention them, but seem to treat it more like a muscle. It can be exhausted, it can be strained, you can increase it through training. I don't mind that, because that gives the characters some power to change their circumstances and they're not just 'born' with a level of 9000 or 2, but can become powerful through learning and practice.
