I don't think they can be used well. Magical cores result in two things:

A) Characters who are innately more magically powerful than others from birth.

B) Characters running out of magic during an action sequence.

Both of these points undermine the role of characterisation in a story. Instead of events being dictated by your characters' personality and choices, they're dictated by arbitrary factors which the author fixed. That's just bad writing and unsatisfying to the reader: conflict is best resolved in a way that stems from the characters' natures.

I always like to draw a comparison with a car chase in an action movie. You don't want to see someone win a car chase because the other guy ran out of gas. Nor do you want to see someone win a car chase because they were born with an arbitrary number of "car chase points".

You want to see the car chase determined by the hard-earned skill of the drivers, and their strength of will/bravery/perseverance.
