  Reason A) may set up a hierarchy in the magic power stakes, but so what? Aside from the quantifiable aspects, is this really any different from any skill in real life?

  For instance, I can play piano decently for an amateur and have some natural gifts that help make things easier for me (I have perfect pitch and unusually large and flexible hands, e.g.) While I don't use up "piano mana" when I play, I do get fatigued (mentally and physically) when I practice for too long and I have to work to make sure my limited time at the keyboard is efficient. I also know that others (my son, e.g.) are far more naturally talented than me, can practice for longer, with better focus, and had better instruments, parental support and teachers during the key formative years.

The difference is essentially one of complexity, and therefore realism/believability.

No one could doubt that natural talent plays a considerable role in musical skill. However, admission of natural talent is a long way from being equivalent to magical cores.

Natural talent at piano is the result of innumerable factors both genetic and developmental which affect brain structure and chemistry in ways so complex that they're still far beyond our current understanding. It likely involves thousands of genes all interacting in different ways with environmental factors during formative years. On top of that you have the issues of discipline, hard work, and quality of training. Not to mention more physical factors like hand size.

Compare this to a single numerical value which accounts entirely for differences in natural ability at a broad range of technically and theoretically diverse skills.

The real world is complex, and while magic is not biology, it should be of a convincingly similar complexity if it wishes to convey a sense of realism to the reader.

This is why I like the "no core" approach, because it makes magic essentially determined by mental and physical factors in a similar way to non-magical skills.

I think magical cores /could/ be done well, if they were shorthand for a kind of fully developed "magical biology" in which the human body had a non-physical magical system equivalent to a biological system of organs, vessels and tissues. The configuration of this system would depend on a large number of factors which could alter the system in innumerable variations. Instead of outputting a single value of magical skill, the various configurations of the system would preference natural ability with certain types of magical skills, though rare individuals would have a natural predisposition to all (or at least a great many) skills.

  For example, your reason B) still involves the choice of when and how to use one's magic if it's a limited commodity. This in many ways is more satisfying to me than someone just spamming spells all day in a jbern-esque spellchain.

I agree that "spam magic" is boring, but I don't think that's the natural result of non-exhaustible magic. If the attacker has non-exhaustible magic, so does the defender. That means that spamming a spell at someone isn't going to overcome their defence: if it wasn't strong enough to overcome their defence the first time, it wouldn't be any other time, which just repeats the exact same circumstance. This means that the only way to overcome someone in such a situation is either to out-think them tactically, or be the superior caster of magic (i.e. you have a spell stronger than their defence in a one-to-one comparison).

Indeed, it seems to me that it's the exhaustible system of magic that more favours spamming spells at people, as it's only in an exhaustible system that you can hope that the defender will "run out" of magic before you do.
