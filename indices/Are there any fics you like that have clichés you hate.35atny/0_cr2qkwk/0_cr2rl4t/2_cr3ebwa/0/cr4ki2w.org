While I don't enjoy magical cores in Harry Potter fanfiction, I don't think the idea is necessarily a mark of bad writing, particularly in other fictional works (e.g, Butcher's /Dresden Files/ or David Drake's /Lord of the Isles/).

For example, your reason B) still involves the choice of when and how to use one's magic if it's a limited commodity. This in many ways is more satisfying to me than someone just spamming spells all day in a jbern-esque spellchain.

Reason A) may set up a hierarchy in the magic power stakes, but so what? Aside from the quantifiable aspects, is this really any different from any skill in real life?

For instance, I can play piano decently for an amateur and have some natural gifts that help make things easier for me (I have perfect pitch and unusually large and flexible hands, e.g.) While I don't use up "piano mana" when I play, I do get fatigued (mentally and physically) when I practice for too long and I have to work to make sure my limited time at the keyboard is efficient. I also know that others (my son, e.g.) are far more naturally talented than me, can practice for longer, with better focus, and had better instruments, parental support and teachers during the key formative years.

Like any skill worth doing, effort and ability both matter. We can control the former; the latter is luck of the draw. True prodigy requires serious amounts of both and recognizing the existence of natural talents in addition to manufactured ones doesn't diminish the idea of prodigy significantly, in my opinion.
