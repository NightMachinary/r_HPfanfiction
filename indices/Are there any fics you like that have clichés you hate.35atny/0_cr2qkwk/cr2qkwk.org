There are many good fics that incorporate the "magical core". Its such a, for a lack of a better word, anime thing to do. I mean, yea, Harry and Dumbles are strong. But there gotta be a different way of making that visible without making me picture a glowing ball of energy in their chests. In some of the more ridiculous usages of these cores I half expect Ron to ask for a power-level at some point. And its definitely over 9000 for Harry.
