I don't usually like powerful!Harry, however [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10714425/1/Messing-With-Time][Messing with Time]] makes it work by grounding it in Harry's skill/knowledge as an auror. I don't know if there are other fics that focus on this angle, but it makes /so much sense./

Harry's able to break into Azkaban /because he's Head Auror,/ not because he has 8 animagi forms. He knows the playbook.
