Dude, if you value your sanity, stay as far away from Tsume Yuki as absolutely possible. Never have I seen an author start this many interesting stories and then abandon close to every single one. Never!

I suppose, if you can live with starting to read tens of good stories and forever be left unsatisfied, you can give her a shot. But.. be careful! :(
