  if it's a Harry/Ginny ship then Hermione reports to Dumbledore

Huh, is this really a thing, or something you just made up? In my experience, most Harry/Ginny stories are canon friendly, and generally keep to canon characterizations. Dumbledore bashing is present in some stories, but it's not as common as other ships. Hermione is almost never bashed. Where on earth did you that from?
