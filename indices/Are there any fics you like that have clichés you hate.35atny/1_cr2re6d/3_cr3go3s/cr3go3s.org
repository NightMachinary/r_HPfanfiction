For the most part I agree with you, Soul Bond fics are a big no no. But there's always a black sheep.

As the black sheep for soul bonds fics, I nominate [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9322278/1/Black-Bond][Black Bond]], it's not overly romanticized which is what tends to be the main issue and it's just written well overall in my opinion. It's not H/Hr either so that's good.
