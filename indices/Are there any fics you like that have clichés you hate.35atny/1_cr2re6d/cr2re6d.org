Anything with a "soul bond", whether is spurned on by 'true love's first kiss'. I usually expect it to magically blend the power and abilities of the two in question, with evil!corrupt!Dumbledore. And if it's a HHR fic, Ron is either clueless/ignorant or gets jealous and "shows his true ugliness within" and Ginny becomes a manipulative child about it and tries to get Harry back.
