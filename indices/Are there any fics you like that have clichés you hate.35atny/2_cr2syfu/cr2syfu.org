/Wastelands of Time/. Not only is it unapologetically Super!Harry, but the Harry in that story seems to have /nothing/ in common with the Harry Potter from canon. I usually hate this sort of thing, but Joe somehow makes it work.

/On the Way to Greatness/ is almost completely a rehash of canon events. I have very little patience for rehashes in general, yet OtWtG happens to be my favorite story of all time.

/Backwards With purpose/ has many tropes I dislike in time travel stories -- Harry does his school years again, they try to change the timeline as little as possible, Harry admits to time-travel readily to characters in the new timeline etc. I still love the story and many of my favorite moments in fanfiction are part of it.

/Equal and Opposite/ has that ridiculous love potion Ginny trope that I always despised. I despise it in this fic as well, but the rest of the story is good enough to make me overlook it. Still, I like the story /in spite/ of the trope, and most certainly not /because/ of it.
