Oh god yes. I normally hate Wrong Boy Who Lived fics, because they tend to have James and/or Lily just deciding to abuse Harry for no fucking logical reason.

The Sacrifices Arc doesn't have extreme abuse, but Harry is kind of neglected and brainwashed. I should hate this, but it's done so well, that I can't help liking it.

Even the character bashing didn't put me off.
