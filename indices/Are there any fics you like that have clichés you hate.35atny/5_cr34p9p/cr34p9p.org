The Sacrifices Arc by lightning on the wave (of Limyaael's fantasy rants fame) contains so much of this. I guarantee that if you read any of the fic summaries it will be full of 'oh god no', but it's all done really really well because /that was the point/. It's like the Belgariad of HP fanfiction.
