[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7261904/1/The-Reluctant-Lord][The Reluctant Lord]] by SmallBurnyThing has the unique distinction of hitting nearly every single one of my non-technical pet peeves (Powerful!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore, harem, Submissive!Hermione, magical oaths, titles of nobility that mean something, Ron- and Molly-bashing, etc.), yet doing it in a sufficiently rich and interesting way that I still enjoyed reading it. Unfortunately, it's abandoned, though the author uploaded a chapter outlining what he had planned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6948912/1/][Reconnaissance]] by Albernheit had an I Swear on my Motes device for Harry not putting his name into Ye Olde Goblet, though I guess that one is forgivable, since (in the context of the fic), Goblet of Fire is an artifact whose function is to judge impartially, so the "Magical Oath" can be viewed as supplicating to it.
