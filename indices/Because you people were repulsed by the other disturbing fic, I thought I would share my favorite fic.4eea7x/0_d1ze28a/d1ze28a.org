See, the problem with fics like these is that they're clearly written with the intent of being messed up, and that completely destroys the novelty of it. There's nothing shocking about a fic that exists only to be shocking. That's why the fic about Dobby using his sock in sexual ways doesn't repulse me at all, because that's clearly what it's meant to do.
