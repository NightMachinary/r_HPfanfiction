I'd recommend my favorites:

Linkffn(The Arithmancer; Lady Archimedes; Annals of Arithmancy) the Arithmancy series is Hermione centric and focused on math. Must read for any nerd who wondered if you could modify a light spell into a laser beam... And for anyone who's wondered if something like that would result in a published research paper.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) Hermione expelled from Hogwarts. Harry and Ron train to fight Voldemort without her help (or so they think). When the two become aurors after Hogwarts and work hard to track down remaining Death Eaters and a group of very skilled thieves, the last thing they expect is that it's their friend under the mask.

Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) Death Eaters behaving like literal nazis, gaining power through propaganda? The Minister is trying /appeasement?/ Muggleborns get thrown out of Hogwarts by Umbridge? And others get killed while "resisting arrest"? And the Malfoys are holding a summer ball where all their rich bigoted Death Eater friends are all in the same place? Let's blow it up! Very brutal action war fic.
