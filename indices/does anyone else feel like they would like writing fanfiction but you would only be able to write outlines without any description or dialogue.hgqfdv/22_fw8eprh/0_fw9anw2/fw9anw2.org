This! I'm also incredibly self-conscious about my grammar/language skills. I'm not a native English speaker and know I didn't pay too much attention to the grammar lessons in school all these years ago. Consequently, I probably have these huge knowledge gaps I'm not even aware of.

However. I decided to just write for fun and practice and post the stories that feel exciting after some proof-reading with Grammarly. Not everyone reading is a native speaker or grammar pro, some will notice my eventual mistakes and tolerate it while others might stop reading but at least I had fun and got a little bit better along the way :)
