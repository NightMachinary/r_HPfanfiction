I do actually write. However I have a rule of no posting until I finish a book. This has cause situations like one ongoing series that has 4 or 5 books 99% done cause I can't write an ending I'm content with to save my life.

There's also the minor factor of I do have a finished book or two that I haven't posted because I don't want to deal with figuring out how to post.

The ending thing is probably because I can do dialogue but outlines tend to escape me.
