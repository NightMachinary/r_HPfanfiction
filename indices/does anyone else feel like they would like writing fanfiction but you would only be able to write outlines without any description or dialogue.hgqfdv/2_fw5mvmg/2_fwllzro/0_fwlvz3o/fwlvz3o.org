A native 4 or 5 arc version would be nice. I know using anything besides the standard 3 arc is rather niche, so not really a major issue. But besides that I don't know. I don't delve too much into the other aspects of it. Preferring to just use word documents for characters and timelines etc.

But quite good for mapping out scenes and chapters. As well as POV characters for the chapters. We'll see if I get myself moving on the writing front after August and I can give a better estimate in how it's helped me with actual writing.
