I write very bluntly, without paragraphs of description or anything. Which tends to work better with fanfiction, when set in already existing places, since readers usually know what I'm referring to and already have an image for it in their minds.

That being said... I don't write very well, either, and I have many fanfiction ideas. I've actually written a few of the many I've had, and they have gotten decent reception on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] and AO3, even though it's been almost 2 1/2 years after I wrote a one-shot, people still want sequels. I'm just not sure what I was thinking 2 1/2 years ago, so it's going to be difficult.
