Go for it!

I used to think like that too, but then I started writing and wrote continuously for 26 days! One chapter per day, and uploaded them without giving myself a chance to criticize myself.

That way, I got over the confidence issue, and learned through experience, writing better and better as chapter progressed!

All the best!
