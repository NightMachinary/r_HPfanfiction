It's mainly how I operate, honestly. The outline isn't what gets published though so if it works for you to write a bare outline and tweak as you go along to make sure themes and plot points connect, then go for it!

My advice is, if that's how you work best then you may just want to make sure you complete the work completely before you start posting so you can go back and make sure everything winds up connecting.

My current work is an Auror casefic which makes it hard to stick to an outline 100% because you kind of have to build off of plot twists and unexpected bits that you may not have even thought of in the beginning. I actually made a detailed outline this time but still wound up cutting out scenes and adding new ones. Just get comfortable with changing directions when it makes sense.
