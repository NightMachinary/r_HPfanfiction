I have the opposite problem. It's hard to come up with good ideas that haven't been written already! By idea/outline, I mean having a premise, conflict, climax, resolution... It's easy to say "what if Harry met Daphne on the Express instead of Ron", but it's hard to figure out what the conflict would be and come to an emotionally satisfying conclusion all the while providing some unique twist to make your story actually interesting.
