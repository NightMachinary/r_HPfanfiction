There are many ideas for stories which do not require that much thought but haven't been written so far. For example, Harry asking Padma to be his yule ball date because he thought that she was Parvati from behind. Padma would probably know about the Cho thing and adjust her expectations, leading to a slightly different Yule Ball and possibly a romance down the road.

Or Harry/Lavender, either at Hogwarts (Yule Ball, comforting her after Ron left her) or afterwards (hasn't been done without bashing everyone under the sun).

If you want, I can give you a whole list of plot ideas I had which haven't been done to my knowledge.
