Not every story needs to be a 7-year saga.

For the Padma one, it would basically be whatever you want her to be. Personally, I would make her understanding, add conflict between her and Cho and, without either really wanting it, having them develop an attraction over the evening.

For the Lavender one, well, it depends on when you set it. The obvious would be Harry comforting her, one thing leading to another and then have conflict with Ron, who suddenly is unsure about his feelings towards Hermione and Lav and feels betrayed despite telling Harry countless times that he had no further interest in Lavender.
