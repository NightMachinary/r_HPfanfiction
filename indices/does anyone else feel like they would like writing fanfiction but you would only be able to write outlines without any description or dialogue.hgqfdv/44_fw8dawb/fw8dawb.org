That's actually how my first couple of fics were written. They were pretty much outlines that could have been fleshed out into longer stories with dialogue and everything but I didn't know how yet. Eventually I started getting more comfortable and figuring out how to add more descriptions and dialogue and all.

But even the outlines can be fun to read!
