Absolutely. But that's just the untalented author in me. I could be given a topic and throw so many side bumps and expected details, so manys storylines, and even divergent paths from canon but I just don't have the skill to bind that all together with dialogue and character(s) progression.

People underestimate what it takes to author a novel, a fanfiction, or even a series.
