My #1 tip is to sit down without any written outline to stick to and write ONLY dialogue. Just the conversation. Like you are talking to yourself but you are both characters. Then add the rest later.

Also, I write fairly well on A03 for people into weird ass shit but I'd like to do something nice today/tomorrow/this week/I'm bad at schedules.

People, pop some one shot ideas or longer plots that could be summed up in a letter or address to someone else and I'll pick at least one to write for ya on A03
