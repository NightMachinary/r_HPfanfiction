Okay this used to happen to me early on. (It still does but I would like to think I have gotten better. Hey let me live in my dreams...) I have been on fanfiction on around 10 years majorlynaa a reader but I write more often now. I have written pretty cringeworthy dialogues. All I can say that they get better with experience.

I just imagine the characters having the conversation in my head (of course I do not hear voices /avoids eye contact whilst whistling forcibly/ )and just think of what things they absolutely won't say. For instance a particular character doesn't curse because it's uncouth(it's just one example I actually think over a few points at least also including what that person is likely to say), the rest of it is my playground. (And I play like a messy baby)

I also have a tendency of using dialogues as info dumps. I am trying to master that art...
