A unique idea I've never really seen one is one in which Harry chases immortality himself (but tries to do it better than Voldemort). There are a few interesting backstory reasons this might work well:

- Harry is the rightful heir to the Deathly Hallows
- His ancestors' motto was "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death"
- Harry's parents are obviously dead; he might reject death entirely as something that should be applied to good people
- As the last hope of the people against Voldemort, survival is his top priority
- Harry deflected the Killing Curse as a child

There are so many cool things that could be done here. Harry could team up with Diary Riddle into a true solution for immortality, all while battling Voldemort at the same time. There is so much room for worldbuilding and exploration, as Death isn't something you conquer in a weekend trip. I can see Harry raiding to ancient Egyptian tombs, investigating covens of vampires or other creatures that live unnaturally long, opening a portal to the Phoenix world to see what the deal is with their immortality.

There are also a lot of cool things you could do with Book 1. The Sorcerer's Stone is not something Harry would be able to retrieve from the mirror, after all... but he would definitely try. If the stone isn't destroyed in this scene, then perhaps he would later attempt to raid the Flamel estate and steal it himself (or at least try to steal the notes from which it was created). He would fail of course.

If you want morally (dark-)grey, you could do some really neat things. As the Voldemort situation gets worse, and Harry has no practical solution in sight, he might resort to making a single Horcrux out of of someone unquestionably terrible. Bellatrix after she murders Sirius, Pettigrew himself, or someone else. You could then have a very cool scene where he's very publicly executed by Voldemort, but then he's back again thanks to this Horcrux. But he would be a bit more off-kilter after this and realize that this is probably his last chance.

There would also be an interesting dynamic with Dumbledore around this.

Honestly the HP series makes /many/ references to immortality, more than usual in this category, but it's something I haven't seen reflected much in fanfic. I think there is a lot of unexplored cool stuff here.
