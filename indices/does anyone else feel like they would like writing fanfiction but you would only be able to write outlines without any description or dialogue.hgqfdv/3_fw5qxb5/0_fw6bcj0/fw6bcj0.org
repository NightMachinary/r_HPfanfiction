Saaame. I can get a great idea in my head and write rabidly, sometimes for days or weeks, then I hit the end of my 'daydream' and lose all inspiration to continue. Not because I don't /want/ to, but because I literally can't 'see' what comes next. It's like I was watching a movie and someone turned off the TV. That /always/ happens, without exception, unless the story I'm writing is literally only a one-scene joke plot. And I never, ever manage to get much past that point, because if I try, it inevitably comes out terrible.

And sometimes I'll already be writing, and a game-changing thought occurs to me, but it contradicts something that happened earlier--usually something which was pivotal to the story ending up at that point in the first place.

Only once can I remember the game-changing thought actually fitting in with the original plot. It was like I'd been writing it that way from the beginning, and it was /glorious./ (Until my inner TV shut off as always. T_T)
