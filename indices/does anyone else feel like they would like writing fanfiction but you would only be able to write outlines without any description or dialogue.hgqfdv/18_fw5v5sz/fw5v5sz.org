I do write and I loved writing fanfic while I did, but I still shelve some ideas. I have snippets and outlines and one liners and all sorts and there's no chance to write them all. So I just enjoy writing the outline and having a think about it, and then I let it go.

That said, if you enjoy writing, then do it, even just outlines. And you can practice prose in private til you're more confident, or just never share if you don't want to. It's your hobby, your rules.
