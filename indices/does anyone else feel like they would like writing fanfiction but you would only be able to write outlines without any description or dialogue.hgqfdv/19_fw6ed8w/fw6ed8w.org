I think everyone starts off feeling like that, in all honesty. I certainly did, back when I started writing. The only guaranteed cure, unfortunately, is to practice and research.

Writing until you work out how you wanna write is basically the first level of being a writer. If you're struggling with that, thinking that you're just gonna be bad and comparing yourself to the Big Names in FF that you've read or published Authors you enjoy, just remember - you don't have to be as good as them. In fact, if you're just starting out, you're almost certain not to be. But even if you can't be as good as those people, you can always, always, always be as bad as them. And remember, in the 1850s, a Portuguese-English phrasebook written by a man who couldn't actually speak English got published. And then republished several decades later.

Research is where the second level comes along. Basically, read stuff you wanna emulate and google stuff to help you. Nearly every published author 'how to get better at writing' thing I've ever seen recommends reading as a big way to improve. You might've seen the Fanfiction thing about Authors and other Creators not being able to read our stuff? This is the main reason why - Authors don't wanna read something a fan has wrote and pilfer phrasing or ways of describing stuff for their own work. And regarding research, if you find that you're struggling to write descriptions, go find stories that you think do it well, or go find resource lists of how to describe things (There are pages of websites on word and phrase resources to describe different things, like eyes, or sadness, or breakfast - and the 'describingwords' resource is invaluable [link below]).

For me, a good learning resource to develop the actual techniques came from D&D - being a player and a DM really helps teach those kinds of skills. I'm not the best at them now, by any means, but I'm definitely writing better prose than when I started, so I'd recommend looking up some tutorials on DMing and how they tell stories, describe scenery, or keep battles from descending into "Roll a D20. You hit! You do six damage. Now you roll a D20, you miss. Now you roll a D20- and so on".

The third level I forgot to mention - Editing. Even if your first draft is literal shit, you can edit it into gold. :)
