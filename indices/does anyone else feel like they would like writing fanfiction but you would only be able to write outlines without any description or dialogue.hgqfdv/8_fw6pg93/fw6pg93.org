One bit of advice I was given about writing dialogue was to just write out the main points of the conversation in bullet points, almost like writing a play where its character A line, character B line and so on. And a couple of basic descriptions about what's happening. Then go back and fill in who is saying what, tweak the words to "fit" your character and add in the description around that.

So you'd start with something like this:

/Sirius couldn't believe he was free. And now he had something to ask Harry./

/-Did anyone ever tell you I'm your godfather?/

/-yes/

/- would you like to live with me?/

/- oh that would be great/

/Sirius wondered why Harry was so keen to leave his aunt's home./

So you now know the dialogue you want to write is between Sirius and Harry about moving in (yeah I've taken something v similar to PoA canon because my brain CBA to come up with something original today!) and you can tweak it to make it a "proper" writing draft:

/"Harry," began Sirius, clearing his throat awkwardly. "I don't know if anyone ever told you, but I'm your godfather."/

/"Well, I wouldn't say they told me, they never tell me anything. But yeah, I know." Harry scowled and kicked at the marbled floor of the ministry corridor. If only he had known about Sirius before. If only the man had been given a trial twelve years ago. He could have grown up with someone who, at the very least, tolerated him./

/"I know you probably won't want to, but James and Lily, that is, your mum and dad, erm, I'm not very good at this," Sirius trailed off and rubbed a hand over his gaunt face. "They wanted me to look after you if anything happened. So, if you'd like to..."/

/Harry gaped at him./

/"Leave the Dursleys? Live with a real wizard? Are you joking me? Of course I bloody want to. When can I move in?!"/

/Sirius hadn't been expecting quite as enthusiastic a response. After all, Harry barely knew him. There was clearly something else going on here, and he knew he would be having a very serious conversation with one Albus Dumbledore as soon as those papers stating his innocence were in his hands./

So once you know that you want to go from A to B to C, you sketch out the basics and then go back and fill in the gaps. There's your first draft.

Hope this helps a little.
