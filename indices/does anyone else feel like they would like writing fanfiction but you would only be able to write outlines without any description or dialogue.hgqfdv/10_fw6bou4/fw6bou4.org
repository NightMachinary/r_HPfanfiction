ITT we have people who can write well but find plotting difficult and people who can't write for shit but think they have good ideas for plots and outlines. I say we pair up. Write a short summary of fic you want to write and your strengths: A) Plotting OR B) Writing. If you don't have a short summary, approach the people who do and offer them your services. Writing in pairs can be a good exercises and both people can learn from each other, bounce ideas off each other and maybe even motivate each other. It might not be for everyone, but some of us can finally be able to produce something, and even if it is shitty, at least we tried. Sitting on our thumbs is not going to lead us anywhere anyway.
