Same here. I've got like 10 or so polished fic ideas, but no ability to actually make it a story.

Heck, I've got an idea for an original story, but I can't even decide if it should be set in like the early 2000s, or in the early 1900s. One would work better in that I lived through it and therefore have a decent reference point for the culture of the time, while the other would work better on the basis of communication speed, what with a distinct lack of cellphones and all.

In that same vein, I'm basing the story off of anime romcom tropes, but with ideas of my own mixed in (ie traveling the world instead of staying in a single area the whole time). So should it start in Japan, or America? If I did Japan, I'd likely choose early 1900s since a lot of people left Japan back then to either see the sights or settle down in America, while an American protagonist in the early 2000s would likely have a similar reason for visiting Japan.

Both have a disaster involving travel that I feel would fit the story as a gut punch without feeling contrived for its inclusion.

For whatever reason, trying to write fanfiction just compounds all my self doubt because at that point my story isn't in a vacuum because there are thousands of stories using all the same characters as me, which makes it exponentially more intimidating to attempt.
