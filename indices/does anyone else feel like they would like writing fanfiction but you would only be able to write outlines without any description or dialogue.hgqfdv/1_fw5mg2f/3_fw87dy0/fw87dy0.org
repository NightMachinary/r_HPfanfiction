I posted in a separate comment, I write on AO3 and people into what I'm into tend to like it. Any chance you have some one shot or something longer that could be creatively reimagined into a one shot length that you'd like to have written at some point? If I can find inspiration in them I think it would be a positive writing exercise for me.
