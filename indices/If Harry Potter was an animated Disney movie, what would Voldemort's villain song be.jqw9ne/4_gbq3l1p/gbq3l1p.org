Voldemort has a high voice rather than a deep one so it should play on that. He's also not the sort that does big, ostentatious dance numbers; probably shouldn't be anything more than casual pacing and small gestures. Thematically it should play on his ego and casual cruelty. Ergo, I think it would have to be something similar to the King's song from Hamilton.
