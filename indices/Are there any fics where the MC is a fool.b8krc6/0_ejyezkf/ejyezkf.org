Well in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make A Wish]] Harry isn't stupid but clearly has a lot of luck. Bit of a crack fic but quite funny and enjoyable. linkffn(2318355).

It's got a sequel by the same author and another which is a crossover with DC universe (particularly the Justice League Animated Series from early 2000s) called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11965672/1/Terminal-Justice-by-Overkill-AKA-Irrational-Intelligence][Terminal Justice]] (unfortunately unfinished right before the end... before the last chapter if we believe the author on his original publishing site) linkffn(11965672)
