Not sure, I can offer you Percy has hallucinations?

I appreciate that you did only ask for who components, though.

Edit: I remembered [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/812453][this oneshot]] with Harry in. It's very well written. Heads up, unless you feel you need trigger warnings, I would suggest not reading the tags. I didn't, by chance, and was glad as the warnings are spoilers. On re-read, maybe do. Ah. Your choice.
