Couple of Harry/muggle-girl stories:

- linkffn(1120850) ... I would say that this falls in the category harry-behaves-as-jackass-and-nobody-calls-him-out-on-it , but there are some interesting parts
- linkffn(2163835) ... It begins with the story of Harry/girl-next-door, but then it goes really weird, but that first part is nice
- linkffn(2053712) ... Again, not sure about the second half, but it really have some seriously good parts
- linkffn(9566537) ... This one is probably the best of these.

I think most of them are in HBP timeline though.
