I only see it recommended occasionally, but I'll always suggest linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent). Very AU, my favorite "Power He Knows Not" of any fic (including canon), and a great expansion on Moody's character, including a great antagonist for him. It's unfinished, but wraps up Act 2 of the story in the second to last chapter, so I think it's still worth reading.
