I may be using JK Rowling's characters and magical realm, but it's very loosely with my own plot, many of my own characters and at least one major setting/location of my own, so yes. I can report it to the site admins and should have a case. They want to use my original plot, as well as shadows of my original characters and imitations of my original settings. It's mostly my intellectual property.
