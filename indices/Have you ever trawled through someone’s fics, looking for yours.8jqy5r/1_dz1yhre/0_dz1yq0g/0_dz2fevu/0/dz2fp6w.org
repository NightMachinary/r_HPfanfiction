I still see it as taking something which is not theirs. Literally all they do is change names and switch a HP character for another HP character. They have written my story, not word-for-word, but action-for-action, setting-for-setting, dialogue-for-dialogue. When we write fanfiction, we use characters, settings and prompts, but make the story and the world our own - usually. We still have a right to our intellectual property.
