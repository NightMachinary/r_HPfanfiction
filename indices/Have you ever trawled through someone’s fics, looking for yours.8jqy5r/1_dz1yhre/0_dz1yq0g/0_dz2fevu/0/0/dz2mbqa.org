Yes but that is essetially what fanfiction is. How many stories out there are basically the canon books rewritten with minor changes or an exchanged character that basically changes nothing? I'm not saying it doesn't suck, because it does. Im in agreement with you there, but unless whole passages are lifted word for word, I truely don't think much can be done. I'm pretty sure the act of writing fanfic waves any claims we may have had to parts of it under intellectual property. However, i am not a lawyer and thus very well may be wrong and probably am.
