  They want to use my original plot, as well as shadows of my original characters and imitations of my original settings.

That doesn't sound like plagiarism. It's only plagiarism if it's word for word either in part or in its entirety. If they are copying your plot and borrowing your characters and settings but rewriting it in their own words, there's nothing you can do. That's fanfiction I'm afraid. It must be pretty annoying for Rowling too.
