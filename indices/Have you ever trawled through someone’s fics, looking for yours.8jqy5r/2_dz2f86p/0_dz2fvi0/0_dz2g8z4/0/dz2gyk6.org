I mean POOOOOOOR quality. There are some fanfiction authors who are pretty darn good authors and the quality of their works amazes me to see. To think one book series could inspire such greatness in people is insane. That said, they're mostly the ones that use Rowling's world and a few of her characters as a basis for something bigger, more complex and so incredibly in-depth. I like to think I'm nearing that league. I put an immense amount of effort into my work, and it is far more to me than just Harry Potter. It has a mind of its own now and, if I changed some names and tweaked the magic, it would be its own original series entirely. Also, E.L James.
