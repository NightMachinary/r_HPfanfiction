I believe there is a point where it does become plagiarism, where it adheres so closely to your plot and uses characters so much like your original characters and settings so much like your original settings that it might as well be the same story, but perhaps with a different protagonist or with a different coupling. My main worry is that I had seen drafts of this person's work and they clearly didn't have any understanding of my characters to imitate them with, but it was so clearly fanfiction of my fanfiction that anyone reading both works would immediately see the connections and the poor quality of work would reflect on me as an author.
