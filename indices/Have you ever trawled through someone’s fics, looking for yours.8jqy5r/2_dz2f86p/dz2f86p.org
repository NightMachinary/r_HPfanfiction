No, no one's ever likely to plagiarise my work; it's not popular enough. If someone reused 'my' plot or world or characters but written in their own words, I might not like it but there would be nothing I could do and I'd feel an idiot if I tried. That after all is what I'm doing with Rowling's material. But that's not plagiarism, it's just derivative.
