I'm with you, let's let Voldemort just be completely dead the night he attacked the Potter's. It would segue beautifully into the 'manipulative Dumbledore' trope so well it's ridiculous.

It would be a story in which an ever aging, highly respective person, who wields just a smidgen too much political power, corrals and controls the life of the protagonist due to the ramblings of a 'seer' combined with his increasing senility.
