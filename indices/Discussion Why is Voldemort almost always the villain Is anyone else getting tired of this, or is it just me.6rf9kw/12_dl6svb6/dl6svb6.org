I feel like in many fics it's difficult to make a different character take on a Voldy-type role, especially if Voldemort still exists in the story. However, just because there's no other "foes" doesn't mean that Voldemort has to drive the plot. Maybe instead of a Hero-vs-Villain story, turn your story into a Man-vs-Self or a Man-vs-circumstance?

E.g. maybe time-travelling Harry holds almost all the cards and can easily trounce Voldemort (although perhaps at a cost), but he has to examine the moral implications of his actions every step of the way? Is he turning into a terrorist like Voldemort? Is he turning into a manipulative chessmaster like Dumbledore? Is he using his knowledge to accomplish as much as he's obligated to, or wasting time on arguing with himself?
