In order to make Voldemort not /an/ antagonist, you generally have to either have someone else kill his parents, have Voldemort being mind-controlled (often found in evil!Dumbledores), have some other thing make Voldie not in control of his actions, or have some way to make Voldemort not Voldemort (say, by Obliviating him back to childhood.

Alternately, you could have a 'bigger fish' scenario, where you have something so very evil that Voldie goes 'enemy of my enemy', and ends up not being an enemy (by death or redemption) by the end.

Or have Voldie's defeat not be the end (bigger bad), or just have him be to be dealt with, but just not the biggest problem.

Fics that do that can feel... awkward or ill-paced if done poorly, especially if the author heavily relies on canon for structure and pacing and stuff.

At worst, you end up with awkward summary chapters after Voldie falls.
