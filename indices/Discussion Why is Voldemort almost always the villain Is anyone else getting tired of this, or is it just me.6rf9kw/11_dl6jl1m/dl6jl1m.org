I was writing this story where Voldemort died from dragon pox in his first year at Hogwarts Canon!Harry soul gets switched with this Harry's dimension.

The main villain was a Vietnamese witch whose parents died during the Vietnam war by way of napalm bombing, they were researching soul magic (Horcruxes and other stuff) thanks to that they were able to save her (sacrificing themselves) and the woman became really powerful thanks to her parent's research and their sacrifice.

her objective is to reveal the wizarding world and destroy all forms of government (also thin the population) to create her own version of peace so no one has to live what she lived

She is less crazy than Voldemort just as powerful and ruthless and even more dangerous

the kicker was that she was killed by Voldemort in the canon universe
