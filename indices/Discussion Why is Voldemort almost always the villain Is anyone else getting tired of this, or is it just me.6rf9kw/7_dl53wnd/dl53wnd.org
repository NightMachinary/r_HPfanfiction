I would also like some variety. I am currently reading linkffn(Lily's changes). It's middling quality fic that has Harry and Tom Riddle working together to take down Dumbledore. Frankly, it has some of the worst bashing out there and whole chapters can be skipped because it's so cliqued. However, I am through to chapter 15 and it has now become more original. Actually, I am not sure how I lasted until chapter 15 as so many parts are cringeworthy. The writer has a certain charm to their writing that has kept me going.
