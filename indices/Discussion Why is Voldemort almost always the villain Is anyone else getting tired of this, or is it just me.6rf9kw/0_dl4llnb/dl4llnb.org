I think a lot of people are tired with reading Harry vs Voldemort but we're a community of avid fanfiction readers. For a lot of people Harry Potter the series IS Harry vs Voldemort. Then 30-40% of fanfiction and rarely the good part is Harry vs Voldemort done 'right', better known as OP or Indy Harry. Its easy, its what we know and what we first loved in the books. The driving conflict through out the series was Harry vs Voldemort and its only natural that people want more. So many people who first touch the writing side, especially in their teenage years want a 'better' Harry, a Harry who is Voldemort's equal in always.

Post-Hogwarts or stories outside of Hogwarts are very popular but very difficult to write. Essentially they're completely new. Fanfiction is like lego in someways, you're given the pieces and you can make it your own but essentially the pieces are given to you, post-Hogwarts/outside of Hogwarts features new characters or characters who have developed in ways not shown in the books. I personally don't like the epilogue there is almost limitless potential if one ignores the epilogue and/or Pottermore. The problem with limitless is its vague. We like specifications, it makes things easy. I ask you to draw me a masterpiece and you'll stare at the paper blankly not knowing where to start. I ask you to write a 5th year Indy Harry story where he gets stronger, well you could knock one out in a few hours. Editing and improving is infinitely easier than creating something from scratch.

We don't pay for fanfiction (ignoring people who bought Cursed Child) and beggars can't be choosers. If 70% of what is written is Harry vs Voldemort then we either read it or we have very little to read.
