I've seen harry potter and the metamorphmagus mentioned a few times and I'll second that if you haven't read it already. I went on a harry/tonks kick a couple of months ago, and it was by far the best. There is a lot of smut, but also a really fun plot and great character development for harry and tonks. There's even some pretty interesting conversation on the topic of sexual liberation woven into some of the smutty scenes. It's just really well done. I shan't link it here, because several others have already.
