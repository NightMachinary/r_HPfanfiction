  In June of 1980, Voldemort successfully took control of the Magical Ministry. For eleven years, Magical Britain was finally at peace, only a few rebels fighting against the New Ministry. Voldemort stepped out of the limelight after the end of the war, choosing instead to focus on something important: His sonInferius. A four year old Inferius who goes by the name 'Little One' and is completely adored by everyone who meets him. But Little One holds a lot of mysteries. Who is he? How did he die? But most pressing, what is his relationship to the Dark Lord? Everything is fine, of course, until the Order decide to take Little One away from a very protective and possessive Dark Lord. And somehow, that is the least of the Dark Lord's problems. Add one clingy, annoying Death and one all-seeing, secretive Fate and you might just have a story! Follow Voldemort as he struggles through protecting his child, fighting off a very persistent Death, running an entire country, and for Merlin's saKE CAN HE PLEASE BEAT FATE AT ONE BLOODY GAME OF CHESS?????   [Very OOC and not a Tomarry/Harrymort. Recently changed summary, same story!]
