Which means the wards falls to the keeper of the keys (which despite all odds is more than just a fancy title): Hagrid, who frankly couldn't care less about a cute little snake wandering around (He was mildly disappointed that it isn't getting fed, but it's health is improving as of late, so it probably isn't important), a nice old cabinet getting some maintenance after years of neglect (He feels genuine respect to whomever is fixing their furniture the hard way, it takes someone truly special to put in the effort when magic is avalible), a little girl getting a bit too engrossed in writing a diary (He knows the how that can help someone out of a rough spot in their lives, It helped him through his early years, and this half giant ain't no snitch), I can imagine him chewing out moody, for such heinous crimes against spiders.

Edit: forgot the troll, and thus hagrid was visiting Aragog, (that spider doesn't get out much and he feels responsible for that), and thus on Halloween every year he brings him a big gift basket of treats, and spends the night catching up.
