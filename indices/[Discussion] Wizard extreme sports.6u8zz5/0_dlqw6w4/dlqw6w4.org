Creature running. Its when you find a dangerous creature, attempt to either ride it, or get it to chase you. You escape you live.

Similar to our running with the bulls events.

Another idea is spell crafting as it is seemingly dangerous.

Finally my idea personally, especially in Britain, muggle rushing. Its when a wizard goes into the muggle world for a specific amount of time and trys to live...without magic.
