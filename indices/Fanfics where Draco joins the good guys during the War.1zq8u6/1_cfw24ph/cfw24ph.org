Harry Potter and the other Path is great: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=224105]]

Been a while since I've read it but it's one of my favorite AUs with a OOC Harry. Everyone else is close enough to their canon personalities that the differences can be explained through their interactions with Harry and the changes he makes. There are two OC that play a major role later but they're at least tolerable. It has some funny moments, very good action and plot twists and good character development. Features very good characterizations of Anti Voldemort Snape + Draco. Hardly any romance though.
