I wouldn't call it good, necessarily, (it's pretty angsty-emo and has its share of bashing), but there's a about a million words (complete) in Bobmin's [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset/Sunrise over Britain]]. It's Draco/Luna with Draco joining Harry's side.

A better story with Draco on the good side is Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]]. 250k words, complete. (There used to be a WIP sequel, but it's been removed, apparently.)

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.
