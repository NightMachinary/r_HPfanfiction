Brennus has kind of a weird style. On the one hand, he uses the same spells and magic repeatedly, he falls into the magic-is-energy trope, and he writes most of his stories in that way where most of the major characters look like idiots except for a couple fic (and I'm not even sure its meant as bashing either, its odd). On the contrary, he tends to have good banter and dialogue. Ironically, the best part of his Harry Potter fics are the parts that don't include magic. Hail Odysseus is a bit unique, its a Slytherin!Harry fic, but him being in Slytherin is probably one of the least important parts of the book. Also, he tends to make stories where both he and Ginny (always Ginny) are both noted as powerful, which is a gripe I have with a lot of OP Harry stories (no one is on his level except maybe Dumbledore/Voldemort). Honestly, I prefer it when he becomes skilled/powerful, but its by taking advantage of what he has in canon: quick-thinking, creativity, and fast reaction. I can only name a few that really capture that.
