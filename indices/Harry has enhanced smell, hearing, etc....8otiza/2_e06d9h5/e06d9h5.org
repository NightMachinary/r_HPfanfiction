Pretty much Blindness Linkffn(Blindness).

Aside from the obvious enhanced sense of touch, hearing and smell that many blind people develop, Harry possesses what he calls a form of mage sight. To give a very underwhelming explanation, it lets him see magic. If you are Naruto fan, its basically the sharingan but for magic instead of chakra. And this gives him incredible insight into practicing and controlling magic.

Mind you he gets OP halfway through, just so you are aware.
