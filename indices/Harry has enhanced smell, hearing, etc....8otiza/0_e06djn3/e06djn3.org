Hmm...I know I've seen one before where Harry had hypersensitive senses after being exposed to the Cruciatus or something like that. There was a bit where he mistook his heartbeat for footsteps, and nearly deafened himself when he tried speaking. His senses were acute enough that he could sense what was behind doors and hear people speaking from far away.

...I don't remember which fic it was, though. Or if it was a one-shot.
