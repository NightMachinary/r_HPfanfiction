I grew up reading the books. I got the first one when I was six and my mum read it to me. I was seven when the Chamber of Secrets was released and read it by myself. I got the rest of the books the day they were released. When HBP and DH were released I was fourteen and sixteen respectively, both times I convinced my mum to let me have the day off school so I could buy them and then read all day.

This was something I got teased for a /lot/ as few of my friends were into reading at this point, and those that were, weren't into Harry Potter.

I found fanfiction in late 2009 at eighteen when I wanted to read the Artemis Fowl books that I owned but couldn't find. I downloaded them and from there quickly found Artemis Fowl fanfiction. Shortly afterwards I found the Harry Potter fandom and quickly fell in love with the depth and breadth of stories. I've been reading it ever since. I even tried my hand at writing some fanfiction in 2010 but decided writing wasn't for me.

I say all this because even with this experience of growing up with the books, it's only in the last few months that I've really /participated/ in the fandom. I love discussing Harry Potter. I love the world and the magic. I love arguing about theories and head-canon with other fans - and I'm finally doing that with other people who are just as invested in the fandom. There are so many different places for people to talk about it and it's just going to keep growing. You've already found us here, there's also [[/r/harrypotter]] and [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][Dark Lord Potter forums]]. A lot of the fanfiction sites have their own forums.

[[https://www.pottermore.com/][Pottermore]] released new information yesterday and it's already generating conversation and personal revisions of canon. There's big discussion threads here every day that get 100s of comments. An official [[/r/hpfanfiction]] debate was started recently that is just awesome to see.

You haven't /missed/ anything, you're just a little late to a party that has no end in sight. Try to participate as much as you can and I think you'll find it really rewarding.
