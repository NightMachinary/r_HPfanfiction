I strongly disagree. Half the stories on my favorites list are active and updating... It's in vogue to like Harry Potter right now; a huge amount of writers haven't moved on.

I've been reading fanfiction since the books started coming out, and I think the pool of quality material out there has only gotten deeper. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw][If 90% of any one thing is crap]], your late arrival to the genre just means that there is a really large trove of the good 10% for you to go through!

Think on the bright side.
