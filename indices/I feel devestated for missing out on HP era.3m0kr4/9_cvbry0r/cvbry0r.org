I only joined FFN in march and there have been literally thousands of fics written between then and now. The forum I frequent is well moderated and is full of people every day.

The Fandom may no longer be growing exponentially and while some fans "grow out of it" new fans crop up all the time (for example my 8 year old who is currently reading them the first time).

I think the Fandom is pretty stable to be honest.
