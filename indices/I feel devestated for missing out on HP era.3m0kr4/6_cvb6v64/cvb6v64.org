I lived through it... and ignored it, by and large. I was more interested in reading Terry Pratchett than waiting around for Rowling to publish.

Funnily enough, the HP era is just starting for real now. The ideas, themes and communities that grew out of the books have taken on a life of their own and spread across to other media. As for waiting around, well, there's still a LOT of material Rowling or her successor could cover if she/they felt like it.

Besides, fanfiction. There's a lot of crap out there (some published by myself) but the best out there is amazing... and easily as good as a lot of other books being released today.

Don't be fooled-just like with Star Wars, Dune, Star Trek, The Lord of the Rings and many, many other universes out there, the end of the Original publications era is only the beginning.

We have decades of good stuff to look forward to. Don't beat yourself up for missing some of it.
