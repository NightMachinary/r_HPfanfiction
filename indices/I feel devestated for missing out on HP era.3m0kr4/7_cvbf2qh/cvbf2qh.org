Well, in a sense it is different to be part of a fandom during publication vs. after it's completed.

I won't lie: while not a hardcore fan, I was around on the internet while the books were still being published, and spent many hours on forums reading various theories, ideas, etc. It was fun. The theorizing and speculation is really, really fun. The sense of community, of anticipation, the eagerness and mystery. The desperation to know how it all ends. And, of course, the fandom shipwars were great for sitting back and watching with some popcorn.

I've been a part, to some degree at least, several 'ongoing' fandoms (mostly manga-related, like Fullmetal Alchemist and Inuyasha, back when they were still publishing), and it's true that there's a shift in focus and activity once they complete publication. But even those fandoms are still active fic-wise.

Even now, there are several book series that have very active discussion but very little fanfiction for them (for example, the Stormlight Archive series, the Kingkiller Chronicles series, even A Song of Ice and Fire though there's much more fanfiction being written since the shows came out and people are largely starting to ignore GRRM's preference that fans not write fic based on his works). Part of the appeal of unfinished series is the ability to speculate and theorize midway through the story.

That said, some fandoms leave a lot more room for exploration after they're complete than others, and HP is one that leaves a LOT of ground uncovered. There are really limitless possibilities - past generations, present events, future timelines and a new generation. Different places, different groups. Many, many side characters that could be explored. It might not have the same sense of urgency and anticipation, but it's still quite active, and has had much more 'staying power' in terms of fandom activity than other series have had. Much of the best fan-work has been created after the series ended! I'm also expecting a pretty good fandom revival with the new Fantastic Beasts movies.
