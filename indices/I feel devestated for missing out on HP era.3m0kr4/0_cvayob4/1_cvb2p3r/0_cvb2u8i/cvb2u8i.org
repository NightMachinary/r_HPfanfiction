I won't argue with the fact that a lot of it is bad but I will say that it might just feel that way because there are just more Drarry fics in general. If 70% of all fanfiction is crap regardless of pairing, and there are more Drarry fics than not, then of course a larger number of shitty Drarry fics are out there. There's also a larger number of good ones, if you know where to look :)
