Harry Potter still has a huge following and more staying power than a lot of fandoms. As far as fanfiction goes HP tends to have huge amounts of fics, more than a lot of other fandoms or media. Depending on how popular your ships are fanfiction is still being written in droves (I ship Drarry and there is /tons/ of new stuff, all the time.

You might have missed the initial craze but HP is anything but dead.

P.S. if you haven't already go to [[/r/Harrypotter]] and join in! Get sorted too, common rooms tend to be friendlier and more active than the Great Hall (at least my common room is, anyway!)
