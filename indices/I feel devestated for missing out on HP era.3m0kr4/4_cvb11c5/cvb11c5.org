I wouldn't say that you've missed the party, you are just a little late. The main difference is that liking Harry Potter is now considered "cool", whereas I was a "dork" for being a fan all throughout middle school when it started. I have a feeling JKR is going write another book soon (am I the only one getting that vibe with all this new content) and with the addition of the "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" movie, it's only just going to keep up and up.

/Maybe/ fanfiction has been on the slight decline, but you wouldn't know it if you looked on here :)
