The part you missed was a lot of fun. Especially waiting for the books---I'll never forget seeing friends at the bookstore, comparing theories, staying up overnight and trying (usually in vain) to keep from reading the whole thing in one go, arguing on message boards, etc.

And the fandom was bigger too. A little nuts---if you think shippers get testy now, it was ridiculous then---but bustling and fun, though now that I'm older it seems like it would probably be exhausting to deal with.

But all that activity left a lot of cool stuff behind, and whether you were there for it or not that cool stuff is all that would be left for you now, seeing as we don't have pensieves. So don't worry about it too much, and stick around here and help make sure this next push (with new Pottermore stuff and the spin-off movie) is fun, too.
