[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016), diverges a little earlier as both Hermione and Ron left Harry in the tent. They were soon caught and brutally murdered. Harry led an one man war for several years until he freed Daphne Greengrass.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771): Voldemort returned in 2001, more powerful than ever and in the form of zombie battleship BismarckMort. But fortunately for the good guys, HMS Hood has also been recalled to fight her nemesis once again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Voldemort attacked the Wedding and killed most Weasleys. Things pretty much become a huge cluster fuck until the badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville accidentally end up in a new dimension.
