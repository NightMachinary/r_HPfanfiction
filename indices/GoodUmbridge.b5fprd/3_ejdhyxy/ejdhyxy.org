In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] both Umbridge and Rita Skeeter are portrayed as more complex than their one-dimentional canon incarnations. Rather than being universally horrible to everyone, they turn out to be highly competent and useful allies.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11687216/1/The-Carriage-Held][The Carriage Held]] portrays Umbridge as a bit more sympathetic. She's still as horrible to the students as she is in canon, but she also has moments of surprising loyalty and intelligence when not in front of an audience.
