For my money, her being such a perfect "hate-sink" makes her a /vastly/ better villain than Voldemort. "Crazy and homicidal and lusts after infinite power" is some boring-ass cartoonish characterization that's so removed from actual human behavior that it's hard to care about the character.

But "suck-up toady bully who's a low-key sadist" is a person that actually exists. Shit, I had to deal with two of them in one office I worked at. And putting her in the context of a novel that has Harry struggling with PTSD and anger and being-15-ness makes her just perfect.
