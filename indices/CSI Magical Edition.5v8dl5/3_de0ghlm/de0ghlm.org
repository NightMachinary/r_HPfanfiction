  How do you suppose that magical forensics work when wizards have to investigate crimes?
#+end_quote

To be honest, probably rather poorly. I imagine there's ways to figure out what kind of spell caused certain kinds of damage. Combined with the ability to check a wand's previously-cast spells, that's probably all wizarding society has developed. Alongside an apparently loose legal system and truth serums, mind reading, and probably a few other similar truth-extracting options, you don't really /need/ much else for idiot criminals. Crimes of passion, minor theft, and the like.

For a proper motivated criminal, it's probably impossible to catch them. In fact, I suspect, with the ability to wipe memories and the like, the magical legal system is intentionally harsh, in order to show to society that they're /not/ weak on crime despite being completely unable to catch highly intelligent or skilled criminals.

  How would they handle sexual assault/rape cases?
#+end_quote

I bet this one's a real doozy. This is a subject in itself.

On one hand, it'd be pretty easy to not only confirm that a rape (in purely muggle terms) occurred, but to establish a clear suspect. From there, it's just using those truth-extracting methods to figure out if the suspect actually /was/ the rapist, or if some kind of magic was used to conceal the rapist's identity, either intentionally or unintentionally framing somebody.

On the other hand, we're talking about a society that openly advertises and sells love potions, which is potentially more disturbing than seeing a billboard advertising chloroform to solve all your love issues. The existence of love potions adds a whole new dimension of complexity to rape cases, so the magical world may even have a completely different definition of rape. It'd certainly have different laws.

I'm gonna assume having sex with somebody under the effect of love potion, when you know they're under the effect, is illegal. I'm not even certain that would be their law, given that love potions are legal to advertise and sell, but the Imperius Curse is a one-way ticket to Azkaban. It's not worth trying to unravel that here though.

We don't really know how love potions work. If there's no antidote past a certain period, or if some love potions are permanent, it's probably outright unprovable in those cases. If they're temporary, then you run into a situation where the "rapist" might actually just be an innocent party, either not intended to be the target or was intended, but the love potion victim was given love potion by a third party.

Anyways, I think if you want to go the magical CSI route, you'd basically have to invent more practical magic than we actually see in the entire series. You'd need whole new potions and spells to circumvent all the ways magic can cover up crime. That is, if you didn't want to use muggle methods even if they are magically applied.
