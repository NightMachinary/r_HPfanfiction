The thing is, as far as I have read, the plot seems to be rather interesting and I love the idea it, but I do hate the way the author presents the story /and/ himself. It's been years since I tried to read that fic, I remember stopping by the time time turner was used. I have read and suffered throught a lot of worse fics, but I really, really disliked the way it all was presented - the author has the habit of making you feel dumb for not getting his references and then gives out praising for getting the others, basically, I couldn't stand the author and his writing style - he thinks himself to be so /clever/, that the /mortal people who don't read his blog/web-page/ are /beings of reduced intellect./
