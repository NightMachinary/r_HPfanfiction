I feel like this argument goes right next to â€˜she's /actually/ a 1000 year old elf who just happens to look 12, so she's not underage'. They're supposed to be a kid, everyone who looks at the story thinks they're a kid, they're portrayed as a kid. The author deciding the duck is actually a goldfish later on doesn't change matters for most people.
