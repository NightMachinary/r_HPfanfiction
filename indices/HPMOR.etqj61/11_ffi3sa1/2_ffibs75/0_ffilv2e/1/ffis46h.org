Aye, gotta concur with [[/u/Asviloka]] . The writing and plot strucutre in HPMoR can be accused of many things, but the author clumsily changing course halfway through /really/ isn't an accusation that holds any water. You can argue that his idea (to subvert the "politicking children" trope by revealing his child protagonist isn't actually a child at the very end) makes for an unsatisfying reading experience. But it was a very /deliberate/ writing decision, whatever you think of it. And again, saying "it was deliberate" isn't necessarily an excuse. If you think it's annoying, then it's annoying and HPMoR's not for you, and that's that, the fact that the things that annoy you are deliberate really shouldn't change that opinion.
