Although it's true that HPMoR is particularly egregious in that regard due to not featuring just fictional children but fictional /child prodigies/, I don't think singling HPMoR out of all /HP/ media and fanfics for this holds much water. Children in fanfic never act like real children, thank God. Even the children in /canon/ are way more focused and coherent than real children usually are, the overexcited scatterbrains.

Tl;dr, children in fanfic acting and speaking more like teenagers or adults, to me, is just part of the genre conventions. Compare people talking in rhyme in classical theater, or singing in opera/musicals. No, it's not realistic. No, no one's asking you to believe that it /is/, you're just supposed to suspend your disbelief for a minute and enjoy the witty dialogue/nice rhymes/musical number that you get out of it.

'course, if the supposedly witty dialogue and the supposedly intricate plot in /HPMoR/ doesn't do anything for you, then sure, it won't feel /worth it/. But that's an issue with the humor and the plot, not an issue with the way the children are written /per se/.
