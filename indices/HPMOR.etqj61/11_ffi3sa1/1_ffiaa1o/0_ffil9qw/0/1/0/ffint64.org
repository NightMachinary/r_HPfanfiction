He is presented as a child. The way he acts and talks is not relatable in any way. I get that apparently somewhere later in the story he is revealed to be older or something? I must admit I never managed to get that far. That may be the case, but doesn't mean it is a good story telling.

Also from what I understand (and correct if I am wrong) Harry isn't the only character in the story who is "not normal kid". There is also Hermione who is portrayed in much the same vane.
