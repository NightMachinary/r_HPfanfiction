I have no problems with the plot as such, I don't bemoan the science or techno-babble in it, or choices and twists within. I can get on board with all the meta-commentary and philosophy. This isn't my main issue that detracts me from reading it.

It has a lot to do with how the premise is set up, how the story is developed, how characters and people behave.

Ultimately how well is the build-up versus payoff handled.

And I think this is where MOR falters and why it fails to capture the interest of some readers - including me.
