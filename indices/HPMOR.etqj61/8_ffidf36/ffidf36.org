HPMoR was the first fanfiction I read, the one which changed my perception of fanfiction from 'a bunch of weirdos that resulted in 50 shades of grey' to 'wow this is awesome! I should write fanfiction too'. I've recommended it to two people; one loved it as much as I do, the other couldn't stand it. It's definitely not for everyone.

I don't care about canon characterization. I don't even care about realistic characterization, as long as it's internally consistent. HPMoR is an unevenly-paced awesome story, with long sections dedicated to sharing and promoting the titular 'methods of rationality' thrown in with more or less success.

I've read it repeatedly - finished a reread just last week, in fact - and continue to enjoy it fully every time. But then, I'm a rational-leaning person who enjoys most things to come out of the rational fanfiction community and thus probably closely adjacent to the target audience.

It was funny, clever, gripping, intriguing, heart-wrenching, imperfect, and beautiful. I've yet to find more than a handful of other fics I would put on the same level, and it remains in my top-10 to this day. There are some stories you love and then come back to later and discover aren't as good as you thought, but HPMoR somehow manages to surprise me with how good it is every time.

So, I think it's the same as with Seventh Horcux - another awesome story which some people just don't get. Tastes are different. One man's trash is another man's treasure. No one thing will every fit all. I personally don't get why a lot of popular things are popular, so I'm glad to have found some that work well for me. Like HPMoR.

And, anyway, isn't about 99% of fanfiction about wish-fulfillment in one way or another anyway? At least this version of Harry is imperfect, makes mistakes, learns lessons, screws things up, and doesn't just have everything miraculously go right with no effort.
