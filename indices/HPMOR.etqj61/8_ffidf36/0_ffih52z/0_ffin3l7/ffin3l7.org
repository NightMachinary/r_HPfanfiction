To be honest, I never really cared all that much for Harry Potter canon. It's good, well-written, fun, and that's it. Done and over with, moved on. It's the fanfiction community, all the awesome fics to be descended from it, that keeps this as one of my two primary fandoms. I'm more a fan of the fandom than anything else. xD But now because of the awesome creative fandom, I've read the original books more times than I ever would have otherwise.
