I agree with everything you say. MoR was the first fan fiction I ever read, too, and the first time I realized that these stories can belong to anyone, they're not just relegated to their creator and publisher. It gave the original concept more life, and let me experience Harry Potter for the first time, again! If I could forget all the great books I've ever read, just so I could read them again, I would! MoR was as close to that as I'd ever gotten, and Seventh Horcrux did it again!

I've read both multiple times, in addition to many other fics, to the point I'm a little worried it's all I'll read for the rest of my life!
