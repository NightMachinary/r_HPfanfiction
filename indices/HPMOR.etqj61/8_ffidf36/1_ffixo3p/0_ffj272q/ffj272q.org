Kinda like canon, where slavery is just something wizards do and most everyone is OK with is.

More seriously, it makes the point that eleven year old children of Death Eaters think rape is some cool thing grown up wizards do (I think it's a pretty realistic point). It doesn't really develop that point in any way.

Harry does care about it, but in a "plot how to change that" way, rather than in a "shout a moral lecture at Draco" way.
