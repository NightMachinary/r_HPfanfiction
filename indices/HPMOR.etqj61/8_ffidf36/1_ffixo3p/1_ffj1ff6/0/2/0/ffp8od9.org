Yea and thats how Harry interprets it. Whenever i see this comment as an argument to claim its a bad fanfic, its because "omg a child wouldve never said something like that" ( or something along those lines). What people don't say is that Harry is immediately horrified and then rationalizes on how Draco's upbringing and the socioeconomic environment where he lives in(which allows Malfoys to to anything they want) are the reasons Draco could say that and it ultimately needs to be stopped. He does /not/ ever condone it but he understands where its coming from.

And that kind of thinking its not that uncommon (regretfully) in modern society. Have you seen "13 reasons why"? The antagonist said something like what Draco said multiple times and then acted on it because he was an entitled son of a bitch whose parents didnt teach him right from wrong.

Harry then remembers that this is the son of a ruthless killing machine who has control over almost all politics in Magic UK, so he can't really change his whole way of thinking in their second meeting. But you know what? In his own twisted way he succeeds in changing Draco.
