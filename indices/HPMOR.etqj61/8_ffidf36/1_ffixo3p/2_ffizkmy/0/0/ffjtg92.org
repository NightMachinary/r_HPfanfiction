11-year-old Draco tries to impress Harry with some locker room talk about how he plans to rape Luna when he's old enough. He's clearly parroting things he's heard his elders say. Harry is horrified at the culture that produced this little monster. Draco never threatens to rape Hermione or anyone else, and never actually rapes anyone in the story as far as we know.

Privileged men really do say shit like this, and they really do get away with it. The president of my country says shit like this and got elected in spite of (or because of?) it. HPMOR correctly identifies this as a problem.
