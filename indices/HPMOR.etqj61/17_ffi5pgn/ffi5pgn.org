It's basically just philosophical wank for ivory-tower types to feel better about themselves. Y'know that 'I understood that reference!' joke from the Marvel peeps? Imagine that, only the references are all pretentious classical literature and science jokes. It's a fic written to appeal to the kind of people you'd probably work very hard to avoid at parties.

Lord-Potter-Black in this thread is making a reference to a joke about a show called Rick and Morty that people have rather similar feelings about, but there are people who feel that way about HPMoR.
