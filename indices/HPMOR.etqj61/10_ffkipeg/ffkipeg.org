It's very much like the works of Ayn Rand. Heavy handed screed to push the author's ideology, filled with incredibly dubious (if not downright incorrect) ideas - some of them also morally repugnant, and main character serving as wish fulfilment to "prove" the worth of those ideas and the world shaping itself to help him. So basically complete tripe, but somehow they both gain rabid adherents among impressionable teenagers who then form a cult-like following and promote them everywhere.

Edit: there's a well-known and detailed review of it here, if you're interested: [[https://danluu.com/su3su2u1/hpmor/]]
