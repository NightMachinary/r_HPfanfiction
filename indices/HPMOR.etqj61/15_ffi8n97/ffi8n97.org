I'm not alone then, i have seen this fic being recommanded as the best fic several times. I agree with you, it's nonsense, a kid at the age of harry would never be like this and he would never be so sure of himself in a new environment.

It's as bad as every godlike harry fics. It's neither funny or realistic, it's pure nonsense.

By chapter 5, Harry hypnotizes Draco with nonsense...

So a 11 year old knows to do this and all scientific theories existing he also has the least pleasant personality possible. By chapter 10, i just wanted harry to get killed, it would've been so good to see that smackhead get whacked off.

I don't understand how anybody could like that fic.

The people who recommand that fic should not promote as they've been doing, it was never what they said it to be.
