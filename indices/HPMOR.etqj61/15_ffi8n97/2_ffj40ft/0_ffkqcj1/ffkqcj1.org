It would be Rick and Morty if the character were swapped and it would have made no sense, the grandpa would have been the shy and 'dumb' one while the teen would have been the drunk adventurous genius.

It would make no sense and not been as funny. It is a thing to make the reader believe in what they read and if the author don't fail the premise and make it a believable thing into his own universe then it work.

It just doesn't for MoR, it's super cringe and not believable for me, i just can't stand it.
