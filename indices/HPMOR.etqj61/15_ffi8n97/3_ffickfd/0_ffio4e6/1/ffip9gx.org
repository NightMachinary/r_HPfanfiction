It's an AU. There are thousand of stories where Harry is not Harry. "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus" has "Harry" replaced by a girl named "Lily", Alexandra Quick couldn't even be considered a Potter FFN, there are thousands of fics where Harry is a girl, but still all stories are recommended everywhere, and nobody feels the need to constantly shit on them like people need to do with HPMOR for some reason.

You just have to mention HPMOR once and everyone goes into beserker mode.
