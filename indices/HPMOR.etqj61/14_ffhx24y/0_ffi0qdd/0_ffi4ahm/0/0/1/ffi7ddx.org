Pretty sure he's saying if you're going to call out something from a work of fiction, the work of fiction in question has to be guilty of what you're calling it out for. Like, for example, saying Ron Weasley's a Death Eater or domestic abuser when that is emphatically untrue. And that's a pretty reasonable thing to think.
