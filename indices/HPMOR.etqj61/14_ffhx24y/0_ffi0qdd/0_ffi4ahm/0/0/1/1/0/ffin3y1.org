That's not what anyone is saying. Change what you want, have a blast, but be explicit about it. Criticizing something based on misinformation or falsehoods is a whole nother story. If I write a story and complain in that story that Hermione should use her demon fox chakra more often to solve her problems and that she's an idiot for not doing so in the books, people would look at me funny because Hermione doesn't have demon fox chakra in the books.

No one's saying you can't change things from the source material. This is fan fiction after all, but if you're critiquing, in story, elements from the source material that aren't actually in the source material, then the critique is just wrong, and what ever point you're trying to make is muddled because it's not based in fact.
