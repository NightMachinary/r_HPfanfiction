  I admit, the robe fitting scene made me laugh. Harry's characterisation is obviously not realistic, but it's a guilty pleasure nonetheless. A fun read, the story's flaws are easy to overlook if you don't take it too seriously. 4/5.

When HPMOR was first published, its opening chapters seemed like it would be, well, a story. Nothing special, but entertaining.

It turns out it was intended to be some kind of scientific parable instead.

Unfortunately, the end result was something that fails both as a story and as a parable.
