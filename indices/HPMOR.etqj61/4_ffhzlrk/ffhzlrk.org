It's a story that is not for everyone, and in truth it's not very much for /Harry Potter/ fans as such, so much as it is for people who have read enough other fanfics to get the various references. Its charms include a surprisingly tight plot (which only becomes apparent over time), a great antagonist, its philosophical message (but if you're religious or otherwise pro-death that won't do much for you), and its sense of humor (which is as relative as these things ever are; if it doesn't make you laugh, it doesn't, and that's all there is to it).
