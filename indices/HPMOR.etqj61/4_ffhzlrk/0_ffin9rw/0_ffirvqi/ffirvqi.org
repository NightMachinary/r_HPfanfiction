That too, yes (but the references /are/ there --- the whole David Monroe plotline is a /A Black Comedy/ reference, for example, and of course there is the usage of fanon ideas like Atlantis or there being a long and storied history of Dark Lords plural).

But yes, it's a very niche audience to say the least, sure. Only... why should that mean it's bad? If it's for a niche audience and that niche audience is happy, I don't see why people who aren't the target audience have to get so worked up about it. Granted, /some/ of the vocal HPMoR fans can get annoying when they try to bring down what /regular/ fans of /Harry Potter/ like in comparison to what /they/ love, and in that case I'll be on the regular fans' side. But when it's people who like HPMoR being attacked and bullied by people who say "you can't like it, because it's bad, and I know it's bad because /I/ don't like it", I'll never /not/ take HPMoR's side.
