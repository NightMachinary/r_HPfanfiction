You're making stuff up completely from scratch about the author's motivation.

The author portrays this Harry as a genius at some things and an idiot at others, which makes him a fun character to read about. This Harry's memorized the D&D rulebooks but never played it because he doesn't have any friends. That's not a Mary Sue trait. The author decided to write a character with no social skills, for fun. This Harry's lack of social skills leads him to make some serious and hilarious mistakes.

If the author somehow gets a kick out of being hated, he failed miserably, since he's written one of the most popular fanfics ever. Console yourself with that thought if it helps.
