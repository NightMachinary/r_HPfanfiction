Mary Sues are self-inserts. if i had a diaper fetish and wrote a story in which i made Harry into an idealized version of my personality, his corresponding diaper fetish would be a Mary Sue trait by virtue of being part of my ideal personality that i inserted into the character. Mary Sue traits are whatever i as an author aspire towards and consider uber cool. ya feel?

if you do have social skills, it's really not hard to pinpoint the moments in the text where you can almost see Eliezer bending over to savor the smell of his highly rational, exceedingly intelligent, tragically unsociable farts. the emotion i experienced most often while forcing myself through that ordeal was second-hand embarrassment, and let me tell you, it's absolutely no surprise that it's so popular. it's the wet dream of every wannabe Eliezer in the world.
