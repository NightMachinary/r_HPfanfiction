Yeah, that's what I meant. There can be 2-3 years between bursts, but each burst has 4-7 chapters.

My philosophy with these thing is that if I like a story enough, I'll enjoy reading what there is of it; and if I don't, what's the point of reading it in the first place, even if it has an ending?

A story might gain in re-read value if it has an ending, but I think I've successfully broken my habit of re-reading fanfic.
