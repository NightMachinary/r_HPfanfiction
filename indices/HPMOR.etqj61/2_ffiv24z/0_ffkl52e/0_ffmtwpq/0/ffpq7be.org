This is from the end of the fic. There's plenty of it throughout the final acts, with Harry and Voldemort applauding each other for being the only people capable of thought. The most egregious example is from Chapter 90:

  "That's what I'd tell you if I thought you could be responsible for anything. But normal people don't choose on the basis of consequences, they just play roles. There's a picture in your head of a stern disciplinarian and you do whatever that picture would do, whether or not it makes any sense. A stern disciplinarian would order the students back to their rooms, even if there was a troll roaming the hallways. A stern disciplinarian would order students not to leave the Hall on pain of expulsion. And the little picture of Professor McGonagall that you have in your head can't learn from experience or change herself, so there isn't any point to this conversation. *People like you aren't responsible for anything, /people like me are,/ and when we fail there's no one else to blame.*"
