It's laughable how everyone who hates the story complain that a 11 year old would not be like MoR's Harry (even when, if you read the fucking story first, you would realize he is NOT a fucking 11 old /deliberately/), and its so hypocritical that same people praise when ,in other fics , Harry is a master politician ruthless Slytherin who has 10 titles and is a billionare.
