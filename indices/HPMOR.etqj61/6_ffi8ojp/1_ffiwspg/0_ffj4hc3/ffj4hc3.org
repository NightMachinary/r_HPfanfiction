His stories are guilty pleasures, really, as many have alluded to in the past whenever his name's brought up. And I agree with that. You know who's going to win when reading his stories, but therein lies a huge problem: it breaks any spehere of suspence he /could/ create within his stories. Sure, some people don't like suspense and want to know exactly what they're getting when reading his stories, but other people do like suspense, and I think he would be better received here if his stories weren't always so easy for Harry to win.

I haven't read Harry Crow so I can't comment on that, but of his stories I've read, there's been zero character development that I have seen. Not only that, every character of his is one-dimensional and extremely boring to read. Maybe I've been reading too much Stephen King lately, but King kills it with his characters. I'm not comparing Robst to King as King is a professional author and has been writing for decades, but Robst either can't write good character development or simply chooses not to in his stories. Again, Harry Crow may be different.

I agree with you in that Robst does away with the idiot ball (something that really bogged down JK Rowling), but I'd argue that his characters actually are OOC (though not in accordance with the plots of his stories). I didn't read about Harry and Hermione when I combed through his stories some time ago, but instead read about completely new, one-dimensional, boring characters that have been slapped with the names of "Harry" and "Hermione". Ditto that to every other character he writes.

With your third point, although victory might feel earned, in his stories I have read, victory is simply just too easy (referring back to the lack of suspense that doesn't exist in his stories). It's typically a one-off and the good guys (always) win, no matter what. It destroys the mold of his stories and makes them way too predictable (though again, some readers may like that).
