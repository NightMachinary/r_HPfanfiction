I'll say that Harry Crow did manage to develop tension. There were times when it literally had my heart racing with excitement or tension, which really isn't something I can say for many stories, including those by actual professional authors.

But yeah, the rest of his stuff doesn't manage that very well. The main thing I tend to enjoy about his work is his tendency to include ideas or plot elements I've not seen elsewhere. After this long reading fanfiction, novelty is at quite the premium.
