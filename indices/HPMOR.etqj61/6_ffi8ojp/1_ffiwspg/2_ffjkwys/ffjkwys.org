Generally I don't mind canon story. But I do agree that we should have had a bit more build up and a more satisfying payoff. Wand loyalty should have been at least hinted in prior works.

And sad how Dumbledore's prowess was diminished - "nope he isn't that amazing a wizard - he simply got an super-uber-mega-wand!"
