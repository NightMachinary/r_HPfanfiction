I wouldn't say he's a master author, but many of his stories are quite enjoyable, and I do consider Harry Crow to be better than the last two books of canon, but for specific reasons:

1) Character development - more people get more development in Harry Crow than over the entire course of canon. Then again, having characters grow and change is clearly not JKR's strong suit.

2) No Idiot Ball - every decision the characters make is fully consistent with their portrayal to that point and given the circumstances. Nobody veers wildly OOC because they need to in order to make plot happen. Again, this comes out ahead of canon more because of a deficiency in Rowling's writing, as she treated her characters more as ambulatory plot devices than as actual characters.

3) Victory feels earned - Harry and co. don't win because of some arbitrary rule of wand ownership and blind luck. They train, and prepare, and build alliances, and end up winning victories that truly feel earned rather than contrived.
