I would say HPMOR started out as something more like a crackfic with some serious conversations thrown in. At a certain point it then became a fix fic, but preserving its earlier canon, before progressing into conventional fanon (with wards and House Potter etc.) and then finally went Happy Feet/The Last Battle (and, in many ways, Deathly Hallows) and was mostly about the author's Views.

Which is to say... if someone can remember all the chapters with the Quidditch alternative, that'd be great.

And it does start with a warning that if you aren't feeling it by around chapter whatever (5? 10? 15?) you should give up on it... so whatever it eventually became, it's very much aware what it is. Hence, HPMOR is definitely an example of caveat emptor.

Note... HPMOR has... as I remember, fairly obnoxious takes on both House Potter and wards but it's hardly unusual in this regard. And you have to get, iirc, bloody far into it to discover these particular issues.

EDIT for clarity... I liked the crackfic stuff a lot. I really, really do not like The Last Battle. Take what you will from that.
