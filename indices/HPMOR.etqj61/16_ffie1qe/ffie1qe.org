It really isn't better than original books.

I liked the story, followed it to the end. I still would not recommend it to everyone.

I see it as a good try at establishing the ideas like rationality, scientific thought, problem solving, Bias recognition and many more such ideas. There is good in it, if you are interested in all that.

Narratively, it's Somewhat shaky. Doesn't feel like the author was particularly fond of the original books. But, that is fair it was a children's book. :)
