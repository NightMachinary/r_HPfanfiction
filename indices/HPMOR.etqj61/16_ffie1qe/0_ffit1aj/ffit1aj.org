Although I wouldn't swear to the fact that the author (or a lot of his most diehard fans) would agree with the following, I feel like the "it's better than canon" argument largely rests on the underlying assumption that no matter how /well/ it does, it what it's /trying/ to do is more praiseworthy than what canon was trying to do. Which, I mean, gets at philosophical and religious opinions, so obviously it's /very/ subjective, but "canon is increasingly about a Christian worldview, albeit not to Narnia-levels, whereas /HPMoR/ is a decent introduction to the concept of rationality and preference-utilitarianism" is objectively the case.

Course, you can think that canon being better at what they're doing than HPMoR is at what /it's/ doing outweighs the fact that HPMoR is doing something more "ethical". Or you can disagree with the author of HPMoR's philosophical views (hey, maybe /you/'re a Christian!), in which case the whole appeal will be lost on you, of course. But that's the core of the argument, I feel. It's a bit uncouth to say it, but the real reason most HPMoR readers are ticked-off at people defending canon is "but J.K. Rowling /believes in heaven/!!..."
