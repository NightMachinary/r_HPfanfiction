I don't know about J.K. but me personally couldn't care less about religious nonsense.

I think what I get from this thread - the problem is tone at the beginning of the story - it reads very much like a over the top crack fic. It is kind of hard to take it seriously, relate to it. Few people have said to me that it only picks up much later.

I'll try one day as a challenge to myself to give it a proper read.
