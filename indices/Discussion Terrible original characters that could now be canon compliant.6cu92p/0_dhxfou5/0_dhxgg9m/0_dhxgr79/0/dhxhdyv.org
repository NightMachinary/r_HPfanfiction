Well I think certain idea will attract certain type of author with certain style.

A good author will never introduce an idea, a characterization or anything really without a goal in mind. Especially when it relates to a character. So, when getting to the point of a Veela Draco, a good author will ask himself "why" and "What". Why should my character be a veela, and what will this change bring to my story.

I feel like this kind of trop is most used by author who try to shoehorn a relationship without having the proper abilities to write it, either as canon-compliant to a point, or just so that it flows smoothly. They will slam Veela on top of Draco and use the veela as the justification of the relationship, instead of the plot device that could start it. Or so I think
