Molly thought Hermione dumped Harry for Krum, because she believed Rita Skeeter's article. At this point in GoF Molly hadn't yet become aware how much nonsense Rita writes, because Rita was only beginning to target Harry. So Molly behaved more coldly towards Hermione after the article was printed. When Harry cleared up the misunderstanding, everything was fine again. She never, at any point in the series was "tearing into Hermione for being a 'scarlet woman'". Her behaviour was wrong, but not as horrible as you make it sound.
