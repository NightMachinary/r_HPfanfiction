There were other instances -

- Hermione being derisive of Lavender for being 'too girly' (girls shaming other girls);
- Ron being upset at Ginny dating and about to call her a slut (so, definitely shaming her for being what he considered promiscuous);
- and the incident you mention regarding Molly believing Skeeter's gossip rag against Hermione for being sexually interested in two men and leading them on (again, women shaming other women).

Those are considering, by definition, slut shaming. I guess they all centre around idle gossip and cultural and societal ideologies, which I can work into my fic, since they're considered "canon" situations of shaming.

On a side note: no teen pregnancy at Hogwarts??? How??
