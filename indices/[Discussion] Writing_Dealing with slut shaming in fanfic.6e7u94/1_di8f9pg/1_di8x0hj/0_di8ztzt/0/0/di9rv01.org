I was curious what exactly Hermione said that was so nasty, but I couldn't find a single quote where she says anything resembling "slut shaming" to or about Lavender.

Similarly, Molly never said anything to or about Hermione that we know of. She acted coldly towards her because she believed that Hermione cheated on Harry. I don't think simply being more cold towards someone for cheating on someone you hold dear is slut shaming them.

Slut Shaming is when girls or women are attacked for deviating from 'socially acceptable sexual behaviour'. I think attaching that label to carelessly, even when it doesn't fit, trivialises the meaning of the word.

You are of course right that people who lash out can do so by slut shaming people, and I agree that this is exactly what Rita Skeeter does, and maybe what Ron does too, but Hermione being dismissive about/ ignoring Lavender... Molly being rude to Fleur or colder towards Hermione... I just don't see it. Am I overlooking certain things they said?
