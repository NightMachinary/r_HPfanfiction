See, this is what I'm having trouble with contextually in the story - do I use Ron and Molly (by extension) as examples of wizarding society that indicates that women who are not 'loyal' to their partners (or potentially toys with their feelings) should be held in a lower standard? Does that imply someone who flirts too much is therefore able to incite behaviours considered promiscuous? That could then, along the way, be labelled as slut shaming?

Hermione herself -- at least, in the article I read, not sure how I feel about it yet tbh -- looks down on Lavender for her girly actions and for the fact that she wants Ron as a boyfriend. Okay, yes, we know that Hermione's jealous... but one of the considerations of slut shaming is women looking down on other women for their behaviour that runs contradictory to what they consider socially acceptable (or, in other words, women just putting other women down).

Like [[/u/cheo_][u/cheo_]] said, context is important to those instances, but I'm looking more to the reasons behind why they said or did those actions, and whether or not it can indicate a culturally-wide trend? To establish either certain comments, gossip, behaviour as shaming or not.

(or if it's even possible to write into a story)
