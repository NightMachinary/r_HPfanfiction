I'm honestly conflicted about classifying Molly's and Hermione's behaviour at all, which I realise I probably should have pointed out in the previous comment.

Molly has a specific character while at the same time taking rubbish like Skeeter's articles seriously, something you'd expect to go against the behaviour of someone like her, making it hard to classify her ... moments, as anything but a weird Molly thing, but at the same time still leaving the possibility of her genuinely being like that because Ron has to have gotten his attitude from somewhere and it's a “maybe” so it may or may not have been from her. The very fact that she thinks Hermione is cheating on Harry, when there's never actually been signs /that she's seen/ that they are in any way together or even considering it, it adds to the specific of her character.

And Hermione, well, over the series she's expressed disapproval of many things, some of them in ways that were ... rather out of it, so we really can't say why exactly she disapproves of Lavender (for all we know, it may be that she thinks she is using up time she could have instead spent on making her essays longer); of course now, after getting through it, we do know it is because she has feelings for Ron, but all in all her social ineptitude can make it look as ... pretty much anything, really. And while that means that what she is doing probably is lashing out in one way or another, I'm not sure if it counts as anything but just that.
