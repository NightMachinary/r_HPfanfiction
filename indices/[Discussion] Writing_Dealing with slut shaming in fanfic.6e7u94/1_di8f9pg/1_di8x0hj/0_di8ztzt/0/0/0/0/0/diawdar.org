It's ... hard to say. If you do not mind your story being AU and you need it for whatever reason then go ahead and do write it in. That said, well ...

Molly is, as we already know, a specific kind of person, with many a bias and some behaviours that are quite ... pushy, let's say. Remember the Howler in the second book? Yeah, that kind of stuff, she is vocal about anything she is against without actually checking her facts and letting anyone tell her what is happening. But, at the same time, she takes what Skeeter writes as truth, which goes against that attitude because she is letting someone she doesn't actually know dictate her what to think. Since a lot of what Molly does is /stuff that Molly does/, it's hard to use her as an example of anything as far as stuff of this kind goes unless you go “people are sheeple” which ... may not be far from the truth, actually, but that's still /guessing/.

With Ron, it probably counts, but if you think about it Ron has quite a lot of pent-up jealousy for Ginevra which doesn't /excuse/ him having a verbal go at her due to her dating Dean, but certainly does /justify/ it, one way or another. As his motivation for that seems to be rooted in the specific situation he is in, we could use the fact that he does it as proof that this kind of behaviour does happen at all, but we cannot really use him as an example of what is normal because of the specific circumstances. That one, of all the ones we've seen, I would tentatively count as slut shaming, but yeah, no cultural trends from it.

And as for Hermione, her behaviour towards Lavender during the sixth year, though you could count it as slut shaming if you really wanted (I personally don't) because there is more to it than just words, is quite similar to her behaviour during the third year cat/rat debacle. She disapproves /of something/, certainly, and in hindsight we do know what it is, but looking at the whole thing with only the knowledge one would have at the time it's hard to see anything but disapproval there. Certainly, we do know why that disapproval is there, but, again, with limited knowledge it's hard to say what it is other than just that, so I do not think what she did was explicit enough in its meaning to call it slut shaming.

That said, Britain, just as the rest of Europe, tends to treat sex as something a bit less taboo than USA does. As such, while slut shaming does exist, I don't think it's a normal thing as much as simply a chosen way of being cruel towards someone (or something like that).
