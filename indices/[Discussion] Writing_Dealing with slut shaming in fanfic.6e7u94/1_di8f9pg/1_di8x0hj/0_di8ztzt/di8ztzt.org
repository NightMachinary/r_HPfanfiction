While the incidences you describe all happened, I think it is important to put them in context.

Hermione's problem wasn't Lavender being 'too girly' but her dating Ron, the boy Hermione was interested in herself. She lashed out, because she felt hurt.

Ron was confronted with his little sister growing up, and her kissing a boy before he kissed a girl.

Skeeter did not attack Hermione because she really believed that Hermione was interested in two guys, but because of the altercation between herself and Hermione that happened shortly before the article was printed.

I don't think that the behaviour was right, but I also want to point out that it isn't the standard behaviour for these characters, but a way of acting out when they felt threatened or hurt, and I think it wouldn't do the characters justice to take one of their worst moments (in Hermione's, Ron's, or Molly's case) and say: well, look at them slut-shaming other characters, as if that were normal for them, or for their social surroundings.

Edit: Teen pregnancy at Hogwarts: It's a children's book about fantasy and adventure, a teen pregnancy storyline doesn't really fit the genre or further the plot. If you want an in-story reason: Teenagers who are informed about sex and contraceptive methods have a lower risk of getting pregnant unintentionally. So maybe the wizarding world is very progressive in that area.
