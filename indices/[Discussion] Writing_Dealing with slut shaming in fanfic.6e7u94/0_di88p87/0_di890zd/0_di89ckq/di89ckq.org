That depends on whether or not that spreads past Hogwarts, or if those who already graduated don't really care about such gossip. (That might be different if it involves a celebrity like Harry.)

And if sexual rumours spread, other rumours might spread as well - like unsporty behaviour in Quidditch, bullying, etc. It might very well be that there's an "what happens at Hogwarts stays at Hogwarts" attitude.
