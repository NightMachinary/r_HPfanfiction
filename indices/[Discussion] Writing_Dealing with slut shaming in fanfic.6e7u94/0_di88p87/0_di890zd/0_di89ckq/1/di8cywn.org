I agree with you, it also depends how common marriage outside of Britain is. Assuming international magical travel to mainland Europe is fast and easy, it could very well be that you meet your future partner somewhere else.

I assume the yule-ball would be an interesting event for stuff like that, in the upper years.

Points: Bill and Charlie Weasley both left Britain for the world, and Bill married a french girl. Counter-Points: A lot of other people.
