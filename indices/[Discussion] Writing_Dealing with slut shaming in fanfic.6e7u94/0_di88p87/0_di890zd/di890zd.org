I think the only thing that might need adding onto this is that most British witches and Wizards go to Hogwarts. As a result their future spouses are very likely going to be at school at the same time as them due to the very low population of the wizarding world and assuming they're not marrying a muggle. It might well have an impact when everyone in your community knows what you've done and who with. There isn't that much going on at any given time so rumours will spread and most importantly be remembered. Culturally this is similar to when people lived their whole lives in the same village or one over. It was only with motorised transport that someone could leave their past behind and attitudes loosened up.
