You need first to decide what exactly Wizarding Britain's Society would consider "expectations for sexual behaviors". Are there different expectations for wizards and for witches? Is asking for birth control frowned upon? Having pre-marital sex? Having sex for fun instead of procreation? having sex before 17? Having more than one sexual partner? In their life? In a year? In a month?

We don't know much if anything about how canon treats that. (Some authors do not even seem to know that muggle Britain's not the USA, and not quite as prude, nor that the age of consent is not 18.)
