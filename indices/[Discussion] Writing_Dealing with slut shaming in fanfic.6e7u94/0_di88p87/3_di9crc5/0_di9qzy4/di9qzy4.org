No, that would not be pedophilia. It wouldn't even be statutory rape (i.e. illegal sex by age, though otherwise consensual). Age of consent means 'anything above this is cool with the law'. If the age of consent is 16, a couple who are 16 & 89 are just as valid as a couple who are 16 & 17. Age of Consent in European countries tends to be younger than in the United States. For example, the age of consent in Germany and Italy is 14.

Pedophilia is attraction to PRE-pubescent children, meaning being attracted to those who haven't even displayed sexual development. Those who are attracted to young, sexually developed teens are not considered potential criminals. From a psychological perspective, they are perfectly healthy. From a legal perspective, they can look but not touch until they're certain that the object of their attraction is old enough.
