The second part of my comment was regarding US laws, not European, I suppose I didn't make that apparent. Anyway, I disagree with your characterization of USA being puritan. I don't think young girls should be even thinking about sex at such a young age, much less with older men (and vice versa). It's hardly puritan to have laws protecting our children.
