Yes, if you are in your teens you know jack shit. You are young and don't have a clue.

And yes, I am not hardline. I don't force my opinions on others. I don't advocate for conservative legislation.

If you're not going to bother to engage or think on what I'm writing, and instead are going for bullshit "gotcha" LOL moments, then I'm done wasting my time on you.
