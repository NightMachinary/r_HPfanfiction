You see, the problem is, teenagers will think about sex. What should be done is educating them and, if you must, making sure that they keep their activities to themselves (i.e. masturbate) rather than go for other people which many of them do only because they don't know better. Going “they shouldn't be thinking about sex at all”, when they are going through puberty and start getting sexual thoughts out of the blue that they have no idea what to do with, is one of the worst things you can do. And people will conflate saying that teenagers shouldn't think about sex with just that kind of attitude.
