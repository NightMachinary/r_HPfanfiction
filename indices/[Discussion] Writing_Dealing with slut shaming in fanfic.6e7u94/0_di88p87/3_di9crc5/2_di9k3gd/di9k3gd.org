If a sixteen-year-old can only give consent to having sex with people their age, then they are not above the actual age of consent but rather above the age that is the cut-off for making an exception in case two people who are both below the age of consent decide to have a go at it. This is an exception, and one that may or may not actually be a thing depending on the state you find yourself in, and I do believe some people refer to this one as “Romeo and Juliet laws”.
