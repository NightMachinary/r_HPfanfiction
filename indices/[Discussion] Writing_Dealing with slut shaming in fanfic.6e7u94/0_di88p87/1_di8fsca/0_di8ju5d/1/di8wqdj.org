I'm fairly certain it's against the law in the UK though - as people I knew had to submit blood tests ahead of time before getting married.

But the fact that that /is/ allowed totally changes a part of my story, since one of the characters is pregnant via her 3rd cousin. Or something. I need to figure that out again - great-grandfathers are third cousins once removed, right?
