Oh, fabulous - thanks so much for the link! This is going to be really helpful.

Ahhhh, here's where the embarrassment kicks in. It's actually a Riverdale fic set in the HP 'verse, but when I was considering a particular scene regarding Veronica Lodge & Betty Cooper, I ended up getting into a huge discussion with my husband about slut shaming in the magical world and how it could conceivably (or not) happen, and now I'm trying to prove him right by actually writing it in and dealing with realistic repercussions.
