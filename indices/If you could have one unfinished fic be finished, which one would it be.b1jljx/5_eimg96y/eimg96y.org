For me it would have to be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/][Error of Soul]] Which has a fascinating take on soulbonds.

Based on the fact that some soulbond fanfiction lets the main characters share thoughts and memories through the bond, This fic looks at the consequences no one else talks about.

Like would you REALLY want to hear the stream of consciousness of someone else? If you have shared memories how does that affect your sense of self? There's a kinda chilling description of how the Weasley twins don't know which one is Fred and which one is George, because with shared memories and identical bodys it's hard to remember who was doing what an hour ago, let alone 10 years ago.

I really wanted to see this go through with Harry and Hermione, but it stops short.
