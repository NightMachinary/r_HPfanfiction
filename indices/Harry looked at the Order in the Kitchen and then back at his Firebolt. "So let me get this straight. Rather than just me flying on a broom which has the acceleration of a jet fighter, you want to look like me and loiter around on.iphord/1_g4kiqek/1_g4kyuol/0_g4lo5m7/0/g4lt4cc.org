If that's the case, why not move the Dursleys to a country house and place the order HQ in the basement? The Order has absolute top-notch cursebreakers, surely they can sneakily renovate the place to have an additional hidden complex and war-worthy wards. The Dursleys get to play at being super wealthy, and the Order gets to use the unbreakable wards for an effective HQ. Everybody except the servants they have to draft in for Dursley duty wins.

If/when the wards fall (I personally suspect the age 17 deadline was a self-fulfilling prophecy of giving an exact date they don't have to call a place home caused the wards to fall the instant Harry celebrated not having to live there. If "a spell can't tell the position of the sun", then how is accidental sacrificial magic an expert on ages of majority? Checkmate, tempus haters.), just break off for a network of safehouses. Hell, why resort to houses? You have pop up tents that can contain large spaces inside them, just ward random tiny patches and leave a tent in there.
