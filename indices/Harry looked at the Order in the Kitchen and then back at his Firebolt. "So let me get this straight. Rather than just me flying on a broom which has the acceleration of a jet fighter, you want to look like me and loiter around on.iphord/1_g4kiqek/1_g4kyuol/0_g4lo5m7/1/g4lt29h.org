But there was no need to go back and box yourself into the home just because "THE PROTECTION!" He should have just been taken to a safehouse immediately after Hogwarts and skipped getting caught stuck there at Privet Drive, like they were in canon! Everyone knew where the house was, which just makes you a sitting duck until the protection drops. If he'd have been taken to an unknown safe house immediately after sixth year, skipping Privet Drive entirely, he'd have been safe somewhere nobody knows where to even find, while the Death Eaters are stuck screwing around at Privet Drive.

It literally makes no sense to send him back where Death Eaters are flying about just waiting to get at him, making his location known to everyone until the day it fails. It was just stupid.
