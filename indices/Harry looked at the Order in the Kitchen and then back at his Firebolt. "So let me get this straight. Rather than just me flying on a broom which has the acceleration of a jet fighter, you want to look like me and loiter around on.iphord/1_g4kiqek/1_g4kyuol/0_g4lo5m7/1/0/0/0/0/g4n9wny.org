I think it was either Dobby doing something to trigger the trace, or some kind of external monitoring spells that detect any magic set up near where muggleborn/muggleraised live. No way would someone like Lucius Malfoy be OK with ministry being able to detect what magic he does just because he's near his son.

And even then, we're talking pureblood bigots where the most civilized (Lucius) of them treats their elves like garbage, crazy murder hobos out of Azkaban, and Tommy Riddle (enough said). I highly doubt any of them would even consider using elves to find Potter.

So the easiest course of action would be to sneak out under the cloak (maybe have Order create a distraction or two) or under polyjuice (some muggle takes a taxi, nothing to see here); rent a muggle apartment somewhere far away, lock the wand in a box, and live in comfort until the trace fades.

Edit: Maybe even put the apartment under fidelius, if knowledge how is not lost with Dumbledore.
