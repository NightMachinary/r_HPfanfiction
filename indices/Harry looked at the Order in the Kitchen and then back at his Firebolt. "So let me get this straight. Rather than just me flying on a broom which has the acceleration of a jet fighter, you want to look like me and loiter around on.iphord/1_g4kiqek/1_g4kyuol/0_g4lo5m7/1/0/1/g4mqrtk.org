  “But how come the Ministry didn't realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin?” Harry asked angrily. “He was underage at the time, wasn't he? I thought they could detect underage magic!”

  “Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. *“So if you're underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard's house, the Ministry won't know?”*

  “*They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry's face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring's obedience while within their walls.”*
