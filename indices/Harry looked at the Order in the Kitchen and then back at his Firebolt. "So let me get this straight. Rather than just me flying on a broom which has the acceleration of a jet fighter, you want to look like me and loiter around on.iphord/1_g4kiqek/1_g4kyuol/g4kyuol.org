Yes SNUFFLY why did Harry HAVE to leave on the exact day?! Why not leave earlier? :( Hecks, he could have directly been apparated somewhere safe with the Order FROM HOGWARTS AT THE END OF SIXTH YEAR!!! Or at King's Cross! Just don't even GO home if you think Death Eaters will be watching the place! That's just putting yourself into a killbox area on purpose! If they took the war at all seriously they wouldn't have even let Harry just go home like the school wasn't JUST ATTACKED BY DEATH EATERS AND DUMBLEDORE DIED! He should've immediately been taken to a fucking safehouse then and there! :(

JK Rowling writing is stupid. :(

If I was the Death Eaters I wouldn't have been sitting around watching the HOUSE; I would've intercepted him in the fucking car from King's Cross at the end of sixth year and apparated away with him! Just get him on an isolated stretch of freeway or something when he's going from London to Surrey! What are the Dursleys going to do? Put up an anti-apparition charm to stop harry from escaping and then swarm him with spells.

EVERYONE on both sides acted STUPID for the sake of making the plot go where JK Rowling wanted it to go!
