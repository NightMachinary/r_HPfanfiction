I imagine this is one of many better-than-canon ways that Harry could have left Privet Drive. (Especially if he wore the cloak). My personal method would be, assuming advance preparation took place: a member of the order that Harry trusts takes polyjuice potion to turn them into Mrs. Figg. The real Figg just stays at home while her doppelganger gains admittance to number 4 and once inside, apparates Harry away to Grimmauld Place. Or alternately, gives Harry a dose of polyjuice allowing him to look like Dudley and they walk out of the house openly together. If he left several days before his birthday, that probably would have been safer too.
