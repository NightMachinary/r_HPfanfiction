We also need to establish speed of flight verses speed of spell. Even if spells travel at the speed of light, aerial combat would require rapid spell casting to 'walk' the spell fire with the light as a tracer.

This could be overcome by mass casting which could be more effective by having an entire group as per mass musket firing which would require the group to remain in reference to each other stationary (then Harry can rapidly move away). Or have the group move in concert with each other on brooms, which would make them slower to react, then Harry would be able to out maneuver.

But we are arguing semantics here. If the Order of the Phoenix had any planning capacity at all they would have;\\
a) moved Harry anytime prior to last possible moment, forcing the death eaters to spend resources watching the area for the escape and ensuring that any broom escape would happen with less then the full compliment of death eaters.\\
b) moved Harry elsewhere somewhere between his last exam and returning to 4 Privet Drive and not allowing Death Eater the opportunity for an assassination/capture.\\
c) Not told Snape that the above 2 items were going to occur. Thus getting Harry somewhere safe and causing Death Eaters to waste resources.
