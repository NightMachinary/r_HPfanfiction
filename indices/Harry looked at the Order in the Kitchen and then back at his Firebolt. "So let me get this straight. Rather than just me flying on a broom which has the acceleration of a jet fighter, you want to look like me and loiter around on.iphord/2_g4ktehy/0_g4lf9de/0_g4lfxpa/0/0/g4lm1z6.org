True! I was just pointing that JK made Moody be this tough guy based on legends surrounding him (and probably he might have been in the past having killed Mulciber and Rosier and because half the cells in Azkaban were filled out by him according to Sirius, I think), but by the time we see him, he is just a shell of his former self. He is weak and ridiculed by the public and also has a serious problem with paranoia.
