Which was probably slower than a broom which can reach 150 mph in ten seconds and is probably only limited by the ability of the rider to hold on. Like, that's a supercar or jet level of acceleration. And I'd wager that the bike was slower since it is significantly less aerodynamic, has no seatbelts and the rider is more exposed.
