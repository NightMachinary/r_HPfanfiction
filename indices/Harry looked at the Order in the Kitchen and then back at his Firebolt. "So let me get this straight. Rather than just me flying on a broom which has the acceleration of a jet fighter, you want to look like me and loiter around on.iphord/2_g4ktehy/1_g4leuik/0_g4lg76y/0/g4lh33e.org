It has little to do with science per se and more with the air dragging you off your flying device (so not "that thing can't go that fast" but rather "it is impossible to operate at such speeds since the air would yank you off") . The kind of motorcycle with a side car is usually not the kind built for high speed and therefore has little to none aerodynamic covers like you see on race machines. They also have a more upright seat position. Which means that, especially as a larger person such as Hagrid, simply holding on gets difficult at much lower speeds than on a broom where you have a much flatter seating position and the footrests to brace yourself against.

  Harry thought it was really fast even if he's been riding his Firebolt for three years by that time.

Your perception of speed depends very much on your vehicle. 50 kph on a bicycle feels fast, 100 is basically suicide unless you are a professional. Meanwhile, 100 in a good car are barely noticeable and too slow for a plane to even take off.

So this might very well be a case of "fast for this piece of junk", not "fastest thing ever".
