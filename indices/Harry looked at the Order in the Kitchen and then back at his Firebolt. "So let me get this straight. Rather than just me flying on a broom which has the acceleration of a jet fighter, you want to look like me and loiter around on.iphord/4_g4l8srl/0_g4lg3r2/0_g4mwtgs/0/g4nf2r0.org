You can dodge spells in the books as well, meaning that they aren't particularly fast. But since the whole thing happens at non-relativistic speeds (or however that's called in English), you can simply add vSpell and vLaunch to get the speed the spell would have if launched from a broom.

Which means that Harry is practically spell-proof since even minor wiggling will make every spell miss if they are moving at 200+ mph.
