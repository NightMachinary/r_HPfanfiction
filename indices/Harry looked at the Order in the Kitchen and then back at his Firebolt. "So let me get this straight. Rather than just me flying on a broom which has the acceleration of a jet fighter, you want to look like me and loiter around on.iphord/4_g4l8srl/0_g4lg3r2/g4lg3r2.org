How? Assuming Harry starts in the staircase of Number 4, he could be down a street before the Death Eater even spot him (especially if he is disillusioned or wears his cloak). Which already eliminates roughly 3/4 of the death eaters since they were spread out around Number 4, not all waiting on one side, and therefore have no chance of catching up. He then has the speed advantage and, well let's just say that lining someone up in a fighter plane with fixed guns is difficult, trying to do so with a one-handed wooden stick while going at ~150-200 mph (so a lot of air pressure against your hand and therefore a shitty aim) is practically impossible before you factor in that a fighter has one or more machine guns (a Spitfire, for example, shoots 80 bullets a second) while the wizard would be lucky to get off two spells/second, which are significantly slower (you need to lead your target more which means even worse accuracy). Aerial combat without missiles is very much "throw enough shit at a wall and hope that some of it sticks", which makes HP magic unsuitable for it.

Or you could simply do the escape earlier, which also reduces the present opposition and makes it even easier.
