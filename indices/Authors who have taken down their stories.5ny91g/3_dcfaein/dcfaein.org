Like most have said, I think that when an author takes stories down it's because they don't want them to be read any more for whatever reason.

I must admit, when I started posting fanfiction, I didn't give a second thought to what might happen when I had had enough. Now I am edging towards taking my own stuff down, it's not such an easy decision to make. I have no reason to think anyone likes it well enough to have saved a copy, but I can't know.

When you put something out on the internet, like it or not, you can't control what happens to it.
