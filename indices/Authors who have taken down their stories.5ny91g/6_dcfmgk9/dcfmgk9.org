Sometimes the author has been advised to take stuff down when they were trying to get published or have been published. In other fandoms, such as Pride and Prejudice, stories are taken down for publication. I would say if the author has taken it down, its sad, but their wishes should be respected.

I do know a number of very successful writers who still write fanfic albeit under assumed names.
