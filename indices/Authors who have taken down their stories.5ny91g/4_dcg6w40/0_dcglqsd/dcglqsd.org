If the author of the derivative work was infringing on the original work's copyright when they created it, you would also be infringing by distributing it.

Contrariwise, if they were not infringing on the original work's copyright, they would have their own copyright on the derivative work. You would be infringing on /that/ copyright by distributing it.

Either way, it's illegal for you to distribute it, and it's not in the public domain.
