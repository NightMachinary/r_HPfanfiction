People yank their stories for a variety of different reasons. Obviously others have read it, and they may be simply removing the earlier version so that they can re-present their ideas in a better way, and/or to a different or wider audience, possibly for profit. It could be that they just don't want to hear from people criticizing their work or harassing them for more. I'd say the essential point is that the author is disassociating themselves from the work. So, anything you do to reconnect the two is working against that intent.

I don't think there's anything wrong with asking the author for a copy of something you enjoyed. The author can choose to ignore the request or say 'no', but there's no insult in asking. You're still honoring their decision and their right to control access to their property. This is the most legitimate avenue, in fact.

Asking others if they have a copy is the more rude action, in that you're attempting to circumvent the action of having it removed, but only for your enjoyment.

Maintaining an archive of other peoples' works is akin to being a dealer or fence, in that you're keeping in circulation that which was retracted. The only thing not inconsiderate about it is that the author's retroactive anonymity may be able to be maintained, so long as searchable indexes aren't publicly accessible.
