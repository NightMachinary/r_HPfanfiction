  Asking others if they have a copy is the more rude action, in that you're attempting to circumvent the action of having it removed, but only for your enjoyment.

I have to disagree. If I published a physical book, I couldn't later recall it from everyone who has a copy and I can't stop the lending or giving it to others. Once it's published, it's published and the only way to keep this control is to DRM it and then flip the kill switch. If an author doesn't want their works out there, forever, they have to choose not to publish.
