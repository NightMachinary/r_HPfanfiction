Works published for profit are a different matter. They are subject to mandatory editorial oversight, and the process of handing the work over to an agency to circulate it and generate revenue is a business relationship. Fanfiction is amateur writing, and while posting to the internet may indeed mean you'll never be able to destroy the work, there is no implication that you as a writer should be held accountable for it for the rest of your life. We are assured at least the assumption of anonymity.

Besides which I said it was rude, not illegal or sinful.
