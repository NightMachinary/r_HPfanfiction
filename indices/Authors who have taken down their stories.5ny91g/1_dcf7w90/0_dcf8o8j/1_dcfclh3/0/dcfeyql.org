Yeah. [[http://boingboing.net/2016/05/07/kobo-upgrade-deprives-read.html]]

It's easy to strip the drm, or so I hear, and many legitimate sites actually recommend it. But yeah, it's possible to kill-switch a book. Same with ITunes and other services before they quit using DRM. If the DRM server was shut down then the songs wouldn't play. I done think Apple had this problem but I remember reading about it for other vendors.
