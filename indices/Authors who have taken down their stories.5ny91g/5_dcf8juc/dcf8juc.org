If I take down a story, I don't want to think about it, at least not in that version. I don't want people messaging me about it. I don't want it reviewed. I don't want kudos or favorites regarding it.

I personally wouldn't mind other people offering a mirror, or sharing it among themselves, but I don't want people to talk to me about it.

Other people have different considerations. They might want the work not to exist, instead of just wanting a communications blackout.
