There's A Matter of Force, where the SI is Harry's sister.

Your mileage WILL vary. She's a complete Mary Sue, but the author leans into those tropes purposefully so it comes out funny rather than cringey.

I like it. The SI borrows very liberally from various pop culture, and there are numerous running gags throughout the story (such as the usefulness of towels, which DO pay off on numerous occasions).

And it's complete!

If you're open minded about whose twin the SI is, there's also In Bad Faith, where the SI is Draco's sister. It's incomplete and never reaches the first year of Hogwarts, but the worldbuilding is well written.

Those are the only good ones I can think of.
