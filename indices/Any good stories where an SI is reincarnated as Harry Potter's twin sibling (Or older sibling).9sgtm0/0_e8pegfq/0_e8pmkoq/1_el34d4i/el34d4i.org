Sorry for responding to this after 5 months, but it sucks when that happens. Like how the author of what's widely considered one of the best, if not the best, Pokemon fanfics of all time stopped writing because they thought their work was bad and even took it down. Like sure, maybe the writing isn't on the level of Tolkien, but being better than 99% of fanfiction, and a fair amount of actually published novels, is still a great achievement. Most people can't do that.

It looks like in the case of In Bad Faith the author just decided they don't like SIs. That's unfortunate, as SIs are awesome when well done, which I remember their fic being.
