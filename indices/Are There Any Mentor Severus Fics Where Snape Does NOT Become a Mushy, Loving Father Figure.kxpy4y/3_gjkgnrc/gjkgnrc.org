What about if Snape does develop an attachment to Harry, but doesn't become a father figure because Harry's parents are still alive? But becomes an important mentor because Harry is passionately devoted to brewing potions; James and Lily, while loving and supportive, just don't appreciate the art in the way that Snape and Harry do. So their relationship is more than the usual student-teacher interaction, she eventually becomes his apprentice, but there's no suggestion that Snape should adopt her or anything of the kind, she's very happy with the parents she has. And while he may have emotional investment, he is never mushy. And Harry can't tell him all her secrets, because she isn't supposed to be at Hogwarts at all.
