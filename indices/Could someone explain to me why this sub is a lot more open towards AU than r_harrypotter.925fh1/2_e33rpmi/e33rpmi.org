Is this seriously a question? You're wondering why a sub based on an IP is more concerned with discussing established canon over a sub based on fan fiction of said IP? I mean... look, I'm honestly not trying to be an ass about this, but how the hell is that even a question? When I want to discuss something, I go to a place specifically about that to discuss it. When I want to discuss endless what if?-ism's, I go to a place about that. I'm not going to go a mathematician and expect them to humor me about how things would be if 2+2=5.

[[/r/HPfanfiction]] is /specifically here/ to discuss anyone and everyone's AU's based in the Harry Potter universe. [[/r/harrypotter]] is /specifically there/ to discuss what happens in the Harry Potter novels/movies. Just as nobody cares here if you're insulted that someone would write a fix that doesn't include your OTP, nobody there cares if you think everything would have been much better if Snape was actually Harry's mentor/father/love/all of the above.
