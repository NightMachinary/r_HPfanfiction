Because we know the canon stuff, we have read and seen it countless times, both the originals and in fanfic. And while the concept, the very idea of Harry Potter is genius, the early books are written for children and the last two were simply shit and rely too much on the idiot ball and ex-machina to make the plot work. Hell, the existence of the magical Bulgarian government in Goblet of Fire raises more questions than it answers because Rowling's worldbuilding implies that the borders were drawn in 1707 (a year that works very nicely for the UK, but not for mainland Europe).

But if you come up with something new, or simply manage to take the plot of another franchise and tailor it to fit Harry Potter, you get a new story that most people have never read before. Even simple ideas, like giving Harry Anakin Skywalker's arc from the prequels (with magic replacing the SciFi stuff), give you a completely different reading experience.

Tl;Dr: We like Harry Potter for the general world and some characters and use that sandbox to play in.
