I don't really go on the HP subreddit, so I can't really speak for that, but I would assume it's just the difference of a fanfic focused sub vs that of one for the official books/movies/media.

One is pretty much all about exploring things not found in canon, and given how long its been since they came out, it makes sense we dive far into AUs to try and find something different. If we wanted non AU canon things, for the most part, we can just go read canon - it's just hard to find new fanfic that explores things in canon and stays fully canon without it feeling stale after a while imo.

So [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] will stick more towards canon and non AU just because they're about the canon media.
