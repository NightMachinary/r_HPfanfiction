I cannot recommand enough the excellent [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] linkffn(8096183)

It's a DnD crossover where a Player Character named Milo end up in HP universe, but he, and only he, is a wizard whose life is ruled by the rules of the game. So hit points, limited spell slots, fixed spell list, and the like.

it's very well written, fun and serious and good at both.

Even better Ron, Hermione and Harry are written like kids, without being annoying as hell so you avoid the weird "children acting like grown adults" effect.
