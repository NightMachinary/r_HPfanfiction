Well, "super powerful Harry rolling up to a new Universe" definitely does not fall into the good fanfic category

But any type of crossover is fair-game, no matter if they are from different universes or from the same universe.

But as long as they make sense that is. Cause I hate how when Harry is for some reason in another planet or universe Hogwarts always finds a way to drag him back. Or in the same-universe case, their world mixes awkwardly, like how something that is supposed to be personal information about the main character of the other setting is common knowledge among wizards.
