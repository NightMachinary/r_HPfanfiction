The predictions were:

#+begin_quote
  Harry is in danger of burns
#+end_quote

He has to face a dragon in his First Task, as well as the Blast-Ended Skrewts in Care of Magical Creatures and the maze.

#+begin_quote
  Lose a treasured possession
#+end_quote

He loses Ron in the Second Task and had to find him.

#+begin_quote
  He'll be stabbed in the back by someone whom he thought was a friend
#+end_quote

Ron briefly goes cold on him and cancels their friendship, as well as Moody being a confidant who ultimately ended up a traitor. Either of these could qualify.

#+begin_quote
  Harry will come off worse in a fight
#+end_quote

Harry fights Voldemort proper, and while Harry does come out alive Voldemort definitely ended up a lot better off and Harry was off worse.
