Somewhat tangential idea. What if Harry got fed up with predicting his death and instead foretold great fortunes and those predictions all come true? Like, one day he wins big in some magical lottery, the next day he gets a harem, after that a trip to the moon, on Monday Malfoy stumbles and falls from some tower only to be saved by a big pile of dragon manure, then Umbridge chokes to death on a toad before Harry wins the Quidditch World Cup and so on.
