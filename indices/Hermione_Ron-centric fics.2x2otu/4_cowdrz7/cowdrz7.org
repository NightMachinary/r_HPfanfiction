I know, that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home][this]] isn't really what you're looking for, but it features a likeable Ron/Hermione pairing. Of course the story still is about Harry, and a girl Harry at that, but, you know, good Hermione and Ron. That's not nothing, right?
