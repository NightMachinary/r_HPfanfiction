I manage a community for Hermione/Ron stories on ff.net

The overwhelming majority of stories are Ron or Hermione centric. Here's a link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/SS-Romione/117640/99/4/1/0/0/0/0/]]

I'd recommend going through the top favorited ones first to see the most popular. Keep in mind some of the earlier stories diverge from canon since they were published before all the books were published.

Some author recs who write many Ron/Hermione stories: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4185673/diva-gonzo][diva.gonzo]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4548380/Coyote-Laughing-Softly][Coyote Laughing Softly]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3955920/HalfASlug][HalfASlug]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1146256/TMBlue][TMBlue]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1408980/mugglemama][mugglemama]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2559733/writergirl8][writergirl8]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2641492/jesrod82][jesrod82]], and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3204486/HawthornBlood141][HawthornBlood141]].

I also recall reading some great ones on thequiditchpitch that are not canon compliant but I'll drop links if you're interested.
