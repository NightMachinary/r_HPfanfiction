Excellent author who has written multiple R/Hr fics, most of them Hogwarts-era and canon compliant. She made me fall in love with Ron as a character, as well as Ron/Hermione together.

She has a knack for capturing those little unimportant moments that we don't see in the books, like sitting around the common room talking about trivial things or just having lunch at the Burrow.
