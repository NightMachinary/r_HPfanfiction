One of my own R/Hr fics is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793014/1/The-Wedding][here]] - Biil & Fleur's wedding from Ron's perspective.

Little bit of future thrown in at the end, but I like to think it's still canon-compliant :)

I would recommend "His Return" a little higher as far as how much I like them, but it's not very canon :) Still strong R/Hr
