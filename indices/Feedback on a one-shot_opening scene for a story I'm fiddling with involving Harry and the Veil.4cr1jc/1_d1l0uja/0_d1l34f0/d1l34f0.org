I do know I have a problem with pauses in my writing. I tend to try and cram scentences together with commas so I don't have a bunch of small five word sentences hanging around, but it doesn't really fix the problem. I'll be sure to work on it and see if I can find a beta to help me pick them out.

Do you have any critiques/suggestions pertaining to the idea per chance? I like where I'm going with it, but I don't want to fall into any overused or bad tropes I might not be aware of if I can help it.
