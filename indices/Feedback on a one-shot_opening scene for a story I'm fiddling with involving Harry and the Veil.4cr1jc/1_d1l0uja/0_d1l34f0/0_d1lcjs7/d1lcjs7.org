I understand where you are coming from. Sentence variation is very important and do like a lot of how you structure, it is literally just that there are more commas than necessary. A beta will definitely help you with that ðŸ™‚

I very much like this idea. You are right, Harry is very impulsive and this is a believable move on his part. I am curious what crossover you are thinking of if you would do that? I do like the idea of it being a one shot, but if you have a solid multichap I would say go for it.
