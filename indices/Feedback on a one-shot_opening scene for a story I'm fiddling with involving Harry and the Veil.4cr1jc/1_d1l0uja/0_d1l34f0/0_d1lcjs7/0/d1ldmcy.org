It's been awhile since I've written creatively (most of my work recently has been academic papers), so getting the hang of sentence structure that's more usable in terms of reader immersion and enjoyment is still coming back to me. I'll definitely be looking for a beta some time soon if I go forward with this, and it's looking more and more like I will.

I'd actually thought to have it as a HTTYD crossover, though this scene has changed a lot since I first had the idea and the crossover wouldn't be viable as it is currently. Now I'm looking more at possibly Norse Mythology influences, or possibly completely unique worlds. Maybe a series of alternate fandoms Harry and his story happen to align with in some way. Not entirely sure what direction it's going to go in now that it's broken ties with the original plot idea, but it seems like it will be interesting regardless. :)

There's a chance i'll just clean this section up and put it out as a one shot, and then use a less detailed or slightly variant version to kick off a longer multi-chapter story. This does work pretty well as a one shot, but i also like how open it leaves possibilities for continuing with it.
