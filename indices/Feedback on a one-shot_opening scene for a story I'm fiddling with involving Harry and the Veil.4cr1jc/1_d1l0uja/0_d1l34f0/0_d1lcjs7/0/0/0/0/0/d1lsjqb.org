I was thinking of doing a spin-off of the idea where Harry is taken in to the ministry for questioning after the chamber of secrets incident (strictly questioning; none of that azkaban!harry nonsense here!), and he gets freaked out so he runs off from the aurors and hides in the department of mysteries. Harry is really resourceful when he feels threatened, and so he'd likely hide from the aurors and unspeakables long enough to accidentally tumblr through the veil in a panic. Then THAT leads to the HTTYD crossover.

I'll probably put this out as a oneshot once I edit it a little more and get it beta'd, and then write a longer story afterwords using the world hopping idea. So three stories spawing from this I guess haha.
