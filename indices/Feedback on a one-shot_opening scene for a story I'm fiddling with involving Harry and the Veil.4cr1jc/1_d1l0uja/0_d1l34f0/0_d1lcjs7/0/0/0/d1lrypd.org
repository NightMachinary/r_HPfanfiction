Yep. I made the connection that a night fury is a creature of lightning and death, and Harry is in a way, so dropping him in the HTTYD verse would probably result in te universe laughing and turning him into one or connecting him to one in some way. Which, while that's still a story I'd like to write, wouldn't mesh well with the tone of this scene I think.

I'll be sure to keep you bookmarked if I need a beta in the future for this! :)
