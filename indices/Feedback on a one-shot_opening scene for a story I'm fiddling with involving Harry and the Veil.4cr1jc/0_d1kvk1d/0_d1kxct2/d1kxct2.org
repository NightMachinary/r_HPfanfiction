I've only ever seen the movie once, when I was very young, but I do remember the movie being very intense and full of wonder! A good choice for a crossover I think.

For this, I was thinking more of a universe jumper deal, where Harry is barred from his orginal world due to some plot mechanism, so he has to realm hop to both try and return home, but also find Sirius, who landed in another realm since Harry lost his grip when they both fell.

I think the reason he wouldn't be able to return would likely be because the Veil is part of a pair of portals; one goes in the other out of the universe, and the Veil can only go out. Each world portal has a set location to another realm, and the return portal to the previous world might not be there. So Harry has to hop from realm to realm to find the one that leads back home. And along the way there's an important sidequest of finding Sirius if he can.

Each realm follows its own set of universal laws, so in realms where magic doesnt exist harry loses his magic, or in realms where it follows other rules, his magic changes to match. SO that means powers dont carry over, and if Harry ever DID manage to return to his own world, he'd be the same as he was when he left, except with perhaps more memories and life experiences backing him.
