At this point in Harry Potter fandom I don't think any fics are particularly weird. Loads and loads and /loads/ have things have already been done /so many times/ that sometimes 'normal' gets boring. Also, sometimes you've just read everything else you'd consider reading usually and want something different.

I still probably won't read a lot of the things some people request but that's a personal preference thing.
