Different strokes for different blokes I guess.

For example, I love Tomione and there are some /very/ well written fics out there that make the pairing believable. Of course, nearly everyone in fandom hates that pairing.

We all have things that we like and dislike- I absolutely abhor Snape/Hermione fics.
