Yep. I'd never directly call someone out for it, because "getting into an internet argument about why Harry and Draco or Hermione and Draco should or shouldn't be a couple" has got to be some kind of life fail condition, but parsing the books and paying attention to their characters, it seems truly bizarre that either couple /could/ happen, much less that you'd actually /want/ it to.
