I enjoy both, but the ones I read don't try to pair them up as they are in canon. They're mostly set post-Hogwarts. The characters have grown up a bit, they've been through a war and either gotten past teenage rivalries or manage to do so over the course of the story. In particular it's interesting to read about how Draco's experience in the war may have changed him for the better.
