Yeah but everyone has their own preferences. Somethings mentioned here I agree with and some things I dont. I enjoy me a good Drarry and Dramione but I can't stand some of the stuff people ask for on here.

Edit: Also, its fanfiction I don't see why people need to shit on any concept as well as its decently written. Just don't read it if you don't personally like the idea. I understand not liking something cause its actual shit but if you start complaining about straying away from the character and how "it doesn't make sense" well then no fan fiction makes sense and the only one allowed to write Harry Potter is J.K Rowling. And she can't change anything.
