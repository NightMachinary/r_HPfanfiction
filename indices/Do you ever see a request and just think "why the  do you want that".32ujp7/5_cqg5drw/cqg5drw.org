Anything that even remotely suggests good ol' Tommie is a sexual being in any way. The fact that anyone would read the books/watch the films and go "God, I wish someone would write a really lemony piece about his junk" just creeps me out. Bring on the depravity, knock yourselves out, but Snakeface is /not/ hot, OK? Thanks.

Nah, whatever floats your boat and all that, but I seriously don't get it.
