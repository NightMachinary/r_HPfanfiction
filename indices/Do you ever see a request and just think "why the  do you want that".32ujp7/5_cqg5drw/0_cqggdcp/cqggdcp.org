I do agree for the most part. I can't see canon Voldemort being at all sexual, but while he's not attractive his younger version canonically is. (Seriously, reread HBP and see how often it's mentioned during the memory scenes that Riddle is handsome.) I've seen people saying that the dude who played him in Chamber of Secrets movie is attractive as well, so I can see why they would do it. Attractive people always get sexualised, no matter the evilness of their character.
