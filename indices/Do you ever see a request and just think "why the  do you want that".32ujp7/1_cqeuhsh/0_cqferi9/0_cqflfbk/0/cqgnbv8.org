Seconded. That sounds like it would be hilarious-for the fifteen seconds of screen time the tot gets before 'suddenly-Death Eaters!' happens. After that-well, either it's another 2 decades' waiting time in store before Voldemort gets offed or a situation that absolutely requires an EPIC roaring rampage of revenge.
