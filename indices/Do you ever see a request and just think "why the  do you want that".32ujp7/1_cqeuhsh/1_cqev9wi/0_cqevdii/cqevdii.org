I'm not knocking your reading material! Just noting that it isn't what I would pick for myself. For example, you might not want to read Female!Snape, but I think it sounds kinda neat.

People having different tastes is part of what makes the fanfiction community so varied and interesting. There's always someone writing about something you didn't think of on you own.
