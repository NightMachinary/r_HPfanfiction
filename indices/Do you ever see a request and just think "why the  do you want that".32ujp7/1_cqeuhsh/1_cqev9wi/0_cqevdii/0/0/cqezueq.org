I made a topic a while back and was recommended two. [[http://asylums.insanejournal.com/snarry_games/248638.html][Temperance is a Virtue]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4461504/1/Read-the-Fine-Print][Read the Fine Print]]. The first is eh and the second is OK. Hardly a ringing endorsement! To be honest, I haven't come across any others, but I wish I have! Sorry to be no help.
