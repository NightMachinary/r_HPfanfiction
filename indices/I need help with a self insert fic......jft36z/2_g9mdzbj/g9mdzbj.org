I struggle with the same in “Brother and Sister” linkao3(23443483): more and more I work on it, more it resembles “laundry list of all things Harry should do in the summer before HBP” than a real story. Now rewriting as a screenplay hoping it would clear the story of some long monologues (read: inserted essays on some topic).
