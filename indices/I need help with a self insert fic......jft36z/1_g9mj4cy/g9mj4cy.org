I agree with nescienceescape - that's not a bad thing if you don't want it to be. But if you're looking to make it a more cohesive narrative, the trick is to start tying things together with whys and reasoning. They're doing all these things for what feels like shits and giggles? Find them another reason to do them, and then link a few different things to a single overarching reason. That can manifest differently depending on whether it's information or action, and you can have multiple plot points going if you're wanting, too. eg. Opening the Chamber of Secrets and Finding Out Lockhart is a Fraud.

If you have your characters hear five rumours (ie. gaining information), make three of the five rumours to do with a single main plot point (eg. when the Chamber of Secrets opened, the chickens all died, the forest is restless, and Ginny is acting strange) and prep to reveal that connection later on ("You had no idea, but I had Ginny kill all the chickens and sneak into the forest to get my potion ingredients!"). Think of the information as many different clues to the same mystery.

If they pull four pranks (ie. performing actions), then make those pranks all try meet the same objective. Think of them like four battles in a war. The battles may have specific sub-objectives (take this city from the enemy, route an attack on a harbour, take out a talented enemy general, etc) but the overall goal of 'win the war' is still there. So, they might decide they want Snape gone from the castle and do a lot of different things as part of the plan to make that happen.

To repeat, 'a collection of shit I'd do at Hogwarts' isn't a bad thing - if you decide you like that, do go all in on it. But if you want a more traditional narrative, the trick is to tie your separate ideas together in plot and purpose.
