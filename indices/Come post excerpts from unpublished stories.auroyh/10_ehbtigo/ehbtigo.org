From "Geralt Grindelwald". A timetravel fic.

The sun over Surrey was drenching the suburban scenery in an entirely undeserved bright, cheery light. Just looking at the houses, all exactly the same with only the desperate suggestion of individuality separating them by look, nauseated him. The streets were as dead as if the houses were owned by vampires. One half, mostly the men, were out working while the other half, mostly the women, were busy keeping their houses perfectly ordinary, boring and clean.

As he stomped through the neighbourhood he briefly thought back to his small bottomless bag and the muggle clothes in it. Should he have worn a suit? Spite, and if he was honest with himself, the chance to scare Petunia Dursley out of her wits made him wear a black, modern robe, befitting of a pureblood wizard. The silver seams and buttons made his pale eyes especially vivid and his blond hair look like it was completely white. It was truly an odd sight in a muggle area. He didn't care. Harry looked forward to his aunt seeing him.

Privet Drive 2 and 3 passed him by and Harry got another good look at one of the, if not his singularly most hated place in the world. Despite it looking like every other house; it being even more well cared for, it was the ugliest place in the universe for Harry. The perfectly cut, english lawn, the hedges so geometric as if they were drawn with a ruler and the walls so immaculate as if polished made Harry want to let loose enough to be jailed for muggle-baiting. He thought better of it, but the idea remained in the back of his head in case Petunia was especially nerve-wrecking.

Taking a deep breath Harry knocked on the door and rang the bell, a combination he knew would make his aunt exceedingly annoyed. The first thing he heard was a muffled “Make Harry get it.” from inside.

Harry was almost at the point of charming the door open when the lock clicked and the meek face of his younger self looked up at him.

“Hello, sir?” young Harry began, while giving the older Harry a sceptic once-over.

Harry's own greeting got stuck in his throat. This was too surreal for him to just glance over. His mind was struggling to comprehend the time-displaced mirror image right in front of him.

“Sir? Can I... help you?”

Harry shook his head once to clear it, with just enough success to get his mouth talking. “Yes. Uhm... Harry Potter, I assume?”

“Thats me...?” Harry began when the screeching voice of aunt Petunia interrupted him.

“Who is it, boy? If they sell, tell them we are not buying!”

Young Harry rolled his eyes and asked. “Are you selling something?” in his most mocking voice possible.

The older Harry smirked down at the young boy but shook his head. “I'm not a salesman, I'm a Professor. You have not answered our letters, so the faculty decided to send me to ask personally.”

“Oh...” was all the boy could muster to say while sending a furtive glance over his shoulders.

“Let me guess. Post by owl was not appreciated?”

The boy snorted a laugh. “Not at all, sir.”

“Then I'm sure a more... personal approach is more welcome. May I come in?”

“I don't...” he said while giving the rooms in his back a fearful look.

“Thank you.” Harry said, having lost his patience, and just shoved right past him through the door. Just one step in and Harry was hit with a flood of imagery he could have done without, forever. Yet there he was and the petty bourgeois interior of Privet Drive 4 ripped all those old memories, all those old wounds open again. It was, of course, upheld to the T, not a speck of dirt to be seen, to a large part thanks to the little boy that now stood behind him in a helpless stupor.

Making sure not to even glance at the door to the broom closet under the stairs Harry made his way to the living room and kitchen. Sure enough, the first thing in sight was his cousin, as round as a ball, stuffing his face with crisps in front of the TV, followed shortly by the paling face of Petunia Dursley who held up a pan as if she was not sure if she should use it as a weapon or shield.

“Petunia Dursley, I presume?” Harry asked, doing his best to channel Severus Snape with all his contempt and patronising qualities of voice.

Petunia opened and closed her mouth a few times before she found her wits. “Get out! Get out, he's not... He is going to Stonewall, not this... not this school for...”

Harry stepped closer to her, drawing his wand and waving it around so that Petunia could follow it easily with her scared look. “Mrs. Dursley, I must tell you that there isn't much of a choice. Harry's parents have enrolled him in Hogwarts the day he was born. Why go against it? Believe me, you wouldn't want an untrained wizard in your house. Accidents happen if those abilities are not trained and controlled.”

“Wizard?” he heard young Harry whisper to himself.

Without turning around, his eyes still on Petunia, Harry answered his little counterpart. “Indeed, you are a wizard. I assume that information has been withheld from you? Ever had any... impossible, unbelievable,... supernatural things happen to you?”

“Shut your mouth, boy!” Petunia screeched at her nephew, but the look on young Harry's face was all the answer anyone needed. He had done the impossible, and several times at that.

“Of course you had, otherwise we would not have written to you in the first place.” the old Harry answered for the young one. “So Mrs. Dursley, I must ask you to be reasonable here. Deny me and the next one coming for Harry will be less... civil.”

Harry could almost watch the gears turn in Petunia's head. She eyed him, then her young nephew, and then Harry again. “Normal people introduce themselves.” she pressed out from between her teeth.

“Of course, “ Harry warbled and acted as if he had forgotten about it. “Where are my manners? My name is Professor Geralt Grindelwald, and I do have to say that I would have preferred to never meet, yet here I am and so we do, Mrs. Dursley.” Before Petunia had the chance to say anything, Harry continued. “To move this along, here is how the next days and even years will play out. I will escort Harry to Diagon Alley where he will be able to purchase all the required equipment for his schooling. You will gracefully ignore his absence and sleep well with the thought that he won't blow your house to shreds in a few years because of a bout of anger.” Still not letting Petunia speak, he turned around to his smaller version and asked him. “Want to learn magic, lad?”

“Magic, sir?” Harry looked incredibly conflicted. “But magic doesn't exist, sir.” he almost pleaded.

“Didn't you just say you had these unbelievable, supernatural occurrences?”

“Yes, but...” Young Harry just shrugged, helplessly searching for any reason to not believe in something he was trained to not believe in, clearly seeing how his aunt glared at the man claiming to be a wizard.
