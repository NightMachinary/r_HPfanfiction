*The Subtle Darkness*

"I felt you in my mind," said Voldemort softly. "I saw you in Nagini."

Harry couldn't even breathe, let alone reply. His thoughts turned to the times Harry had seen from Voldemort's eyes... The summer before Voldemort's rebirth, the flashes of emotion, of images, when Voldemort was enraged... When Harry was the snake, lunging at Arthur.

"I am the greatest Legilimens the world has ever seen, and yet you are able to slither your way into my mind with not a hint of training," said Voldemort regarding Harry pensively. "You can speak Parseltongue, yet you are not descended from Slytherin... and our wands..."

Harry's stomach dropped as Voldemort studied the wand Harry carried carefully.

"Your wand, it calls to me, as if it is a long-lost brother, and not an enemy. Quite strange, is it not? Most wands will refuse to cooperate within another's hands unless you overpower the bond, break it. Yet, I have done nothing, and your wand sings."

Harry closed his eyes for a moment, breathing fast.

"It seems on the night I gave you that scar, I also gave you something more... something greater," whispered Voldemort. "I created you, and everything you are."

The blood pounded in Harry's ears, overwhelming any other sounds. His hands shook, his feet tingled. His clear vision disfigured, as if he was looking through the waterfall at Voldemort. He had to get away. He couldn't listen to the next words. He couldn't.

"Have you not realised how similar we are? Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. The only two known Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts in the last hundred years, and wielding brother wands. We can see in each other's minds, no matter the distance, and feel the emotions of the other. We even look somewhat alike... that is, when I was younger, of course." His voice was like silk, wrapping itself around Harry, worming its way into every corner of his mind.

Harry felt as if he was drowning in the sea of his biggest fears. He was dirty, contaminated, as if his whole life he had been carrying some sort of deadly curse, ready to infect anyone he encountered. He couldn't think, couldn't breathe.

"No," he barely whispered. "You're wrong."

Voldemort smiled his terrible smile, his red eyes twinkling with pleasure.

"Are you telling me, or merely trying to convince yourself of the sweetened lie Albus has told you?" At Harry's look of despair, his grin widened. "You went to him before, haven't you? Did he tell you that it is your actions that matter more than our similarities? That it is our choices that define us?"

Voldemort chucked.

"Of course, he did. Yet, he told you only a fraction of truth. Would you have been you without me? Every year of your life has revolved around me. From your parents' deaths, the Philosophers Stone, to last night in the Graveyard. Do you not see, Harry? We are entwined... destined to be by each other, to be alike. /I made you."/

Inside Harry's head was a carousel of fears spinning wildly out of control, each one pushing his mind into blackness. He wanted to run; he needed to freeze. The sounds, of water falling, and Voldemort laughing, felt far away, like he was no longer in the body which knelt paralyzed in the wet grass.

He barely noticed Voldemort backing up, his own wand raising, or the waterfall spluttering as it dried. He stared blankly ahead, weakly gasping at anything to prove Voldemort wrong.

"Harry Potter, I offer you a place in my circle," Voldemort announced and Harry realised he could hear the Death Eaters again. They were laughing over his friends' tears. "Do you accept?"

Harry couldn't move, couldn't speak. His mind spun faster, and faster, his thoughts breaking apart before they formed. This couldn't be happening, it couldn't be. One minute... All they needed was a single minute and Dumbledore would arrive...

“Harry! Don't do it!” screamed Ginny, breaking the silence and piercing the panic Harry was in. It was the rough slap that followed, and the shouts that followed, which snapped Harry from his state.

"Ginny!" Ron shouted, "Don't you touch her, you bastard!"

Ron was not the only one shouting. All the Weasleys' were screaming, some at Harry, and the others at the Death Eaters.

"Silence!" hissed Voldemort, his smirk fading.

The Weasleys' fell silent, their mouths agape as they tried to speak.

"Perhaps, it is time to see the suffering that your friends will endure if you do not agree. Afterall, Lord Voldemort punishes those who stand against him.”
