“Tell me again why we're flying north.”

“Did you not listen to a word I said at the Ministry?” Daphne said, looking at Harry in disbelief.

“I did,” Harry said, nodding. “But then we saw those two house-elves snogging and I Obliviated myself.” Harry scratched his stubbled chin. “Think I overdid it.”

Daphne stared at Harry for a long moment. “Fine. Even if you're joking, which I'm not so sure you are, I'm going to explain it again because you're the type of man to need things explained to him twice.”

“Hey.”

“Shush, you.” Daphne grabbed a handle as they hit a particularly bad spot of turbulence. “Norway got wind of some kind of strange magical disturbance happening in Svalbard.”

“That's in the Arctic.”

“Congratulations,” Daphne said, “you know your geography. Now listen. They sent a couple members of their own Ministry up there, and then never heard from them again. After losing two groups, they figured they'd --- er ---”

Harry nodded. “Call in the big guns. The top dogs. The pros.”

“Something like that,” Daphne said absentmindedly, looking out the window. “You were picked, of course. But as they knew you'd bring me along, and since you were... busy, they grabbed me, told me the info, and then I grabbed you. And now we're here.”

“Yeah,” Harry said, “I was kind of talking about why we were going on a plane, not why we were going.” He glanced sideways at her. “You knew that, right?”

Daphne smacked his arm. “If you wished to Apparate from England to Svalbard, you can Apparate back.”

“No need to get abusive about it,” Harry muttered, switching seats to look out the same window Daphne was. “Why didn't we just grab a Portkey?”

“The Norwegian Ministry already tried. The Portkey wouldn't actually work.”

“Are you sure they did it properly? I mean, it is the Norwegian.”

“Don't be silly,” Daphne said, unable to keep the amusement out of her voice.

The visibility outside the plane was getting worse, as was the turbulence. Harry was fairly certain they'd crash any minute now, but he didn't tell Daphne this. He didn't want her to worry.

“We'll probably crash any moment now,” Daphne said idly.

“Yup,” said Harry, pulling out his wand.

A far green country stretched before Aragorn, its beauty not yet tainted by what was to come. Not yet, but soon, for an army of ten thousand strong marched its way toward Helm's Deep, and the lush grass his horse galloped through would soon be trampled and ruined, as was all touched by the foulness of orcs.

He found himself for once thankful that the bond between a horse and its rider would never reach so deep, for had his own weariness carried over to his horse then they would have never made it to their destination, which was still some distance away. An hour, perhaps, by his reckoning.

Or perhaps more, for as he and his horse reached the peak of yet another hill, he spotted that which he could not leave alone, no matter if it delayed him in his journey. It was a figure on a horse, black as the rider's own cloak. And they made their way slowly to the hill which upon Aragorn and his horse stood.

Aragorn rode down to meet the rider, not willing to waste time.

“Rider before me!” he yelled as his horse neared. “Turn back now and ride swiftly away, for only death awaits you beyond these hills!”

He eased his horse from a gallop to a trot and then to a stop when he reached the rider. And it was to his surprise to find that the rider was not a man as he had expected, but a woman. This was very strange indeed, for what woman rode alone in these parts? What woman rode alone in any parts?

She raised her head to see him, as her hood had hid her eyes from his heightened position on the hill. Green eyes were set upon him, and how very green and lovely they were. How very lovely all of her was.

Black was her hair, as dark as her cloak and horse, and Aragorn wondered briefly if it was wise to approach someone cloaked in all black in these fell times. He was weary, very much so, and depending on her skill he was not so sure if he could properly defend himself from even a woman.

“Did you not hear me, my lady?” he said when she did nothing but observe him as though he were a finely crafted statue.

“I heard,” she said, her voice light and melodious, though Aragorn might've believed there was also power in it, a dark kind of edge, had he not been so exhausted. “I heard you quite well. Death and death only awaits me beyond those hills, you say?”

Aragorn nodded grimly. “Aye. You must ride, ride away or with me to Helm's Deep if you have no place to go. An army of ten thousand orcs marches.”

“Oh, really?” the woman said idly, looking to the hill he had come from, and though he knew her to have heard, her tone suggested that she hadn't paid any attention at all to what he had just said.

A breathy, disbelieving laugh escaped him. “Yes, really. Do you not fear orcs?”

Her gaze returned to him. “Not particularly, no.”

“You jest, surely!”

The woman shrugged. “How long until they reach us?”

Aragorn stared for a moment, unsure of what to think. “Two hours, perhaps three if they rest, though I do not believe they will. It is plenty time for you to ride! They are ten thousand strong, my lady, do not underestimate them!”

“My lady?” the woman said, half-amused and half-absently. “My name is Evelyn Potter. And I do not underestimate. Tell me, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, do these orcs carry magic amongst themselves? Do wizards or witches walk in their midst? And, if I may ask, for I wish not to delve any deeper into your mind than I already have, what is Helm's Deep and why is it you ride there?”

She said this all without giving pause for him to answer. Though, Aragorn was sure he wouldn't have been able to answer anyway. Her questions brought fear down upon him. She had known his name, had freely admitted to looking into his mind, wore all black, and spoke of orcs and magic as though they were meant to be found together.

Had he come upon a user of dark sorcery, sent up ahead as a scout for the army?

Was Saruman amongst them?

And what else had she already learned from his mind?

What of the Ring?

“What Ring?” Evelyn said, blinking up at him.
