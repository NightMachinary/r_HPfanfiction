Thanks for the feedback!

For the last one, it pretty much is a "Why not?" in regards to it being fem!Harry. I just enjoy writing a female protagonist. And it was just meant to be a one shot, where Evelyn literally obliterates the orc army. The other LOTR fic I'm writing I have HP magic tempered a bit, so I wanted to use HP magic to its full extent.

And I feel like a talented adult wizard would be able to easily deal with a normal army via either fiendfyre or the use of Transfiguration and Animation charms to create large rock soldiers or whatever. Charm them Unbreakable and no mundane army would stand a chance. (This is why she asks if the army will have any magic in it, because I largely subscribe to the idea that only other magic can override magic)

It was pretty much just going to be Aragorn watching in disbelief as thousands of orcs are killed by one woman.
