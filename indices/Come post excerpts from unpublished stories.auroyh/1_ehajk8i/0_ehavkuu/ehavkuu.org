I think Daphne (as presented here) is a good choice to complement (balance out? be a foil to?) Harry here. Honestly a little odd that he knows where Svalbard is, but that might be my (biased) education speaking. The [Apparate] sentence is a bit confusing, and I only got it on the second read (Apparate back to Apparate forward). [actually] breaks up the Portkey sentence unnaturally: something with tenses? The humor in the last few lines was on point; I'd love to read more of it. The danger also seems routine. I love it.

Not to my taste. I half-skimmed it and it seems horrifying and depressing.

I'm feeling the fantasy adventure in the prose here. Aragorn's dialogue reads slightly archaic, which is probably standard for LotR, but it's still well-done here. [Death and death] is slightly odd phrasing that I can't really parse as archaic, but it did lead me to expect a "Death is an old friend of mine" line, which gave me a chuckle. The casual disregard of mundane threats actually makes magic seem useful, which is a breath of fresh air compared to what I've recently been reading. I don't see a purpose for a F!Potter in the plot, but I support F!Potter for "because why not?" reasons anyway. I'm seeing your wonderful sense of humor at the end here, too, with the paranoia spiral abruptly interrupted by Evelyn's innocent obliviousness. Also implies she hasn't been in Middle-Earth long. Very interesting, might read, even if I don't read a lot of LotR.
