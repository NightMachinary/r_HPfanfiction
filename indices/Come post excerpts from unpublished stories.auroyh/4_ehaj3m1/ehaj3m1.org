Symbolism

Symbolism was important to magic.

It was magic didn't necessarily follow rules and laws like modern science.

However, symbolism seemed to be a major rule.

Wand woods and cores follow this to a tee. Phoenix feathers are the hardest to tame, elder is associated with powerful magics. To achieve immortality requires sacrifice.

It wasn't commonly known, but a Philosopher's Stone could only be made from the sacrifice of a human life. Soul magics to ensure immortality tended to require a similar price.

Harry had his wand snapped, but had kept the pieces. He needed a replacement.

Ollivander was kind enough to agree to help out.

He still had his Phoenix feather core, and the centaurs bestowed the parts of the unicorns from his first year he avenged. He salvaged parts of the basilisk, and was awarded the parts of the Hungarian horntail from his first task. A thestral tailhair from the beast who carried him to the Department of Mysteries. Veela hair as Fleur and Gabrielle paid back the boy who selflessly rescued them from the lake. Acromantula venom Harry got Hagrid to retrieve from Aragog.

Chimeras were beasts of magic. A hodgepodge of creatures with breath almost as hot as the most ferocious dragon. Immune to the unforgivables due to not truly being sentient, it had resistance to all but the most powerful of spells. A creation of darkest magic and the vilest of luck.

In a direct assault, even Voldemort or Dumbledore would be hard pressed.

But Harry read the classics... he understood a lesson. No one thing can reign supreme. A Chimera might not beat a basilisk in venom or stares, or a dragon with the heat of its fire, or even a unicorn with its speed. But it ranked far up on the scale and had other strengths. A rather strong jack-of-all-trades. Of course Harry wasn't stupid. He wouldn't dare try to create a chimera. But for his wand core... he only wanted the absolute best.

The Purebloods were right, if for the wrong reasons. Magical blood was important. Not the ancestry of course, but rather the power imbued within it. It made for an excellent binding agent, whether for wards or alchemy. And it was not just his blood, but blood of an avenged unicorn, of a ferocious Hungarian Horntail, and of a basilisk in its prime.

Harry drew three transmutation circles with the blood mixture he created.

Harry place the hodge-podge of prime core material at the center of the circle.

A transmutation achieved a golden string.

Harry smiled. It seems the Fates no longer controlled him. He had his own string.
