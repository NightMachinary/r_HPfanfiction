I'm liking the "symbolism" basis of magic, and definitely feeling the FMA inspiration. Sentence structure is a bit rough, e.g. [unicorns he avenged in his first year] would flow a lot better. No idea where all these parts are coming from, like why would he be given parts of the Horntail (that was last seen hearty and whole)? Slight aversion from the mention of a life debt, I would honestly prefer an actual friendship. Also, double period [..] there. The bit about Unforgivables is blatantly against my understanding of canon (Moody's demonstration with spiders), and should probably be justified at some point. Homophone with [rein], you probably meant [reign]. Contradictory information: [hotter breath] ... [not beat / dragon / fire]. Very interesting concept with the alchemy (which isn't explored much) and the String of Fate (which implies a more conceptual/divine focus for magic), but it could use an editor.
