I agree with the life debt thing, they make no sense in canon and are overused in fanfiction. It's just I couldn't match the sentence structure with friendship. I did miss the contradictory statement, although granted I didn't really check the excerpt over. The [rein] [reign] mix-up I do blame on my phone. And FMA is super awesome and makes me mad the first book is called the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States.
