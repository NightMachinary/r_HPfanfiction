I think having Gabrielle give it to Harry at the end of fourth book as a symbol of her graditude which you can even use for a little world building here and claim it's a part of the magical culture of the French or the whole of world. Or she could have given it to Harry during Bill and Fleur's wedding as a promise of future courtship, again could be a part of Magical France's culture. Ä°f you use the second one. I got nothing on Fleur though. I think single Veela hair wouln be better anyway, could add a certain sense of a symbol of equality, what with a single magical part from each creature/person.
