Divines, that was wonderful. This feels like crack. I'm seeing hints that you did some research into the fae, and I love it when authors do research. I didn't /think/ redcaps were from a court, but the entirety of my knowledge comes from /Dresden/ fanon and a British Literature class.

This premise is so outside my comfort zone I can't critique it. 1990s Worm is virtually unexplored. Muggle Harry Potter is virtually unexplored. Fusions between the two are virtually unexplored. I have no idea how powers and magic mix.
