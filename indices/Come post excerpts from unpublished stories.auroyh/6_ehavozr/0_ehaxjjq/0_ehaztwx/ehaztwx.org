Yeah, even just writing first person feels weird to me. It's good for things like unreliable narrators, which Harry in the Worm fic definitely is - he writes Dudley off too quickly, for instance, and the plan is for it to come back to bite him later - but eh. I might try to redo the thing in my usual third-person. And "unexplored" is right - there's like next to no lore there, I had to rummage through Wildbow's word-of-god posts and check citations from the wiki to find any concise information on it, and there's just not a lot for Britain in general. Glaistig Uaine is just getting into her rampage, was what I had determined, plus some bits about the Suits and King's Men. Beyond that I was mostly extrapolating. The Geselleschaft probably was angling for a foothold, the IRA presumably had capes and was using them, the Unwritten Rules were in their infancy, the CUI and Yangban were probably just starting out (and in need of capes, and willing to deal with human traffickers), Behemoth was the only known Endbringer and it had just attacked New York around the time of the Triwizard Tournament's second task(?).

Lots of things I'd need to work out if I wanted to continue it satisfactorily. Doesn't help that I'm an American and know next to nothing about 90s-era Britain, politically or societally...and that's before you add in a decade of parahuman politics on top of that.

As for my redcaps: /definitely/ looked into old-style fae. I'd call them more of an inspiration than a followed pattern in this case, though - some of the many differences being that mine are social, eternally childlike, and part of a court, whereas (to my knowledge) they're traditionally solitary, look like old men, and unaffiliated. Really glad you enjoyed that snippet, though.

Thanks for the reviews in general! I love it when people enjoy my writing.
