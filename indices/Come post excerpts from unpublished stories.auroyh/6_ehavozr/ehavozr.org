*Excerpt 1 context:* Pre-Hogwarts, Harry got abducted/adopted/absorbed by a band of Unseelie fae. When he doesn't show up for the train in first year, Dumbledore and Snape hunt him down and "retrieve" him against his will, intending to re-humanize him. Problem is, Harry doesn't want to be human again, and the Unseelie have, ah, /unique/ customs.

--------------

“The rules have /capital punishments?/” Harry blurted out once Dumbledore finished his litany of prohibitions. “What kind of school is this?”

“Potter, if you kill and eat a classmate, I will cast the Killing Curse myself,” Snape growled. “I won't even be thrown in Azkaban for it. You're not human. Unforgivables are illegal only against humans. Do not test me.”

“But I /eat/ people! What do you expect me to do, starve?”

“I expect you to eat in the Great Hall, from the plates provided you, /without/ supplementing it by thinning the herd of NEWT students!”

“Come on, there's got to be at least /one/ you don't like -- “

“I am perfectly capable of eliminating my own disfavored!”

Dumbledore, hands steepled on his desk, looked rather grim. It was his fault for forcing him to stay here, Harry thought bitterly. If the bastard didn't want to feel sad about how a /redcap/ was angry that he couldn't /eat/, he shouldn't have abducted one in the first place! Bloody stupid wizards.

Or, well. Maybe he was upset that Snape had just insinuated that he did have students he wanted dead and was willing to eliminate them on his own time. That might not look so good in a teacher...

Snape let his anger out in a huff and ran a hand over his face. “I understand there are certain allowances that must be made for you as a redcap. However, the consumption of live human flesh will not be one of them.”

“Allowances?" Dumbledore repeated softly. "Severus, he will never change his behavior if he is encouraged to continue it."

“Can I eat /him?/”

Snape buried his face in his hands and bit back a frustrated scream.

*Excerpt 2 context:* I kept complaining about there not being any decent Worm crossovers where Harry was a parahuman, so I decided to try my hand at writing one. Not sure about this one; I don't usually write first-person, but it felt odd not writing a Worm fic in it. General idea is that Harry triggers after Voldemort's graveyard resurrection and wants to moonlight as a superhero over the summer...with a Tinker power that is essentially mass-producible cybernetic necromancy. Dudley catches him right after his first Tinker fugue.

--------------

The cover snicked into place, an impossibly satisfying sound, and I was done. Before me sat a smooth white U-shaped collar with two dozen electrodes dangling off it like hair, and the brand-name power drill battery sticking asymmetrically out of one side. There were loops on the end for bolts to go through and secure the whole thing permanently to whatever poor sod it was destined for. It was held together by superpowers, electrical tape, and the liberal application of superglue.

Would it work? Absolutely. For long? Questionable. There would be maintenance involved, clearly. Then again, that was true even of the most professional, big-money-backed tinkertech. It was why the Muggle world hadn't yet upgraded en masse to hovercars, jetpacks, and rayguns, despite Hero's best efforts across the pond. Only I would be able to keep this blasphemy running for any significant length of time in the field.

Maybe that was for the best.

“You tore up our microwave,” Dudley said, somewhere behind me. His tone was halfway between disbelief and grief.

I blinked as it slowly registered to me that I /had/.

The garage workbench was covered with discarded and cannibalized electrical parts. The remains of the microwave housing itself were strewn across the floor, cut apart with the same shears I used to trim the bushes and tree out back. Scraps of gold leaf were halfway embedded into the work surface and the hammer's head. A few old handheld game shells, the telephone, and a spare TV remote were scattered about in the mess, their guts repurposed and incorporated into my cobbled-together computer.

“Er.”

“They're going to be livid.” He didn't sound as excited about that as usual. It was probably because he relied on microwavable dinners at odd times to keep his bloated stomach despite the diet he'd been forced onto. I'd just destroyed his meal ticket.

Funnily enough, that made me feel a little better about the whole situation.

So did just looking at what I'd made, actually. It was ugly but it was mine. And better yet, I could already see ways to improve it -- miniaturize it, boost its processing power, increase its memory to accommodate a more complex AI, refine the electrode heads for greater penetration into the grey matter and greater conductivity, increase the number of leads to provide greater coverage and more fine control, make the cover detachable --

It all required better materials than I had. Better tools, too. More precise patterns, custom-forged metal fittings, maybe premade computer parts to tweak...but I could do it.

Assuming Vernon didn't kill me first.

“Yeah,” I agreed with Dudley, “they probably will.”

“What'd you make?”

“Er -- nothing, really -- “ I snatched the collar up and hid it behind my back. Maybe he'd forget it was there if he didn't see it. “ -- just, you know...messing about.”

The way Dudley squinted his piggish little eyes...it almost made me think he was calculating something. Basic arithmetic, maybe. Perhaps he was trying to count past five. He'd only just managed the days of the week last year, you know.

“You're one of those freaks, aren't you?”

“Did you just now figure that out, Diddykins?”

“Not a wizard,” he said, waving a meaty hand like he was fending off a horsefly. “One of those freaks in spandex. Para-whatsits. The capes. Like Hero.”

Unfortunately, even pre-schoolers knew about parahumans, so it was on the upper range of Dudley's thinking ability to make that connection. /Dammit/. And connecting me to Hero, too? /The/ Tinker? It might be flattering if I weren't sure that he only did it because Hero was the only Tinker's name he could pronounce. But he knew.

Dammit dammit /dammit/.

I didn't say anything. Dudley didn't open his mouth to fill the empty space. He just looked at me, far more thoughtful than I'd ever seen him. It was unnerving.

“You cook dinner most nights,” he said slowly, ponderously, like a lumbering behemoth changing course. I nodded. “You're just lucky mum doesn't pay that much attention when you do. Could probably do the microwaveable bits other ways.”

“I...probably could, yeah,” I agreed, eyeing him warily. Where was he going with this? Oh -- wait, I could see it. He was going to extract a bribe. I /could/ play it that way, yes, but only if the sole witness kept mum.

“I might not tell her about all this,” he went on. “Might even help you clean up.”

“Okay...”

“Could probably hide those holes with construction paper...”

I glanced down at the shredded microwave. The only part of it that remained reasonably intact was the front panel, door included. “Sure, Dudders.”

“Shut it. I'm trying to help you.”

“/Why?/ What do you want from me?”

“Nothing.”

“Uh-/huh/.” Even Dudley understood the sheer volume of doubt I crammed into that word, and he scowled at me.

“I could always just tell them.”

“Nope, no that's fine, we'll keep it quiet -- “

He did end up helping me hide the evidence. I put the collar in my desk drawer with the rest of the blueprints, replaced the remaining valuable materials in my hiding spot under the floorboards, and then we set to work trying to make the microwave look like it hadn't just been stripped of any and all electronic components. My cramming session on hobby electronics actually helped a bit with that -- I managed to rig up a battery and some basic wiring so the buttons still beeped when pressed. With some spare cardboard, white construction paper, and plastic wrap, we then patched the casing up enough to pass for intact when we put the microwave back in its niche.

Dudley didn't tell me what he really wanted from all this, and that kept me up later that night. What game was he playing? He was /Dudley/. He'd chased me, beat me, mocked me, bullied me constantly, literally from our first day of /preschool!/ Did he expect me to believe he had a change of heart now? Bullshit!

But I couldn't see what his angle was. Why delay? Did he think he'd get more if he waited? Did he expect me to fall for it and become reliant on his help to hide things so he could withhold it later and command a higher price? Ridiculous. This was Dudley we were talking about. /Cunning/ was not how I'd describe him. If he were going to be sorted into a house at Hogwarts, it wouldn't be Slytherin, it would be the outhouse.

It occurred to me that he may not have thought things through to the specifics of his bribe.

Yeah. That was probably it. He'd come to me tomorrow and name his price. Unless he forgot.

Problem dealt with, I eventually drifted off to sleep. The nightmares made me wish I hadn't.
