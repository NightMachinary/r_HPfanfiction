Added another. Excerpt from a different story.

“So, Harry Potter. Do we have an arrangement?” Harry stared up at the parasite, all that remained of a Dark Lord everyone was too frightened to speak of even now. He was struck with a deep sense of pity, but also respect. This man was so determined to rule he let himself be dependent on another being. He himself wasn't sure if he could genuinely swallow his pride enough to do that. On top of that, even as a parasite, this man radiated power enough to make his legs shake. He was standing before everything he wanted to be. And this being, this /god/, wanted his assistance. He would be the biggest fool in the world not to take this offer.

“Yes.” Harry nodded, lips curling into a smile that once he grew up would match Voldemort's for terror inducing cruelty. “But what will we do about Dumbledore?” Thoughts rushed through his head as he considered various plots and plans that would keep this arrangement from Dumbledore's knowledge.

Voldemort chuckled. “We will do nothing. Not yet. Your mind is open, and any hint of a block will be a red flag for the meddling fool. For now, you will go about your life as if we had never talked. Come summer, I will begin to teach you. Oh, and Potter? Keep thinking of me as a god.”

Quirrel turned, raising his wand. “Obliviate.”
