Actually it's a scene set 17 years after the Battle of Hogwarts. The story is kinda an adaptation of the Seven Samurai. Orla is the 16-year-old daughter of canon Ravenclaw Orla Quirke, filling the Katsuhiro role of a young warrior attempting to mimic a handful of grizzled veteran Ronin who are hired to fight off invaders.
