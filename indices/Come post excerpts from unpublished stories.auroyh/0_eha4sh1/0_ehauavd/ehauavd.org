That (unintentional?) rhyme was great.\\
I'd guess this takes place in the Hogwarts years, with those four together. Don't know who Orla is, nor why Luna would be fighting Aurors (DoM?). Dean appears to be an authority here; Orla turns to him even though they all answered. Nothing innovative is really implied in the snippet, like its a rote "Luna Does Wacky Stuff, Onlookers Bamboozled."
