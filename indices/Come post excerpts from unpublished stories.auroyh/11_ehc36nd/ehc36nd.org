setting the scene: this snippet starts soon after Harry and Ron find the page of the book in Hermione's hand. Hermione is conscious during her petrification, she can't see or feel but she can hear.

 

She heard the door open and close as Madam Pomfrey left for the staff room. An indeterminate time later she heard the door slowly squeak open before a deepish voice whispered “clear".

She heard three sets of footsteps, one light set and two heavy sets, come through the door. The footsteps quickly surrounded her. From the soft set of footsteps came a voice that would've made her blood boil, if the blood in her veins still flowed.

“Goyle lift her by the shoulders, Crabble you get the legs” whispered Draco Malfoy, “You know where we're taking her right?.. Good.”

She heard the grunts of the slytherins and the groan of the boxspring as she was lifted from the bed. The footsteps started up again.

 

After several minutes of footsteps one of the burly slytherins (she didn't know which one) spoke up: “So why are we taking her?”

Hermione wanted to know that herself.

The grating voice of Malfoy replied with one word “leverage.” The large slytherin apparently didn't take the hint when he asked “leverage?”

Draco sighed, “Leverage against Potter. The bookworm is one of his best friends, he'd do anything for her. We'll hide her away so we can demand ransom for whatever we want.”

The start of another question was interrupted by a third voice “Mr. Malfoy would you care to explain what you're doing with Ms. Granger?”

Several things happened rapidly in sequence. First she heard several gasps of surprise from the slytherins, she then felt several loud thumps resonate through her, before she heard a sound like a statue dropping 30 feet. (that was an interesting lesson on the Reparo spell, not that she needed it, she had mastered the spell well enough to repair sensitive optics like her favorite telescope or Harry's glasses before hogwarts. Wow her telescope was clearer after the spell, It must've removed fifty years of scratches from the lens. The telescope was an heirloom from her... from her... Why couldn't she remember whos it was? or what color it was? Wait a minute, wasn't she being kidnapped? why was she thinking of a telescope? She thought on it for a second before she realized why she was mentally rambling, 'Oh i'm in agonizing pain, that's right.')

 

Pain. Why was she in pain? What is pain? is it just a chemical reaction? Is consciousness just a chemical reaction?

Wait, her mind was working despite the fact all her bodily functions were stopped. That plus the fact ghosts exist points to something like a soul existing.

Could you transfer a soul into something else and still have it function? could you split a soul? You can split a brai... STOP, /stop./

She knew if she let herself get lost in philosophical questions right now she'd never stop. She was Hermione Granger, She was in pain, And she needed to know why.

So why was she in pain again? She thought back to what was happening. 'So I was being kidnapped, I heard a voice followed by shocked gasps. what does that tell me? Someone saw them carrying me and they weren't prepared for that. Then what happened? I felt several thumps followed by a stone on stone crash. Speaking of felt, why can't I feel my limbs?'

The realization shot through her like electricity 'The slytherins were startled, dropped me down a flight of stairs, and when I got to the bottom I */shattered./*'
