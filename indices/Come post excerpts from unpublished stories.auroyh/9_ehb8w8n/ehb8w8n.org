The circle of hooded figures levitating the family that owned the campground reminded Charlie of lessons learned in books at Hogwarts, the ones Dumbledore insisted on and the purebloods in his year scowled through --- especially the Slytherins.

“Death Eaters,” Bill said as they made their way through the crowd and joined the Ministry wizards surrounding the hooded figures.

As they cast spells to save the Muggles and drive off the Death Eaters, Charlie recalled all the stories Ron, Ginny and the twins had told him in letters over the past three years and realized that what sounded like crazy adventures at a distance from Romania were both more sinister and more immediate.

Then the Dark Mark shone in the sky, and Charlie‘s brain froze, even as he kept casting spells. He'd done the same the first time he'd faced an angry Hungarian Horntail, and swore afterward that no matter what else happened at the dragon reserve, nothing else could be that scary.

He was wrong. Seeing the green glow of that symbol last seen the night Harry's parents were killed and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named disappeared? That was far, far worse.

All of Mum's family, and most of Dad's, had perished in the last war. Charlie was determined that his family would survive whatever was coming this time around. Even the darkest of dark wizards.

But when they got back to the tent, only the twins and Ginny were there.

“Where's Dad?” Charlie asked. “Where are Ron, Harry and Hermione?”

“We got separated in the woods,” Fred said.

“The the Mark appeared and we wanted to make sure Ginny was safe,” George added.

Charlie looked at Bill. “Should we...?”

Bill shook his head. “In that madness, we'd just be dividing our forces even further,” he said. “Dad will find them.”

“Besides, Harry's faced far worse than Death Eaters,” George said. “Ron, too.”

“And Hermione,” Ginny added. “They saved me, they can certainly save themselves.”

Charlie wanted to believe his siblings, but ... Death Eaters and the Dark Mark? He settled for looking outside the tent every few minutes. The sixth time, he breathed a sigh of relief at the sight of his father, Ron and Ron's friends hurrying toward the tent.

The revival of the Tri-Wizard Tournament was starting to seem like the least dangerous thing that would happen this year, and Charlie was suddenly glad that he had the rest of the week at home, and would be back in a few months to see for himself that everybody was all right.

They had to be all right. No matter what danger was coming, his family had to survive this.
