An excerpt from an extremely rough draft

"So which apartment are you in?" he asked

"5A, it doesn't have such a nice balcony like yours though" she said turning and facing towards the balcony

"Yeah I was lucky to get this one" he grinned knowing that it had nothing to do with luck but rather some bribery

"Sure, lucky" she laughed

"You don't seem to believe me" he said and feigned hurt

"I seem to recall you had too much luck in school" she laughed "How much could you have left?" she asked amused

"Fair point, but I also had Hermione to help" he smiled thinking about his best friend now

"She and Ron ever decide to try again?" Padma asked

"No, she decided to study law in the muggle world after Hogwarts. She couldn't stand a lot of the wizarding world; like house-elves" he said and Padma nodded knowing how poorly SPEW had gone

"When last did you see her?" she asked

"It's been almost three years now, we write occasionally. I'm supposed to meet her in a few days when she gets home for her summer holidays. She is a junior lecturer now at the same place she studied" he smiled remembering their last letters

"Okay then, say hi for me when you do see her. I should probably go now, I'll see you around Harry" she smiled
