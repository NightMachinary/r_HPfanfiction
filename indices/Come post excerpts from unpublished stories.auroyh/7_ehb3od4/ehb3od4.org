/This is the premise for a sequel to my story I've been working on./

--------------

"Rise and shine," Harry said, raising the blinds with a flourish. Daylight poured through the windows, filling the drawing room with dazzling brightness, but Tony continued to slumber on the couch. Harry shook his shoulder, but he merely grunted sleepily and turned his back to him. Losing his patience, Harry took aim with his hand.

"Aguamenti!"

Tony yelped and rolled off the couch, sputtering. His reddened eyes landed on Harry, and for a moment, he looked like a betrayed puppy. Snickering, Harry cast a Drying Charm, more out of concern for his carpeting than Tony's benefit.

"What's the big idea?" Tony demanded, squinching at the sunlight.

Harry swept his arms out. "We're going to Slovakia!"

Tony shook his head. "The only place I'm going to is the bathroom."

"Don't be long. We got about"---he glanced at the clock on the wall---"two hours to prepare. I'll be down on the ground floor."

Tony mumbled something and shuffled his feet out of the room like a zombie. When he walked into the dining room a quarter of an hour later, his hair was damp and his gait was decidedly more human-like. Harry greeted him with a smile that wouldn't leave his lips since that morning, and a plate of English breakfast.

"Dropped by the Leaky," he said at Tony's unasked question.

Grunting, Tony slumped on a chair and tucked in. Somewhere between demolishing the black pudding and wolfing down the fried eggs, he raised his head and frowned at Harry, who was observing him with a mix of amusement and disgust.

"Aren't you gonna eat?"

Harry shook his head. "You ever take an international Portkey?"

"No, why?"

Harry's perpetual grin widened. "You'll find out."

"Lost me there, mate," Tony said, swallowing another mouthful.

Harry sighed impatiently. "Stop being obtuse, it was your idea."

Tony scratched at his nose. "Look, if this is about what I said yesterday..."

"You bet your ass it's about what you said. I stayed awake half the night thinking about it, and you know what I realized?" Harry pointed at him. "That you're absolutely right!"

Tony's eyebrows rose. "I am?"

He nodded emphatically. "There's a whole wide world full of wonders waiting out there, yet here I am more worried about household chores. Well, that's about to change. You and I, we're going on an adventure!"

Tony gave him a long look, then shook his head slowly. "Mate, I'm sorry, but I never thought you'd take my ramblings seriously. You do realize how insane this sounds, right? Besides, I got work tomorrow."

Harry's lips curled in disgust. "Wage-slave."

"NEET," Tony retorted.

"Hey, if I'm a NEET, so is every pureblood who's living off their holdings."

Tony cleaned his plate with a slice of toast. "They're a dying breed. Even Malfoy's taken up a job at the Ministry. Acts like a proper goody two-shoes now, attending seminars and remembering birthdays and all that--can you imagine?"

"Ha! Good on him, I guess." Harry shook his head. "Anyway, while you were drooling on priceless basilisk leather, I dropped by Padma's and got all the gear we might need. You only have to take some extra clothes."

"You're not listening," Tony said, jabbing a fork in his direction. "I'm not going. You're not, either, if you have any sense left."

"Tony, you've lost sight of what's truly important. Accio Daily Prophet!" He opened the paper and slapped it on the table, the blurry photograph in full view. "These harpies are only sighted every few decades, and no one knows where they disappear to. This is your only chance. Either we go now, or you continue working your soulless job---and thirty years down the road, when you're filing yet another TPS report, you're going to remember on this day and go, 'man, if only I had listened to my best mate back then'!"

"TSP, actually, for Typical Spell Proficiency." Tony squirmed at the incredulous look Harry gave him. "They're crucial to regulating correspondence courses like Kwikspell."

Harry snorted. "Just listen to yourself. I know this isn't the kind if life you wanted. I know your heart yearns for more. I know, because you told me yesterday---and those were your true feelings, unclouded by everyday mundanity!"

Tony swallowed, his gaze straying to the moving photograph. "You're not just taking the piss, are you?"

"I would never toy with a bloke's dreams like that," Harry said solemnly. "Are you with me?"

Tony groaned and rubbed his face with his palms. "My parents were so proud when I got accepted into the Ministry, too..." Lowering his hands, he gave Harry a determined look. "Give me half an hour to pack."
