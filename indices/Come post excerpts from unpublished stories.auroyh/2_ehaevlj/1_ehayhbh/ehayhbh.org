I'm curious about how the obsidian got there. Transfiguration? Fire and... sand? A volcano? Also, Shatterbird flashbacks. The doppelganger seems to imply some form of dimensional travel. Instead of [with the weight of], [like] flows better. Britpick: [color] to [colour]. [disapperate] to [[[https://potterwords.livejournal.com/3977.html][Disapparate]]]. I don't... /think/ mud, even magic mud, can do that to Fiendfyre. Pretty good fight scene, though.\\
Very curious about where this doppelganger came from.
