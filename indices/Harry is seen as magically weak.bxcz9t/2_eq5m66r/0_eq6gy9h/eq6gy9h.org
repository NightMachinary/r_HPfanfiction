Thanks for the link. Was a surprisingly decent read (not a fan of the Harry/Snape pairing /at all/). To anyone who's interested in the fic but squeamish about the pairing too, the romance is pretty much non-existent in the first half and you can almost trick yourself into thinking it's a mentor-mentee relationship. Light hints of it work itself in throughout the second half, then the heaviest parts (which are quite skimmable cos most of the plot is done by then) are only in the last 500-1000 words or so.
