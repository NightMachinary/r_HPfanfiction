The Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady has this, especially in the later books! I find their portrayal of prejudice to be very accurate, and the cultural divide between the dark families, the wider wizarding world, and muggleborns is well written. The casual way the wizards disregard muggle inventions and discoveries is really good, too.

A bit of a spoiler here, but the way the war between Voldemort and the Order of the Phoenix and a lot of people's apathy to it was shockingly realistic. A lot of “not really my problem” and especially one newspaper clipping that was like “my muggleborn maid never had any problems with the extremists because she kept her head down! It's only the Bad Ones that get targeted!” It really amazed me.

There's a comment in the fic that I really like, about how the Purebloods are the powerful few in a minority---their culture is being wiped out, but at the same time, a lot of their practices are harmful. Really well done. No bashing, too.
