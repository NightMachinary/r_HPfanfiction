I agree with you mostly but I do not believe that something most be based on true to launch a radical movement. Sometimes the key is to present lies as truth and in case of purebloods if this lies helps them convince themself of their own superiority and keep their position of power their are going to be taken as truth. The fanfiction where I have seen prejudice handle the best is in Victoria Potter where the protagonist herself hears things like muggleborns are muggles who steal magic and how wizards talk about muggles as inferior beings and she is passive about it and even is I influenced by the things her friends say herself as most eleven year old would be. The story so far is only up to year two but so far I understand how Voldemort had a followers in this society. Not because their ideology has true in it but because it preys on their fear of muggles being dangerous and at the same time inferior and the fear that muggles may somehow steal magic. What I like about how is presented here is that is in the details that you see this things the autor doesn't tell you things she shows you. Really recommend! Sorry for any errors I'm learning English

Leave here a piece of the story as an example for op to decide if he wants to read it

â€œIt didn't take long for them to leave the station behind, and the girls returned to their seats. Pansy held out her hand in front of her and examined her perfectly polished nails. "So, Victoria, tell us about yourself. I'd heard you'd been sent to live with Muggles... but that can't be right, can it?"

Victoria blushed. "It's true," she said, causing all three girls to gasp.

"Oh, you poor thing," Daphne said, looking like Victoria had just announced she was dying.

Susan was similarly aghast. "Was it awful?"

Victoria opened her mouth to reply, but Pansy beat her to it.

"Obviously it was awful," she said, putting a hand on Victoria's knee, "but at least it's over now. Really, you're lucky they didn't manage to steal your magic."

"That's just a children's story," said Susan, but Pansy shook her head.

"It's not," she said firmly, "Daddy told me it was true. A few of them come to Hogwarts every year, didn't you know?"

Susan rolled her eyes. "That's silly. Muggleborns don't steal magic."

Victoria looked between Susan and Pansy, not sure who to believe. Certainly she couldn't imagine the Dursleys ever being able to steal magic.

"Well, I don't know about any of that," she began, cutting off Pansy's reply, "but they didn't steal mine."

"But you must have so much to learn," Daphne said, "I bet those Muggles didn't teach you anything."

Daphne's statement confirmed Victoria's worst fear. "I suppose everyone else knows so much magic already," she said glumly, "I haven't even cast a proper spell yet."

Susan snorted. "Neither has any---"

"So much to learn," Pansy interrupted, "luckily, you have us to teach you!"

Victoria smiled. "Will you tell me about it? Growing up in the magical world?"

"Of course we will!" Daphne said, clapping excitedly, "but where should we start?"

The three girls shared a look, before speaking as one:

"Robes."
