When? Is that a serious question? Did you miss the two and a half book long subplot of Hermione vowing to change society and lead a revolution over house elf rights? Did you miss the part where she was, objectively, WRONG, and actually terrorizing the elves and causing damage to them with her dogged persistence and moral crusade? Are you ignorant of the obvious implications of what someone like Hermione would do if she had real power or authority in the wizarding world?

Also, yes, it is in fact a real fear to have your society and culture destroyed by outsiders. Are you just asking stupid questions?

The author you're quoting clearly doesn't understand the point of discrimination, and neither apparently do you. That is half the problem with this topic, the people who are not subtle about it do not /know/ that they are not subtle. The people who do not understand it are not aware that they do not understand. You think you do, but you don't, and the "but is X /really/ a thing" questions prove that.

And yes, theft of magic is nonsense and it's obvious Rowling just pulled it out of her ass. Like the Hallows themselves, it never came up in six and a half books worth of time, it was a last minute addition to the story so she could do exactly what she claimed she wasn't doing: divide the world up into Good Guys and Death Eaters. The culmination of the plot was Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Gryffindor holding the entire Slytherin house at wandpoint, because it was an evil house full of Junior Death Eaters and everyone knew it. Draco Malfoy is not subtle, and Draco Malfoy babbling nonsense about Hermione having stolen magic from somebody is not subtle or clever either.

Maybe if there was any indication whatsoever that it was actually possible to steal magic, it would be a different story. Maybe if this absurd talking point had been brought up even once at any point in the previous six books, it would be a different story. But it was not. And you don't really seem to understand that. You keep trying to reference real life issues as a parallel, but you don't really understand those issues, either, so it fails completely. I've got bad news you're not going to want to hear: most of the people you disagree with or think are stupid, nonsensical, or discriminatory in real life have pretty good reasons for being the way they are, and you just don't want to accept that.

A realistic political talking point would be something like "immigration is bad because it destabilizes the job market, driving wages down and preventing the formation of unions." An unrealistic talking point would be "immigration is bad because all immigrants are secret lizard people trying to steal the psionic pearls I keep inside of my skull that help me think." Draco Malfoy, and every other character Rowling had regurgitate the magic theft talking point, went with the second option, because not only is there zero evidence it is true, but as far as we are aware it is literally impossible to steal magic from somebody. They are proclaiming an irrational impossibility as justification for their decisions. And you are trying to defend it by saying "I think people I disagree with in real life are nonsensical, so nonsense qualifies as clever and subtle."

No. It does not. Just because you personally do not understand something does not mean it is nonsense. Magic theft wasn't subtle in canon, and it's not subtle in your magic girl superpowered fem!Harry Slytherin LARP story, either. To reiterate: Draco Malfoy is not subtle, and you don't make him subtle by just having people ignore him or shrug at his delusions and move on. You make him subtle by */giving him better talking points and modifying his behavior/*, and the entire thrust of this broader discussion is that at least two-thirds of the fandom are not intellectually or ideologically equipped to do either. A writer can only write what they know and understand, and if you don't understand how discrimination works in real life, you can't write it in fiction either.

That's the reason I went on a tangent to point out that Rowling never had Voldemort be clever and charismatic and political where we could see it, not even in flashbacks or memories. She was obviously incapable of writing it, so she didn't even try. At least she was self-aware enough to realize that, which is better than can be said for most fan fiction.
