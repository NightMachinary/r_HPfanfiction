Firstly when in the series muggleborns where looking to overrun and control wizard society? Is this a real fear? Are muggleborns actually trying to control wizard society? What perfect and valid reasons has the average wizard to said they are superior to Hermione? So you say that discrimination in the real world always runs in the basis of true? Can you share with me the true behind this radicalized racist moments ? Because we are not talking here of any kind of radical movement. We are talking here of a movement whose goal is genocide or at least segregation of people because of their blood. So I would like to hear the truth behind those kinds of movements in real life. Is not that I think that this movements have no logic behind them but I think that they prey on fear and not on truth at least to get followers. I think that you can write a nuance story where Voldemort preys in the fear that the purebloods have that as you said they are going to be overrun and controlled by muggleborns. Is this actually what is happening ?maybe is not but it doesn't have to be true for people to believe it.

I mean you said that theft of magic is a nonsensical talking point as if people in real life don't believe nonsensical things either because they are taught at home those things or because it confirms their believes. What I like about VP is that prejudiced is portrayed as I remember hearing people being prejudiced as kids an how this ideas may follow to adulthood. How kids just repeat what their parents say at home. With kids I don't think that you can't make discrimination more nuanced than this because little Draco doesn't know exactly why he has to hate muggleborns apart from my dads says and they steal magic.
