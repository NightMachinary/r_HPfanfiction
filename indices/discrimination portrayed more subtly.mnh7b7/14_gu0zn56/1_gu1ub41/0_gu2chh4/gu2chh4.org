That has all the subtlety of a baseball bat. "Indifference" does not equate to nuance or subtlety. Somebody's OC being indifferent to house elf rape and racial slurs doesn't make your story subtle or clever, and it's not realistic either. It's just another example of what I already mentioned: people who grossly misunderstand something like discrimination cannot write it, and the results are infantile.

The average wizard has dozens of perfectly valid and legitimate reasons to not want their society to be overrun with and controlled by people like Hermione Granger. Rowling did not care to think about or elaborate upon that, even though she very clearly teed herself up to do so by making Hermione's crusade for House Elf rights look absurd and damaging to the elves themselves, so she invented absurd and nonsensical talking points for the Death Eaters, like theft of magic. Copying the mistakes and blunders Rowling made in her obvious indifference to her own stated goal of "the world isn't Good Guys and Death Eaters" and then selling it with indifference of your own is not good writing, nor is it subtle. That is just repeating exactly what happened in canon but expecting the reader to buy it /this/ time because */magically talented Slytherin FEM!HARRY/* */hng warg abibble derf./*
