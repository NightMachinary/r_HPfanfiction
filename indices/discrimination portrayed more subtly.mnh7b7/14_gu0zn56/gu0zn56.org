There are a few, but not many. Mostly because the fandom as a whole is incapable of understanding why discrimination happens in the real world, which means their ability to portray it in a fictional context is flawed at best and infantile at worst. Additionally, attempting to write a fic that does portray it realistically would cause controversy and invite flames and personal attacks, so most people with the ability and talent wouldn't bother in the first place.

Most writers involved in the fandom don't want to admit that someone like Voldemort can have a point, which is why they would get so many followers in the first place. Ironically enough, most people who demand more nuance and subtly seem to be under the impression that you really do just cast an Imperius curse on people and get them to throw away their lives for random things that don't make any sense. The reality is that all radicalism is based on a truth, which is what draws people in to it. If you do not understand that truth, you cannot understand the radical, nor are you equipped to refute or counter them, if indeed you even can. No one is going to be convinced to give away all their worldly possessions and suicide attack the Ministry of Magic while wearing a Halloween mask because some weirdo with no nose told them to do it: everyone seems to understand that on the abstract, but they don't want to actually admit it or put it into practice in their own writing. They get lazy, they take the easy way out. They fall into the trap of 'telling' us what we should be seeing and drawing from the story, instead of 'showing' us events and trusting us to draw those conclusions ourselves. If you're telling instead of showing, it's bad writing.

People don't want to try and understand why the Death Eaters would be doing the things that they do, which means subtly and nuance rarely exists. Even Rowling's own portrayal of Voldemort and the Death Eaters was without nuance: we were "told" that Voldemort was a political revolutionary whose attempted coup failed, but what we were shown was a creepy snake man who was obsessed with killing a teenage boy and the headmaster of his private boarding school. We were TOLD that the world isn't divided up into good people and Death Eaters, we were /explicitly/ told that, and yet every antagonistic 12 year old from book 1 gleefully took a Dark Mark somewhere between book 6 and 7 and were throwing around Unforgivables like they were going out of style. They were */literally/* junior Death Eaters. The only evil person we ever saw who */wasn't/* a Death Eater was Delores Umbrige. Rowling used Sirius as a mouth piece to hold Umbrige up and try to teach us a lesson about how the world isn't just good people and Death Eaters, there's nuance, look see, look at this new Defense professor! And then two books later, every student in Hogwarts collectively stands up and points wands at the Slytherin table, because they're all junior Death Eaters and */everyone knows it./*

Rowling wanted us to believe this was a story about choices and consequences and bravery and love, but that's just what she told us. What she showed us is that the world would have been an objectively better place if Harry had been an unhinged serial killer and spent the first three books killing everyone who was rude to him or his friends. Throwing Draco and all of his 12 year old playmates off the train to their deaths on the Hogwarts Express and making it look like an accident would have solved most of the problems in the later books, but you're not supposed to think about that.

Rowling set the tone for the series herself: the subtlety and nuance is a complete farce and something we are merely told exists without it ever being shown. So that's the way it is for most fan fiction, too. That's also the reason the epilogue fell as flat as it did for most people. Marked Death Eaters walk free for no reason, people who murdered and tortured and used the Unforgivables, given a free pass for no reason. This is Rowling herself admitting that the Death Eaters must have just all been Imperiused or done it for a lark, because obviously once Voldemort is dead the underlying social issues that created him and lead a significant portion of society to openly support his coup must just vanish into thin air. It really all was just one great big Imperius curse all along. All it took was for their leader to die and that entire political zeitgeist immediately folded like a house of cards. Good thing it doesn't work that way in reverse, or the series would have ended when Snape killed Dumbledore.

tl;dr, subtly can't exist unless you're willing to give both sides valid reasons to be doing the things that they do. Rowling couldn't be bothered, which is why we never saw Voldemort be a charismatic political revolutionary and only ever saw a creepy snake man with an unhealthy obsession over a teenage boy. All of the deep and complex conversations that pulled people into his views and convinced them that his methods were the best and most valid choice happened off-screen, where she did not have to write them or elaborate upon them in any manner whatsoever. Likewise, most of the fandom can't be bothered either.

You can't claim that the world is more nuanced than Good Guys vs Death Eaters and then have all the Slytherins be junior Death Eaters that get held at wand point by the rest of the school at the climax of the story. Pick a lane and stay in it.
