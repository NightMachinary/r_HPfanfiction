Discrimination is overt, but widely socially accepted and therefore doesn't tend to involve nasty names or terrorism, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense). As the series progresses, it becomes clear that there is a element of truth to the differences in blood status (first- and second-generation mages have wilder and more chaotic magic than pure-bloods), but not in a way that actually justifies banning non-pure-bloods from Hogwarts and from many types of employment.

It's also suggested that the prejudice might be influenced by babies being sensitive to their parents' magic, like they recognise their mother's scent, and thus developing an instinctive aversion to adults who don't have any magic. Not enough to cause blood prejudice all on its own, but enough to plant a seed.
