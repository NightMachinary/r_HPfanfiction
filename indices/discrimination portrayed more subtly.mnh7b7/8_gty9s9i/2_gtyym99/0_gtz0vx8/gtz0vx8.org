The advantage is pretty much that it's your culture, whereas a Muggle-born has to adapt to a new culture (sports, bedtime stories, slangs, popular places, "local" celebrities, etc). Their ability to perform magic can only be blamed on their education, which is the same for everyone, and natural talent. This is why Slughorn is prejudiced.
