  I mean, you could, but you'd be breaking the law. Wizards get wands before their first year in Hogwarts, because they'll be allowed to use magic once they get there, not before. So, why would you let your kid use yours? How would you teach your kid anything if they can't practise? You can tell them about spells, what they do and their incantations, but everyone will learn this in school.

This law is very, very contrived, probably put there by JKR so that Harry couldn't use magic at home to solve his problems.

We don't know how it even works, or it's limitations, by all we know we could probably shield against with other enchantments in a Wizard's House. The law seems to be ther mostly to prevent children from breaking the Statute of Secrecy

Not like the Ministry would be able to track anyone's specific use of magic, seems to be area based since they can't differentiate between Dobby and Harry using magic. So it should be logical that it simply won't work in a Wizarding home because it can't tell who is actually doing magic.

I would certainly teach my kid some basic stuff, why wait until they are at school and struggle with basic things they could've learned much earlier.

Most of that stuff is due to how JKR needed the plot to work, no practical reason.
