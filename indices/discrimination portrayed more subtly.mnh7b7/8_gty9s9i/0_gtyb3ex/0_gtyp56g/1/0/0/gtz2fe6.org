  At least I imagine if I was a Wizard I would teach my kids the basics before they went to school.

I mean, you could, but you'd be breaking the law. Wizards get wands before their first year in Hogwarts, because they'll be allowed to use magic once they get there, not before. So, why would you let your kid use yours? How would you teach your kid anything if they can't practise? You can tell them about spells, what they do and their incantations, but everyone will learn this in school.

The ultimate difference is whether you are willing to break the law to teach your child. Granted, a Muggle-born would never be able to perform magic at home because they don't live with other wizards, but do you think Slughorn believes wizards who come from magical families are more skilled because they can break the law and use magic before school? I'd say it's because he believes they are "naturals".

Even the way he refers to Lily sounds wrong. When Harry says Hermione is a Muggle-born and the best witch in their year (or something along those lines), Slughorn pretty much says "I'm not prejudiced, Lily was my favourite student, I even have a picture of her here!" Yes, she can be his favourite student, but the very fact that a talented witch like her was a Muggle-born impressed him even more.
