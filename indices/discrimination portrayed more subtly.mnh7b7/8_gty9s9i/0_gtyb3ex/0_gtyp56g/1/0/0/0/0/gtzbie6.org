That's my point. Everyone knows the tracker isn't precise. Umbridge even used this flaw to try and get Harry arrested. So yes, if you're willing to break the law, you probably will get away with it. However, I don't think this law is the Muggle equivalent of downloading music online illegally, which everyone does in many countries. You especifically would let your kids do this, but not everyone would.

I can't think of a moment when either Arthur or Molly saw their kids use magic and were okay with it. Also, this isn't only about breaking the law yourself, it's indulging your child to do so. From a parental standpoint, it might not be the best idea depending on who you ask.

Besides, parents might take in consideration the practicality of doing this. There is a possibility that the wand might not "behave" at the hands of someone else, which would make it harder for them to perform magic with it at best, and get someone hurt at worst. Speaking of getting hurt, at least in Hogwarts they have the Hospital Wing. At home, you'd need to take your child to St. Mungo's and wait who knows how long to get treatment.

Moreover, Hogwarts is one of the safest places in the world, or at least it's supposed to be. What do you do when your kid take your wand outside and try to use it in public? Not only exposing wizards, but also risking to get a stranger hurt or even themselves. We all know kids can be troublemakers and parents can be too lenient, which make their children think they can get away with anything.

You might argue that misbehaving kids could steal their parents' wands anyway, but you have to admit it's more likely to happen if it isn't drilled in their heads that using magic outside school is forbidden.

Edit: you take your kid to St. Mungo's in case they hurt themselves. If your child hurts you by mistake, you better hope they don't do too much damage. At Hogwarts, there is a professor in every class with their own wand, who is able to control the situation if it gets too dangerous. Is it 100% safe? No. But if you're home with your kid, you better have another adult with a wand to control the situation.
