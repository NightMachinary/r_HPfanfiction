I don't think they learn Latin in Hogwarts. In Potions, according to JK, you'd need to perform some spell or some type of magic to make it work. This is why Muggles can't make potions. Runes and Arithmancy could be taught at home, I guess, but will the child even like or want to take these electives? And having some advantage in a few theorical classes isn't really such a big deal that would make a wizard be impressed with a Muggle-born's talent in general, let alone in Potions.

I think all parents focus on teaching their kids how to read and count, and maybe a thing or two about the human body. They can teach them about herbs, plants and spells, but the theory will be taught at school anyway. What makes a difference is practise.
