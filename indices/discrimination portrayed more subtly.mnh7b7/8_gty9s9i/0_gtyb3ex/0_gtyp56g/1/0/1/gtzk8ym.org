Malfoy's very first broom lesson, he was informed that despite his experience riding, he'd been doing it /wrong/ the entire time.

Granted, I have very low opinions/expectations from a Malfoy, but he's one of the ones that would have had extensive training/practice/opportunity before coming to Hogwarts.

If he can't hold onto a broomstick even with years of practice, what makes you think anyone can grab a wand correctly the first time?
