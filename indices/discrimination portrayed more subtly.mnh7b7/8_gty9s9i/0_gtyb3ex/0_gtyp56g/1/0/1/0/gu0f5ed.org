Not all children are equally skilled, nor do they learn at the same rate. And maybe Draco just got a bad habit, or maybe his parents don't let him ride a broom as much he says they do.

Draco is also poor example, due to his arrogance and especially because it has to fit the plot of all children learning stuff at the same time.

Which makes little sense.

Or we actually don't know about it, since the only, more direct examples we have are Ron(who's not very studious at all) and Draco(who was tasked with riding a broom, not practicing magic)

Ron got the grip correctly and still couldn't cast a spell.

It makes much more sense in fics when those that come with a Magical Home have already practiced magic(didn't Hermione said she tried a few spells in first year?) and are probably tutored during summer.

Specially those that have interest in things not taught at Hogwarts or in more combat magic.
