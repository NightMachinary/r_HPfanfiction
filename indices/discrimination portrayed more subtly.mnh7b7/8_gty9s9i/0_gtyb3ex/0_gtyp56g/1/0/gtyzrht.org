I would believe they have less knowledge if for some reason it didn't seem like the parents refused to teach ANYTHING to their kids before school.

I mean, sure not everyone would be proficient, but you would think they would already know how to hold a wand and pronounce the spells properly.

At least I imagine if I was a Wizard I would teach my kids the basics before they went to school.

Aptitute seems more tied to talent than blood.
