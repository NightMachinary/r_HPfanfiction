On a related note, I really want to see a wizarding nature vs. nurture debate.

Like, I'm in developmental psych and I'm trying to write something in the HP universe at the moment and it occurred to me how different early learning would be for a wizard child, just learning about how the world works in general, like the laws of physics and the laws of argumentation. And since HP magic is ostensibly a rule-based system and Hogwarts starts at eleven, I feel like children raised in the wizarding world would have a kind of... instinctual grasp of the underlying logic of magic that Muggle-borns wouldn't have, and that would be really hard to catch up with for a Muggle-born child, especially in a prejudiced society where someone in a "white-collar" profession like a teacher is likely to have been raised in the wizarding world and use teaching methods that have underlying assumptions that just don't mesh well with Muggle logic.

I feel like JKR does such a great job of portraying that with the Weasleys, like Ron being weirded out when a car isn't bigger on the inside than it is on the outside (and I also feel like the movies left out a lot of the more M.C. Escher aspects of HP magic which is a huge part of what makes it so wondrous, but that's another argument). To them the way that the Muggle world works is just... illogical, and their own version of "science" and epistemology in general has branched out from the Muggle one such a long time ago that they're nigh mutually incomprehensible.

In the real world we see this when we try to, say, use intelligence tests on people from cultures wildly different from ours, because their familiarity with certain concepts (test taking itself, in some cases, or knowledge being individual and not collective, as well as common objects and things like deductive logic) is way off from ours and they prioritize knowledge that is so different from ours that we really can't measure it effectively (like some Aboriginal populations having a level of spatial intelligence that is literally unimaginable to the Western mind but having no formal logic system because in their culture it's just not that important).

So, since wizards basically never came up with the nature vs. nurture debate or studied brain development as such, I can see why they would see Muggle-borns as, well, dumber, and it would likely show in the Muggle-born children's grades (another phenomenon that we see a lot in the real world!). And a Muggle-born child would have to have massive, and I mean massive, amounts of cognitive flexibility in order to adapt to all this and overcome the disadvantage of not having been raised in the wizarding world when it comes to more logical or theoretical aspects of magic rather than simple everyday spells. Again, you see this in canon a lot with Ron vs. Harry and Hermione - he just gets some things very naturally that are nigh incomprehensible to Harry and Hermione, despite how smart Hermione is and how little effort Ron puts in typically.

So I can imagine how this could be a hindrance for some "white collar" positions where you'd have to extrapolate new ideas from this knowledge, like some kind of magical research job or some kind of magical engineering, if wizards aren't willing to be open to the ways Muggles reason about the world and if the Muggle-born wizard isn't bright enough to switch between the two systems of thought with ease. But I can also imagine that those who can switch can do some really innovative things with magic just due to having been exposed to such a different upbringing, as we see with Hermione and, hell, Voldemort, actually.
