Yeah, I've actually seen a lot of stories where the MC (normally Slytherin Harry) thinks that Muggleborns should be swapped with a changeling at birth and given to Pureblood families who want one. I think linkffn(lady of the lake by colubrina) does this.

I can see where they're coming from, but surely making a magical primary school would work just as well.
