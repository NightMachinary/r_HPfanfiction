Part of my degree is developmental psych too, I agree! That would be so interesting to see.

I think there's some Purebloods who are discriminatory based purely on blood (hence the slur), and they would believe that being born by Muggles automatically makes you lesser and lower Muggleborn grades reflect that- the nature group. And then there's the Purebloods who think Muggleborns are lesser based on cultural differences, because they didn't grow up based in the wizarding world- nurture. And then non-predjudiced people might be like “okay, the cultures are different but both methods of thinking are equally valid” or something, like the view social anthropologists take on other cultures.
