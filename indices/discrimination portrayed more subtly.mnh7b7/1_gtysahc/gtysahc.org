The best stories I've read have been the ones where the ministry just didn't hire muggleborns, and halfbloods only could get the lowest of positions. There were no laws against hiring muggleborns, but the nice pureblood owned stores in Diagon Alley (which was all of them) just didn't hire them. And no Master would take an Apprentice who wasn't exeptionally bright (and muggleborns were at a dissadvantage when it came to family knowledge) or well conected.

Knockturn alley was one of the few places muggleborns could work and a lot of them left the british wizarding world for south america, or went back to the muggle world.

The problem is that the stories tend to have this one good idea in a story filled with bashing and tropes.

Edit1: It's kind of pointless that I save every story I read on pinboard when I barely tag them. Quick search gave some stories that fit:

Deals wit the Wizengamot post war, and the struggle for right both for muggleborns and "lesser" pureblood families like the Weasleys. It gives a very different take on Neville.

There's also a very wanky story that I think is called "Oliver Twist", pretty sure it's on ff.net. I think it fell squarely into the "interesting idea in a pretty average to terrible story" category, and I think I'm mixing up several stories.

Edit 2: Found the story, I did mix memories of several stories, and the story still managed to be even more wank than I remembered it to be.
