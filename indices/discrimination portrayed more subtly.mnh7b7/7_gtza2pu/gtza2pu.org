The only subtlety that I know of is the decree for reasonable restrictions of underage sorcery with how the enforcing trace works : if the magic is done in a wizarding household it assume that the magic was done by the parent. It make the muggleborns at the disadvantage to use magic outside of school where the purebloods and wizard-raised halfbloods can use it because they have magical parents to avoid detection by the Trace.
