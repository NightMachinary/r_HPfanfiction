I'd recommend Lomonaaeren's Made of Common Clay, linkao3(11699844)

While many of the purebloods in the secretive Sun Chamber are overtly discriminatory, there are many elements of the plot showing the subtle ways these views are held, even by Muggleborn characters. Harry is a bit OP and makes some foolish decisions, but it feels more in character for him to act quickly, rashly, and deal with the consequences later.

Spoilers: Harry uses the Deathly Hallows to burn the prejudices out of everyone, and even his friends are forced to reflect on the ways they held these views. Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy both hold condescending attitudes about Muggles and those manifest in different ways, but it's characters like Hermione picking up Wizarding attitudes of superiority to Muggles over time and the idea that magical creatures need the assistance of wizards that are more subtle.
