Thanks. As a migrant (luckily a white one) I need to deal a lot with the first trope that you talk about. I even got people yelling at me for training my dog in english instead of the native language. Or telling me that I need to speak it at home (a lot of in my laws think that). Because apparently I need to be "integrated" even in the intimacy of my home. A lot of people hating migrants that talk to their kids in their original language (which is proven to be positive for them) or so. I even stopped bringing my traditional food to my in laws parties because I feel like they judge me for not eating "real food".
