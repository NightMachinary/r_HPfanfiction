I don't exactly have a recommendation but I have examples of tropes that fit your request that someone might read and recognise and be able to rec a fic for you:

- “Muggleborns are discriminated against by Purebloods because they refuse to assimilate into wizarding culture” trope. Speaking as an English person, it's very reflective of the attitude that a lot of older people I know take towards immigrants. It's very “I'm not racist, /but/”. They point to their neighbour and say things like “see, he's one of the good ones! He doesn't bring his weird religion into our country”.

- The belief that Muggleborns are innately less powerful. This one is quite subtle because the Pureblood family wouldn't /hate/ Muggleborns. They'd wouldn't curse them in the street, but they would pass over promoting a Muggleborn because they believe they're innately worse at their job. This reflects scientific racism and sexism in the real world, like when people thought that black people and women had lower IQs, which was bullshit. I think linkffn(New Blood by artemisgirl) has this.
