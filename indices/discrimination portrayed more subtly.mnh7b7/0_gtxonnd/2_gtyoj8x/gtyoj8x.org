The first one can work both ways.

Some stories construct as more of cultural shock, others diss the Muggleborn for stuff like criticizing Wizarding Customs that the story has (Samhain, Yule, rituals, etc)

Some involve more religion.

It really depends on how it is constructed.

Some do Muggle Wank where instantly everything Muggle is just better and Wizards are dumb.
