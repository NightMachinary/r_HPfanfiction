  Speaking as an English person, it's very reflective of the attitude that a lot of older people I know take towards immigrants. It's very “I'm not racist, but”. They point to their neighbour and say things like “see, he's one of the good ones! He doesn't bring his weird religion into our country”.

I am an immigrant. I moved with my family from Bashkiria, Russia to America in 2004. This isn't racism, immigrants /should/ assimilate into their chosen culture. You don't get to move to another country and demand the community around you accommodate your culture. Now if you said "they must forgot their roots and denounce their culture" or something along those lines then sure. But assimilating into your new country should be expected, not treated as racist.
