Eh, it really depends, in some very rare cases you have immigrants who demand women in the neighborhood dress a certain way(through various channels, from conversation to using the equivalent of the HOA), or that people stop doing certain things.

But it's not common from what I know, it's just that in some cases people blow these out of proportion.

Some people use that as excuses to be racist though, like complaining the immigrants are speaking their native language /between/ themselves.
