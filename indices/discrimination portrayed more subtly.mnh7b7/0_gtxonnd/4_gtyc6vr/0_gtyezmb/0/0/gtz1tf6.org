That's actually an interesting example, because clothes are the only real canonical difference that suggest that wizarding and Muggle worlds might have different cultures (apart from magic and lack of tech, lol). But in canon we don't see any muggleborns complaining about it at all- you would expect it would be the first thing they changed, if they really were in charge and able to demand culture changes. That, to me, proves that there's no basis for the “muggleborns hate wizarding culture” trope in the HP universe. An author could invent it if they want though, but they should make it clear that they're changing canon, not explaining it.

My version would be this: A few muggleborns question the need for robes or they wear Muggle clothes on the weekends, and it gets publicised in the media. “Muggleborns hate wizarding clothes!” says the +Daily Mail+ Daily Prophet, and people start talking about how Muggleborns must be disrespectful of wizarding culture. And then maybe a Muggleborn kills a Pureblood and that gets publicised too- “Hate crime against Purebloods?” - never mind the much higher stats of Purebloods killing Muggles and muggleborns. People start to see Muggleborns as invaders, encroaching on their lives. Fudge introduces a bill to calm down the public- it's not going to get passed, of course, it's just for show. But suddenly you've got +UKIP+ the Wizarding Independence Party backing it, suddenly you've got the mums backing it because they “don't want Muggleborns taking up my child's place in our good schools”. Malfoy pays for an ad on the Knight Bus which says “we'd save 1 million Galleons by completely separating from the Muggle world” (no one knows where he got that stat from). And the bill passes, and suddenly all Muggleborns get put on a list. They have to prove that they didn't steal their magic, and Aurors raid the homes of suspected Muggleborns, obliviating them and dumping them in the muggle world if they find them. Fudge resigns because he never expected the bill to pass and Lucius Malfoy becomes Minister.
