You skipped a lot of steps there from Lucius campaigning for something that already happens to the Ministry going Fascist with Muggleborns.

Ministry is stupidly incompetent by that point doubt they would be able to do most of these things, remember that before Voldemort, Lucius took great care in looking like a decent citizen.

We also don't know if the Wizengamot is actually a Legislative body.

And you're forgetting about the rather considerable number of people who would be against this, like Dumbledore or Amelia Bones.
