  the problem of immigrants is different to Muggleborns

It is different, but many fanfic writers think it's not. I don't necessarily agree with it as a comparison, but it's a way to reflect real prejudice like OP wanted- I wrote the prompt/summary because I think it's a good example of how the media can change the viewpoint of a whole population, like Brexit-supporting newspapers and the Daily Prophet both did, and make them vote in a way that surprises you.

Maybe it could be part of a no-Voldemort AU then, where the Purebloods use the media and political influencing to oust Muggleborns instead. The point is that they're /not/ directly attacking Muggleborns, they're just passing discriminatory laws to make their lives harder and to make it harder for Muggleborns to enter the wizarding community. And if Aurors do attack some Muggleborns- well, it was their fault! They were /unregistered/. They were criminals. If they registered then they would be fine. So it would reflect real life quite a bit, like ICE in America.

I do think that the phrase “Mudblood” indicates ethnic racism as an explanation over racism due to cultural differences and I argued that vehemently on a thread in this sub yesterday lol. An example of ethnic racism would be my second bullet point in the original comment, xenophobia is the first bullet point.
