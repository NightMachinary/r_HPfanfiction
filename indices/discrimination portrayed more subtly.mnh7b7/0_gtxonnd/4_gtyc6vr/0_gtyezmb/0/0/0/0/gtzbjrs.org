I was basing it all off Brexit actually- which obviously did happen- I thought the references to UKIP, The Daily Mail, Boris's lying bus, and David Cameron resigning when the bill result came in made that clear but maybe that's something only British people know about, oops. I think the Knight Bus message would've been better as “Muggleborns are costing us 1 million Galleons”, but I didn't think of it at the time lol.

The end bit was a mix of the Muggleborn Registration Committee (again, which did happen), and the UK deporting people- I thought obliviating them and leaving them in the Muggle world was quite a good metaphor for that. Not perfect, but close enough.

I didn't mention the Wizangamot? Brexit was a referendum with the whole country voting, which was what imagined the bill to be like. But again, that can be left to the readers imagination because I didn't say how it got voted in.

Dumbledore and Bones didn't stop the Muggleborn registration committee. And, like Brexit, maybe no-one thought it was a threat because it was too extreme to get voted in. It really was a shock when it happened.
