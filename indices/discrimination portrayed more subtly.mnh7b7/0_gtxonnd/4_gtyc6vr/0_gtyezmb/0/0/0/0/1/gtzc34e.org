I know about Brexit, it's just that I don't think the comparison applies because Wizarding politics seem to be much simpler and no one is interested in directly attacking Muggleborns until Voldemort is in power. The Power Dynamics are very different.

Because most of the population would be against it.

Dumbledore and Amelia Bones would stop Lucius if he showed his hand like that, Lucius is not stupid enough to do those things without Voldemort.

The problem of Muggleborns is also a bit different from immigrants, they could be more likened to ethnic racism that xenophobia.
