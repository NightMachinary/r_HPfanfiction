Ngl I did mean that the Aurors raided the homes of “suspected /unregistered/ Muggleborns” and then I forgot to actually say that explicitly lol. As in, Muggleborns who didn't register on the list but were suspected to be Muggleborns, like undocumented immigrants. I clarified in a later comment that obliviating them and dumping them in the Muggle world was a metaphor for deportation. I'm pretty sure that Britain does police raids to arrest and deport people but even if they don't, America does with ICE so it's not that far fetched.
