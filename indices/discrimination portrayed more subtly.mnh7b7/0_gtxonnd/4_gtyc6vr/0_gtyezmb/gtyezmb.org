I don't really think that immigrants do demand everyone else work around their culture. Immigrants can practice their own religion and that's nothing to do with me- I've never had an immigrant try to convert me (unlike Christians lol).

And the main problem I've seen is that these attitudes generalise to the whole group. These old English people see an immigrant (who you can't identify on sight of course, so they just go for skin colour) and immediately assume all these things about them. And then this hatred of immigrants leads to ridiculous things like Brexit.
