As a migrant I need to disagree with you. It is pure xenophobia. Migrants need to learn the local language and respect the local culture. But they are free to dress, eat or celebrate their culture and speak their native language eith their families. The kind of person who says that wants migrants to pretend that they are natives and abandon their past, which is xenophobic and very toxic for the migrants.
