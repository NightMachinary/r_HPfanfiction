What reason would anyone have to advertise racism and discrimination as a good thing? Would you really want to use your platform to spread those concepts completely without any reflection?

Basically everything that's written in fiction can be applied to real life in one way or another. So it's really advisable to think about that before you write. And if you're deliberately writing something that can be without any problems, without being taken out of context or (deliberately) misunderstood, used by racist people to advertise their views then you're doing something wrong.
