Those things aren't applicable to real life and they also aren't portrayed as just a good thing. Well, okay, I can‘t speak for the IT thing because I haven't read it, but still.

You won't go ahead and steal a car because of gta because. Well. It's a lot of work. And also there is absolutely no question about the morality of it. It's against the law, everybody knows it's against the law, nobody who does it thinks it's an actually good thing.

Racism is a subtle thing. It's everywhere in everyday life and a lot of people have to suffer on a daily basis because of it. Racism is a nuanced things and people can be racist without even realising they are. And there very much are people who question the morality of it. People who are openly racist and justify their behaviour with some warped kind of reasoning. And if you then go ahead and write something where racism is a good thing, those people will use it as a justification for their behaviour. People who don't know they're racist will keep on displaying their racist behaviour because it's portrayed as normal and good in those stories. And if you don't want to be part of that and support those views, then don't write them into your story as something good.

I‘ll by the way take it as a compliment to my english skills that you think I‘m american.
