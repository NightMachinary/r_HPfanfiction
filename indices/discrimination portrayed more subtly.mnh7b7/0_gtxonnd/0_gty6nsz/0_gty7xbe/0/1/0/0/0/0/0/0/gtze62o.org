Are the Mortal Kombat/Kiler instinct writers advertising murder? Surely not, I'd say.

Or maybe Stephen King was saying that it was ok for kids to gangbang a girl when he wrote /IT/?

(I mean, he was coked out of his mind, but that's a different thing)

The GTA games have been accused of many different things. It's even in the name, /Grand Theft/. Surely you aren't claiming that they say it's ok to steal, yes?

Maybe if I play it, the cops will have to catch me for carjacking.

Then why racism gets people all worked up? I get it's a sensible matter, and I get that America is /special/ in regards to racist assholes, but people really need to separate both fiction from reality.

Maybe it's because I'm not American that I don't have trouble separating both?
