  And also there is absolutely no question about the morality of it. It's against the law, everybody knows it's against the law, nobody who does it thinks it's an actually good thing.

If you are not a racist, it's the same. If you are a racist, you won't care either way.

  And if you then go ahead and write something where racism is a good thing, those people will use it as a justification for their behaviour.

And that's where I'm saying it's the reader's problem, not the writer's. You don't police what people write just because it goes against the norm.

I didn't live through it, but I was born during a dictatorship. You don't tell pople what to write and what not to write just because it's not "PC". That's just not ok to me.

Someone who's never had racist views will have no problem with a "racist" piece of art.

Someone who's already a racist had previous problems, so the writer's not responsible for it.

And someone on the fence, it's the same. Something else made them doubt. If you go "See? Racism is good because this story I read!", then you have deeper issues.
