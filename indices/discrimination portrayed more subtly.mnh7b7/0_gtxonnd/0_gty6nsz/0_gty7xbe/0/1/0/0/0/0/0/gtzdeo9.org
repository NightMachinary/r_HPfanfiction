Yes writing something is absolutely advertising something. And the way how you write it decides what it is that you're advertising. If you write about a racist society and paint them as the good guys, you're advertising racism. If you're writing about a racist society but make it clear that the behaviours they're portraying are racist and therefore bad, then you're writing /about/ racism. It can be a way to raise awareness about how racism works in society, to help people recognise certain behaviours and avoid them/call them out.

It's practically impossible to write something without advertising certain opinions, concepts, whatever and it's the writers responsibility to make sure those things aren't a buch of racist propaganda.
