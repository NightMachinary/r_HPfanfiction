I‘m not forbidding people from writing something. I'm just saying what not to write if you don't want to have a certain outcome. That's like saying „don't jump off that building if you don't want to die“. „Don't write that unless you want to participate in advertising racism“.

And racism really isn't a either you are or aren't thing. It's, as I said, very nuanced. Not wanting to go out and kill people because of their nationality/ethnicity or something else doesn't mean you can't be racist. It's in a lot of smaller things too. „I‘m not racist, I have a black friend. Why can't other black people be more like him, then they wouldn't have any problems.“ ~ a person who is most likely not aware they're racist but still is and will be encouraged in their behaviour by reading stories where that kind of behaviour is advertised.

Also writing racist stuff unfortunately doesn't go against the norm. That's very much the problem here. It's way too normalised.

And nobody will say „see racism is good because of this story I read“. If the stories we‘re talking about would advertise the displayed behaviour as racism, we wouldn't have any problem. The thing is that they just show the racist behaviour and portray it as a good thing without ever making clear that it's racist. If it was „oh yeah, from the POV I show it here, it's shown as good, but it's actually racist“, it‘s fine. Racism is bad. No question there. Barely anyone who's racist would call themselves racist. They know racism is bad. They'll instead go on and say things like „I'm not racist, /but/“.

But those fanfictions don't do that. They don't call the displayed behaviour racism. They just portray the racist behaviour, and people will read it, unaware that it is racist and then they will translate this behaviour into real life and feel justified.
