It's really not hard to write a slytherin story without advertising racist concepts. Just don't go along and make the canonically racist-Nazi-families the oh so suppressed ones and don't antagonise muggle culture.

Not saying everyone writes those things with malicious intend but it's really not too much to ask to sit down for a second and ask yourself „would that translate good into real life?“
