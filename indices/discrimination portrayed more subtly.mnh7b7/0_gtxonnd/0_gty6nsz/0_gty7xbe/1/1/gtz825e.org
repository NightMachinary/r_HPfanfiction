That's kind of missing the point though. It's basically inventing a problem to justify the purebloods racism against muggleborns and muggleborns having to give up their own culture.

It would be a cool thing in another setting. But as it is in Harry Potter, purebloods are in power and muggleborns are discriminated against. Muggleborns aren't making any laws and forbidding any traditions. Purebloods can basically do what they want, I mean a bunch of them had no problems buying their way out of prison after the first war. No one is stopping them from practicing any traditions. It's never a question that the magic that is forbidden are things like the unforgivables and that they're simply designed to harm people.

So what reason is there to desperately want to find a reason to justify the purebloods behaviour when in canon there never was any questions that it's just plain racism?

Basically, if it's in a pretty canon setting and just an excuse to have muggleborns as the bad guy or as an excuse to have them give up their culture and show the wizard way of living as superior, it's morally questionable at least.
