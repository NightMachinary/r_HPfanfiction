The problem there is you came into this conversation allowing the views of others to influence what you believed I was saying. I will repeat. That's stupid. Tradition does not mean Nazis, or bigotry. Nor did I say it did. Again, that was you. I simply postulated an idea of an AU story where certain traditions were important in regards to magic. That is all. Not Nazis, not bigotry, nor did I say that those traditions harmed, or insulted muggles, muggleborn, or raised. Again, that was on you.
