Yes. Yes I did. I checked out this post a while ago, and apart from replying to you(and maybe others, idk), I have not checked this thread since. It caught my attention, I read a few comments, made my opinion known, and left. So no, I don't know what you're talking about, and let's even say I did, why would I let what others think influence my thought. That's stupid. No. You bought that crap up, not me. You thought that me saying my thoughts on tradition being important to magic meant Nazis. So don't put that shit in my mouth, and say I said it. That was you.
