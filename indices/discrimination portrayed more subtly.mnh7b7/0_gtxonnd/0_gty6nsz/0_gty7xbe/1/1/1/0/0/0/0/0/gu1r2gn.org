That I mention bigots, racists and Nazis, and you think traditionalists are being attacked. It's like the post where one complains about Nazis, and someone tells them "Stop attacking Conservatives!". There's a huge difference between a bigot and a traditionalist. Unless, of course, someone thinks bigotry is part of tradition.
