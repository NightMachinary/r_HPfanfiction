Yes, AUs are fine - but if someone writes a story where the Nazis are the good guys, where their genocide is justified as self-defence, where their racism is based upon facts, then I will certainly assume a few things about that person's world view. Just as I don't give the author of the RPG "Racial Holy War" and those who play it the benefit of the doubt.
