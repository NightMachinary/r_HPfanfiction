I've seen a few good ones with this trope. That these traditions were there for a reason that actually had impact on both behaviour, and magic itself. I will always classify any magic that requires negative intent, or can only be used to harm as dark. If it's just powerful magic that can actually be used in a variety of ways both good and bad, it's not dark.

With the traditions, I remember this story where magic wasn't just energy, but also had a form of sentience, and that these traditions helped bolster your connection to certain aspects of magic depending on what traditions you follow, and also helped keep you sane even. As in that the reason that most Muggleborns "went native," is because magic has a certain relationship with magicals, and that going against it would just do more harm than good. Something like a check and balances type of system that allowed people incredible powers, but also made sure that others had it also. Also the reason Magic couldn't work with science is, because if that was possible, it may have allowed an individual to have way too much power, and thrown the balance all out of order. Like Magic nukes for example.
