I actually read an essay that made the hypothesis Dark magic was called that because it was magic of a "wilder", more raw and primitive form that couldn't be controlled so easily and could lead to bad consequences (for example, going mad or evil even though the spells themselves weren't used for bad purposes), pulling examples from canon of "Dark" magic that wasn't necessarily harmful at first glance as well as offensive spells that were 100% allowed despite harmful consequences.

She also pulled examples from what was on JK's website at the time (this was back in like 2011 so Pottermore wasn't around yet and neither was the canon bloating that we have today).

EDIT: [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/potterverse.html][here is the website that I talked about]], she has some really insightful commentary even though she's a bit too much of a Snape stan for my personal tastes.
