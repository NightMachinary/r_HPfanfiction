  we see this a lot in history when you look at how indigenous populations lost so much of their culture and tradition due to immigrants

I think there is a great different between people finding land and starting to oppress and kill the people already living there, and culture slightly changing with time due to outside influences. Nobody stops the old families of still doing what they want. They won't be discriminated against because they don't celebrate Halloween or something, they're very much still the ones in power.

Cultures, language, basically everything changes over time, that's just what happens. There's nothing wrong with that happening and there is nothing wrong with holding on to traditions. But there is absolutely no sense in blaming people for simply peacefully existing and practicing their own culture
