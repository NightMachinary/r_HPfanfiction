  They're like â€œMuggle traditions have replaced wizarding ones, muggleborns made us replace Samhain with Halloween

I think there's a way to show some nuance with it - particularly if you demonstrate that muggleborns are making up a greater and greater percentage of new witches and wizards and just by pure numbers they are culturally making the magical world more muggle culture esque. Because cultural destruction is also not a good thing - we see this a lot in history when you look at how indigenous populations have lost so much of their culture and tradition due to immigrants.

I also think there's a huge difference between lamenting that ancient holidays are not practiced anymore/shunned than complaining about changing archaic and discriminatory educational, economical, and political systems.
