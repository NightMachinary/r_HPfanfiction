Same! I was hoping someone would be able to rec an actual non-racist one for me, but no luck so far. I see far too many of those Slytherin Harry fics where they paint Slytherins and purebloods to be the /real/ oppressed group. They're like “Muggle traditions have replaced wizarding ones, muggleborns made us replace Samhain with Halloween and outlawed all dark magic (which isn't harmful magic at all!)”, like do they /really/ think that muggleborns have the political power to do that? Unbelievable.

It would probably be more accurate to say that the trope shows prejudice and discrimination but doesn't recognise it as discrimination.
