Thinking of fics that don't have explicitly discriminatory laws but nonetheless feature societal and institutional blood supremacism:

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk): Hermione senses a "quiet bigotry of low expectations" towards Muggleborns, and resents the heck out of it.
- linkffn(Murder Most Horrid by Useful Oxymoron): An AU in which Voldemort never happened and Bellatrix became an auror---which doesn't stop her from being blood-prejudiced as heck.
- linkffn(A Necessary Gift by cosette-aimee): Muggleborns don't get the mentoring that everyone else takes for granted.

On a more plot bunny note, it would be interesting to see stories in which not being able to do magic over the summer is an actual disadvantage that affects people's progress. (To an extent, it happens in canon when Draco (apparently) learns extracurricular magic such as Serpensortia and Occlumency during the summer.)

It would also be interesting to see a fic in which Hermione is a Dumbledore-grade genius, which has some negative consequences. In particular, consider purebloods who sympathise with Voldemort but consider his methods to be uncouth and destructive; they instead play the long game, sitting the conflict out, waiting for Dumbledore to die of old age so that things could go back to the way they used to be. Voldemort they resent for being an upstart and giving their cause a bad name.

Now, they find out that the next Dumbledore is here---and she is an outspoken and stubborn Muggleborn. Suddenly, time is no longer on their side, and Voldemort has more supporters.
