That's a tough one I want to say Linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) but idk if it fits. Basically muggleborns are taken from their family as children, have the minds wiped and then are adopted by a wizarding family. Some parents love their kids but there are others who see them as inferior and the whole process is pretty fucked up.

They are then fully adapted into the world after but it goes deeper than that and I'm not sure how to explain it well.
