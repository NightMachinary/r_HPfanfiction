Hey I actually stumbled across this from a thread you posted two years ago looking for fics like Death of Today.

May I introduce you to [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][Rigel Black]] who is probably as dear to me as any fictional character has ever been. There's politician!Riddle and healer!Harry, as well as far more than I could possibly describe here.

We're nearing the end of book four now and it's everything I ever wanted. If you think this fic is going to disappoint you.... stop worrying.
