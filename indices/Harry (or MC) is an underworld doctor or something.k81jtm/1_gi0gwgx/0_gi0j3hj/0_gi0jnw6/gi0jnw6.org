Ah, fair enough. The only thing I can think of that's even remotely similar to the Lower Alleys is the hedgewitch community in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13051824/1/New-Blood][New Blood]] but they're towards the end of the current content and I find this fic problematic at times.

I haven't read a ton of healer centric fics, so I'd certainly be interested if you found any more.

Out of curiousity, /did/ you ever end up finding anything like Death of Today?
