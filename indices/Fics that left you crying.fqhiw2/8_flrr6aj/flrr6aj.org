Not going to use the bot because of multiple links. What can I say, I cry easily.

Gen, including Severitus:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9205421][A Ghostly Boy]] by lastcrazyhorn, very short but very angsty.

Slash:

- The classic [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][If You Are Prepared]] series by Cybele (HP/SS). To be honest, I've only read it once, so all I really remember is that it was a really good story and I sobbed my heart out so much I'm not sure I could take it again.
- [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=290][The Last Dance]] by Sushi (HP/SS)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10785525][No Happy Memories]] by Amanuensis (HP/SB). Not a pairing I usually read, but this is so heartbreakingly awesome.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/539949][Our Tree]] by Dacro (HP/DM)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9471506][The Park Bench]] by plumeria (HP/DM)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7876180][The Return]] by Kulfold (HP/SS)
- I wish I could also link The Sensible Garden by RaeWhit (HP/SS), but she's apparently purged most of her HP fanfic. I have it saved in Word, if anybody wants a copy.)
