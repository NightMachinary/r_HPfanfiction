My screen has a box labeled "Bot Usage" on the right. You might not have that if you're on a phone. The bot creates a "reply" to your post with the fic's summary and link.

For an old-fashioned HTML link, look at the bottom of the box you're typing the reply into, for the icon that looks like two rings linked together. Click that to open a popup to enter the url.
