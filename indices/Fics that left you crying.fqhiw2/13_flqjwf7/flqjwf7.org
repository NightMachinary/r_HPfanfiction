[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1067936][Gryffindor tie(s) by Amaru_Katari]], but really, it is about suicide and it is not gentle description, so if you can be triggered by something like this, I don't recommend it. For others, yes, it is pretty rough.

Also, linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts--From Sir, with Love by Forest_of_Holly) from the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts]] series. This probably won't affect everyone as much, but for me it was the most horrible thing I have ever read. And yes, in quarantine, there is enough time, so read whole series. Some, parts are better than others, but it is definitively worthy of reading (also, the third volume is tough and great).
