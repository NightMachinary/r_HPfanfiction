I second both Cauterize and Stages of Hope; great fics.

linkffn(I Know Not, And I Cannot Know - Yet I Live and I Love) is just a beautiful fic, and that's all I'll say. Definitely read this one.

linkffn(Catechism; Friends by the psychotic house-elf) were fics that take abuse/cruelty to kind of an extreme, but unlike most of that type, are done well.
