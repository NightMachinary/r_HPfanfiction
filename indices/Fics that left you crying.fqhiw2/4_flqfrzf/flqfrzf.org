I can't recall ever having cried at anything fictional, but it was really rough reading certain chapters towards the end of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647/chapters/15327019][Conspiracy of Blood]]. This may have been because [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzylRlmlvDk][I Want to Know What Love Is]] was playing in the background and I feel it echoes what Harry was saying in said chapters.
