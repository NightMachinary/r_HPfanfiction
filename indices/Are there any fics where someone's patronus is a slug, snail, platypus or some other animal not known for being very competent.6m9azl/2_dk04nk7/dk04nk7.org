I do remember one where Luna had a platypus. Don't remember the fic, and it wasn't more than a paragraph spent on it. Harry was teaching them in the DA, and he thought it a very Luna thing.

On the whole, the animal doesn't affect the patronus and it's function. A corporal patronus is patronus, regardless how it manifests through a person's magic. As amusing as the idea of a slug moving as slug speed to deliver a message or chase dementors is.
