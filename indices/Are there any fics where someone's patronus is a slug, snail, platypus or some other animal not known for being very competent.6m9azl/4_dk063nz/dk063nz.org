Not sure if this counts as incompetent, but I believe there was one where Lucious Malfoy had a white peacock as a patronous. He was embarrassed about it so he told everyone that he couldn't make a patronous. I think there is also one where Draco had a peacock as patronous. I always thought the idea of the Malfoys with peacock as their spirit animal pretty funny.
