...I would personally /love/ a platypus patronus.\\
In regards to incompetentness, I think a better question would be if someones animagus form was one of these. A patronus is a patronus. Regardless of what form it takes. be it a tiger or a snail, it's still gonna chase off dementors. The strength of the patronus is related to how well its cast, and even then, better casting won't give you a better form, it'll just be a bit more solid/corporeal/whatever.\\
Although...if the snail was actually snail size, i could see how that'd be a problem.
