I am amused by clever tags on AO3, but recognize that it's not helpful. After all, the entire point of tagging is to be able to use them to find similar tropes. That said, I've done professional indexing, and full tagging includes a lot of things that may seem redundant because you try to include every permutation that people may search for.

But yes, to answer your original question, I agree it should be mentioned either in the tags or the summary, so that people can either look for it, or avoid it, as they please.

(The ones I don't get are when they genderbend the character and then put them in a gay relationship. Ummm, if you wanted them with that person, why not leave them as-is and write het? I don't mind slash, but to genderbend to make your fic, I dunno, "edgier" by being slash, seems like just a gimmick.)
