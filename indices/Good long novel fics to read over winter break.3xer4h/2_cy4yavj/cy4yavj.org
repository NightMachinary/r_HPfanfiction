[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][The Meaning of One;]] [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=126789][and the incomplete sequel.]]

One of the best stories I've read; and probably the best high-powered Harry and the best Soul bond portrayal of any fanfiction I know of.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078750/1/A-Call-to-Arms][A Call to Arms]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall][My Dear Professor McGonagall.]]

Anything by this author is worth reading, but this story of Hogwarts under Death Eater control is surprisingly overlooked in favour of Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5354628/1/So-You-re-a-Masochist-the-Art-of-Sidekicking][So You're a Masochist: the Art of Sidekicking]]

This one's a bit short compared to other options, but the quality cannot be doubted as Ron Weasley guides you through all you need to know about heroism.

The Weasley Twins Trilogy; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2506841/1/Surviving-the-Weasley-Twins][One]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3378737/1/The-Weasley-Twins-and-the-Sect-of-Kai][Two]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4634460/1/The-Weasley-Twins-and-the-Kosa-Assassin][the Incomplete Third]].

Follows the hilarious exploits of the Weasley Twins in their first three years of Hogwarts; if I had to pick a writing style that most closely matches Rowling, I'd choose this.

Pick any story from this author and it will probably be a good one; but this story of Michael Corner and his RANDOM system is the one I'm going to recommend.
