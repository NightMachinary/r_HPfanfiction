Okay, I just wanted to let you know, I started reading the Secret of Slytherin and it is absolutely brilliant. I mean, truly, truly brilliant. And deeply satisfying in a way that concerns me, really. Also, the chapter title [[/spoiler][Remus Lupin Versus the Establishment]] is an absolute treasure.
