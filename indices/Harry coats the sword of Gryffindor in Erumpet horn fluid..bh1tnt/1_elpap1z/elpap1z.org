An explosiv sword would be kinda pointless though, since the explosion would counteract your swing.

I spent a good few minutes thinking about possible uses, but other than makeshift battering rams, there is no reason why you'd want your sword to explode on impact. And even then you'd want the explosion further away than a yard from your face.

I mean, you could use it as makeshift reactive armour to neutralise HEAT warheads, but I doubt that the Death Eaters went to the former Warsaw Pact and bought themselves RPGs.
