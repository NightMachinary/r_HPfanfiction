Wingardium Leviosa! You want this sword far away from anything you want to keep, like your face. You want it floating in mid-air at all times, and maneuvered with accio/banishing/effectively telekinetic. Would take some practice but would be quite lethal once you got there. It's not really a sword anymore so much as a reusable missile.
