As said before, it would make an explosive sword. Problem with it is :

It's a sword, hard to cut anything when the sword make boom everytime you want to it something, may be used as an explosive weapon but something like a mace would probably be more suited\\
Since it explodes, will the sword resist the explosions (Goblin work so probably)? And more importantly, will the user be able to resist the explosion that happen at mere cm from his face, and to not get his arm shattered by the shock?

But then again, Goblin weapon only absorms what make them stronger, and magic in HP is a lot about intent. So would the sword absorbs the fluid in the first place since it may make it weaker?
