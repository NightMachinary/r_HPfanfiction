There are a few fics where a lot of magic is cast within sight of the Dursleys, but none explore the impact it has on them (usually Vernon and Dudley get trashed for attacking Harry or you have a magical makeover for Harry's room). "Summer of Change" has elements of that, but it hasn't aged well over the past decade.
