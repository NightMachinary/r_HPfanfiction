*Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived* got smacked on here a couple days ago, but it's a pretty well-regarded fic and a good introduction to the genre. Beware that it's incomplete. There are five more chapters that are on the [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net][Dark Lord Potter forums only]]; you'll have to make an account to access them. There are also probably a couple copies of that fragment floating around in dark corners of the internet, but DLP is the most straightforward way to get there.
