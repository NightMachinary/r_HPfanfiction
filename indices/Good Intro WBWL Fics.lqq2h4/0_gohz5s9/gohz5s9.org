Just make sure you read one of the few good ones, so that you don't get put off that genre. I'd recommend:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1664050][Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin]]

There is another great one called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]], but its pretty depressing.
