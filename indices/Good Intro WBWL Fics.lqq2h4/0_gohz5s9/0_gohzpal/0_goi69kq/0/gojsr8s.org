Yes, but the WBWL played straight is 1) dead and 2) doesn't have any great fics besides Antithesis. The WBWL these days is pretty much along the lines of those three fics, and most of the stuff that's recommended in general has some kind of trope subversion.

That said, I think Prince is actually a great introduction to the tropes and general world of Harry Potter fan fiction, if you're up for reading a million-plus-word fic. If you catch up on it you will pretty much be well informed on every trope in the book.
