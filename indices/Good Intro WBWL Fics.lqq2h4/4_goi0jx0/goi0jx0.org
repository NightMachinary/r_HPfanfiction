If you want an intro that most older fanfiction readers had, go read the Sacrifices arc. It was one that introduced many people to the genre, and it's complete (very few are). [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][link]]

Then there's Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) which is brilliant, but sooooo long, and full of tangents and rich world building which suffocates the plot. But, as I said, it's brilliant. It's also a subversion of some of the common tropes in the genre.

Its bastard child, I suppose, is Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos linkffn(13507192). Which is better paced, but somewhat of a pale copy. It's still in the top 0,1% of fanfictions, it's that good.

There are a lot of unfinished, abandoned fics. One of the more original ones is Magus Emissarius linkffn(4167175).

Here's a community with a lot of similar, not all WBWL but similar, fics. Community [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Wrong-BoyWhoLived/18135/99/3/2/0/0/0/0/][Link]]

EDIT: Found another oldie that would be a good introduction, Unsung Hero. It was deleted from ffn, but it is available on portkey archive. It's a straight played, complete WBWL story, without the subversion of Prince or Ashes. [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/6109/1][link]]
