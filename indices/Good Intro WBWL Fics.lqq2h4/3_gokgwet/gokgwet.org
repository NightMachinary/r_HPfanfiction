I've only read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7322935/chapters/16633456][Antithesis]] which was fantastic. Quite dark and heavy at times but thats the theme and the point. It was really interesting. Especially seeing his views on his brother and how that lack of attention affected him. And then to see how his brother dealt with him in turn.

I've heard good things about the Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived too though haven't read it.

People will knock wbwl stories for being tropey. Which they probably are but if you haven't read any wbwl then you won't know what the tropes are. So don't listen to those people =P
