So my writing process is a bit odd, but it works for me. First, I print out a month by month calendar that will span the timeline of the story, including any relevant backstory. I go through the calendar and mark down any fixed events, birthdays, start and end of term and holiday breaks, things like that. Then I get out the sticky notes. I write down plot points that I want to include on the sticky notes and stick them on the calendar. I can adjust things until the chapter is written, but once I actually write the plot point, it gets written on the calendar and the sticky note gets tossed.

I do it this way because I really need a visual representation of the passing of time. I want to look at the calendar and know that I've got too much happening in October and than nothing happening until the winter break, I want to see that these two events happened too close together, or too far apart. And putting in the fixed dates before I start makes sure that I don't forget some event that may effect the story even if it's not directly related to whatever plot point I'm working on (like a character's 17th birthday).

I also do personal timelines for each of my main characters, and "knowledge flow" timelines, where I list everything that a character knows before the story, and then add information as they learn it, like when did Snape learn the second half of the prophecy, when did Harry learn about horcuxes, things like that.

As for mapping out the actual plot, not so much. I have, as I said, plot points. Specific scenes in my head that I want to write that will advance the story in some way. But I don't plan beginning middle and end. In fact, one of the stories I'm working on right not has a "Dark Lord Defeated" sticky note sitting on my "unknown time" page lol. I'll get there eventually, but I'm not sure how or when yet, and I'm ok with that.
