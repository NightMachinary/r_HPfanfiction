Yeah, and I'm a horrible not-picker lol. If an author says that something happened on a Wednesday two days before the start of term, then September 1st better fall on a Friday that year lmao! I know that that is pretty ridiculous of me, but I can't help it. I even have my own crazy head canon about the whole attack on the Potter's (Saturday, October 31st) and Harry being dropped at the Dursley's (Tuesday, November 3rd).
