I couldn't say; I don't discuss writing methods with people much. I know that I don't do most of things mentioned in this thread. I just get an idea and I write and see where it takes me. It's like setting out on a roadtrip without planning your route: you might know where you want to get to, and have a few stops along the way that you want to hit, but you don't know what roads you're going to take to get there until you reach them.

Of course, this has it's problems--unplanned routes means you can get caught out by roadworks and p(l)ot holes--and to be honest I would advise most people to use outlining to some degree or another. Frustrations that I face after already writing 30k words are things that outliners figure out in the planning process, but this is what works for me. I've written several long stories this way, and while they might not be masterpieces I would say that's a matter of skill and practice rather than lack of outlining.
