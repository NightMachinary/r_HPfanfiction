I don't outline. Tried it a couple of times; one story abandoned from loss of interest, the other ended up the worst thing I'd written since I was a teenager.

I have a notebook for jotting down ideas, but they're basically just the barest premise of a story. For example my most recent one just says "All the knowledge in the world". If I have a particular idea that needs expanding on I might make a couple of extra notes, but generally I don't think about even vague details until I turn my attention to writing that specific story idea.

For stories I am working on, I mostly keep it all in my head and just write. If I have ideas at 4am, I might make a note of it so that I don't forget come morning, but other than that I generally rely on my memory. If I forget, I figure it probably wasn't that great anyway (or it'll come back to me later). I only make exceptions if my brain is slamming with me with details, but even then I only jot down the barest notes I need to remember everything and I don't bother with form or organisation.

As for when it comes to deciding what stays and what gets cut, I figure that out when I write it. Obviously some ideas you realise you can't keep because it's just not plausible with how the story has gone up to that point, but with other things I don't decide until it's written out. Every story I write has a secondary document named "[Title] Extras" and has any bits I've written and decided not to include, just in case I change my mind.
