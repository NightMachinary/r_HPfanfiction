I assume here a serious work. I do fanfiction in a non-serious matter, without much plan or direction because typing is almost meditative for me, while planning, plotting and outlining is not. That's hard, creative work. Work that I simply won't use for something that isn't 100% my own afterwards. Hence my answers concern my original work.

1) Yes, I do outline a story. Before and during the writing process.

2) I plan through the entire plot from start to finish. Then I add the character arcs to it. After the character arcs I refine the plot to go logically with the characters decisions. Then I refine the character arcs,........ until I finally have a plot and character arcs that I like. Then I moodboad scenes and places. I try to get into my characters heads, write some origin stories for them and play their lifes through in my head - which is a process I tend to do several times during the writing of the story to remain in-voice and character.

3) The outlining is part of the creative process. People always think that to be creative means to be without limitations. I'm more of the opinion that being creative is to set your own limitations. True, the writing itself is then only a "completion process". Its the assembly of pre-done parts.
