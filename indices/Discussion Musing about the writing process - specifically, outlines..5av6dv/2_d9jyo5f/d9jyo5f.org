My planning process:

Step 1: establish the beginning and the end.

Step 2: Break the story into three arcs: beginning, middle, and end. Working backwards from the ending, establish a major plot development that occurs at the end of each arc.

Step 3: Go into each arc and establish the basic steps that are required to take the story from the beginning of that arc to its ending. One chapter for each step of plot progress.

Step 4: Come up with some subplots, find ways to tie them into the central plotpoints already decided on, and disperse said subplots across the chapters.

You now have a chapter plan that tells you what has to be achieved by the end of each chapter. That is where I stop my pre-story planning.

Step 5: Before writing each chapter, familiarise yourself with what that chapter needs to achieve from your chapter plan. Think of a series of scenes that will achieve that goal. This is your scene plan.

Step 6: Write the chapter.
