Do you outline a story?

Yes, very brief. Usually it's a matter of only writing a summary-sentence (MC, problem arising, why it's a problem, the goal of MC or something like that.)\\
I tend to lose myself into my outlines, details so much that I end up with a very stiff model that never brings me any pleasure to write, so I decided to skip outlines altogether and just write.

I make a first draft usually as fast as possible. Leave myself notes (I don't even know the name of my characters at that point, or barely. I just have a vague idea of what's happening and the end in mind and aim to that ASAP.) Seriously, it's the ugliest piece of shit you'll ever see, but it works and it's a story.

Once I feel I reached the end, I go back to my notes, fluff things out, and go on the second draft. Once the second draft is done, I then split into chapters my story, and go on the third draft, and so on until the story is finished and polished.

From there I revise and make second, third, fourth and fifth draft, until I feel it's all polished.

I write a first draft based on the summary
