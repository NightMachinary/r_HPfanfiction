Some people can write as stream-of-thought while others (such as myself) prefer to do things in a more organized fashion. It really just depends on what you're most comfortable with. I would recommend however, that any writer ought to have an understanding of what it is they want to write about, what major points they want to hit, and where they want to end up. How much more detailed you go from there is really up to personal preference, but without knowing where you want to go with your writing you're liable to end up writing yourself into a corner with no idea where to go from there. Additionally, by having a goal in mind, you have a conclusion to strive for and complete, without which it becomes easy to meander off on tangents or simply loose interest in the work. Don't make your goal too lofty though, keep it reasonable and achievable with consideration to how much time and effort you intend to spend on the project; remember you can always set a new goal once you reach the first.
