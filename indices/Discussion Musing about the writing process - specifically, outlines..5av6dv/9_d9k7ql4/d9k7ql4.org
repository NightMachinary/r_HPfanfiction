I do the [[http://i.imgur.com/V6jip1l.jpg][outline thing]] like JKR does (or did) for the HP books. I find it to be very useful with pacing/timing of specific events.

I expanded on that some and wrote a slightly more detailed thing in a text file, which is mostly what I reference nowadays. The above/first outline was instrumental for the basic idea and plotting though.

When I begin a new file (which I do for each chapter), I briefly jot down a list of all the scenes to take place, and then systematically tackle each of those.

I'm all about planning. I can't fly by the seat of my pants.
