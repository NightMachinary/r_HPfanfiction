I outline rough plot lines. For example, I'm on fourth year of a fanfic right now, and I know how the main events of the next two years are going to go down until the fic's finish.

Outlining every scene, though, I definitely would never do. It removes spontaneity and the fun of the writing process; there are a few scenes, especially deaths, I might have written versions of in advance, but never would I plan the whole story out scene by scene.

At the moment, my general process is to look at my main plot, write up a rough chapter outline (main ideas to hit) and almost always write the chapter whilst ignoring the outline. I still cover the intransigent points, but those I'm writing are still entertaining.

Too much outlining can make you afraid to incorporate great ideas when you come up with them later in a fic. I might come up with an incredible side plot TODAY to incorporate, and I have the freedom to do so without having to go over two years of plot events.
