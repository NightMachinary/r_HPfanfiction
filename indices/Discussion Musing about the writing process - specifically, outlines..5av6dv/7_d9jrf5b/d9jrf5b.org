Best analogy I can give is I think of writing alphabetically.

I know where I want to start and have a few key points mapped out where everything in between just happens organically.

I start at point A, know a few thing i want to include later on, EFG, and an ending sometimes I know the ending, but most often I know when/how i want to wrap a story up, ( using my analogy I know Y but not Z)
