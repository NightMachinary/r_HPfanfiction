#+begin_quote
  Do you outline a story before starting to write?
#+end_quote

Yes.

#+begin_quote
  to what degree? A simple list of plot points you want to hit, the series of transitions, every scene in detail (almost like a screenplay)?
#+end_quote

To the point of excess. I've had to remove dozens of plot points that led to sideplots that went absolutely nowhere. When you're planning everything out, it's hard to imagine just how much work it takes to bring all of those minor details to fruition.

#+begin_quote
  Do you find you constrain yourself by outlining, i.e, is something lost in the creative process by setting limits before starting?
#+end_quote

Definitely not, but I can see how that might be a problem. I think the trick is to not be married to any one particular way to solve a problem as the first draft develops. If you think of a better way to complicate a characters life after you've moved on from outlining, don't be afraid to make large scale changes. Just be ready to deal with all of the ramifications to deviating from the outline.
