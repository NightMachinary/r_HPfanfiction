Plotter or Pantser. Architect or Gardener. It's a question I get asked frequently.

I'm plotter/architect to an obsessive extent. I like having a full grasp of the world and its rules so I can maintain an internally logical and consistent narrative.

I should point out I don't write one-shots/shorts. All my work is long form/feature length.

I start with dot points for the seven key "beats" needed for a three act story.

These then become summary paragraphs.

I then write dot points for scenes necessary for plot and character development and see where they fall logically to link the seven key beats.

I then write summary paragraphs for those.

This document goes to my alpha readers for a check on tone, flow, and consistency.

I do a pass based upon their notes and make changes.

If I have any clear set pieces, snippets of dialogue or drafts/part scenes I add them as placeholders now, as part of doing a scene breakdown for every scene.

The scene breakdowns are written onto coloured index cards. Colour designates the key plot element/subplot to which the scene pertains. These are placed in order. Then holding one edge I look at the top of the cards and let my eye tell me if there are any times too much of one colour is clumping together or dropping off unnaturally so I can go back and assess the flow and move scenes around as needed without having to rewrite huge slabs.

Once I am happy with the flow/integration of plot elements, I start on a first draft.

I know, I'm a lunatic. However, it's the system that has gradually come together over years that works for me.
