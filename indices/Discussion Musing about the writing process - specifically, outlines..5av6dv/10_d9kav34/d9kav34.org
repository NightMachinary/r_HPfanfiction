  /Do you outline a story before starting to write?/
#+end_quote

For short one-shots, no. For the nine billion multi-chaptered fics that are languishing on my computer, yes.

(But for my non-fic works, I tend to outline short stories too.)

--------------

#+begin_quote
  /If yes, to what degree? A simple list of plot points you want to hit, the series of transitions, every scene in detail (almost like a screenplay)?/
#+end_quote

All three of those are what I use in various combinations. I outline each chapter. Sometimes that outlining is scene by scene, going so far as to contain dialogue and specific reactions to dialogue. Sometimes it is a scene summary with required reactions, symbolism, etc. Other times, it's a single line or two that acts as a placeholder for more details until I have the rest of the plot figured out.

I very rarely get specific with things like clothing or setting to a fine degree unless those things play into the plot.

As an example, one of my recently finished outlines is around 30k words. The story will be about 3x that, an appropriate length for its genre.

  /Do you find you constrain yourself by outlining, i.e, is something lost in the creative process by setting limits before starting?/
#+end_quote

No. It may seem counterintuitive, but it's made me more creative.

My style of writing, to borrow a bit from George R. R. Martin's idea of architects vs gardeners, is less architecture than it is planned gardening. I have an idea of how I want the end result to look, so I make very specific plans. Sometimes, those plans alter before I can start on the actual project. But sometimes, when things start growing, I decide that what I've planted looks a bit prettier when I don't prune it so much. Or when I remove a tree that is beautiful but utterly out of place. Or when I suddenly have the thought that it would be really neat to have a series of strange, almost hidden shrubs, planted everywhere starting at the front gate.

The *tl;dr* of it is that since I know what's coming, I'm free to play in the parameters that I've set.

  /If you write with no outline at all, how do you keep track of all your ideas, what to include and what to remove?/
#+end_quote

I used to write like that. Basically, I'd have character lists and a general idea of the plot. It was hard to keep track of what came before and even harder to know what would come after. I frequently waited for "inspiration." I was editing as I went, which was a nightmare. Stories fizzled a lot.

In the end, it was a lot of wasted paper and wasted time.

Outlining personally works for me, so I stick with it.
