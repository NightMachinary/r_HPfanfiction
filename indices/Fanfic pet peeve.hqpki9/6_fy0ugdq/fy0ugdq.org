The problem is Hagrid's accent, as many average writers often make him sound like a drunken idiot with a flu. For example:

"'Arry, I go' ya a cake fur ya bir'day. 'Appy bir'day!", "Ya a wiz'd, 'Arry.", or "Don' talk abo' Snape like tha'. Heeza a goo' teecher at this skul, ya?" (Something like that.)

That's not Hagrid. That's more like Fleur on drugs. Just a step up and you'll have Jar Jar Binks. "Yuzza izza wizard, Harry! Mezza so proud of your parentsa!"

There's a thing called Google, you know, or people can analyse the way he talks in the books. Otherwise, just avoid accented misspellings entirely, and trust the reader to mentally 'Hagridify' it.
