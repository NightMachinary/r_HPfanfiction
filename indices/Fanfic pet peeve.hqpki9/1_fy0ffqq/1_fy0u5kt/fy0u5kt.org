And I once read one where the troll was still in the dungeons when the Slytherins arrived. All the youngsters were making a big fuss about Dumbledore's decision to send them there (Malfoy especially). Then the older students just said "So what?", pointed their wands, and brought the troll down in a combined Stunner assault.

It's nice to read about a Slytherin house that doesn't entirely hate Dumbles 24/7 (can't remember the fic's name).
