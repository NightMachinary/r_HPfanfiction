  Rita Skeeter praising Hagrid instantly sounds weird

Yes, she is not the kind the praise anyone. I guess could do it if praising Hagrid (a Healf Breed) emphasized Dumbledores failing, but considering the character, it is more likely that she would find a way to critisize Dumbledore while insulting Hagrid at the same time.
