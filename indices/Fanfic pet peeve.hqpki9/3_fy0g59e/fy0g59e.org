I have a love-hate relationship with Hagrid. I agree with most of the stuff here. But my main issue with him is that he mainly seems to advance the plot or drop a hint. Don't know what's in the third floor corridor? Hagrid. Don't know what the first task is? Hagrid? Need some sort of information? Hagrid. He's the Gryffindor information network. After book1, every time Hagrid showed up, it told me something was going to happen. The chickens? I instantly dropped the book, had a Hermione moment, ran to my bookshelf and had a hell of a time finding my Canterbury Tales book. The Skrewts? Ugh...

Any sort of discord with Dumbledore? Hagrid is out. It doesn't even have to be bashing. Mad about being stuck at the Dursleys? Mad about no mail? Anything really, Hagrid would instantly side with Dumbledore.

One plot point that I have never seen (except for a Gamer!Harry fic where Harry spent a summer working with Hagrid as an assistant) is Harry asking Hagrid to help harvest the Basilisk. Maybe make a jacket or something out of it. Hagrid is always treating leather, fixing boots, his jacket, etc.
