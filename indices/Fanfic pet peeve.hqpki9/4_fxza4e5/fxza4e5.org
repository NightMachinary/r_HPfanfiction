No one can write the Hagrid speech?

one fic I've read had him talk a completely foreign language. like, "Im'd g' to Hog' hed, yall" ... what? I know that if I were to write a fic, Hagrid will not be in it. it might be because English is not my native language, so it's pretty impossible for me.

I wonder if that's a pet peeve of someone, if Hagrid is written normally without his accent. cause I would probably write him normally if I had to.
