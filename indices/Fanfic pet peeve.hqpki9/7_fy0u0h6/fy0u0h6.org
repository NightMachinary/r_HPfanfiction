He is the second biggest exposition machine in canon, that's why he has so much presence. The biggest one, Hermione, actually has many notable moments outside of it. Hagrid has like two. So unless you are doing a complete canon rehash, it's hard to justify Hagrid's presence most of the time. The time that could be spent developing other side characters that can actually make a difference in the story.
