It'd be fun to break the trend and write an indy!Harry who takes no shit when Hagrid's insulted. Malfoy's sabotage? Partially-indy-third-year Harry makes Malfoy's life hell from the shadows.

Umbridge making a fool of Hagrid in front of the entire class? Indy!Harry turns her office into a constant source of misery for her, courtesy of dungbombs, firecrackers, and more sinister traps (perhaps Dark magic?).

I like to think that no matter what, Harry would always have a soft spot for Hagrid if the fic implies that the canon events still happened before Hogwarts.
