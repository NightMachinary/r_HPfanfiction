1. His accent is a pain to write correctly. It sort of interrupts artistic flow if you need to keep checking the dialog chart!
2. He‘s difficult to pair up romantically, if romance is your thing.
3. On the flip side, he has no real rivalries to explore, either.
4. He's super loyal to Dumbledore, if Dumbledore-bashing is your thing.
5. He's not an intellectual powerhouse if outthinking Voldemort or witty banter is your thing.
6. In canon, he constantly needs Harry--- starting at age eleven--- to clean up his messes rather than dealing with them like an adult. An “edgy” or “mature” or “indy” Harry isn't likely to tolerate that. But calling out his flaws feels like kicking a puppy. If you told him that he's not qualified to be a professor, he'd probably just cry.\\

He just doesn't fit with most fanfic tropes.
