Hagrid does too have RIVAL!!! He went to SCHOOL WITH VOLDEMORT, and got EXPELLED because of him and also POOR ARAGOG!!! :( Fanfic writers should make HAGRID have WAY MORE interactions with Voldemort than they do! And maybe Hagrid can have personal motive to fight Voldemort because maybe he thinks he could have stopped him way earlier or something! I hate how canon totally brushes this off! That is like huge, also because he meets him again in sorcerer's stone and then in deathly hallows again again.
