Ive learned these days to go into every movie with low expectations. That way its harder for me to be disappointed. That said, I have higher expectations for this movie then most, if only because I feel like it was cast almost perfectly and its separated enough from the usual HP world to where it should feel fresh.

And to be fair to Johnny Depp... I think he could make quite a good Grindlewald despite the doubters. If folks can get past him as Captain Jack that is...

PS: for those comparing it to cursed child. Dont. Cursed child was always a money grab based upon a very minimalist story turned into a play. It was never even intended to be anything beyond a play but money blinds folks.
