Thats actually not correct. Both Dark Shadows and Transcendence despite doing poorly in the US and getting mixed reviews, were box office successes overseas and made far more money then the budgets they had. Alice through the looking glass also technically made money at the box office. His only real big flops since Stranger Tides were Mordecai (which I actually enjoyed), and The Lone Ranger (which actually made money against its production budget but the 150 million marketing budget ruined any profit and made it a loss).

Now to be fair, all "could" be considered as box office failures in that they were expected to do better. But we must keep in mind that box office profits overall are down (especially in the US), and he is certainly not the only headlining star whos movies have been floundering.

Hes also not headlining this movie so the whole comparison may be moot. In fact, quite a few people have no clue hes even in it lol.
