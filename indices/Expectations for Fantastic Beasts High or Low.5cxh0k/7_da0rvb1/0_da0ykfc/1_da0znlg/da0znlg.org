When a film makes less than its production costs it is a flop. The Studio has to make payouts to Distributors and other profit sharers. When a film does not at least double its production costs it is a failure because it is not profitable. [[https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-box-office-gross][Explainer]]

So look at Transcendence

- $245 million worldwide total gross - $150 million in production = $95 million
- for arguments sake half goes to the Distributor. $47.5 million to be further divided down among theater chains
- $47.5 million to the Studio that made/financed Transcendence
- this doesn't even take into account marketing costs which can cost just as much as production does
