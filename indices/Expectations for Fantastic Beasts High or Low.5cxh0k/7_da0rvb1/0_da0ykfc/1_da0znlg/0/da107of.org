By that very argument though Transcendence was not a flop since it made more then its production costs. You also have no real clue how much actually goes to various sources or what the contracts were between the various parties. Thats strait guess work. And in my very response I made it clear all the movies listed could be considered as box office failures despite technically making a profit above their production costs.

Also keep in mind that the box office is not the entirety of a movies profit making potential. Many movies are box office failures or flops but extremely successful in the digital or box media markets. The box office is a fickle mistress these days.
