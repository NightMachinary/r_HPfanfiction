Oh definitely. Imdb for example even says:

"Credited cast, sorted by IMDb STARmeter:"

Hes listed high because his name does carry weight (regardless of his recent history).... not based upon how big a roll he plays in the film.

The fact hes not featured in the trailers at all is another thing to think about.
