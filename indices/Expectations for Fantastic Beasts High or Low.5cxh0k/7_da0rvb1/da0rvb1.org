I would like to point out that the last six films Depp headlined were box office failures. /Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides/ was his last success.

*Into the Woods is not included because it's hard to suck with that ensemble.*

But yeah high hopes for the film and series. Nothing really to base the plot on which will probably aid it with this fandom.
