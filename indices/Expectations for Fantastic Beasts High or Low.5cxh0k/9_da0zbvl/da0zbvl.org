I have a good feeling about the director. A bad one about JKR's involvement (because CC), which is really kind of sad - she created this universe but ever since 2007 she's just been fucking it up. And WB have a shit track record lately.

Oh well, at least we'll all laugh at how bad the movie-license game will be.
