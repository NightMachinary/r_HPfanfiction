I disagree with this.

In regards to how close they were to canon 1 and 2 are clearly the closest, but I think that adherence to canon isn't a good comparison to how good the film is.

For me, and almost everyone I know, 3 is the best film of all the Harry Potter movies. 1 and 2 are consitently in the bottom 4 for everyone I know (unless they say 1 for nostalgia) because Hogwarts seems very sterile. After 3 people start running around in normal clothes, messy uniforms and acting like children would if they were at a boarding school IMO (I've never been to one so I could be completely wrong here). It also makes magic dangerous, it introduces the dementors, it makes the unkown magic scary which for me is an important part of the Harry Potter movies, but not the books.

I don't agree with you about 4 and 5, I personally liked the dueling especially in 5 the effects during the final battle scene were amazing for me. 6 I'll give you, I don't like it much. 7&8 though I love, they really capture the desperation that Harry and Co feel, and the efectless magic, I liked it, it added importance to certain spells like Avada Kedavra and Expelliarmus.
