I think they missed serious opportunities with magical dueling in 5. Instead of things being transfigured into animals to attack or objects being charmed agressively (other than in Dumble vs V) we got gunshot style spells and white clouds vs black clouds which just seemed shite to me. If you liked that then you're welcome to it.

Edit: And they shouldn't be running round in normal clothes acting like normal kids, they're in a school for MAGIC. They ride on brooms and wear pointy hats, they study potions and runes, they don't go round in jeans and a fucking t-shirt.
