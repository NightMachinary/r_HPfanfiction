1st film was great, everything a Harry Potter film should be. 2nd was much of the same.

3rd started to go bad, everyone was going round in jeans rather than robes and it didn't work as well.

4th and 5th seemed rushed and just didn't quite work. the dueling was weird and the quality wasn't there.

6th, 7th and 8th were fairly dire, people fighting as bubbly air jet things and just argh.

Apparently, Cursed Child was even worse.

The films have been on a solidly downward trajectory since the 3rd, I don't know why this one should buck the trend.
