I have high expectations for the creature focus - fanon seems obsessed (rightfully so, since they're prominent in canon, but still sigh-inducing) with phoenixes, hippogriffs, basilisks, and what have you. I look forward to seeing this particular feature impact fanfiction both in Harry's time and in the ones that'll be sprouting from these new movies.

I'm nervous about Johnny Depp as Grindelwald and, for future movies, a shift in genre. God forbid a focus on romance. More theory and world-building pls.
