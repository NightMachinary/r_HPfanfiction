I grew up with those particular big names being the HP characters, though. It might be different for someone who knew Alan Rickman as the sheriff of Nottingham before they knew him as Severus Snape, but not so for me.

Johnny Depp is just one of /those/ faces, like Dwayne Johnson and Nicholas Cage. You don't see their roles when they're spotlighted because they're so prominent.

Also, he isn't blonde enough to be Grindelwald. There's that, too.
