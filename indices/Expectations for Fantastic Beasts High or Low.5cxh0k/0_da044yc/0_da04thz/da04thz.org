Decision to put Johnny Depp as Grindelwald rankled a lot. I really don't care about the baseless accusation he suffered from, and the debate that ensued, but I just never picture Johnny as Grindelwald.

On the other hand, it could have been Jim Carrey. Really glad it's johnny depp when seen that way.
