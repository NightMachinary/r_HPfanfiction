  After Voldemort's return, Harry finds an unlikely ally. The Child of Light made a deal with a demon. A snarky, sexually promiscuous, slightly insane, possibly incompetent demon. Rules are going to be broken (as well as the fourth wall, and probably some bones). Yep, the Wizarding World is screwed. Reviews are welcome! Sequel up now!
