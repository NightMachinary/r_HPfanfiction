So my favorite fic of all time is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3415504/1/Prodigy][Prodigy]] on fnn. Its a WBWL crossover with lots of police procedural tv shows, like CSI, NCIS, or House. Its kind of unreaslistic but not crack with time travel elements (not like redo or anything it just there to have more time in the day) and no bashing of Harrys brother. Its so so well done please give it a try!!!! You can even read it without seeing the other fandoms (i did the first time and i still havent seen CSI even though ive seen the other shows by now)!!!!!
