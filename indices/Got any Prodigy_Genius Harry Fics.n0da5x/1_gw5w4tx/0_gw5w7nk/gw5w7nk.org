#+begin_quote
  After a miserable ending to an otherwise magical first year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter wants nothing more than to escape the clutches of his muggle relatives once more and return to the world in which he belongs. His brother Charlus, the Boy-Who-Lived, wants nothing more than to redeem his own failures and prove to not just the wizarding world, but to himself as well that he is more than just some child celebrity.Unbeknownst to Harry and Charlus, the two of them will have to struggle with more than their own personal demons. There is a monster roaming the halls of Hogwarts, one controlled by an equally mysterious Heir of Slytherin, one who is seemingly hell-bent on destroying Hogwarts from the inside out. How will the Potter twins react to threats from this Heir of Slytherin, along with their own personal struggles, both internal and external? And what of the enigmatic Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor who seems to be far more than what meets the eye?

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him. The sequel, Wrath and Remorse, is published on this site.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
