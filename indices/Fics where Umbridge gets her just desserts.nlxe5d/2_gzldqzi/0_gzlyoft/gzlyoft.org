I still don't understand why people pull off this centaur rape nonsense.

Sure, classical literature represents them this way. But in the HP-verse, do you think Dumbledore would allow rapehungry centaurs to hang out in the forest within walking distance of the school with a high amount of female children about? The acromantula at least are deeper into the forest.

Not to mention Hermione READS ALL THE BOOKS Granger of all people would do that to someone. Sure, get someone that has been systematically messing with her education and torturing them murdered? Yeah, I can see her doing that. But not giftwrap someone for a one-way trip to Gangbang, Rapetown. And if that doesn't settle things, that whole skit with the horse clopping sounds in the Hospital Wing afterwards? Yeah, that would be even more messed up, and the fact that she didn't react to it in that context is even more telling. Let's go even further with this... Would Dumbledore allow a rapehungry centaur into the castle TO TEACH?

And even then, would Dumbledore let Hermione back into the thick of things after doing that? Not even a slap on the wrist?
