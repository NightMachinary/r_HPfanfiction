In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435/chapters/36417321][October]] something changes the timeline, and Tom Riddle eventually winds up as the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts. linkao3(15675435)

Despite what it might sound like, it's not a crack fic. The story of how Tom got to that point is well writen. He actually takes his subject seriously because he recognises how wizarding society's disdain for muggles may eventually lead to disaster. He designs his course to cover important topics in muggle history, geopolitics, science etc. but this clashes with the Ministry decreed Owl and Newt testing that focuses only on absurd topics like the purpose and use of random muggle gadgets.

I love the scenes of his class. For example, this one at the start of chapter 27:

  “This is the map of Earth, can anyone tell me where Britain is?”

  There were a few chuckles, there always were, and in the front a boy confidently raised his hand with a little too smug of a smile on his face, as if this was all too easy. Charlus Potter's son, James Potter, one of the sources of Minerva's near constant headaches, if her complaints in the staff meetings were anything to go by.

  “It's those islands right there next to France.” James Potter said with a cheeky grin, but that had been the easy question.

  “Very good, Mr. Potter, now how about wizarding Britain?” Tom asked and here the audience began to look a little confused. Even the muggleborn students always had trouble grasping this issue, that there was a difference between the political boundaries of the magical state versus the muggle, that they were not somehow one in the same thing.

  “Anyone?” Tom asked, but no one answered, so he moved to answer it instead.

  Pulling out a pen he circled London, a small section of Scotland, and various cities in Ireland, “As British wizards our ministry does not deign to separate our political borders from our muggle counterparts but if one were to look at our communities, to see where muggle ends and wizard begins, you would find that our nation is quite small. That we are a nation comprised of city states, small landlocked nations that have to pass through miles of muggle land before reaching its counterpart.”

  It was always at this point, if there were any Slytherins who'd decided to take his class either as a joke or to keep an eye on him for their fathers, that the room would grow cold and they might even interrupt him saying that their father was on the board of trustees and he'd better remember his place.

  The tension in the wizarding community had been growing though in the past decades, there were no Slytherins in his class now, and those that were purebloods were trying too hard to be politically correct to object here and now even if they didn't agree.

  There was a storm brewing, out there in wizarding Britain, and they were all just waiting for it to hit.

  “Now, with apparition the idea of a connected country isn't as integral as it is to the muggles. We don't need roads or trains to get from Point A to Point B. Yet, never the less, in your own lives it's clear that our state is derived from the infrastructure of its muggle counterpart. To get to school you take a train from King's Cross in London, a muggle train station from a great muggle city. To enter the Ministry of Magic you use various phone booths in London's financial district. The Leaky Cauldron acts as our border, letting you in and out from Diagon Alley, again located in central muggle London.” He placed his pen into his coat pocket once again.

  When he first started teaching he had gone further than this even, pointing out that the only truly magical state was Ubik, which had refused to recognize the statute of secrecy since its creation, instead allowing muggles to view magic as either an act of god or some alien technology, whatever they desired, and teaching its children in the magical school that had been built there. But Tom had learned that a bit of caution is always wise.

  For now he would let those clever enough finish his lecture for him, realize that they lived in a muggle world, and that denying this was what lead to the horrific corruption that wracked the ministry today.

  “Introductory Muggle Studies will be focused on the history of the muggle state and the magical state as well, where's the difference, when were magical states founded, et cetera. The more advanced courses I teach are those that focus on muggle science and engineering, how muggle technology works. Any questions?”
