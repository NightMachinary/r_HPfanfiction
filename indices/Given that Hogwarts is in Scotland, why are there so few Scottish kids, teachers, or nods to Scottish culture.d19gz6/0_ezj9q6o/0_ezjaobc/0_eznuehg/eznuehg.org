Well, it would be odd if there was a particularly strong Scottish presence... Scots represent, what, 7-8% of the UK population? And Hogwarts is a British school, not a Scottish school. It just so happens to be located in Scotland.

It's also worth noting that magical Britain has been unified for much longer than Muggle Britain. The Wizards' Council ruled over both magical England and Scotland as early as 1269.
