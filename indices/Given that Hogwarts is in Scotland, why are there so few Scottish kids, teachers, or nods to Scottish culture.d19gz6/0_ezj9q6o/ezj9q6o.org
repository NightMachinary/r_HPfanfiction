I mean firstly Scottish men don't wear kilts all the time.

But secondly - Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are emphasised to be remote and they collect witches and wizards from all over GB & NI. The appeal of Hogsmeade is that it's the only entirely wizarding settlement, so people will have moved there from all over the place and there wouldn't be much opportunity to interact with Scottish Muggles at all.
