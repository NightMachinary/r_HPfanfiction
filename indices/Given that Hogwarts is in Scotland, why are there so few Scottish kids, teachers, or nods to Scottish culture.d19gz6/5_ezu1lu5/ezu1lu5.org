Probably because what is happening now - the lines between cultures blurring and some cultures vanishing outright! - has been happening with wizards for centuries (they have had instand travel and communications for centuries after all and we muggles only have had planes available to the masses for what? 50 years? Cars for 100 years (but available to everybody probably only since WW2!) and the internet only for 30 years!)

Also I doubt there are that many scottish wizards and witches!
