Could be. I feel like for local flavour Hermione at least could have made some comments here and there. In a US context, its as if a Californian cast of kids went off to school in Texas for the majority of their year for 7 years and never once did anyone remark on the cultural differences or even that they'd never travelled out that direction before.

It would have been great to see some magical equivalents of e.g. the local wildlife as an injoke to Scottish readers or to establish the setting.
