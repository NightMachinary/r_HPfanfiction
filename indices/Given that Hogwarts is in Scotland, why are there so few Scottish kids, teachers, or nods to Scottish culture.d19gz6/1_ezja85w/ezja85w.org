To be fair, most Scottish men don't wear kilts in everyday life and you wouldn't see them in Hogsmeade anyway since it's a fully wizarding village.

But I totally agree with you on the accents front - not just different Scottish accents, but other British regional accents. Snape's a Brummie, Dumbledore's from the West Country, Remus is Welsh (or is that just my headcanon?) - I assume it's because it's fairly difficult to write an accent, but I try and pepper my fics with regional words/turns of phrase.
