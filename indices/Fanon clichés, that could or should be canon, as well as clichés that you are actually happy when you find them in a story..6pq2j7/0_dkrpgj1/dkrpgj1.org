This is more of a headcanon than fanon or clich√©, but mine is that Flamels actually spend most of their time guarding the Stone against thieves, updating and reinforcing protections on it, and fighting off kidnapping and assassination attempts.

A related heacanon is a line that I would give to Grindelwald if I ever wrote him into a fanfic: "I looked into the whole immortality thing as well, and you know what I discovered? That the harder try to become immortal, the more people will be trying to kill you, that's what. It's more trouble than it's worth."
