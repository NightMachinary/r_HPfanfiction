I don't like the idea Harry's vault in the books is a trust fund. But if you want to incorporate it in your story, you can have Harry can only take a small amount of money out. It'd make more sense to me than opening an entire different vault. Just say he can only take X amount of galleons per year until his 17th birthday.

I like the idea that the reason Neville sucks at magic is not only that he has a badly matched wand, but also because he has no confidence. If magic is willing what you believe in into existence and Neville doesn''t believe he's good at magic, then he'd always have trouble in lessons.
