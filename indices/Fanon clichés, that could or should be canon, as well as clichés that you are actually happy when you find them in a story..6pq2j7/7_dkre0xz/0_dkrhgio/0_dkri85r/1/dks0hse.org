The exchange rate estimate was using PPP. The official exchange rate is a bit less: According to word of god it's around 5 pounds to the Galleon, which makes a bit of sense if you assume lower cost of production in the magical world and minimal trade.

Then again, that estimate only counts one large pile of gold in the vault, and it acknowledges that there might be more. It also doesn't count any of the other items that might be in the vault (family heirlooms, etc).
