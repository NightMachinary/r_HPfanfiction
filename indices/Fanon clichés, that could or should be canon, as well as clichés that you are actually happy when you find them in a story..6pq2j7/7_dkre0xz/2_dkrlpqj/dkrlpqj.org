  Basilisks were non-naturally occurring, which would make them extraordinarily rare, probably so rare that most of what could be harvested is likely useless as no one has any idea what it does. Essentially any part of a basilisk unique to a basilisk is about marginally more useful than Ununennium (an element with a half-life of ~10 Î¼s.) Fanon just assumes that there has been extensive research and study on basilisks, which are illegal to breed in canon.

Now that I think about it, I kind of like the idea that a basilisk is essentially a wizarding Boogeyman. No one knows anything about it, they have no way to combat it, and if you find out one is in your house then you hide in your bed and pray. It would make the fear of Parselmouths much more sensible. It's not that they're afraid that you can talk to snakes, it's that they're afraid you can talk to the /King/ of snakes. Anyone who can control a the Boogeyman is undeniably evil.
