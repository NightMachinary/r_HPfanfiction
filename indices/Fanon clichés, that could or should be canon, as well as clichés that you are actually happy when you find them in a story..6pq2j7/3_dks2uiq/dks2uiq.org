The mismatched wand of Neville is ridiculous. After all the longbottoms are a old pure blood family. They undoubtedly know the importance of a well match wand.

I do like the 'basal appearance' of the methamorphumagus. After even if they can change at will, some traits from her parents should be there. After all magic doesn't present it self at birth, the accidental magic occurs later in life. The idea that this special kind of wizard doesn't have a 'normal' face and was morphing since birth is idiotic

EDIT: Paradoxically, Neville's first wand was mismatched because it belonged to his father. This is Canon. I'd think that Mrs. Longbottom should have known better than that.
