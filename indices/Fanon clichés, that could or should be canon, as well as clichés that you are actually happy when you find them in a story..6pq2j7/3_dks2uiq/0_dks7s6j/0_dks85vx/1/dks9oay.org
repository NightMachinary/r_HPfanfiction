Neville's first wand was from his father, and he got a new one before he met Harry on the train in book 6, but we're not really told that Neville's trouble come from his wand mismatching- that's pure fanon.

The Weasley's didn't really have much in the way of family for them to recycle wands, right? The older siblings can't just give theirs up, Arthur isn't mentioned to have any dead relatives. Molly had her brothers, but she may have not had the chance to get theirs after they were killed. It's reasonable to assume that, if Dumbledore's wand was buried with him, most wands are buried with corpses. Alice and Frank could be a special case because they're not actually dead, which is why Neville actually has his dad's wand.
