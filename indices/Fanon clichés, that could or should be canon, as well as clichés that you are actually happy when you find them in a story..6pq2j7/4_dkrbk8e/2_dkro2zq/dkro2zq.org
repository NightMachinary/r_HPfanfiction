Aside from people disliking magical cores and lordships, you also mention such things as "Harry growing up in a loving family", which isn't quite the same kind of thing as the OP: the examples given by ORoger are all comparatively small details that could be true of canon with a few small rewrites (or none at all) to the canon books. "Harry takes credit for slaying the Basilisk" or "Harry grew up happy" would fundamentally change how the plot of the books would go.
