One thing that I am more than willing to accept is the fanon notion that the Wizengamot is the British magical parliament. It solves the very pressing issue of explaining where magical laws come from. We are acquainted with the executive in the face of the Ministry, and we witness the judiciary at a few trials---but the magical legislature is never revealed at all!

In the same vein, I don't mind the fanon notion that at least /some/ of the Wizengamot seats are hereditary. Even after Blair's reforms, the House of Lords contains an (admittedly diminished) number of hereditary peers: why oughtn't the same apply for wizards too? Granted, the nobility system can get abused to ridiculous lengths in some fanfics, whose authors seem to assume 20th century nobility can act the way it did in the 12th for some reason... Still, I quite like the Noble Houses system, when done correctly.
