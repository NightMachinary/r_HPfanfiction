I like the idea that Dumbledore isn't a dumb-ass and actually kept the stone on him the whole year and put a fake in the mirror. Or maybe there was no stone at all. It just bugs me that someone as calculating and intelligent as him would place the stone behind protections that are fairly sub par and bank everything on the fact that the mirror would keep it safe.
