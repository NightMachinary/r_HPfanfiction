  -the reason why Neville is inept in magic is a bad matched wand.

This is pretty much disproven by canon. The reason why Neville is bad at spellcasting is a crippling lack of self-confidence, not because his wand isn't good enough.

Neville becomes much better at spellcasting during OOTP, while practising with the DA -- and what really improves his performance is the news that Bellatrix Lestrange has broken out from prison. Then he begins practicing harder than everyone and stops caring about failures, accidents or injuries... and that's when he gets better. Quoting from the book:

  Harry was pleased to see that all of them, even Zacharias Smith, had been spurred on to work harder than ever by the news that ten more Death Eaters were now on the loose, but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in Neville. The news of his parents' attackers' escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo's and, taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers' escape. In fact, Neville barely spoke during the D.A. meetings any more, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter-curse Harry taught them, his plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room. He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them the Shield Charm - a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker - only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.

So Neville goes from being one of the worst spellcasters in the DA to one of the best, and all this happens while he still has his father's wand. He doesn't break it and get a new one until the end of the book... and in HBP, where he does have his new wand, he's pretty much at the same level.

So... no, I don't like fics where Neville just gets a new wand and all of a sudden he's great at magic. Neville's problems run a lot deeper than that; what he needs is confidence and not a new wand.
