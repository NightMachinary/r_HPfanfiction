/Say a Prayer/ linkao3(4629198) has Harry adopted by Marvel's Loki. I wouldn't characterize this Harry's magic as gray, but Dumbledore, Molly, etc. get all het up about him being adopted by a "dark pureblood". His strongest friendship in this series is with Neville and he develops a large friendship group.
