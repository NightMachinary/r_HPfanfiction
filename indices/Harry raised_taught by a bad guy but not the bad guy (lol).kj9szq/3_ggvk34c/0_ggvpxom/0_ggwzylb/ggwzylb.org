I don't think any of these match your prompt exactly, but mostly.

If you like /Say a Prayer/ then I recommend /Ninja Wizard/ by the same author. That one is a crossover with /Naruto/ but I've never seen that anime and I followed along just fine. Harry rather raises himself in that one, though.

/The Child of Azkaban/ linkao3(15068012) - story complete, series ongoing. James and Lily put a spell on Harry so that if he was ever hurt, he'd be transported to his legal guardian. Petunia hurts 2yo Harry, he's transported to Sirius...in the Death Eater wing of Azkaban. He's raised primarily by Sirius but he also learns from the Death Eaters.

/Patience Rewards Itself/ linkao3(2080986) - incomplete and discontinued. Harry is raised by Jim Moriarty and Sebastian Moran, from /Sherlock Holmes/.

/Sarah's Wish/ linkao3(7240036) - incomplete and discontinued. Harry is raised by the Goblin King from /Labyrinth/. His magic creeps out everyone including Lucius and Snape.

/Fruit of the Golden Tree/ linkao3(16756768) - story and series complete. Harry's grandfather Fleamont wakes from a coma and rescues him from the Dursleys - violently. Then Fleamont avenges James' and Lily's deaths - violently. Then Fleamont teaches [spoiler] that the hereditary Black Madness has nothing on the hereditary Potter Rage.
