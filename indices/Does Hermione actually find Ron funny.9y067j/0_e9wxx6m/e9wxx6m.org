Something I think gets overlooked with Hermione is that she actually has quite an immature sense of humour at times. She couldn't stop laughing at the wizard talking about a breeze round his privates in GOF, and although Harry was howling with laughter she was certainly joining in the banter with Fred and George at Bill's wedding. It's something Ron does well, I think.
