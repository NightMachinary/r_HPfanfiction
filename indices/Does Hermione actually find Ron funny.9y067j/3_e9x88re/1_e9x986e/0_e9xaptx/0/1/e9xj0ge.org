  "No. Wait. Okay. I'm just gonna use a few flush potions, and if nothing happens, then I can go be with Ron and be sure whatever I'm feeling is not imaginary, and true, and have lots of red-haired kids, and - No, Hermione Granger, Stop. Okay. You're being obsessive again - look at your list. It's just like if/and in programming. Just follow the logic and don't ask pontificate - there's no harm in using flush potions."

Something kinda similar to this happens in one of my fav fics:

Hermione figures out that she and Harry have been potioned and goes completely BAMF, also rescuing Harry along the way. Fair warning though: Most of the order of the phoenix are complete bastards in this fic.
