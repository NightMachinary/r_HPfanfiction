  Yeah, honestly that's part of why love potion fics are my very guilty pleasure, since they give some sort of reason for that irrationality. They usually tend to be terribly written though =).

Yeah they work pretty well, but a love potion isn't enough. That's why authors that use this usually also throw in a Harry-revulsion potion or Dumbledore-loyality potion as well.

Hermione's crush on Ron doesn't have anything to do with her irrational behaviour towards Harry. It makes zero sense that she dismisses him so completely and refuses to give him even a sliver of a benefit of the doubt. Her behaviour in regards to both the potion book and Draco is completely ludicrous. This is the girl who brewed polyjuice because she thought Draco could be the Heir of Slytherin and who willingly followed Harry into the Ministry trap... suddenly she won't even entertain the idea that Draco, someone whom she hates, might be up to something.

  The resistance of you thinking what you feel is real love when realizing it might just be a fabrication would be reeaaaalllly interesting also.

I agree.

  Eughh, having to put myself in the mindset of being romantically interested in Ron is just demeaning...ewww... I need to take a shower. Poor Hermione and evil authors.

Hehe yeah. It's really demeaning. I think it's pretty obvious in HBP that she's interested in Ron (even for an oblivious boy, and he's supposed to be attracted as well, no?! Doesn't she at one point say that she wanted to go to the Slug Club party with Ron?), so him snubbing Hermione for Lavender of all people is just intentionally hurtful or some kind of fucked up mind-game. I'd be so monumentally pissed if someone did that to me. Any romantic notions are dead at this point ;)
