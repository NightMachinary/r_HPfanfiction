lol yeah. Subverting that stupid plot point is a wonderful idea. I particularly hate the idea that Hermione would somehow feel threatened by Harry becoming better than her in a subject.

IMHO it makes a lot of sense to have conflict over that book, but it would be the other way around: Hermione wants access to the book, but Harry is somewhat reluctant to share. Maybe because he's a bit possessive about it or because *he* thinks that it is too dangerous.

I've pointed out multiple times in this subreddit that Hermione is obsessed with research and obscure knowledge. Why would she think that it is wrong to gain knowledge from a book?! Isn't that the entire point of learning?
