You rang?

Yeah I've read the fic (according to my files), but must have been ages ago because I don't remember much of anything.

I can really appreciate an author putting a lot of effort into writing Hermione out of that relationship in a sensible manner (and the examples you posted are pretty good), but for my taste Hermione from HBP is way too brain damaged and you'll have to gloss over a lot. I'd always want to retcon that somehow.

I don't really have a problem with some of the basic premises of the Romione romance: For some stupid reason Hermione becomes attracted to Ron and she starts acting a bit irrationally, that's fine. HBP just takes it way too far and, as Lenney points out, her being a weeping mess because Ron would rather snog Lavender instead of feeling incredibly insulted is just "WTF". In my version of HBP she'd recognize the unresolved sexual tension for what it is, probably initiate a short-lived sexual and very intense relationship with Ron where she does some stupid stuff (no Lavender) and then comes back to her senses and breaks up after the inevitable explosion.

I'd either want to avoid referencing HBP or I wouldn't want to burden myself with trying to make sense out of the mess that JKR left us with and have an AU 6th year in place. It's just too broken.
