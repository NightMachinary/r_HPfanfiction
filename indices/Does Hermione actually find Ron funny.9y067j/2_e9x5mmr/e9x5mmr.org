I am definitely in the minority when I say that I liked the slightly goofy Ron in the HBP movie a lot more than any of his book characterisations. If he has those tendencies it is a lot easier to overlook the many times he fucks up than if his character is entirely serious. Pretty much like how Barney Stinson would be a complete douche and not strangely endearing if he was written completely serious.
