I'd throw in my own "No longer alone", which has a strained friendship with Ron at the beginning because he and Hermione were at each other's throats all throughout year three and Harry got tired of the constant fighting. They patch things up for a while but the friendship will eventually fall apart over Harry becoming a Triwizard champion. There is one scene where a little shade is thrown at Molly however.
