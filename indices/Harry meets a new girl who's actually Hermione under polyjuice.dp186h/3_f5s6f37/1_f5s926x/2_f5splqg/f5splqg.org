I disagree on the rape by deception in that it's a person he doesn't know.

Hear me out.

If a dude polyjuices into another man and has sex with that man's wife, rape by deception. If a woman polyjuices into a man's wife and has sex with him, again rape by deception.

But if they don't know each other then how is it different from a woman wearing elaborate makeup, a wig and a push up bra?
