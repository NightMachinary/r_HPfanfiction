Hermione dies her hair, puts in colored contacts and says her name is Susan so she can low key hang out one night. If Harry meets “Susan” and decides to sleep with her, Hermione didn't commit rape imo. I'm not sure if that happened in the real world you could make a compelling argument that would get someone convicted.

Rape by deception imo is only possible when you trick the person into having sex with someone they would already normally sleep with like a spouse or partner.
