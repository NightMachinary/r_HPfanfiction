  Looking different than you normally do and meeting someone, then hooking up isn't rape. Your not convincing them you are someone they would normally have sex with.

Agreed, which indicates that you may have missed my point. Pretending to be someone else to convince someone who wouldn't normally have sex/a relationship with you to do so is very different from dressing or looking different than your usual.
