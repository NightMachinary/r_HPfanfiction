First of all, don't assume everyone gets your movie/book/whatever reference. I don't know what Revenge of the Nerds is or if what some Lewis did was or wasn't ok. From what I can guess, it probably wasn't.

Which leads to my second point. Do you feel that killing someone is rape? Is stealing something rape? I would say no, but your post pretty much equates "doing something wrong" with "rape". Don't be stupid.

Now, if you feel that this post is a touch biting, it might - just might - have something to do with the fact that you implied that I condone scummy behavior, up to and including rape. Just a thought.

So, to give you an answer, even though I don't believe you actually want one, no, I haf not heard of "rape by fraud" before. I just looked it up and found it to be an interesting but definitely complicated and delicate topic.

If you are naked and blindfolded on a bed and someone comes in that acts like they are your spouse, then yes, that could be seen as rape. If you are at a masquerade and sleep with someone that you believe to be your spouse without any sort of communication, however, it is not. That is you being an idiot.

Now, in this case, magic gets thrown into the mix, which makes everything more complicated. But, without having read, I would say it's the typical thing where the person you sleep with is not who they said they are. The thing where a character suddenly finds out that their love interests isn't actually rich but dirt poor or that they used to be a different gender or that they used to know them and but simply didn't recognize them. As such, I'd say it isn't rape.
