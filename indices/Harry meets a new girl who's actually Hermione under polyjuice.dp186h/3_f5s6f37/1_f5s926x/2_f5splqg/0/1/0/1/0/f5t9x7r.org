Great, you acknowledge that you had no concept of rape-by-fraud. It's good that you can admit ignorance, even if you have to be a condescending prick about it.

It's a shame that you have to add an extra five paragraphs in and around your response further demonstrating your ignorance, not to mention the obtuse abrasiveness that makes you such a warm and cuddly human being, but I suppose that's the nature of the internet. We just can't have nice things.

Is it carnal knowledge of another, without their consent?
