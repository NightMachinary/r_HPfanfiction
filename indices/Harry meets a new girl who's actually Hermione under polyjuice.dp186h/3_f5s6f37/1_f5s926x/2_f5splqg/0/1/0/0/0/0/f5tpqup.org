Ah I understand your assuming that they wouldn't normally have sex with you.

In the original example that started this, Hermione polyjuices herself to look different. It is never stated that she looks like Cho or anyone we know, so it could be assumed she took a hair from a random muggle as Harry did to attend Bill's wedding.

I also think it's plausible Harry would have sex with Hermione as herself. IMO It's only Hermione's hang ups that stop her from that, possibility thinking she isn't good enough for the chosen one.

Therefore in my assumed scenario, Hermione eventually comes clean and we get the sappy romantic comedy ending where Harry says, I always knew it was you Hermione and I figured you would tell me when you were ready...
