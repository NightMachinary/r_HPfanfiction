The issue you are having in this conversation is people other than you are separating the issues while you are combining them. The sex can be entirely consensual while the situation around it is hurtful. If I consented to have sex and it was with someone I wouldn't normally want sex with in a disguise, I wouldn't call the sex rape, but would call it deeply hurtful.

Getting sex by pretending to be a person the target is in a sexual relationship with would be rape by fraud, but sex I consented to with some random person who turns out to be someone I know isn't rape in my opinion, just hurtful in other ways.
