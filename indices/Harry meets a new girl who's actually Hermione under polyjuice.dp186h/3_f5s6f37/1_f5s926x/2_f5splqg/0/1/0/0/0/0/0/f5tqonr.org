It does seem that we were looking at this from completely different perspectives, which is probably silly since neither of us have read the fic in question. I'm seeing it as, "here's Hermione, someone Harry sees like a sister, going to great lengths to pretend to be someone else for the purpose of having a relationship with Harry." It's a huge breach of trust, massively deceptive, and - assuming it's a sexual relationship - rape by fraud. If one of my friends did something similar (assuming they could, lacking magic and all), I would feel violated - devastated, even.

It absolutely could be a rom-com trope, though, if Harry figured it out before they became intimate and went along willingly.
