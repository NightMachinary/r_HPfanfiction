#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter hated the attention his fame produced but when a worthy muggle charity can benefit from that fame, he reluctantly agrees to enter a bachelor's auction. Little did he suspect that Hermione has had her sights set on him for quite some time

This is the story's summary. I haven't read the story, so here's what my imagination cooked up:

1. Hermione has been attracted to Harry for a while. He's oblivious because Harry.
2. Instead of just being honest, forthright, etc., and asking him out on a date, she cooked up a scheme:

Hermione: Hey, Harry, thought about benefiting this muggle charity in their bachelor auction?

Harry: Sure, why not. Why are you brewing so much polyjuice?

Hermione: Oh, no reason /smirk/.

1. Hermione buys Harry while under polyjuice. Harry and fakedate hit it off, meet up multiple times. Harry starts to become invested in the relationship. Hermione is a deceitful ho.

2. Instead of her deceit destroying both their romantic relationship and their friendship, Harry probably forgives her because Harry.

Questions: Why is Harry Muggle-famous? Why is Hermione a sociopath?
