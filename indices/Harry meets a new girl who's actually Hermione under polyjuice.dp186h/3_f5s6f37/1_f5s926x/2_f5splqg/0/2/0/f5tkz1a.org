Making yourself look different (make up, cosmetic surgery, magical transformation), no. Deceptive, sure, but not rape.

Pretending to be an entirely different person, possibly - depending on circumstance. I'm not going to get into the intricacies of what circumstances would and wouldn't count, as they're literally endless.

Pretending to be an entirely different person to someone you know, who wouldn't normally have sex with you, and convincing them into a sexual relationship predicated on their belief that you're somebody other than who you are - yes. That would constitute rape-by-fraud.
