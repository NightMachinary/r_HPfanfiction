Except that “the seventh month” is quite problematic: seven months since when? Why January 1st? Are timeless magical entities that much concerned with the Gregorian calendar? What about seven months since the day the prophecy was made? What about the fact, that seven months is generally considered the shortest time the pregnancy must long for child to have chance of survival? Or what about seven months after the marriage, that would be tasty! [SELF-AD] I have worked with debunking The Prophecy in my story “Ginny on prophecies” linkao3(22663204). And yes, it is always useful to remind everybody that contrary to fanon, Dumbledore actually didn't believe in The Prophecy itself, but was forced to follow it by Tom.
