I love this and have also thought how cool this would be, but pregnancy is actually 40 weeks*, or if you are unlucky like me, 42 weeks. 9 months is just what they call it to make it easier to remember but it's more like 9.5 to 10 months.

Most likely Harry was conceived mid October. However I will grant that JKR was probably thinking this when she gave him that birthday (unless she just wanted him to have her birthday) because she is bad at counting and also because so few people realize “40 weeks is actually 10 months but two of those weeks are fake so it's really 38 weeks” because education about pregnancy leaves a lot to be desired.

/There is also funky and perhaps arbitrary week counting in the medical world. They judge a pregnancy by the date of your last period, which is wild, since people don't *typically/ ovulate until ~2 weeks later.

I will now leave and stop ruining all the fun haha.
