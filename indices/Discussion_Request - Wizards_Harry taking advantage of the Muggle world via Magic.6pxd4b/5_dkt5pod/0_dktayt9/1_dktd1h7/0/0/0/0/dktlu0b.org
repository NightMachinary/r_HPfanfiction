I can't see how conjuring anti-matter would be possible. I doubt wizards/witches are aware of the phenomenon, and the fact that antimatter has opposite charges as compared to normal matter. Even if the witch or wizard was aware of the mechanics of antimatter, do they have to simply visualize the material they wish to conjure, and additionally willing it to be anti-matter, or is such a thing not possible due to the fact they have never encountered it in the real world before, and thus do not have a full mental image or memory to hold it to?

It would be a great way to permanently fuck up your enemies though, if at massive cost to the environment and the planet's habitability.
