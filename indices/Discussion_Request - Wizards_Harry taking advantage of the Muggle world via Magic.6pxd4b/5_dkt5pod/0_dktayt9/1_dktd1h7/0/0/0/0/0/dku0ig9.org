  or is such a thing not possible due to the fact they have never encountered it in the real world before, and thus do not have a full mental image or memory to hold it to?

Well you are packing some interesting metaphysical assumptions into that statement. What does a Wizard experience when they encounter a stone or a rock? Sure, they can touch it and look at it, but does it really give them any deep meaningful understanding to conjure stone (some kind of deep knowledge about the essence of stone)? Do they even know which particular mineral or mix of minerals they are conjuring? Or is it just enough to think "stone" and you get some random thing that would qualify as a stone? They don't appear to be conjuring base elements but very abstract concepts.

Why then isn't it enough to think "anti-matter" (if you have a rough understanding what that is supposed to be... after reading a physics book your understanding of anti-matter is probably much better than the average wizard's understanding of 'stone') and get something that would reasonably qualify as anti-matter?
