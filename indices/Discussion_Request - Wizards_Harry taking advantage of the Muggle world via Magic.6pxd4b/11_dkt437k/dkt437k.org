I imagine the ICW and MoM/MACUSA have very strict rules and regulations to keep wizards from wantonly screwing with the muggle world. That would probably fall under the DMLE's Improper Use of Magic Office. I'm sure it happens, but any author would have to take into account that what their character is doing is:

1. Probably nothing new or creative, wizards have interacted with muggles for millennia and I'm sure more than one muggleborn wizard has tried to use magic for their own gain.

2. Gonna face serious obstacles from the government. The Ministry is a bureaucratic mess precisely because of how many rules and regulations it has to enforce to keep society under control.

Unless you're writing for humor/satirical purposes, I think it's kinda lazy not to create obstacles for protagonists when they obviously should exist.
