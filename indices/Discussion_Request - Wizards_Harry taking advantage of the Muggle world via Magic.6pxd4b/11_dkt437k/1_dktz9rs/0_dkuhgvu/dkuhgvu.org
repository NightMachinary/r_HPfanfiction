Oh yeah what I meant was that wizards doing business with muggles is nothing new or unique. By the time the Statute of Secrecy was implemented Muggles had a globe-spanning economic system, which wizards were almost definitely involved in. So there were likely extensive efforts to regulate the use of magic in business dealings with muggles afterwards.

Like you say it's hard to enforce, but that's why the MoM has such a bloated bureaucracy - it has to constantly track and regulate magical interactions with muggles to prevent exposure. Mistakes do happen and stuff probably does get overlooked. But you've still got teams working daily to keep an eye on stuff, which makes it difficult to get away with illegal business dealings in the long run. In the real world it's easy to make money off crimes but a lot harder to make that money look legitimate. I'd imagine the DMLE would be VERY suspicious if a muggleborn wizard with no known employment suddenly started cashing checks at Gringotts.

Actually that might be a fun fic idea. Maybe a series of oneshots about the DMLE section in charge of investigating financial crimes.

  In the Magical criminal justice system, financial crimes involving muggles are considered especially complicated. In the British Ministry of Magic, the dedicated wizards who investigate these crimes are members of an overworked squad known as the Business & Finance Unit. These are their stories.
