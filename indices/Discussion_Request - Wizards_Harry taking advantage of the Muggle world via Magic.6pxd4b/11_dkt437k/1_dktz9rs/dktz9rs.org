Ehhh, about the nothing new or creative... I doubt even a muggleborn wizard 200 years ago would think about duplicating rare earth metals to sell... Really, that isn't even screwing with the muggles, its a mutually beneficial trade, and its also one that would be pretty much impossible to track. Like remember when Morphin was accused of killing Tom Sr.? Along with the fact that Dumbledore or some other Order member pretty much says the Trace is crap and can't detect who does the magic, we pretty much know for a fact the gov. can't properly see who is doing what with magic. Assuming you're over 17 you don't even need to worry about doing the magic in a muggle area, since the trace won't activate.
