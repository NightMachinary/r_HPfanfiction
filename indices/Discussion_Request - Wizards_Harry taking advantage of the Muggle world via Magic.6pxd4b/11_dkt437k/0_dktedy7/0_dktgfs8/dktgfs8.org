Arthur is incompetent about muggle society for comic relief purposes by JK. Assuming everyone that works with policing magical interaction with muggles is that bad at their job is a bit much. The Statute of Secrecy would never work otherwise.

My personal headcanon is that Arthur was "kicked upstairs" to prevent him from getting into another department where he could disrupt the Purebloods agenda. His employees are much better at their jobs than he is.
