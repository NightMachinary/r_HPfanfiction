Well keep in mind that Muggle Studies at Hogwarts was not exactly all that great a class. In addition Britain has had more general struggles than some other countries in cannon due to an extra dark lord in recent history and so perhaps there has been little in the way of training and exploration of subjects that are not something that would be obviously useful in wartime or too/against a dark lord.

So I take it as more an example of the general incompetence in Britain due to the various issues PLUS the fact that the wizarding world is behind the times.

However I do enjoy your theory lol. And its quite believable.
