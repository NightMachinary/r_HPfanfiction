New headcanon; Arthur SHOULD be competent at handling muggle artifacts; he managed to get a car to work (and fly and turn invisible, but still), after all. And he wouldn't have gotten the job without doing decent in Muggle Studies at Hogwarts.

BUT, Arthur has a tendency to get personally involved in raids and confiscation of illegal goods, and when that happens people aren't above trying to hex him, see Mundungus Fletcher.

So at some point in the recent past, some wizard who wanted Arthur to forget that he had illegal muggle artifacts, tried to Obliviate Arthur; he fluffed it up a bit, resulting in Arthur having some memory trouble when it comes to muggles. Hence mucking up the word 'electricity' and wondering about the function of a rubber duck.
