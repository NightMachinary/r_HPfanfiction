Wizards casually memory charmed Muggles throughout the Series, and were never caught. I doubt the various Ministries would really care. After all, Oblivate and planting false memories were the cornerstone of maintaining the SoS.

For my suggestions, I don't think you even need the Imperiuse Curse, Confundus and false memories alone ought to be sufficient.
