You can open a businesses doing restoration work... How much does it cost to restore some old high quality furniture?? Or an old painting?? That's an easy business that someone like Lupin should have looked into.

Also, I doubt the Aurors can do anything unless it gets people attention, you can do it in your house an aparate to work, or had the working area warded.
