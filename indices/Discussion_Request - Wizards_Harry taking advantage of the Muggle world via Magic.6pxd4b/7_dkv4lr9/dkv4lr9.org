I'm somewhat disappointed that people in this thread have thus far been so modest with their suggestions. Imagine, just for a second, a wizard's potential to affect politics!

I don't mean things like confounding the Prime Minister---which the Ministry might find out about (though I will point out that Kingsley guarding Blair in HBP was implied to be a wartime measure, and I do recall a fanon suggestion about Grindelwald having used a confundus on Chamberlain in 1938). No, think smaller and smarter! For instance, suppose you are running for parliamentary seat. No matter how you campaign (though I guess a few discreet compulsions cast whilst going door-to-door cannot but help), all you need to do on election night is disillusion yourself amongst the vote counters and carefully modify just enough ballots to give you a comfortable majority of several hundred. Then, get to work on your parliamentary influence...

With the help of the occasional potion, confundus, memory charm, or even temporary imperius, you will soon develop a reputation as a /very persuasive/ backbencher, capable of swaying almost any vote for your party. Of course, it would not do to imperius the entire house and get them to vote unanimously---that would give the game away somewhat---but it shouldn't be difficult to sway enough of them to get a realistic majority whenever required. This influence in turn allows you to climb the party ladder, enter cabinet, and potentially become PM within a decade or so. If a scandal comes up (though why would it---see, the beauty of the thing is that you won't /need/ to use bribery, blackmail, or anything like that, when magical methods of "persuasion" are more than sufficient), the relevant enemies can be obliviated or else killed and transfigured into dead rats, thus rendered undiscoverable by muggle police.

Now, many may argue there are probably wizards monitoring for such behaviour in canon, but that's not what I see in the books. I understand that the normal peacetime protocol is for the Minister for Magic to talk to the PM annually, if not even more seldom, and it is only after Voldemort's return that magical protection is given to the highest echelons of the muggle government. I cannot see why wizards would react to a takeover as the one I described, if it is carried out slowly and carefully enough!
