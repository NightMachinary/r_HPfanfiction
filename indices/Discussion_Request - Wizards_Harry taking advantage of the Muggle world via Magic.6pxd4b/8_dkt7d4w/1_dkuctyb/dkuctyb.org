  We know, for example, that even covert assistance given to Muggles via magic can be prosecuted as breach of the Statute of Secrecy.

Do we? I don't recall any reference to the Statute being used for anything except, well, secrecy.

It's also worth nothing that the Statute is international law, with each ministry responsible for enforcing it in their own domain. The British MoM can prosecute whatever they want according to their own laws, but it technically wouldn't be under the Statute proper.
