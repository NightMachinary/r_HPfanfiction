  So the question is, what are peoples thoughts about using magic in the muggle world to take advantage of it in some way, and are there any Fics that explore this?

Legally, I think breach of the Statute of Secrecy could be used as a pretty catch-all, flexible offence (not unlike public order offences in England and Wales) that allows the Ministry to prosecute any use of magic on or around Muggles they consider illegitimate. Such flexibility is legally useful as of course you can never predict neatly all the possible categories of behaviour that you want to punish.

We know, for example, that even covert assistance given to Muggles via magic can be prosecuted as breach of the Statute of Secrecy.
