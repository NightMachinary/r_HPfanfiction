Eh, seems more like a plot for a HermionexDraco, than a HermionexHarry, at least if you are keeping canon friendships.

"Gold Digging" usually implies the initiation/maintenance of a relationship due to material (non-emotional) benefits. "Friends who decide to get married because it helps both their careers" or even just "Harry wants to help his friend achieve her vision and he can do that by marrying her" don't really fall into it, that is kinda a separate thing.
