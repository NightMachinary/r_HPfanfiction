I have no idea if the authors are lgbt but I'll link you a few good fics I have bookmarked. I especially recommend you the Harry/Voldemort fics I've linked. I know this isn't everyones fav. Pairing but i chose those fics for their goodd characterizations.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4340120]])

This is a Marvel crossover. Loki/Harry. Very focused on plot and a great relationship. Highly rec. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4148136]])

Not really as much plot. The focus is the relationships between the people but it's a great Wolfstar series as the individual persons are very well written. Linkao3(Howl by Shiftylinguini)

All of these are Novel length fics with either Draco ir Snape as a Mc/focus point

Time travel (Snarry) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3188624]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836032]]) Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/670548]]) This fic is called the boy who died a lot. I wasn't immediately hooked but after some time I got really into it. I laughed. I cried. Really good fic. Also this is Snape pov.

Sherlock x HP crossover Linkao3(1134255) Harry interacts a lot with Mycroft in this, less with Sherlock but it's one of my favorite Crossovers
