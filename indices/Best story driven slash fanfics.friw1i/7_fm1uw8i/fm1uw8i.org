Yule by budchick - HP/TMR

A Yuletide time travel TMR/HP with a credible emotional feel and plot. I like this Tom, and I believe in this Harry's reactions. Not at all melodramatic or slashy in the ficcish way; this has a more organic growth of empathy with a potential for a relationship rather than just sex. This is non-explicit and would be OK for non-shippers.

Harry Potter and the Sympathy of Souls by - MorticiaYouSpokeFrench - HP/TMR

An amusing take on how Harry overcame Voldemort and dealt with his horcruxes, with the aid of the Flamels. I love the sneaky Flamel trope so much, and the idea of Nicolas mentoring Harry really works for me.

credence barebone and the king of the faeries series by saltpans - Credence/Percival Graves

Lovely fairy-tale-ish fantastical magical detail; in part 2 Dumbledore is very in-character as well as uniquely powerful--well handled.

Part 1 king of the oak is complete, but author lost inspiration due to dislike of the second FB film (for very good reasons, IMO; I haven't watched that myself). Blessedly, the author gave a synopsis and a final snippet to round off the storyvline.

Thirteen Gifts by Lomonaaeren - Harry Potter/THeodore Nott

Oh, this is a lovely post-war courting story, and it was touching to read in the holidays.
