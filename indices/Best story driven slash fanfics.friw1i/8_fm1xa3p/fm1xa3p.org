A Bit of a Rest by gonergone - Harry Potter/Charlie Weasley

Last updated in April 2014, so while I would love more of this melancholy but comforting post-war story, I doubt I'll get it. Potentially Harry/Charlie but mostly gen till the end, so if you don't like the ship, you can still enjoy it. Unresolved past Harry/Ginny mentioned, but again, that's not the focus--Harry's healing is.

House Proud by astolat (who happens to be a bestselling fantasy author IRL, so this is well written)

I'm not a Harry/Draco fan (never have been), but I loved this one. Great details on the importance of tending to a wizard house.

Spellist by Esama - Harry Potter/Phil Coulson

Very interesting magical detail in this one-shot, 2400-word crossover with Marvel Movieverse

Reading In by wynnebat - Kingsley Shacklebolt/Percy Weasley

Short, but a sweet romantic story of two friends who become more.

A Snake Named Voldemort by estalita11 HP/LV

Love this one--the Dark Lord in this story is cranky and evil(ish). But it's also the sweetest Harrymort I've ever read that is still credible. And Dumbledore isn't evil--bonus!
