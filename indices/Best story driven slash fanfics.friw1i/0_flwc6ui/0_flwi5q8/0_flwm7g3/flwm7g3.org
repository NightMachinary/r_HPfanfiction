Right, here's some slash ones (M/M) that I've enjoyed because the writing is good and the story is not just smut or something like that.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/1110843][ô saisons, ô châteaux]] (series) - Regulus is a Ravenclaw, and takes place during the Marauders era. The story has slash pairings along with canon pairings, though main pairing is Regulus/OMC.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/1174661][TAB]] (series) - Harry finds out from Petunia that Snape is "that awful boy" and the story goes from there. Main pairing is Snape/Lupin.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1105713][October]] (series) - Series uses both MOD Harry and time travel mechanics, but it does a really good job of not falling into the worst tendencies of both tropes. Pairing for a time is Tom Riddle/HP, but then moves to other pairings (all non canon).
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/21709729/chapters/51783664][The Last Something That Meant Anything]] - Percy focused and a really good three shot . It's a mix of canon and non-canon events from Percy's perspective from pre-sorting to post-DH. Multi-pairings, but Oliver/Percy is a big one.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/16186133/chapters/37823456][Black Pride]] - Walburga Black saves Sirius from Azkaban, and the story goes from there. Pairing is Sirus/OMC.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][Face Death in the Hope]] - time travel shenanigans. Harry saves Regulus from the inferi, and both decide to kill Voldie. Takes place during 1st Wiz. War, with pairing being Reg/HP.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/18799003][Older Magic]] - a one-shot, but a great one. Takes place during Fantastic Beasts era, pairing is Percival Graves/Theseus Scamander.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/16586783][dear forgiveness, i saved a plate for you]] - Almost 30 years after Ariana's death, Dumbledore goes to therapy. Past Gellert/Dumble and Elphias Doge/Dumble.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413][Blackpool]] - A Sirus and Regulus centered story, I won't speak too much about it since it's one of the best stories to go in blind. background pairing is Sirius/Remus.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9571568/chapters/21642761][A Journey Home]] - a Percy/Oliver centered fic, takes place post-DH. They work together on a broom project, and shenanigans ensues.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/481516][Seeing]] - a Draco/Ron one-shot, and really well done. Takes place 10 year after DH.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/200820][Hand in Glove]] - Post DH (I think it's decent amount of time after) one shot, pairing is Goyle/Dudley.
- [[http://archiveofourown.org/series/681][Ben Folds's Series]], Percy/Oliver is the main pairing, but story is a very different take on DH, and the story continues from there.

Also recommend Second String, which another user linked. The pairing is Gideon Prewett/HP.

I probably have more, but this is a good place to start at least!
