[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13984608?view_full_work=true][Mount Unto the Stars]] is Snape/Lupin set amongst a mystery story. The relationship develops slowly and with character development. Some sex at the end but not very graphic. The mystery is entertaining too.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11002008][Breathings of the Heart]] - Snape/Lupin, one of my favorite Snupin fics and I have read a lot of them. Snape and Lupin are forced to live together to receive an inheritance from Dumbledore. Told entirely through letters and news articles.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8138437][It Was Just a Kiss]] is Sirius/Lupin while at school and is basically about each of them coming to terms with being attracted to boys. They are very confused and in denial at first but horniness wins out ðŸ˜›. Perhaps more porny than you'd like but the development of their feelings and their struggles with adapting to their sexualities feels very accurate.
