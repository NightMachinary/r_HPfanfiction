Albus/Gellert epistolary fic; bittersweet, but moving.

The Unexpected and the Transcendent by Someone_aka_Me

Charlie/Draco isn't a pairing I recall reading before, yet I find that I like them very much in this story. And they are both asexual in this.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14312001]]

Potential Gravity by zeitgeistic (faire_weather)

A post-war Harry/Draco that I can believe. (I'm not a Harry/Draco fan) I like the intense feels. yet it's not sentimental. I like this Draco, who finally gets fed up with Harry's ways and starts a new life in Lebanon. Nice magical detail for a story this length (35,000 words or so).

The Secret Language of Plants by Endrina

Many pairings, but they don't really matter much because the slash is mostly low-key, and the action is exciting once the war kicks off. It's very AU throughout, so prepare for surprises, and there is a fourth, diverse side to the war besides the Ministry, the Order, and Voldemort. I like that it's Gennish, whimsical and magical, and while nearly everyone is gay, it's somehow believable. I adore the epilogue.
