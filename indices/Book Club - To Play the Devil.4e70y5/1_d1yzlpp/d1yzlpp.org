I honestly can't decide what I think about this fic.

It's well written, the characters all seem to have their own distinct voices, but there is something about it that just seems off to me. I think it is Voldemort and Harry's skill levels? I'd think they'd both be better than they were, but I guess the apathy they were feeling was part of the point?

I don't know, I just honestly don't know.
