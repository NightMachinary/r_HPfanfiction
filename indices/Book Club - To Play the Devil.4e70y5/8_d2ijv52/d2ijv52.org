Just finished reading it. I liked the story. However, a few times I had to check to see if I had missed a bit where a new subplot jumps in without warning and then just disappears. In particular the side plot with the goblins hunting Harry. There wasn't much lead up as to why they were hunting him. I later realised they had been introduced briefly in an earlier chapter and then pretty much forgotten about for a bit until they became the focus of a couple of chapters. After a fight scene they are then pretty much forgotten about again. If the goblins were willing to enter a war in return for information on Harry's location, they would not just abandon their efforts of hunting him after a fight in Stuttgart, especially when they can still field several armies.
