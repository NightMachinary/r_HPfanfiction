It took a little while to get into it, initially I didn't like the whole premise, probably the idea that nearly everyone would be an OC put me off. I did find the pre-quest stuff in the first few chapters a little slow.

The main characters have mellowed fairly realistically, as you would expect over that time-span and I enjoyed their sparring. I thought that the story-line was reasonable and the writing was good. The pace accelerates as the story develops, so if you are finding the start slow, just read on.
