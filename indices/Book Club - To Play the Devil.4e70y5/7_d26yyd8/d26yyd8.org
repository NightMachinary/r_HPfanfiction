I liked the premise, I tolerated the plot, I hated the writing. The wordiness abated -- a bit -- in later chapters, but whether the author used 50 or 30 words (when they should have used ten) didn't make a difference. Their descriptions were contradictory -- not just between chapters, but between paragraphs. They were even worse at punctuation than I am. And I still don't really know what happened to the nemesis at the end, because I have no idea who “woke up in a field in northern France”.
