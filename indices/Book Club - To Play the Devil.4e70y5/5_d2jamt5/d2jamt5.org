I really rather liked it. It was different, I'd agree with Serenhime that it was somewhat strange. It was filled with too much description and a little bit slow, but those were its main faults.

The characters were likeable and a little amusing. They seem natural and are well written, the story as a whole is good. I don't know quite how to describe it, the immortal!Harry doesn't really seem to have kicked in yet (I guess because they're only reaching the end of natural wizarding lifespans). There are a lot of OCs, but oddly they don't detract from it.

I am new to the Book Club and I really look forward to seeing what you throw up next. :)
