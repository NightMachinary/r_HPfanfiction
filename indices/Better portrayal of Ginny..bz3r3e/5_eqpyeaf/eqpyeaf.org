I like Ginny's portrayal a lot in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185). I find this version of her a great example in character development, considering the new circumstances and her own experiences. And yet, she's still very much recognizable as canon Ginny (post GOF).

Unfortunately, this fic is on hiatus in its final story arc. The author has assured me that Ginny will play a decisive role there.
