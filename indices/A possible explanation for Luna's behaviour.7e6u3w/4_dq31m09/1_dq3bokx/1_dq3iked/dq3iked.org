I'll be honest, I have never made it past the first chapter of the harry-had-a-twin stories that seem to be everywhere. I just don't get the appeal.

Harry is already a reader insert, so if you want to play with his personality it isn't hard. Neville is already set up nicely if you want to have someone else be the prophicized one.. I guess using Neville messes with the whole reason that Harry was at the Dursleys, but that only matters if you are playing Dumbles as real cold blooded..m
