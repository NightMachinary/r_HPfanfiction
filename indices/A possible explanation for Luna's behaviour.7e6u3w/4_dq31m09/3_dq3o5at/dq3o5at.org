I don't remember it very well, but I think this one has an interesting take on Luna. Similar to what you describe IIRC. I remember I really liked that fic when I read it, but not much more, unfortunately (except for the fact that it was pretty dangerous to be close to her in this one), so I could be mistaken but I'm pretty sure the Luna I think of is in this one.
