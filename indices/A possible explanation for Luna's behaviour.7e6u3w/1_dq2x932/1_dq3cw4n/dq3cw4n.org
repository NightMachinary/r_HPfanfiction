The argument is stupid though. The reason people believe in dragons is because they're documented to be seen by many wizards in the Harry Potter series and the reason muggles don't believe in them is because they're being actively hidden and knowledge of them is destroyed.

Besides, the same argument could be used for the existence of literally anything at all that you can come up with, which should show you it's not that great.
