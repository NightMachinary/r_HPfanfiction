Your second point stands, but Luna's reasoning /is/ that people are hiding the existence of the creatures. For instance, we know she believes Heliopaths are Minister Fudge's "secret army", so /of course/ he'd cover up their existence up. Which isn't that hard to do in the wizarding world when you think about it, as long as there aren't too many specimens. Put up protective enchantments on the areas they are known to inhabitate, tag them with some sort of Disillusionment Charm if necessary, and if worst comes to worst Obliviate witnesses. Heck, Canon has Slytherin hide a freaking Basilisk under the Hogwarts Professors' very nose for a thousand years, and Hagrid apparently cover up an /entire Acromantula colony/'s existence for fifty years.
