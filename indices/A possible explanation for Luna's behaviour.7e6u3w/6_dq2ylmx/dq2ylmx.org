I think Luna was damaged mentally when her mother died. Her father was not much better off though, and they were kind feeding off each other.

She was lucky to meet Harry, who at least accepted her and gave her a chance, although Harry still laughed at her and didn't take her imaginary animals seriously at all.

We know later that she was a very powerful witch, able to conjure Patronus when the Trio had failed. If the dark side was able to recruit her, we would have a second Bellatrix Lestrange right here, or worse.
