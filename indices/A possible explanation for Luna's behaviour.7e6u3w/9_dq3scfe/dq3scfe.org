The fan theory that I find the most credible is that Luna has schizotypal personality disorder. She fits almost all of the symptoms to some degree: eccentric appearance and behavior, odd beliefs, paranoid ideas, unusual perceptual experiences, and odd speech and thought patterns. The one thing that really doesn't fit is being socially withdrawn (which she is, but not by choice), but there's enough variation that it could still be plausible.
