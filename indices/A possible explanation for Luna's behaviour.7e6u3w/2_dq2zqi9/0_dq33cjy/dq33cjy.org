I totally agree, I've always thought she was so in tune with nature and magic she could see and believe what others couldn't and everyone else was almost muggle like compared to her. All the greatest witches and wizards were deemed crazy until they proved others wrong.

Luna is the new Newt (and coincidently married his grandson).
