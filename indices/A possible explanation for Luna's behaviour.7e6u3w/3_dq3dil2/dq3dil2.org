While it's possible that Luna's behavior is akin to a very religious girl, I'm not sure it fits.

It think it's helpful to actually look at canon--and that means the books, not the films--and what we see from Luna.

Luna goes on and on about various creatures, but the only ones she ever thinks may be in the same room she's in are Wrackspurts and Nargles.

She describes Wrackspurts as invisible creatures that burrow into ears and make minds go fuzzy.

Nargles are described as infesting mistletoe. And, in the books, she does not describe them as capable of theft.

So, let's assume that Nargles and Wrackspurts are unknown insects or arachnids of some sort. And that Wrackspurts can cause disorientation and confusion.

In a world where Billywigs--three inch long, electric-blue wasps that cause levitation when a victim is stung--Nargles and Wrackspurts sound completely plausible.

Elsewhere, Luna describes the Rot-Fang Conspiracy, heliopaths, Fudge's assassination of goblins.

The Rot-Fang Conspiracy is most likely bogus, but there's very likely a level of corruption in the Auror Department. Auror Dawlish is mentioned as having been sent by the Voldemort Ministry to arrest Augusta Longbottom.

Heliopaths are described as "great spirits of fire" that "gallop and consume everything in their path."

Now, I don't think heliopaths are real, even in the Harry Potter Universe, but it's not out of the question. But more likely, it's possible that someone saw Ministry officials trying to control Fiendfyre and used "heliopaths" as a cover.

Most often, we see Luna get angry when Hermione dismisses the descriptions. It's also worth mentioning that Hermione has a tendency to sound extremely smug and self-righteous about it.

Luna gets offended because not just because she thinks these things are real. Multiple eye-witnesses discussed these things with her father. Quite possibly when Luna was in the room. Luna believed the eye-witnesseses. She takes them at their word. An attack on her father, saying that the /Quibbler/ is full of "rubbish" is an attack on people who saw these things they can barely explain.

Luna is honest. She believes in honesty. She also has a habit of commenting on embarrassing truths.

I think it's worth noting that she's introduced in /Order of the Phoenix./ When very few people were willing to take Harry at his word, Luna is.

Luna is not delusional. She is not insane. She is not schizophrenic. +She is not quirky.+ She is not a seer. She is honest.

Edit: Okay, maybe Luna can be called quirky. But she isn't a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.
