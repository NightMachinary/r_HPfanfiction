Sombody posted in a thread the other day about synesthesia. What if Luna's father has synesthesia and is also your average run of the mill conspiracy theorist. Luna, who inherited her fathers condition also sees these creatures as a result of the synesthesia, and it's presenting as a magical form of a muggle condition. That, alongside being raised by a conspiracy theorist coupled with probable ptsd from the death of her mother results in the personality she displays.

So basically magical synesthesia + conspiracy theorist beliefs + ptsd coping mechanism = Luna Lovegood.

That's my take on it anyway.
