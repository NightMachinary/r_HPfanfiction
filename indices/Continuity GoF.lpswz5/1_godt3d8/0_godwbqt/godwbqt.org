That's right, I forgot Black didn't know either, but I'm fairly certain if Snape or someone brandished it under his nose in an attempt to prove the Dark Lord's return, he would have understood the significance. Thank you for reminding me and validating how I was handling the Mark in my fic. My headcanon is the Mark looks quite a bit cooler than it's depicted in the movies. I've seen lots of tattoos featuring skulls and/or snakes that were a lot less... disappointing than how the movies showed.
