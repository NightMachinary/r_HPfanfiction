I don't think Quirellemort knew about Dumbledore trick before being in front of the mirror (and even there I'm not sur he really understood how to get the stone). He would clearly not have the time to do a round trip just to capture a student.

The mirror also need to find someone that /want/ the stone without wanting to /use/ it. Something that would probably be a bit hard to find in the school (though this point is probably up to the author).
