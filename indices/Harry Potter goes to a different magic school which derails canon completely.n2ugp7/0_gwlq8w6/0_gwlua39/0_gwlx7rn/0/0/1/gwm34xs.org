Kidnapping a student doesn't guarantee him getting the stone. You have to want to find the stone, but not use it. Voldemort doesn't know that and a student isn't going to want to find the stone for a person that kidnapped them. If we're going with logic, Dumbledore would have safeguarded against the Imperius, too.

Harry is immediately tied up and disarmed. Quirrell continued to stand in front of the mirror inspecting it.

But I simply said Voldemort doesn't get the stone. It was your idea that he would stick around to kidnap a student.

Edit: Quirrell also had at least a 30 minute headstart and was still inspecting the mirror when Harry got there
