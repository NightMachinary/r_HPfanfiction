Randomly kidnapping a student would alert Dumbledore, which, besides death, was the 1 thing Voldemort did his best to avoid. We know Dumbledore guessed what Quirrell was up to, but I'm almost certain they thought they'd bested Dumbledore and, in a way, they did.

But, also, Dumbledore returned to Hogwarts without prompting from anyone else. So he finds Quirrell standing in front of the mirror and Voldemort flees like he did before.
