This is my version of events:

Let's see what could happen if Harry is completely MIA:

Year 1

- Nobody got into that duel with Draco, so no alienation with Hermione, no finding out about Fluffy
- Nobody got into that fight with the Troll, so Hermione was either killed or she didn't cry in that loo because of the above point. Anyway, no Trio.
- No hint about Fluffy, no Hermione doing research, no Hermione pushing them on studying, no hint from Hagrid about Flamel
- Finally, Quirrellmort got stuck in front of the Mirror and was neutralized by Dumbledore. Voldemort ceased to be a threat for a very very long time.

Year 2

- Lucius still planted the Diary on Ginny, but she broke free sometime in November and dumped it in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom.
- Since there was no Harry chatting up Moaning Myrtle, it was not found again for years, or even decades.
- The CoS plot came to an abrupt halt, and nobody had a clue about what had happened.

Year 3

- Weasleys still went to Egypt, took that picture, and Sirius broke out.
- Sirius successfully killed Wormtail at Hogwarts and went on the run.

Year 4

- Since both Voldemort and Wormtail had been neutralized, Bertha Jorkins was fine, and there was no sabotage attempt at TWT.
- Barty Jr broke free from his father's Imperius Curse during the Quidditch World Cup and went on the run.

After all that, two characters should drive the plot forward:

- Sirius who wanted to exonerate himself and find Harry
- Barty Jr who wanted to find his Lord and free his comrades from Azkaban
