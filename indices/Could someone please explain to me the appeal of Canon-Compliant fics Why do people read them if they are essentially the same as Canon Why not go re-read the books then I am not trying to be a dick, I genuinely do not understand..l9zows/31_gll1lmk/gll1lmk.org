for the simple pleasure of lazy reading. Sometimes authors add complex word building and change details about characters, events, places for no reason other than to be different. The changes hold no plot relevance and often the author forgets the changes and it leaves a lot of holes and gaps in the story. It especially helps when reading multiple fics that are all slowly being updated. Needlessly changing details can make it difficult to remember when updates are all a month apart. That being said no author will ever win because some will scream that isn't canon and others will yell the story is just a repeat of canon.
