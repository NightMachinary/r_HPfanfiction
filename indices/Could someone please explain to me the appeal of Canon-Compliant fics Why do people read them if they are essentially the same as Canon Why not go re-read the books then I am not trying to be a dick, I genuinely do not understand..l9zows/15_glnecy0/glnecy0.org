Canon compliant doesn't necessarily mean /just like/ canon. Think of it more as /doesn't contradict/ canon.

I can have stories about minor characters that canon didn't tell us much about, explore events that canon says happened but that we didn't actually see, take the story further than canon does while still being able to square what I've read with the books.

I enjoy the world, I would like to explore it further...canon compliant fics allow me to do that.

I love a good AU too, but AUs scratch a different itch as both a writer and a reader.
