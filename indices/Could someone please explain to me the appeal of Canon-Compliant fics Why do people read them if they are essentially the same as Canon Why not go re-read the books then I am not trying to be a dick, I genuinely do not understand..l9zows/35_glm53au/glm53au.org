Think of it like a time line. You have the major plot events that have huge turning points, but you also have the time jumps that we know that nothing important happened. A Plot-Compliant fic can take place in those instances, but still have the major plot points happen throughout the fic. Who knows, maybe there were some weird couples that we didn't get to know about, let's all admit it, Harry was oblivious as fuck.

i just really like if the authors go into depth about what could have been going on behind the scenes. ill find the link to my favourite story and put it here
