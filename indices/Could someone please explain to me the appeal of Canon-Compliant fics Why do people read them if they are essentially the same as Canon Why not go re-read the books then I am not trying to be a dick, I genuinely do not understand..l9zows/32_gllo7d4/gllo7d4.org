Canon-compliant does not mean "it's just canon in different words", or with some minor difference like Harry being female (the latter is, in fact, the opposite of what canon compliant means). It basically just means that the fic doesn't contradict established canon. Quite often, it means whatever happens in the fic can be placed in-between the lines of canon - "missing scenes", pre-canon events that are never shown but might have been talked about, et cetera.

A canon-compliant fic could also be written from an entirely different perspective - thus showing a side of the story that you don't get purely from canon.\\
Not From Others, for example, shows the perspective of Ginny Weasley while Harry's off Horcrux hunting and Hogwarts is under Death Eater reign. It's one of my favourite "canon expansion" fics. linkffn(11419408)

Other examples might be fics that explore the nineteen years between the end of the Wizarding War and the epilogue, or a one-shot prompted by Cursed Child where Harry plays Exploding Snap with Ginny.
