I do not really like the kind of story that re-hashes Canon. It's sadly really common with 'let's change something up' fics - especially in the first years for at least the beginning, nothing much is changing expect details and maybe the inner dialogue of the characters.

Most Canon compliant fics actually avoid that trap, because they won't need to repeat Canon. Instead, they focus on a different perspective, or narrow the time frame, or fill the blind spots in Canon. I'd be hard pressed to remember a Canon compliant fic that goes over the first Diagon Alley shopping experience step by meticulous step like so many AU or For want of a nail' fic do.
