Well, someone can do different things from outside canon and still be canon compliant. For instance, it is canon Hermione writes long letters to Krum. As the /content/ of those letters is never shown in canon, you can make a fic consisting entirely of letters to and from and it would be totally canon-compliant, while showing a interesting perspective on canon that we don't get to see canonically. Like, does Hermione just /mention/ what happened, or leave it out, or even ask for help? And what does she /think/ of them?

Where it /wouldn't/ be canoncompliant would be if Krum and Hermione fell in love, *unless* that relationship for whatever reason stopped and she got with Ron - as per canon.

And now I need that fic.
