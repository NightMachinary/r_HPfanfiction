Well, there are various types of 'canon-compliant'. Mainly:

1. Everything is as canon. That one is nice if you want to explore something that isn't shown - people already mentioned it, but stuff from other eras (i.e. Marauder's, Grindelwald War, Post-canon shenanigans)
2. Everything but plot of the story is canon (with maybe some possible expansion on things that we're not shown that falls in line with what canon is). Which is, IMO the best way to write fics with some point of divergence, like 'what if Harry was adopted by X' or 'what if Harry got into Y thing and it changed his views/personality/relationships'.\\
   Because it's not fun to read some sort of work where the premise is, say "Grindelwald won, what's next?" and then to find out that suddenly Harry is a condescending, indy prick with locked magical core that befriends the Goblin nation to inherit 10 different titles and beats Dumbledore with the power of arithmantic equations that cause nuclear explosions.
