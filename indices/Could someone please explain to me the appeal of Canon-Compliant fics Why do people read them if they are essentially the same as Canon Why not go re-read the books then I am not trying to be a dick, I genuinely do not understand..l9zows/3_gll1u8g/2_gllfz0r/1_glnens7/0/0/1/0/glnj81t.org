Atheist? What a bizarre accusation. Are you saying that your prejudice against dozens of people whom you know nothing about, whom canon didn't even /name/, is based on your religion? It's definitely not compatible with the three big Abrahamic religions, nor Buddhism, and despite my very limited familiarity with Hinduism I'm pretty sure it doesn't condone that attitude toward total strangers either. Can you enlighten me on what you believe?
