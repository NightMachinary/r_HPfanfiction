It really did change the way I look at canon. For example, Dumbledore giving out all those points in first year /while the Hall was already decorated in Slytherin colours/, pulling the rug out from under every child in that house? Jerk move, old man. Give points, sure, enough to win the Cup, ok, but don't use it to humiliate kids who have done nothing wrong.
