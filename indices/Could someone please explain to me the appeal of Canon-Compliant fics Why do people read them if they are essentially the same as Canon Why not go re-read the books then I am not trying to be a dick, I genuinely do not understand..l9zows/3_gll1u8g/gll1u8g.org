Canon-compliant doesn't mean they just rehash. It usually means that they cover a different time period and/or a different point of view. Like linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh), a slice-of-life fic showing Harry and Ginny moving into a new neighbourhood when James is five, or linkffn(The Snape Chronicles), depicting Severus Snape's whole life (with canon being only a relatively small segment) and giving his perspective, or linkffn(A Call To Arms), following Ginny throughout the events of Deathly Hallows. The appeal is to directly expand the canon world, thinking about what could have happened off-screen.
