Nothing I said was rude. It is a fact that it is much more difficult to come up with a plotline that is all your own, just like it is much more difficult to write original fiction than it is to write fanfiction.

Downvotes don't change the reality of what I said. It's really safe and comfortable to cling to canon, because your readers all already know the outline of your fic, so a lot of the work is done for you, and therefore authors can get away with not having to think up creative or original ideas.

It doesn't mean I think they suck, or that they're bad writers. Hell, I've had fun reading some canon-compliant fics. Still doesn't disprove what I said.
