  Nothing I said was rude.

I'm pretty sure it was, actually. As your explanation for canon-compliance being popular was "coming up with your own story is hard, so people prefer to just rewrite," you implicitly dismissed the hard work and tears of authors who may put a huge amount of effort into a highly original storyline that happens to not contradict canon.

If you'd clarified that that's just one reason among many for writing canon-compliant fics, that probably would have been fine.
