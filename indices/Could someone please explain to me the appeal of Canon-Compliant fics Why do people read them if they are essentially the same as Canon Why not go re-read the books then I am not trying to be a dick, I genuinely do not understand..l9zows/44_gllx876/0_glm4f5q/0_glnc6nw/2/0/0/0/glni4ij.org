When I think of canon-compliant, I think "Harry's first year he gets on the quidditch team, saves the sorcerer's stone. Harry's second year, Dobby shows up and the basilisk petrifies people and he has to rescue Ginny from the Chamber, etc etc."

I would say that HP adventures as a postwar auror are definitely AU, unless you have him as a bad father who lets war criminals slide like we see in the epilogue - because other than the characters, nothing in that fic would have anything to do with canon. Conversely, if you have a mystery that, idk, Draco is solving while Harry/Hermione/Ron are working to save Buckbeak and Sirius in the background, that's what I think of as canon-compliant.

Guess it's just different definitions. To me, what you call canon-compliant sounds more like just "fanfiction" in general. I'm not sure which of our definitions OP was referring to, but given that he mentioned re-reading the books, I suspect it is mine. edited to remove an apostrophe.
