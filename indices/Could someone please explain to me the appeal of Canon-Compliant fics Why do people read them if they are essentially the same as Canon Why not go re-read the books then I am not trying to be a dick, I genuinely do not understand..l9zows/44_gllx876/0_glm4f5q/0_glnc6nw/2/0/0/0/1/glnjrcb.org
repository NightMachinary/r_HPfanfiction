Then that is your, quite narrow, definition of canon compliant, though I would argue that you can still be very creative with alternate points of view and missing moments during Hogwarts years - I have a whole series of missing Hogwarts moments and some of them include pieces that I feel I was at my most creative and most hardworking with ([[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/1407286]]). When it comes to post-Hogwarts, or scenes away from Hogwarts, like what was happening at Hogwarts during DH, or how Percy is bringing down the Ministry from the inside (also.stories I wrote!), a canon compliant author still has to abide by certain established "facts" like end game ships and occupations of characters, while also keeping the characters both convincingly in character but also convincingly impacted by their canon experiences. You might not like the epilogue, but that's canon, so the canon compliant author that fills in the years between must creatively and convincingly bear it in mind. Slap an AU tag on there and you can get away with a lot more - you can pair them with whoever you like, you can get rid of plot obstacles, you can make the characters more hardworking or intelligent to advance the plot, etc.

I'm sorry if you were offended by me saying your statement was rude, but I think it is important to understand that fanfic authors of all genres pour a lot of creativity and hardwork into what they do. You don't have to like canon compliant stories, and I completely see the argument for wanting to read something different, but suggestions that authors are lazy or that it is less creative is naturally going to get people's hackles up. AU stories aren't my thing but I still have a lot.of respect for the authors that question how changes would shift things, or bring entirely new concepts and characters into the mix.
