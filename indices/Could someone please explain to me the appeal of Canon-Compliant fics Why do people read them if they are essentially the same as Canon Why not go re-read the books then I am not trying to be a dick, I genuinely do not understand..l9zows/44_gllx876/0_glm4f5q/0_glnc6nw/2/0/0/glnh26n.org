That's not what canon compliant is - you're not tweaking anything. You're taking the characters, world and existing plot and working without changing any of that to create a new story or something more in depth. This can include an entirely new set of circumstances- for example, i write canon compliant Auror mysteries for Harry to work on. In some ways this can be harder - it is tempting to change the existing world building or character portrayal to suit your plot needs, but then that wouldn't be canon compliant. It's a different kind of story writing, and comes with it's own benefits and challenges, just like AU does.
