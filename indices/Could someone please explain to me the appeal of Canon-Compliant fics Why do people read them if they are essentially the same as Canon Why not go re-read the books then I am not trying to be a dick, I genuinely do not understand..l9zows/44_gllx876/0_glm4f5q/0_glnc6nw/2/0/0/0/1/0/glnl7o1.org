I wasn't offended. The word 'lazy' never appeared in any of my remarks. You read what I wrote and got defensive.

And given that I already said I write fics, it's safe to say I understand how much energy and effort that it takes. I also understand how to accept that not everyone will enjoy my plots or think that they are creative. Somehow, I still manage to continue writing without having my ego destroyed. Have a good day.
