I don't understand what you're arguing with me about. My position is that taking a story that all of your readers know (HP Canon), and tweaking one or two things or exploring a different character's mindset is less creative and easier than coming up with a new set of circumstances for characters to grapple with. Writing outside the warm embrace of canon is just flat out more difficult to do, which of course means that there will be a lot of bad stories that don't succeed - my own certainly can be counted among their ranks.

What's the issue? If someone walked up and said "Gosh, it's a lot harder to worldbuild and create characters in original fiction than it is to write fanfics!" would you get upset and think they were rude?
