I came up with several post hogwarts mystery plots of my own and it was canon compliant - it's taking canon characters and "history" of the world and building from there. It's pretty rude to suggest that it's impossible to come up with creative or original ideas. Of course there are some that don't, but I'm sure you would agree that plenty of AU writers don't either - how many times have people written Harry inheriting titles, going shopping for a magical trunk and realising Dumbledore is evil?
