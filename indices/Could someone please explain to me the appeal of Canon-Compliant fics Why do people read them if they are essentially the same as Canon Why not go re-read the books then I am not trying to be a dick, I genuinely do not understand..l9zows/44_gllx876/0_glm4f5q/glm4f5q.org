That's pretty rude - there are lots of AU authors who just follow the same plot but with different pairings or Harry randomly has a sister or something, just as there are lots of canon compliant authors who take the time to create a complex plot or put a lot of effort into.in-depth character exploration. Lazy authors don't just sit in one particular genre.
