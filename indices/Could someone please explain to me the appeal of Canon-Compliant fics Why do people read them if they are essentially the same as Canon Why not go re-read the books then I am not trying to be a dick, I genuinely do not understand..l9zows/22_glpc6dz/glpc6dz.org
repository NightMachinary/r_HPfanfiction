For me, there is so much that we didnt see in the books because they were from Harry's point of view, so its fun to wonder what Luna gets up to in the castle (she obv visits the Grey Lady). Does Neville spend time in the greenhouses? What do the rest of Gryffindor do when Harry and Co are at Quidditch practice? A huge void that JKR left to our imaginations!
