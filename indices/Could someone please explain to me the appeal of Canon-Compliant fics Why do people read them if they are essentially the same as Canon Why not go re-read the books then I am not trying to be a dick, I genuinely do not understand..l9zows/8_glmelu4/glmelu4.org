The biggest problem I am seeing in this thread is that a lot of people seem to think "Canon Compliant" means, hey, I'm going to tell the same exact OG HP stories and bore you to tears. OR, look, here's HP and the Philosopher's Stone where NOTHING changes except Harry is blind (this is NOT canon compliance. Harry, while visually challenged, never goes blind in JKR's version of events). Neither of these things are a true definition of canon compliance. All that canon compliance means is that you can read this fic and the details will be consistent with the lore and world as presented by JKR. That's all. Harry gets with Ginny, Voldemort dies, and all that good stuff fans are familiar with.

BUT, oh ho ho, the fun part of canon compliance is that there is SO much world and SO many stories that can be told, and get told they do, in insanely creative ways. The founder's era, marauder's era, post the second war, and all the parts in between are fair game. So are the original stories. Did you like Prisoner of Azkaban but really would have rather seen it play out from Sirius's POV? There's a canon compliant story for that. Did you wonder what the fuck Charlie was doing in Romania while everyone else was attending Hogwarts classes? Canon compliant story. What does a day in the life of Arthur Weasley at The Ministry look like? Canon compliant story. Think of them more as untold stories in the world you are already familiar with.

But whaaaaaaa I already know how it will end, what fun is that, this is BS, whaaaaaa. Ok, if you pick up a canon compliant story told from Harry's POV, then yeah, he's going to end up with Ginny and become an Auror and you know that part of the story. Some people love that, some people don't. You choose what you want to read. BUT so much of canon compliant stories have nothing whatsoever to do with the trio or most of the main characters, because, they tell different stories about different characters who may or may not have been involved in the events from the books, and there are SO many good stores like this. I love how the canon compliant stories that are well written will make you read the books again and be like holy shit all of this other stuff was totally happening at the same time, to the point that you forget that it was a fan fic and not a "real" part of the lore. You'll suddenly have this entire backstory in your head for all the side characters that adds so much depth to the real world.

Basically, if you like untold stories, look more into canon compliant tales. If you're thing is more what if?, then AU is your cup of tea. I like it all. I don't care if I know how some parts will play out, I want to see the journey. Some of the most complex plots I have found are canon compliant stories that weave into the OG stories. They are all the adventure, characters, and world expansion you get from reading between the lines.
