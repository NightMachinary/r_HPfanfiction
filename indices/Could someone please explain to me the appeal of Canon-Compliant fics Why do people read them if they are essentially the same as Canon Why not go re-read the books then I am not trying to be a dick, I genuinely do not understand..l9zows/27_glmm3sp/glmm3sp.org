I like reading stories about side characters who do not get a lot of narrative focus in the original work, and imagining what they might have been doing behind the scenes while Harry and co. were off fighting evil and having epic, grand adventures. If the setting is changed too significantly in these sorts of stories it no longer feels like I'm reading anything related to the original media anymore so I'd rather read something else.
