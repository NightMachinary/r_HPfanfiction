It's basically a look at this different perspective.

Like Neville in Deathly Hallows.

We see him stand up to the death eaters in part, telling them "Hey losers, he isn't here." In the train.

It tells us that, he's gotten confident and he's stepping up.

Also in part 2 we see him on the hog's head with scratches and bruises on his face, when the trio commented he said "Like hell I'd reckon, this is nothing Seamus is worse."

He's not phased by pain, he's used to it at that point.

And when he explains he says this "Today's dark arts lesson we practice the cruciatus curse, on first years, I refused."

This is where Fanfics come in, How did the rest of the students cope? How did they react to the news that they're doing dark arts, on first years no less?

It allows the author to follow a side character (Neville, in this case) to cover something because the main characters (Harry, Hermione and Ron) are busy doing canon stuff.

It can explain small stuff like how Hannah Abbot married Neville, did Hannah have a crush on him before he realised? Did Luna know and turn down Neville after the battle?

Small things like those that somewhat explains canon stuff that seemed random or maybe just take it into another direction.

Idk I spent too much time on this, so sorry for grammar.
