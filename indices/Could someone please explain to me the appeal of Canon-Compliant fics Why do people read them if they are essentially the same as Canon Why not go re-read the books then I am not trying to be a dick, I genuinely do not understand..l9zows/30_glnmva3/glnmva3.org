It's funny, I have the exact opposite. I only read and write canon-compliant stuff. I think it's because being creative while sticking to canon is a very fun challenge, both writing from the MCs and from side characters perspectives. It's like: you've got this very rigid box of rules and you still have to find out a way to tell something new (as many people have pointed out, retelling the story is mostly not the point, here). As a writer, I find that it's a fun game. As a reader, I'm in awe of other's ability to master this exercise.

For AUs, as a reader, I mostly wonder what's the point? Like: What if James and lily had lived? Well, the story's kind of done, then, isn't it? What if Harry was in slytherin? Well, but then you're changing his entire personality, why? I've read some /really/ good AUs but i find that the quality has to be stellar for me to really see the point of them. Generally, I find canon better. As a writer, if it's to write a completely different story with different characters, I'd rather write my own stuff.

I hope this helps :).
