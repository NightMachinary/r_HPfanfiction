I don't recall Hermione doing something similar. Are you referring to altering her parents' memories, which was much more drastic and was certainly ethically questionable but was intended to save their lives?

As for there being no bickering between them in the epilogue - first, I didn't say that the bickering dynamic doesn't work for some people, just that I don't get it. And second, they do in fact continue it in the epilogue.
