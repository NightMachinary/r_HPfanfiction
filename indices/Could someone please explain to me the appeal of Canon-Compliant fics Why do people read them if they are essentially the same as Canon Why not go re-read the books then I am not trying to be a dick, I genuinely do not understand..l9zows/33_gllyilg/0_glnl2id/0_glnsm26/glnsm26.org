People are way too harsh about the confunded thing, didn't Hermione do the exact same thing and literally nobody cared. You're acting like it's assault. I still think their relationship is one of the best and their bickering was really never as bad as everyone makes it out to be. After all if we're using the five page epilogue to judge their relationship then shouldn't that mean their marriage is going well since there is no bickering? I've seen plenty of canon compliant fics where their relationship is great.
