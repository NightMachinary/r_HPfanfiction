Can't say I'm a big fan of Ron/Hermione, actually. Nineteen years later, he's still lying to her to cover how he tampered with someone's mind in order to successfully cheat on a test. I never did grok the "bickering because they love each other" dynamic, but in some stories I can see it; that, however, goes well beyond just needling each other.

I've seen Ron/Hermione work well in some AUs, though.
