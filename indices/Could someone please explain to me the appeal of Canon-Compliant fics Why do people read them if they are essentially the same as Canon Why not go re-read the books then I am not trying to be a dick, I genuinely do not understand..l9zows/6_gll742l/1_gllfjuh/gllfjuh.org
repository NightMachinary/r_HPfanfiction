Absolutely this, only I write canon-compliant Marauders-era fics. There is so much scope for OCs, original plots etc whilst still writing beloved characters and Hogwarts, and keeping it canon-compliant just gives a bare bones structure from the few people and events that were mentioned in canon.

I enjoy reading AUs when done well, but canon-compliant fics also add to my headcanon rather than just being an alternative what-if.
