On the flip side, there's writers like me who write exclusively canon divergent stories. Sometimes its so different, though, that even I have to stop and say "wait, I need to reconcile this with the source material some more" lol. And that's what I love about fanfic, that I can just run with it and write a vivid story that explores entirely new possibilities.

But I without a doubt respect canon compliant writers because they can't use the fact that it's AU to hide any OOC moments. Y'all really have to recreate that characterization and feel of the original content. And that's impressive because it takes time and thought to really look at a character and get everything from their thought process to their conversation patterns just right.

I also respect AU writers that do the coffee shop, modern, medival AUs, etc. etc. Cuz its just so neat tbh.

Basically, everyone's got their place in fandom. There's no wrong way to do it.
