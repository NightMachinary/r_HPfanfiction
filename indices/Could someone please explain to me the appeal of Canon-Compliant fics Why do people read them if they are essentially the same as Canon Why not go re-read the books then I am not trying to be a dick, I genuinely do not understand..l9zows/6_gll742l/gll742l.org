I only write canon compliant and only very rarely read AU. Writing canon compliant fics for me allows me to explore missing moments and alternate POVs that explore characters or world building in greater depth, as well as creating new plots pre or post canon. I have nothing against AU as a concept at all, I just never really stick with it because I end up thinking "but that's not what happened!" I also like to think closely about how events in a characters life shape their personality - when it comes to AU, I think changes in plot would inevitably change the personality of a character, and I read and write fanfic because I want more from the characters I know and love.

With canon compliancy, I was able to explore Ron's side of the argument in GOF and find his justifications for it. I was able to show what Ginny was doing in DH, and Percy too. During a time of personal grief I was able to write creatively with a bit of distance by thinking about how George would respond to the loss of Fred. I could take the time to be more abstract and add to the relationship between Harry and Ginny in greater detail than the books were able to show. I was able to great new plots with new characters post-Hogwarts and next gen, while keeping all the events of canon as firm "history" that both the reader and the characters have an understanding of.

It's interesting to me that it's often seen as an "intro" to fanfic, and I have had people condescendingly tell me I will get bored and go AU eventually. Well over a decade of writing now and I'm still not drawn to AU in the slightest. Everyone's different!
