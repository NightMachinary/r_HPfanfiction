Well for me, when it comes to "Canon-compliant" fics, they're all about expanding on what's already there. In the original novels, barring a few standout moments, we follow Harry. We hear almost nothing about what Ginny went through her first year, or her sixth, for that matter.

We don't get to learn what life was like for the Marauders when they attended Hogwarts.

Hell, we learn very little about what caused Vernon to become a man so dead set on squelching anything he viewed as abnormal out of Harry.

There is a lot that fanfic authors can toy with that would still really fit into canon. I've even seen crossover fics that deal with the tail end of Voldemort's first rise that fits neatly into canon, being a prequel that expanded on, among other things, how Harry survived, and Voldemort's spell backfired.
