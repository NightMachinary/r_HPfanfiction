Canon compliance just means that the story doesn't contradict canon. It is set in the same universe as canon. There's a lot canon doesn't cover, though. A lot of room for creativity to tell your stories. You could write about events you imagine happened before canon or after. You could write about the main characters or you could create your own characters. Heck, you might only mention the main characters in passing. There's still a lot of room for fun.
