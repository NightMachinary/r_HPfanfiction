I don't care much for canon re-reading. I personally prefer to read stories that refer to events or perspectives that are briefly mentioned in the story or stories from different eras. I don't really want to re-read Harry's perspective on things but I like reading a perspective that is completely different than Harry's. For example Voldemort's or Snape's interpretation of the same events.

I don't hate AUs but I'd rather stick to at least some of the original premises because that's why I read fanfiction. If the AU starts from a cool premises but turns out to be total crap, I feel cheated. Also if it's really good, may as well read an original story. This way I can even support the author financially.
