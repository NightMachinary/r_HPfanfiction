The real mind-twister to me is people that straight up hate AUs, fanon, or any other worldbuilding element an author puts in their fic. Like, what's the point of even reading */fanfiction/* if all you will do is go on rants about how X and Y are stupid and break the franchise simply because Rowling didn't use them in the original work?
