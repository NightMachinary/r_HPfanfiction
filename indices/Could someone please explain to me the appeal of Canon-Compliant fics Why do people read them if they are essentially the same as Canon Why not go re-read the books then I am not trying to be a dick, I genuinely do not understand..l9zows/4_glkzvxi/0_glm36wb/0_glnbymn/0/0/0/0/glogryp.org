That is honestly the worst thing about nearly every Harmony fic; this knee jerk reaction to explain why Harry and Hermione work and why the Canon pairings don't. Harry and Hermione can't just be a couple, someone has to explain why Ron and Hermione would never work or how Ginny 'looks' like Harry's mum and it's gross. I don't read fanfics for essays justifying your OTP, and the fact that you feel like you have to justify it in story really pulls me out of it.
