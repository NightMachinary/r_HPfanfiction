Oh my god I hate that shit. I'm not even a particular fan of Harmony but I've read a few good fics that happened to have that ship, and I just had to nope out of one because Ron and Hermione just went into this weird discussion that felt so weird, like they were staring and talking at me explaining why they don't like each other like that and why it makes so much sense that she's with Harry instead, and Ron's just getting stepped all over. It was weird. And the fic was good aside from that, a nice character study, but that part broke my immersion.
