Yeah, an AU where it's a reimaging of the same characters, where some key changes have taken place can be interesting. The Changeling being the prime example. It's different, but Ginny is still Ginny, Harry is still essentially Harry, etc.

A Harry Potter story that takes place in a non-magical setting is not a Harry Potter story. It's a novel without the original characters.
