To put it simply, I think it's because people who despise AUs (e.g. me) don't like to read something that isn't specifically about the characters they enjoy. The characters' relationships strongly depend upon the source material. If someone writes an AU where it's non-magical and "Hogwarts" is instead a muggle coffeeshop where the kids hang out like it's /Friends/, for example, there is not even a smidgen of interest in reading it if such essential qualities of the world and characters have been changed. It rings extraordinarily hollow; those are not the same characters, and so I have no interest in them. The same holds for most other lower-key AUs, like "What if Lily and James survived?" or "What if all the characters changed genders?"

I recognise why many people like AUs and similar, but I don't really understand the drive to read it. The canon-compliant works I read are both works that are strongly compliant, as well as ones that worldbuild with very plausible, realistic information.
