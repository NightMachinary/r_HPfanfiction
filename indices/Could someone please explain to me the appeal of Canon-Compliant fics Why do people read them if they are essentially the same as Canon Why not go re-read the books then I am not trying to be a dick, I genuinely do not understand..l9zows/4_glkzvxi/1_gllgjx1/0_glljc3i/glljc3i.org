Ok, but there's a difference between having different tastes, and actively condemning non-cannon-compliant fics.

I'm not accusing you of anything, but all the time I see posts from authors of AU's talking about the incredible amount of vitriol thrown at them for them /daring/ to alter the cannon in /any/ way.

People who like AU's might call cannon-compliant fic's boring, but people who like them seem to generally think that making an AU should be a crime or something.
