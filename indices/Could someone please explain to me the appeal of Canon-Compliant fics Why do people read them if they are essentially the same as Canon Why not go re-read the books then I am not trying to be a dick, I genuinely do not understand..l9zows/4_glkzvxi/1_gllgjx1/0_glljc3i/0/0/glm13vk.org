Everyone gets vitriol thrown at them, it's the nature of publishing online. There's always someone who disagrees with my interpretation of Harry or what was actually happening off screen or even, on occasion, that their non-canon ship is actually canon and should be included (looking at you, Wolfstar).

Honestly I think people get too wound up in both directions. Everyone is allowed tastes and preferences and we should avoid criticising canon compliancy as boring/uncreative just as we should avoid criticising AU as nonsensical or an insult to canon.
