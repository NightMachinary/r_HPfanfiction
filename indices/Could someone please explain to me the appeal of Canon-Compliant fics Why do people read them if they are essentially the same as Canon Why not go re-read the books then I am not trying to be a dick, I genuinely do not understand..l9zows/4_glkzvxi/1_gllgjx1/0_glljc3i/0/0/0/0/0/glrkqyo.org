It is always overzealous if they come after others. Whether it's about what's canon and what's not (Personally I think there's a difference between word of god and word of others close, and that the movies, made with JKR, are canon ish, and are not to be dismissed just because you don't like it) or someone insisting in comments or DM's that AU is always better than canoncompliant or vice versa. It doesn't even matter if they're right or not; nobody should harass authors.
