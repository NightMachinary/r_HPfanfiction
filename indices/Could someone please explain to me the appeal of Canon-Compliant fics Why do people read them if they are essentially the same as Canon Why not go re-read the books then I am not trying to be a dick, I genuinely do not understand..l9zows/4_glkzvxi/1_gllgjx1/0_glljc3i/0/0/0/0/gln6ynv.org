It is overzealous if they are coming to me, a canon compliant writer, and raging that I am writing Remadora, something that has happened multiple times. It's not canon, and the directions for the film actors aren't canon ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I have nothing against wolfstar if people want to write it, and it can be worked into a canon compliant story if you squint, but it's not for me.
