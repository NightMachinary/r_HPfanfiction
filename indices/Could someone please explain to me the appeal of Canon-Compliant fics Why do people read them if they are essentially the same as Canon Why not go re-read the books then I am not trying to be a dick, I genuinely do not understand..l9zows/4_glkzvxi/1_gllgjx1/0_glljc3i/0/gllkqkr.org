Consider the opposite scenario: a person who likes AUs throwing shade at authors for keeping canon-compliance and not having the courage to do something crazy or different. While I'm sure it's out there, it certainly doesn't happen nearly as often. And I think the simple difference between those two scenarios is that AUs change a lot; canon-compliance alters little. For a fan of the series, there's generally not much to really /complain/ about in a canon-compliant fic, unless they hate the source material. Meanwhile, AUs can change /everything/. Anyone can take issue with how something is done in an AU -- and not just from canon-compliant-liking people. That's undoubtedly the major part of any vitriol we see in comments.
