Kind of a good point. We've seen that several AU fanfictions have been able to be published as novels, and that's super cool. I think many authors like AUs simply so they can better picture the characters in their minds and think of clear directives they can go. They can appreciate the characters without context, and like to see them represented in different scenarios in order to challenge them, assuming some aspects of their personality will always be innate and consistent.
