90% of the time it's because the author's a hack who makes their own shit up because they can't be arsed to look at how canon approached the same problem/don't have the competence to use the canon-give tools/believe their "kewl shit" that is completely dissonant with the rest of the story and that they stole from some shonen anime they obsess about is superior to the canon approach.
