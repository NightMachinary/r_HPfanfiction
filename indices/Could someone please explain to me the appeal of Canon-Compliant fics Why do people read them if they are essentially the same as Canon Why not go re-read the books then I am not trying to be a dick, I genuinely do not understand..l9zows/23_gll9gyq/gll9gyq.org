I read fanfiction because I want to return to the world I love and to spend more time with my favourite characters. Even if there are major differences in plot and some different character development, I prefer it to be logical, as if it really could happen in the books. A different plot is nice, actually, if it's done well. But OOC without proper development and (especially) different world rules always make me close the fic. It's like it's not Harry Potter universe anymore, only names left. I'll better read a different book.
