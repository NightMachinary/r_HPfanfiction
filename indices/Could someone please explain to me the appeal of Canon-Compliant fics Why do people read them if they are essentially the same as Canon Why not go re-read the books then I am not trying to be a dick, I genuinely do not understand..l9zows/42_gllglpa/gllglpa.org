I don't know about everything else, but canon compliant fics that go through the entirety of the HP canon plot (the stone 1st year, chamber 2nd year, etc) with marginal differences even when the entire premise of the fic has an entire other character, or a self insert with prior knowledge, or even a slight AU that manages to backflip onto canon at every opportunity, really, really, infuriate me. It just feels like the author was too scared or lazy to change the plot at all, and I go through the fic waiting for a break from canon and it just never comes.
