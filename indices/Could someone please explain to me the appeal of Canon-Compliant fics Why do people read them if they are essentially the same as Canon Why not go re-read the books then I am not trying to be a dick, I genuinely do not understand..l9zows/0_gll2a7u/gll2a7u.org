Canon compliant doesn't mean it's the exact same story as Canon, it just means it's set in the same world. It could be pre-canon, post-canon, or happening in the background.

Think about it this way. A story about Harry meeting Hermione as kids is definitely not Canon compliant since we know they only met when they were both 11. However, a story about Harry making friends with a snake when he is 6 could be Canon compliant, as long as nothing in the story contradicts Canon.

Or, to put it another way, Canon compliant fics could be about the next generation, Harry and co's kids, again, as long as nothing in the story contradicts what was laid out in the books.

As you can see, there's a large scope for interesting fic premise out there, especially if you prefer introspective stories, like a peek into Sirius's mind the night he gets rescued in book 3. And so on. I hope this explains?
