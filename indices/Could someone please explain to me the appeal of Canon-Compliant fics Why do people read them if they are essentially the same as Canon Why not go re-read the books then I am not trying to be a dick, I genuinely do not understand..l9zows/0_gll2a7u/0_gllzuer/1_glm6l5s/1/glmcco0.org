Reach is a defeat for the humans though, therefore everyone dying heroically fits thematically. Like 300. I'd offer Mass Effect 3 as a counterpoint. Where you win in the end but don't live to enjoy the fruits of victory. And Bioware got enough shit for that that they retconned Shepard surviving in the destruction ending.

And HP canon is the worst of both worlds, any victory against Voldemort does not feel earned because what defeats Voldemort is his promise to Snape to spare Lily, who asked for that not caring about Harry or James. Lily had a choice, but she only got it because Snape was simping after her.
