For some things, yes. But what I don't get is the appeal of canon compliance in Marauder era fics since that means you know exactly how things will end (Pettigrew the traitor, the Potters dead, Sirius falsely imprisoned, Lupin fucking off to god knows where,...). Missing scene fics are one thing, and given that I came to fanfics looking for a better told Harry/Ginny romance, something I can get behind, at least in some cases. But in many other situations, canon compliant is little more than a dark shadow which looms over the fic, spoiling the end.
