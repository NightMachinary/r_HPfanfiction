We all know Spider-Man beats the bad guys, the good guys tend to win, in a romantic comedy the couple gets each other and in a French film everyone either gets their life ruined or dies. Yet, surprisingly enough, people watch it. People don't expect the seventh part of HP to end with Harry's death and Voldemort winning, after all. Nor, after all the build-up, did they expect Voldemort to turn /good/. So why bother watch it? Or read it? Why watch the movies of the books you've read if you already know how it ends?

Mostly, because they want to see /how/. /How/ will Harry defeat Voldemort? /How/ did Pettigrew betray his friends and why? What happens when Lupin fucks of, to where, why, and what brings him back? How do he and Sirius live together?
