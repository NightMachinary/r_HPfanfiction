I am someone that can enjoy a story even if I know "spoilers" because for me it's mostly not about the destination, it's the journey there. So even if I know that Peter ends up as a traitor or the Potters dead, I find it very interesting to read takes of authors on how did that happen and what their lives were before the ending that we know of.
