I am not someone who enjoys reading tragedy, so the knowledge that they will die at 21, be betrayed and whatnot just doesn't sit well with me, especially since there are basically no "the Potters Live" fics which don't end up bashing them (WBWL fics for example).

I've asked a few times for something like that, but there are no fics like that around, so there's no "antidote" to cheer you up after reading them.
