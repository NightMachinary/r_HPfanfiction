It's weird that you would point out how missing scenes fics are useful while saying you don't get the appeal of canon compliant marauders fics, given that almost the entire history of the marauders is a missing scene. Like, we see part of one day and hear second hand about a couple other things, and then there's 10-20 years of open space to work with.
