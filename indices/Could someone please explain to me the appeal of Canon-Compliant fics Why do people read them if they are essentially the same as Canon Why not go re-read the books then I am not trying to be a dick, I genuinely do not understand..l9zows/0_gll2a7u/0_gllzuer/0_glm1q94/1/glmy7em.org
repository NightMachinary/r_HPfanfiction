I think I see where Hellstrike is coming from with regards to Marauder ones specifically - the bad ending that they all get in canon does make it a bit harder to stomach in canon-compliant fics that flesh them out more, because we /know/ that's what's going to happen.

I don't really agree with that personally, but I can see how it could sour people's enjoyment of a fic like that
