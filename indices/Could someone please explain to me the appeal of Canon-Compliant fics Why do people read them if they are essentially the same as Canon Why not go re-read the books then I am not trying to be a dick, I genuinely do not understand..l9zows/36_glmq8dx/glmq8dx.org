I know that I like stories where one specific thing is changed, and everything else is only altered via the butterfly effect, basically saying if you don't have to change something, don't change it. As an aside, I feel that whether or not there's a lot of changes or very few changes to the story, try and keep the universe's rules the same as they usually are unless that's the specific thing you're changing. I.e., if you're doing a situation that involves the Fidelis charm research, that charm first. ( I also feel the need to put out my pet peeve when stories involving the Fidelis charm forget that someone can't just torture the information out of The Secret keeper; the secret has to be shared willingly. It only adds a whole level of drama that doesn't need to be there.)
