Yes, stories which just repeat The Stations of Canon without much change (and yes there are many) are incredibly boring. However, there is a lot of fun in stories which somehow extend the canonical stories (have you noticed all those “and then three months nothing special happened” comments? There are many of them in the books.), which took the same story from somebody else point of view (e.g., “Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince by RRFang” linkffn(5677867), or “Order of Mercy by MandyinKClinkffn(12181042)), or which extend the story beyond the books timeline. The last one is especially meaningful, because JKR cut the seventh book incredibly short (we don't have any closure on Harry/Ginny story, nothing more than a kiss from Hermione/Ron, WHAT HAPPENED TO LAVENDER BROWN???, etc.). Read for example the series “[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond by Northumbrian]]” (start with “Tales of the Battle” and go on), which makes whole Harry/Ginny romance much more believable than in the books (I claim that [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][Ginny is the worst written character in all books]]).

That is not to say, that I have anything against AU stories, I read and enjoyed many of them, but both categories can happily stand next to one another.
