The burdens and not asking for help most probably do stem from his upbringing. Lack of trust and respect in authority I suppose could be(but to be fair, many of the adults that were supposed to 'help' him did jack shit and so that didn't help his stance on the matter). I still stand with the ascertain that his upbringing lowered his self esteem and I really have to work now.
