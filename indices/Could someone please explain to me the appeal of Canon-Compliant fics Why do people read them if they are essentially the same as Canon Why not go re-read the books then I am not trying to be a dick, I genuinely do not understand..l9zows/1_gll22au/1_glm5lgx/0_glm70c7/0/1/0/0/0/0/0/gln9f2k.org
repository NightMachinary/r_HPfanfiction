Some parts of Harry that I'd say his upbringing plays a part in:

Lack of trust and respect for authority. A tendency to want to solve his own situations. Resistant to asking for help when he needs it; takes on burdens that aren't his to carry. He bottles up his emotions and then explodes, rather than handling them as they come. Quick to anger. Lack of self preservation.
