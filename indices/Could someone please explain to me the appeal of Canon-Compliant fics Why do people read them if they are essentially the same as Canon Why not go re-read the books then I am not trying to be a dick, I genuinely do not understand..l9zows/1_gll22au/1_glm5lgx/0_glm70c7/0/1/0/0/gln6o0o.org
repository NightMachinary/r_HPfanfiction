No, but there's definitely...not a pattern, but you can't expect two kids to go through this type of abuse and one is fine while the other isn't.

Mental Abuse and/or Emotional Abuse(these two are difficult)

Physical Abuse

Criminal Neglect

Modern Child Slavery(I don't remember if this is one on it's own or ties into another type of abuse like neglect, but it's still worth pointing out)
