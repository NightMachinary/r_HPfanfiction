Dude he tried to kill Sirius and then jumped at the chance to live with him two seconds later. He accepted two half assed apologies from Ron after being done extremely dirty by him. He let Hermione shit on him in sixth year, etc.

He didn't realize that Dumbledore-even if you don't believe in manipulative Dumbledore-did some fucked up actions, he immediately changed his opinions on Snape despite being abused by the man for years, etc. Those are actions of a dude with no self worth to speak of
