Maybe if you only read the canon compliant stories out there that do nothing but re-hash the events from the books or focus on the trio and Draco. But, dear lord, this is such a small part of the canon compliant stories out there. I think you're not understanding what canon compliant means.

Canon compliant means the story takes place in the wizarding world as presented by JKR. That's it. Portraits talk, Hogwarts is a school, and Voldemort dies in 1998. It does not mean a retelling of the original stories, and may not even be focused on any of the main characters you are already familiar with.

Basically canon compliance does not = retelling the stories you already know.
