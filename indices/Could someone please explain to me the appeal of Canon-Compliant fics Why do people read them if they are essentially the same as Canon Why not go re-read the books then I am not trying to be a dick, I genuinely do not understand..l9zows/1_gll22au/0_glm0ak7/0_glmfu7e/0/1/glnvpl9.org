Canon Compliant still leaves a /lot/ of wiggle room, especially if you're creative. In fact, I find that stories that are creative enough to manipulate and twist things so that they can stay canon compliant while telling a story that would be much easier to tell as an AU tend make for really great storytelling if you can find them.

The first one that springs to mind is Pride of Time, where Hermione accidentally goes back in time to the maurader's era at the end of fifth year, falls in love with Snape, and they get married and have a kid. Stories with that plot are usually a dime a dozen, except /this/ one is somehow almost completely canon compliant (with a bit of blurring between movie/book canon) until the very end of the final battle. It's much more fun that way ðŸ˜‰
