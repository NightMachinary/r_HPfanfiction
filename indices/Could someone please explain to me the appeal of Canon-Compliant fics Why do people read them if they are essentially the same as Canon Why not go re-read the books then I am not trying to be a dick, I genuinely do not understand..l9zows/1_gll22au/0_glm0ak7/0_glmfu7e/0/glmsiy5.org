That.

Founders era fic? No problem. Marauders era fic? Easily done. What shenanigans did Susan Bones and Hannah Abbot get up to? No problem at all! How did Umbridge's reign affect the Ravenclaws' study habits? Done in a jiffy.

As long as /nothing in your fic contradicts canon/ you can write whatever you like and it is canon-compliant. You can write a fic showing us WHY things happened a certain way in canon. You can write a fic showing us what the characters were up to in the days and weeks JKR skipped over. You can even write a fic showing us how how the epilogue was a sham and a front, how Hermione and Ron's marriage is breaking apart and they are only staying together for the kids, how Draco is actually on day release from prison and how the issues with uneven cauldron bottom thickness severely impact British potions manufacture.

And frankly, "how can I make my idea fit into already established canon" is a far more interesting writing challenge than writing whatever comes to mind without care and calling it "AU". You have to actually understand what you can get away with and how to work arond the difficult bits.
