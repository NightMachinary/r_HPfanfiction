Yes! This is why I don't get the statement they made about a lack of character growth. It's the canon compliant fics that add so very much depth to the original characters. Sure, their character growth from ages 11 to 18 is pretty much set in the books, but seven years is such a small part of a person's life. Also, I want to read more about the struggles of potion manufacturers.

My current fic is one I am weaving between canon events and it really does make for a challenge when you are also developing your own plot. It is kind of that happy medium between "here's my creativity" and "here's a few limits to work with". You have to be VERY aware of canon, but yes, you can do so much between the pages of the known stories.
