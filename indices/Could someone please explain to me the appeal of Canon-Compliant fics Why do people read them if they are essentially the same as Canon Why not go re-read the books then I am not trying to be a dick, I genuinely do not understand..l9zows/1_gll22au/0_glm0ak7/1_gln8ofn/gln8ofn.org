Canon compliant actually means that if you read the fic alongside the books, nothing in the fic would conflict what's been established in canon. This means you could have stories like Hogwarts-slice-of-life or whatever that can be enjoyed on their own, but if they were canon compliant then they could also be used to add more depth to your enjoyment of the books because they match together and don't conflict.
