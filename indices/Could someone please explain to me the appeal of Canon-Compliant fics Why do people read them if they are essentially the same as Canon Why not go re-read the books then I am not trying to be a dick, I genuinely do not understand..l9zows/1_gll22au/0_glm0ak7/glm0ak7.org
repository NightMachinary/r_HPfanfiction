Canon compliant means that you put them through all the idiocies of canon though. A canon compliant fic will never have a character grow in a direction which is logical or expected based on pervious development if canon was stupid/ham-fisted about it. Good examples here would be no one believing that Malfoy could be a Death Eater or the incredibly obvious fake break-up at the end of HBP.
