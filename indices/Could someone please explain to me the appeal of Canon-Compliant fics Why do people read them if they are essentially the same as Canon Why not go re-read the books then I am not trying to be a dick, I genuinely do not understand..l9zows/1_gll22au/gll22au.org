Have you ever watched a show where you love the characters so much, that you want to just watch them do stuff together that's not tied in with the overarching plot?

Like, you just want to spend time with those characters, and see them have moments where they're not out saving the world or solving some grand plot.

Now, I don't read a lot of canon compliant stuff, but I definitely see the appeal of witnessing Harry and Ron chilling out in the Burrow and talking about some dumb shit like normal teenagers.
