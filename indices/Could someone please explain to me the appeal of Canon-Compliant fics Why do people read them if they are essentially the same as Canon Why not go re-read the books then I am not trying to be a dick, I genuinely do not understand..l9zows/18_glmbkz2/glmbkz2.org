They're not the same as canon.

I could reread the books but I still won't find :

What James did to make Lily changes her heart and finaly go out with him, and marry him.

The books won't tell me how Remus reacted when he heard that Three of his friends where dead, because the 4th one betrayed them all.

How the Dursley reacted when they found Harry on their doorstep ? And how they write-off teachers concerns when the kid was obviously mistreated and yet no one intervened.

Harry first day of primary schools.

What discussion, if any, Petunia and Vernon had when Harry showed his first bit of Magic.

Dudley's worst memory.

The Weasley's almost entire childhood.

How Remus and Tonks met, and how they feelings developped, and how their relationship built. The book will give me the saillant part, but not the feelings of falling in love, the uncertainity that is there, the actual fight when Remus left, Teddy's birth, and so much that I like in romance fanfictions. Even if I know how it ends.

Harry first training with the whole team, and just not Wood. And how they all react to his talent.

And so so much more.

They're a lot of stories to tell, pre-canon and post-canon. Stories of background characters. Stories of even main characters that aren't Harry.

Like Hermione and her reaction at discovering she was a witch. Again her whole childhood is a big unknown. Does she have friends outside of the wizarding world ?

Or even the 7 books told from McGonagall P.O.V., including everything we haven't seen on the day-to-day life of an Hogwarts teachers. Did you know that the Muggle-Borns Parents Association could be a bitch to deal with ? Me neither. I just came up with it.

Harry is an oblivious characters, and does really reflect or notice a lot of things outside his main concerns. It makes for an easier story to read. But since almost everything is from his P.O.V., it left countless of stories to be told in this universe while still staying whithin the constrain of canon.

Even with Harry as a main characters, there's a lot of stories left to be told, even during the 7 years.

Also, contrary of what this fandom seems to think, a fanfiction doesn't have to have 500 chapters and 2 millions words.
