There's different kinds of canon compliant fic. There's the kind that rehashes canon with a new perspective. Sometimes we want to see things through the eyes of a character and know what they're thinking. The entirely of Harry Potter is told through Harry's POV, so it'd be interesting to know all the things Dumbledore never told him or to see Snape's struggle as a double agent forced to look after the son of his school bully.

There's also the fics that take place before, after, or even during canon! Authors might add a scene that takes place between two existing scenes. Maybe they write out an event that was mentioned in canon but we were never shown.

I'm a sucker for AUs, but I think there's a lot that can be done with canon compliant fics that are really interesting and creative!
