Canon compliant fics can be a way to explore secondary characters we don't know much about. For example, a canon compliant fic featuring Bellatrix Lestrange could hit the major events we know that happen to her (which aren't many, to be honest) but the rest of the story would be filled in with other details, emotions, etc. It would make a compelling story out of an intriguing character we otherwise don't know much about.

If you look at stories as just a series of events, then canon compliant fics aren't going to offer you very much. But if you're interested in exploring the backstories and motivations for characters besides the Golden Trio, canon compliant fics are not boring at all.
