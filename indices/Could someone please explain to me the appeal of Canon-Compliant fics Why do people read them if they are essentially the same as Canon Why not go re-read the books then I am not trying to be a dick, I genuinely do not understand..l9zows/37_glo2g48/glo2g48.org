Considering that i just read one of the most AWFUL non-canon-compliant fics in my entire life that was so bad that i debated on whether to continue on in the fandom (i will not be linking or naming what fic it is i'm not a monster) i understand canon-compliant love a lot more now and appreciate it SO much more. Like i don't mind deviations like "oh here's the exact same story of year 4 but with _insert something that answer/solves a pretty basic questiom_ here." or "here's year 4 from an OC characters POV and the main plot is the same just not focused on trio" That doesn't bother me at all but when you have a fic that let's say.....made Harry an animagus with the form of an elephant and he kills Voldemort by trampling him then yeah no......not for me.
