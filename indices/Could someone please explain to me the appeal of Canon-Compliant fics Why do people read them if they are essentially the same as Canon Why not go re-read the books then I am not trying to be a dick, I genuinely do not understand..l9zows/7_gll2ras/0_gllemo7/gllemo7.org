I think that's a little too reductive - the majority of fanfic readers tend to have enjoyed the original work, and are interested in seeing more. Either of the same, or of different takes on the world/plot.

I expect that more fanfic readers are interested in reading both types than just one or the latter, as long as it's well written/interesting. Also, I think that even in most AU readers are primarily interested in reading fanfiction because they enjoyed the original work, not out of dislike of the original work's flaws. "What-if X happened" is also a primary motive for AUs, and that also does not suppose dislike of for the original chain of events.
