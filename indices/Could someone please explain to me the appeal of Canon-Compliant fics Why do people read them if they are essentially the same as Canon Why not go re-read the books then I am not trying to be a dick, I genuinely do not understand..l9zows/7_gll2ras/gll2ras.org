Other people have correctly clarified that "canon compliant" does not mean rehash.

More fundamentally, however, there are two main kinds of fanfic reader.

There's those who read fanfic because they love the original work and want more of the same.

Then there's those who read fanfic because they disliked something about the original work and want to "fix" it.

People who like canon compliant fanfic fall into the former category. I think Blorcyn put it best when he described good fanfic as a love letter to the original work.
