As a refinement to type one - sometimes it's not just wanting more of it, sometimes it's enjoyable to find stories that make you reevaluate canon. Stories that make you think, Yeah, that really wasn't explained/wasn't right/should have gone differently. Or change your sympathies, eg reading The Snape Chronicles left me with very strong opinions about Harry viewing the memory Snape tried to keep away from him (knowing what Harry knew about Snape's role and his own vulnerability to mind reading, it was an awful thing to do).
