It bothers me that families like the Dursleys and Malfoys lost nothing. They were abusive and dark. Whereas those that fought for the light lost entire bloodlines with many families having only an heir left. I feel Harry wasn't dark enough. Not after phoenix. He becomes a different person in HBP and DH.
