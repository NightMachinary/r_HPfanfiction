  I'd like to get people's perspectives on this.

He was a teenager. Normal teenagers aren't emotionally mature and stable on a good day. Then just add all the crap he's been through- the Dursleys, seeing Cedric die, getting tortured, abandoned by his friends, slandered in the press, shunned by his peers, tortured /again/, seeing Sirius die. I'm honestly surprised Harry turned out as good as he did. I think there really should have been more fallout after Sirius' death. At the end of Order of the Phoenix he is a wreck. But only a few weeks later at the start of Half-blood Prince Harry is back to normal and trusts Dumbledore again. (And don't even get me started on the movie where he's just casually picking up muggle waitresses like Charlie Harper's long lost son.)

And just for posterity's sake: Draco Malfoy also tried using the Cruciatus on Harry, used the Imperius on Rosmerta, committed attempted murder twice (Katie and Ron), was planning to kill Dumbledore, became a member of a terrorist organisation and actively helped said organisation to infiltrate a school full of children. It's a bit off-topic, I know. But I find the amount of fics that treat Draco like a misunderstood hot flirting machine disturbing.
