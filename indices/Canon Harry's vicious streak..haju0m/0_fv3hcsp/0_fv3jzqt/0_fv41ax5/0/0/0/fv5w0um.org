And that is the key point - *IF* they betrayed the group. People who went there agreed to keep the secret and thus protect their peers. Those who didn't feel up to it had ample opportunity to leave. All the others somehow managed, and thus remained safe.

Marietta went to Umbridge. Not 'was caught by' - 'went to'. As in, took direct action against both word and spirit of the pact she agreed to, knowing that people would pay for it, including Cho (who was supposed to be her friend).

I find it hard to feel sympathy for Marietta, because she got injured at the result of *premeditated actions* she undertook. I am not sure if she knew about Blood Quills, but shedid know that the the Toad was bad news and lacking in mercy.

To me, it read like one of those Super!Harry GoF parodies where he puts in his name, backs out and is surprised to lose his magic. And Marietta's punishment didn't last more that 2 years - and it only took that long for the last, cosmetic traces to fade.
