Oh for sure- very good points. I think a lot of the difference is that he didn't have a sibling, either. Azula is the way she is because her father was able to compare Zuko to her and inflate both her confidence and sociopathic tendencies by putting Zuko down to raise her up- hence Ozai's A+ parenting quote of, "Your sister was born lucky. You were lucky to be born."

If Draco had had the same kind of influences (his father actually having ultimate authority, sibling rivalry, absent parents by either necessity (Ursa) or neglect (Ozai), and later, a healthy father figure to help him navigate emotional pitfalls), he may have turned out either more ruthless, like Azula, or more jaded and eventually redeemed for it, like Zuko.

Given the emphasis the Ton puts on heirs and bloodline, I think Draco would have broken more similarly to Azula out of necessity. He was more similar to Zuko in canon because he was the boy who made terrible choices out of love for his father- much of what we see for the first 2.5 seasons of ATLA with our favorite awkward Turtleduck. But his father didn't repay that love with betrayal and didn't make that love a weapon against Draco, so it continues to get him into worse and worse situations because letting go is hard, especially with centuries of familial obligation bearing down on you, too.
