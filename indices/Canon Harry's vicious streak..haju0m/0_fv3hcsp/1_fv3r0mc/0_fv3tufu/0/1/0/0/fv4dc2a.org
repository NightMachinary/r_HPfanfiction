I don't think Draco and Azula are that similar. Azula enjoys what she does and revels in the hurt she's able to cause; Draco thinks he will, and tries his hardest to be his father and a good Death Eater, but as we see in the last two books, he simply ends up miserable.

I think in that way he's sort of in the middle between Zuko and Azula.

If I had to find parallels, I'd say Malfoy Manor is the equivalent of the cave in Crossroads of Destiny: Draco doesn't give the trio away, and Zuko opens up to Katara and seems to be about to switch sides. And then, due to circumstances or due to immaturity, who knows, both revert to their old selves and take refuge in what they know, despite that making them miserable.

After the day of black sun, Zuko manages to finally break free from his father's influence, and I don't find it too hard to imagine a similar arc for Draco after the Battle of Hogwarts.
