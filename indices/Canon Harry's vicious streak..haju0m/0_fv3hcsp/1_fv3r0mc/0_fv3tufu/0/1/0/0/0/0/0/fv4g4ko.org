Exactly. Love is a bond that is hard to reject even when it's unrequited, like with Zuko and his father. When it's a loving, healthy bond? Anybody would be hard-pressed to reject it, even for the clear "good" choice right in front of them.

I'm pretty sure Iroh was an essential part of Zuko coming around when he did. I firmly believe Zuko could have gotten there on his own, but it would have taken longer and been harder without an example of what a parent really should be to compare Ozai to.

Draco is indirectly the entire reason Harry made it out of the final battle alive, because of that reciprocal bond between him and his mother. It's easy to imagine Ursa would have done the same thing, but she was gone far too early. The major difference is I could see Lucius doing the exact same as Narcissa, but I couldn't see Ozai doing so even for Azula.
