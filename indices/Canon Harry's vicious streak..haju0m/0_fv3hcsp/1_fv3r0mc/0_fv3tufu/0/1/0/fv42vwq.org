In that view Draco is closer to Azula in some ways than Zuko, characterization-wise. Which tracks with the paternal brainwashing they both received- the main differences are how they were used by their fathers and how much power each father held. If Lucius Malfoy had been the Dark Lord as opposed to his lieutenant, it's entirely possible Draco would have been a lot more like his Aunt Bellatrix- deadly and confident with a thick streak of cunning- than we see in canon.
