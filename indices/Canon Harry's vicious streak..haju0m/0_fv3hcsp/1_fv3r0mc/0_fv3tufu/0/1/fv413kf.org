I ship Zuko & Katara but I don't ship Draco with anyone. The biggest difference between the two I think is their childhoods and relationships with their fathers.

Zuko was a good kid who barely interacted with his horrible father. Had some really bad teen years did a few bad things mostly for the right reasons or just survival, but all in all was good.

Draco had from his point of view a great dad who spent time with him and taught him to be a man. Basically from the start Draco was taught to be a piece of shit. His entire world view is some awful nazi shit, and yeah a few people who have been raised like that better themselves it's really really rare.
