Yes to this whole comment. Canon Draco may not have been redeemed the way Zuko was, but the groundwork was there, and I've seen a lot of fics do it convincingly.

Also, unrelated but not really, I've never met a Zutara shipper (myself included) that didn't also ship Dramione or Drarry. Guess we have a type, huh
