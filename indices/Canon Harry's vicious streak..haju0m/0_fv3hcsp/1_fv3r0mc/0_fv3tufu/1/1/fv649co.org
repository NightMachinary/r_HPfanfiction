  Draco refusing to kill Dumbledore at the end of the sixth book

He simply did not have the balls to put his money where his mouth was when he had to do it himself. He had absolutely no qualms about using Katie, Slughorn and Rosmerta for his assassination plots.

  Draco refusing to identify Harry

That was him being afraid of the consequences of a false positive, not any deeper motivation. It would have been his head if he confirmed the person to be Harry and the Dark Lord realised that it was just some random guy.

  I think fanfic authors moving this change of heart up in time to before he joins the Death Eaters isn't any more implausible than what's in canon.

We never see Malfoy denounce any part of the Death Eater ideology. He is afraid for his own skin, but he has no qualms about Voldemort's goals or anything if he can just enjoy it as an outsider. Narcissa goes against Voldemort as well, but that was motivated by Draco, not by denouncing pureblood supremacy.
