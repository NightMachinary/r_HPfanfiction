I agree, I think a lot of the points in favor of Draco's redemption only count if it's an actual change of heart motivating his actions. My interpretation is that his actions are more based on fear and self preservation (though I will admit, it's been awhile since I've actually read the books).

And of course it's fine for fan fic to interpret those actions to support his redemption, it's a popular trope for a reason. I just wish there were more well written (aka not uber bashing) stories out there were Draco is still the same self-centered, big talking, kinda cowardly, blood supremacist...you know, just to balance it out a bit.
