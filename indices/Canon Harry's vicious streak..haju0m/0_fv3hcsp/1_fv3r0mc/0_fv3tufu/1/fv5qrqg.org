  I think it's plausible for Draco to have a change of heart once he grows up a little and starts thinking for himself

Indeed, this happens in canon. It's just that it happens mostly off-screen and we only see it from small pieces in the books---Draco refusing to kill Dumbledore at the end of the sixth book, Draco refusing to identify Harry when the trio is captured during the seventh book---and from Rowling's comments after the fact.

I think fanfic authors moving this change of heart up in time to before he joins the Death Eaters isn't any more implausible than what's in canon.
