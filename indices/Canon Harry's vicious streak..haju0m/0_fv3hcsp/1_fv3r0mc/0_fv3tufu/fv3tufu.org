Yes and no. I think a lot of people want to see a redemption arc for a lot of villains, I'd go so far as to say for all villains (I've seen some Voldy-fics where the descriptions lead me to believe they gave him a dark-hero happy-ish story; to be fair those aren't ones I've read, so I can't be sure but...).

But with Draco, I think the Zuko parallel is easy because they both have douche bag father figures who heavily influenced their lives and choices. Does that excuse anything Draco does? Absolutely not. But it helps to explain it, and IMO gives a great build up for change and redemption. He (both Draco & Zuko) was definitely a product of his environment, his family, and social circle, and I think he wouldn't necessarily have been the douche we know & love from the books (TV show) had his circumstances been different. I think we see a flash of this in book six, when Dumbledore tells him he's surprised he invited Greyback into the place where his friends live/sleep and even though we know Draco has used Greyback as a threat, he responds with something along the lines of horror saying “I didn't know he was coming!!” (Please forgive me for not being great with direct book quotes or taking the time to look it up :D).

I think it's plausible for Draco to have a change of heart once he grows up a little and starts thinking for himself instead of continuing to be spoon fed by his environment; kind of like Zuko did with seeing the world and realizing that the world view his father painted was false. And he chose to change. Granted the books don't really show that Draco had this change of heart, but I think a lot of fanfics have done a good job with it. Also, Draco's parents clearly abandon all their beliefs/alliances at the end in search for their son whom they loved above all else, so change/redemption is clearly possible.

This also comes from a diehard Dramione & Zutara shipper, so I'm probably biased, lol. :D

Also, to the OP, I agree that he was angsty/snarky, but like the other commenter mentioned I'm surprised it wasn't more. This doesn't speak well for myself but I think I would have been way worse if I had been in Harry's same situation. Most of his douche-ish responses, while not ok, are understandable reactions to everything he was subjected to. I think it's actually why I have such a hard time re-reading The Order of the Phoenix, because I get so angry at the injustices and there's never enough of a retaliation, again IMO. Thank goodness for Fred & George's departure, lol.
