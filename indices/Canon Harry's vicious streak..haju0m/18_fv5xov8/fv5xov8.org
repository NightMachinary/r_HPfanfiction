Harry isn't always violent, but he tends to deal with stress by becoming straight up vicious. He also thinks it's funny when other people seek revenge (Mad Eye cursing Malfoy, for example.) Not everyone in canon reacts this way. Neville lost his parents to Bellatrix. Luna lost her mom and was bullied by the other kids. Neither of them reacted by becoming vicious or violent; they grew up a lot more patient and forgiving.
