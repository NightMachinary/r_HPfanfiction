I'm going to side with a lot of people on this one. Who doesn't have violent and vicious thoughts now and then? Especially, as a teenager or someone whose being dealt a shit hand in life and is still going through a tramautizing period. I actually think Harry's kind of tame for what he's been through, he could be way worse in that regard and we would still argue its war, etc etc.
