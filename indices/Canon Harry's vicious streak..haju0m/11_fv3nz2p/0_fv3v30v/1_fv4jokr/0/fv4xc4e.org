I agree, but I think the reason it pushed him over the edge was because she's like a mother figure to him. I think there are few other professors that could have taken McGonagall's place that would have elicited such a strong reaction from Harry were they spit at/on. For example, had it been Trelawney instead, I don't know that it would have pushed him to react that way. Granted, I think something would have pushed him there regardless because Carrow had, like you said, tortured his friends/fellow students all year and was an all around douche (and was there when Dumbledore died also feeding his dislike for Carrow because at this point in the book Harry didn't know about Snape's duplicity). I think it plays out the way it does because it was that mother figure for Harry being spat at, and it took a slight on someone he respected so highly to push him over the edge and go â€˜ya know, enough is enough' curse Carrow and to mean it so viscously/intensely because of all the crap Carrow had done.
