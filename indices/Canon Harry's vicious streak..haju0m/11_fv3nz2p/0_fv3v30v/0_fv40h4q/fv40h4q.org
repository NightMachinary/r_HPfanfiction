McGonagall was never a mother figure to Harry, he barely knows her really. The fact he tortured Carrow rather than just kills him is a huge concern. Killing him would have been kinder and better for the war effort, instead he tortured the guy. A temporary solution and one that won't last long, Carrow could have gotten up later.

But I think this is mostly Rowling's own messed up morality, thinking that only murder is truly unforgivable and that killing equals murder.
