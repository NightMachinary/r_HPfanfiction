I agree with you on Rowling's take on murder, however I definitely think McGonagall however little Harry may have actually known her, was a mother figure to him. She was his head of house, an inherently motherly role, she helped him multiple times over the years (1st year: signs him up for quidditch like a proud mum instead of expelling him or docking points for flying without authorization; 2nd year: doesn't expel Ron or him for the car incident and tears up/says she understands when he lies & says they want to visit Hermione in the hospital wing after she's petrified; 3rd year: escorts him to the hospital wing after the dementors on the train; buoys his spirits after Professor Trelawney predicts his death )- all things a mother, which Harry never had, would do. I could go on, but truly Harry has very few mother figures in his life, so even one who is strict, but always stood up for him (let's not forget how in fifth year she grabs his shoulders and flat out tells Umbridge she'll make it her life's mission to make Harry an auror) even if they weren't close/close confidants, she meant/represented a LOT to Harry.

Though again, I agree that Rowling's take that murder is the worst is wrong. She even has Dumbledore say it at one point, I think, that there are far worse things than death. And I agree, the torture she inflicted on Harry was far worse. Killing, while heinous, isn't necessarily the worst crime in the books.

Also, I wouldn't say Harry tortured Carrow. His spell was so strong it threw Carrow against the wall and knocked him out. It was basically instant and hardly torture. If it had been reversed the death eaters would have inflicted far worse torture on Harry.
