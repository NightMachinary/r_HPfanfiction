He only fantasised about cursing Snape, he doesn't actually try anything until Snape kills Dumbledore - and when he tries, he fails miserably because the author made him a worthless everyman.

Bellatrix, he attempts (and fails) to curse right after the woman killed the closest thing he had to a parent. Carrow, he curses when they're about to fight Voldemort and his army.

The thing with Harry is that he never does anything like this in the middle of a fight. Crabbe fires killing curses at Hermione? Harry's response is to use a first year spell. Tottenham court road, they use obliviation which makes it obvious that the two Death Eaters encountered someone from the Order who were too squeamish to kill. The bike escape when he and Hagrid are barely holding on for life? He uses a bloody disarming charm.

Heck, a more vicious approach from Harry would have left Malfoy Manor in ruins with all the Death Eaters dead inside.
