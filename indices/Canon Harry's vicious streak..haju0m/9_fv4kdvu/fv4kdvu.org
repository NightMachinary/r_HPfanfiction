Yeah, he tries to do as much harm as he can to the person who /had just killed the closest thing he has ever had to a parent right in front of him./ And then she gloats about it. If someone murdered my dad and I witnessed it, damn right I'd be trying to do as much harm to that person as I could. And I don't even have the excuse of being an angry teenage boy with a Dark Lord stuck in my head.

I think the Snape stuff is justified - Snape (book!Snape anyway) is bloody awful to Harry and to Hermione. Not to mention how he treats Neville. He's a bitter twisted person who bullies children. Because he's a teacher, Harry /cannot/ stand up to him in any way. Snape has the final say because he is the one in authority. So I think it's normal to fantasise about hurting someone who has been abusing their power over you - you want them to get a taste of what feeling helpless like that is.

The Carrows - who actually thinks what he did was wrong? McGonagall was basically his last remaining link to Dumbledore, the only authority figure left that he trusts. And to witness her humiliated like that, by a person Harry knows has also been torturing and abusing his friends? He had to cause pain, he had to incapacitate them or /they would have handed him over to Voldemort./

It was a war. People make decisions in war that they wouldn't always make in peace time. Every time Harry hurt someone, they deserved it and it was of their own making. Even when he used sectumsempura on Draco - Draco had been about to use the cruciatus curse on him. It's a case of self defence, and Harry felt absolutely awful about having caused that much damage.
