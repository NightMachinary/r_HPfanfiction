Harry can be pretty ruthless as you said. Here's his thoughts on joining the Auror Department.

#+begin_quote
  It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn't really think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago. . . . Neither can live while the other survives. . . . Wouldn't he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort?

He doesn't have an issue with the idea of killing Voldemort, although he does show his restraint when he refuses to stun Stan or spare Dolohov and Rowle(though that was more of a tactical decision).
