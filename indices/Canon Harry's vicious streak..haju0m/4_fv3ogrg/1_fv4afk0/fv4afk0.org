As thrawnca pointed out, Harry /has/ acted on his thoughts. He attempted to Crucio Bellatrix; he used the Imperio curse on multiple people and goblins at the bank; in Ravenclaw Tower, he succeeds in using the Cruciatus Curse on Carrow.

There are other, less memorable instances where Harry demonstrated violent behavior. The Quidditch match in 5th year, for example.
