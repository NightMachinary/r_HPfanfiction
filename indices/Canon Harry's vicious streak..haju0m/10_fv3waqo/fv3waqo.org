I think in particular we should be able to forgive his crucio at Bellatrix and his anger at the "I see no difference" comment. If someone disfigures a close friend of mine, and an authority figure observes the effects and does nothing about it except make some stupid mocking comment, I'm going to be doing more than fantasizing about hurting said authority figure.

Bellatrix, well she's Bellatrix and she had just killed Sirius at the time.
