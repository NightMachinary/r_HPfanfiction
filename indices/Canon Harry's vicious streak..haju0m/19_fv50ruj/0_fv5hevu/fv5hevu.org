But that is the thing, isn't it? Harry is an abused child like children I fantasy children's books are abused. Like in Roald Dahl.

The adults are horrible, abusive and should have long since have faced repercussions but haven't, and the child in question deals with all sorts of abusive behaviour with resilience or snark.

The only fic where I seriously see Harry actually suffering consequences from the shit live has heaped up on him, and Petunia getting her shit together enough to consider family therapy is An Aunt's Love.
