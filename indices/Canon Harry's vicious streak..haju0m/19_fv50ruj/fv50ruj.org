People tend to forget that Harry is an abused child, and often if a person hurts someone who an abused child is close too then the child will lash out in anger, and try to protect the person who was harmed. Harry is no different. Bellatrix had just killed his godfather, on of the only people who cared about Harry's well-being. And Carrow had threatened his head of house, the person who made sure he was alright, and who kept Harry Potter in check. Honestly I probably would have done the same thing. Also Dung had stolen from his late godfather, and by extension, himself. One thing abused children are protective of are their belongings. Harry has so little for so many years, and once he has something, Dung takes it away. I would have lashed out too.
