Fuck, I know I read this, I know I downloaded it, but I can't find it nor remember it.

For anyone else, this fic has Bucky being saved by femHarry (I think her name is something like Charissa or its her middle name) after the train, and then she waltz into the Army camp. Steve never goes into the ice, and he ends up with Peggy. Iirc, Bucky and femHarry don't even kiss till much later, even if they are clearly inlove with eachother. Harry helps the Army with portkeys and other magical stuff, and afaik, there isn't magic whatsoever in this universe.

Its fairly short, no longer than 70k words. I just can't find it.
