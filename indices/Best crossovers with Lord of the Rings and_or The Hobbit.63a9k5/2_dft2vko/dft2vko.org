It's a bit off the wall, but my favourite story in the HP/Tolkien area is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10473466/1/Fate-be-Changed][Fate be Changed]] by Araceil. It's a Harry Potter crossover in name only, really, and it has basically all of the usual red flags. Despite that, though, I really do recommend giving it a go. I think I often value love of the fandom over other things, especially with Lord of the Rings (where love of Legolas seems to be the most common reason to write things), and this definitely has the warm fuzzies for LotR.

In other news, my own LotR crossovers (I am Steelbadger on FFN) are still being actively worked on. I just had a bit of a crisis of confidence in my plans recently.
