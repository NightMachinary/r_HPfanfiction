The wordcount is why I laugh at the Hobbit having been 3 movies. LOTR was not a short trilogy, but the Hobbit was only 70% of the word count of Return of the King, the shortest of the 3.

I have a really hard time even starting any fanfic with more than about 250k words. I don't care how good it is, seeing 500k+ and incomplete is a really good way to make me ignore something thinking maybe I'll check back in later.
