My previous comment was only for HP fanfic - I misinterpreted the post.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8280375/1/Retroactive][Retroactive]] - in the Avatar: The Last Airbender fandom. It's brilliant in every aspect.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6988840/1/Bring-Me-All-Your-Elderly][Bring Me All Your Elderly!]], also in the A:TLA fandom.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4719758/1/Avatar-Aang-An-Annotated-Bibliography][Avatar Aang: An Annotated Bibliography]], also in that fandom.

These three are my favourites out of all the A:TLA fics I've read so far.
