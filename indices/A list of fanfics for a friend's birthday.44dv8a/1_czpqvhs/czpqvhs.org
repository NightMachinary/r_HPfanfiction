I have a few stories with ruthless, but not evil protagonists:

*Art of War*, linkffn(10179471), has Harry leading Hogwarts students in a very bloody uprising

*Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650), is a super Harry/Ginny story with lots of sex and violence.

*Children's Crusade*, linkffn(6989327), forces Harry/Ginny/Ron/Hermione to defeat Voldemort in another dimension.

*Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), lets a time traveling Harry build a kick-ass team with Bellatrix Black.

*Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), bashes almost everyone except the protagonists and a few others, ending is very unconventional.

*Harry Potter and the Spygirl*, linkffn(10959290), features Harry/Hermione as a killer couple.

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), shows what would happen if the wizengamot was stupid and sick enough to pass something like a marriage law.

*Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), deserves a special recommendation: the story setting is very AU, especially in the Muggle world where nuclear weapons were never developed and European countries were at each other's throat. In the wizarding world, James and Lily didn't trust Dumbledore at all, and they laid a nasty trap for Voldemort in their home. Predictably, the ever overconfident V stepped on the trap and got his body blown up. James and Lily then fled England to avoid Dumbledore's control, and had to move every few years. Incensed by all this hiding and running, a young Harry vowed to gain power and followers so he could one day force the wizarding world to leave them alone. He started by enrolling in the military academy after graduating from the high school...

The author has shown excellent knowledge in politics, strategy, and the art of war. The writing is also very good, and characterizations are great. Voldemort is still the key opponent in the story, and he is even more competent and intelligent than in the canon, but Harry is more than a match for him.
