The best fanfics I've ever read? That's highly subjective, but here are mine:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle]] - book 1 in the /Alexandra Quick/ series; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4684861/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Lands-Below][Alexandra Quick and the Lands Below]] - book 2; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784632/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Deathly-Regiment][Alexandra Quick and the Deathly Regiment]] - book 3; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7689884/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Stars-Above][Alexandra Quick and the Stars Above]] - book 4. These are, hands down, the best fanfics I have ever read.
