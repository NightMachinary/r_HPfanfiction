  Pansy wanted to turn in Harry because she was scared.

Of course she was. She wasn't a noble gryffindor. Marietta Edgecombe did worse to harry as a ravenclaw. What draco did in fear was worse cause he let a bunch of psycho terrorists into a school full of children. Pansy wanted to turn in one person to save herself, but through that she could save many. Basically people like attractive actors. In the movies draco, Hermione and snape were all more attractive than they are described in the books.
