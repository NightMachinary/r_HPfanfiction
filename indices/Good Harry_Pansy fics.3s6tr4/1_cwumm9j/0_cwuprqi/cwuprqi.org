Most people don't like pansy but like daphne. Pansy seems to be the antithesis of hermione in canon, xenophobe, dumb, ugly, dainty, and weak. Daphne on the other hand in most fics is a perfect oc. A better hermione because she's deviously smart. Truth be told Daphne and Harry fics are a guilty pleasure for me but I wish there were more pansy Harry fics. Why is Draco likable when is just as much of an annoying turd like pansy. it's baffling how its popular for Draco to be redeemable and a great character but not pansy.
