Well, to be fair to him, this Pansy story predates pretty much the entirety of the Daphne craze. A lot of his stories seem super cliche, but he was one of the first (if not a first) to incorporate a lot of them, and a lot of fics since then have merely gone with the same formula. So, pretty much, we can blame Jeconais (and a few other early authors) for a lot of the shitty cliches that get regurgitated in every other fic to this day. It's just a shame that this dude never really improved in his writing.
