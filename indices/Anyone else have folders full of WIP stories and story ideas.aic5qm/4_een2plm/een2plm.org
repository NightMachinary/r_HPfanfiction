Yeah, and I am honestly surprised when writers claim that they are out of ideas. I have more than enough to last five lifetimes if someone would bother to write all of them, and every time I read something which I think sucks or was abandoned, the pile grows. I mean, I started rereading "Blue Magic" on the commute home and already picked three ideas from that, not to mention a twerk to an existing one.

As for the WIPs, my production time is atrocious. The "quickest" I went from the drawing board to FFN was two months, and even that included recycling a few older snippets.
