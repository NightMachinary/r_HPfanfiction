[[http://sebsauvage.net/paste/?eef3396ebedac410#1EAI0ADZjk6sZHTaGXLDu89rUllYHsjvdipeguDFSgo=][Here's a relevant scene from the Sacrifices arc.]] (It's from book 4, so: spoilers!)

As a contextual background: This story's leitmotif is that everybody continuously tries to piss Harry off as much as possible, and Harry's trying to be all reserved and in control of his emotions and whatnot because he's super-powerful but doesn't want to use his powers to encroach on others' free will (however the author imagines that).
