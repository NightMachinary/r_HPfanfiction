I can't say I have any stories in which she dies just like that. I prefer either comedy or drama centred on character development, so I never was seeking out stories of this sort.

That being said, if her being humiliated is at least close to what you want, there's “Take no Umbridge” by Stephen Ratliff. It's a bit train-wrecky but it's enjoyable enough and it might prove itself helpful if there's no stuff of the sort you want.
