There's this fic linkffn(101 Ways to Kill Umbridge), though it's not very good.

There's generally a disturbing lack of passionate retribution in fanfiction in my opinion. I mean, I know that sadism and torture are normally frowned upon, but c'mon, we read like 500K words fics where Harry constantly suffers from the actions of multiple villains, and in the end all they get is having a bridge fall on them and die or something. It completely robs us of catharsis. WHY DON'T THE BAD GUYS EVER SUFFER AS MUCH AS THE GOOD GUYS DO?

I think of writing a fic where every character I hate just suffers a lot, but I need a lot of rage to fuel me enough to actually materialize it.
