Have the read /Elizium for the Sleepless Souls/? The final chapter is focuses on Dolores. It's not quite what you're looking for but you'd probably enjoy it. It will certainly make you dislike her more. If you haven't read the whole story yet, I strongly recommend it, it is a great story. linkffn(7713063)
