There's a pretty recent 6th-year "Haphne" story that I'm enjoying immensely, despite it being the first story of its author; he did have some minor problems with grammar and spelling at first, but it has become considerably better since he found a decent beta.

The story is quite good and more than a little promising so far, the characterization is notably well done and has some nice fresh twists and turns, plus it doesn't contain the Ice queen clichÃ© - in fact, as someone who has read like 90+% of the Harry/Daphne stories out there, I can say that the Daphne in this story is probably my absolute favorite. Harry is more open-minded (both about Slytherin and the whole light/dark thing in general), confident, hard-working, doesn't take sh*t from just anyone and considerably less whiny and simply more likeable than canon Harry.

Doesn't contain any adventure/war/battle scenes as of yet, but that will change eventually as Harry is actively preparing for the war.

Updates are consistent and fairly frequent. Anyway, long story short lol -> [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11022385/1/Cage-and-Key][Cage and Key]]
