  A lot of people claim Daphne is great because she's a blank slate in Slytherin so she can be that gorgeous forbidden type character

While I love Daphnr/Harry stories. Using a canon character that is a blank slate like Daphne, Tracy, Blaise etc. seems no different than creating an oc. It's basically tricking the people who don't like reading original characters. The only true canon facts about Daphne are she is female and slytherin and in Harry's year. The ice queen personality is kinda overdone. Just because she isn't outgoing explaining her not showing up in canon a lot. Doesn't mean she is docile or an ice bitch. Maybe she doesn't give a fuck about the war and is just living the shitty life she was given. Very few wizards and witches have any personality in canon outside of gryffindors. I hated that Harry didn't end up with anyone in slytherin or a muggle. It would've been nice to know for sure that all slytherins from Harry's generation were not evil instead of just assuming. The only slytherins that have redeeming qualities are from older generations. Like Sanpe or Narcissa. It would've been nice to see Harry be a little like dumbedore and reach out to the other side.
