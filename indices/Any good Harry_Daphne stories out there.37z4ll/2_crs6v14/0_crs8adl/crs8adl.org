Daphne Greengrass is a Slytherin girl in the same year as Harry. She is a pure blood, and has a sister, Astoria Greengrass, who marries Draco Malfoy after the series.

In fanfiction, she is generally regarded as an "ice queen", a cold-hearted /bitch/, who had no emotions and completely independent for everyone. She is said to be calculating, always having a plan in mind. She is friends with Tracy Davis.

Keep in mind, this is off the top of my head, and I'm generalizing based off of the numerous amount of fanfic about her^{don't hate me D:}.
