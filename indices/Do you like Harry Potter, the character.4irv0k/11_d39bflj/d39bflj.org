He's okay, relative to the series standard for character development and complex characterisation. I just find that it's difficult to be OOC when you're basically a walking plot device. Harry is exactly as curious as JKR needs him to be, most of the time, and exactly as angsty as she felt like writing at the time. It's inconsistent, but then again, so is a lot of her writing.

I notice it a lot more, now that I've grown up and had time to analyse the books, but it's not that Harry is especially bland, but that all of the characters are quite bland. The base /concept/ of the character isn't always the case, but they are usually quite shallow and lacking in development, and Harry's development is... all over the place. Inconsistent, and driven by the whim of the author, who admits to not re-reading her own work.

In order to be IC, Harry basically has to be a stooge of the plot. He needs to investigate things, but not be /too/ smart about it at any given time, or be curious about anything not involved with the plot. That's Hermione's job, and when she's not holding a plot-induced idiot ball or being just plain evil for no reason, I love her for it. Seriously, we have seven books about a /magic school/ and not once does JKR give a coherent model for the magic system. This should be wizardry 101, and it's something I figure Hermione should have known back-to-front by the first week. The Watsonian explanation is that Harry is terminally uncurious about his surroundings, and he somehow either missed that class, or never cared enough to think about it at all. I kind of hate that. The Doylesian explanation, however, is that JKR never stopped to work out how her magic worked, that class /never existed/ and she never rectified her mistake throughout seven. Damned. Books. Seriously, for books about magic school, this is unforgiveable, and it reflects badly on Harry's character in my eyes.

Additionally, Harry needs to be naive enough to not question anything the author hasn't figured out an answer to (like the aforementioned 'point-stick' model of magic that just works because it does). He needs to be /good/, but also do horrible things like casting Unforgiveable curses, and suffer no repercussions for doing so (god forbid he learn something from the experience). He needs to be /special/ when the plot demands, but not so special that he actually has power to change the status quo in a meaningful way. He needs to care, but not care enough to actually want to change things with any power he does manage to acquire. This is, incidentally, why the epilogue is such a wall banger for me - despite everything, the Wizarding World post-Potter is effectively the same closed-minded, racist backwater it always was, and Harry never did much to change it. Nobody did, despite nineteen years of intervening time. It's a depressingly bland idyll that hides ugliness and apathy, which reflects poorly on every character mentioned therein. Lastly, Harry needs to be a variable amount of famous depending on whether he's meant to be a living myth or an international celebrity today. It's all a crapshoot anyhow, so just write him how you feel like, at the moment you feel it. After all, that's what JKR did.

Maybe good fanfiction has made me bitter, but canon wasn't kind to Harry. He never really grew into his shoes, and had to rely on plot armour and Deus Ex Machina a lot in later books rather than having become good enough to have a fighting chance as an underdog. Maybe I just don't like passive protagonists. Because the series uses Harry as a proxy to show /everything/, the flaws of the series and the flaws of Harry are one and the same. Hell, at its base, he has some genuinely admirable qualities, like his bravery, snark... but looking back on it, I weep for all of the things we /could/ have learned about the Wizarding World had the protagonist been Hermione.
