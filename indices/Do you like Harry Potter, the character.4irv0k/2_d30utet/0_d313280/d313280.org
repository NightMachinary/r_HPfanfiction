  I also like his selflessness. Without even knowing you, he'd lay down his life for you in a second.

And you say this based on... what? pretty much every time he put his life in danger in canon it was for a personal stake, or for very close friends. I hate how authors take the phrase "saving people thing" and turn it to "Harry wouldn't let anybody die, no matter what! he'll take the cancer from a dying man so he won't die!", which is fucking bullshit. Harry has altruistic qualities, yes, but he's not Jesus. He hardly cares about his friends' problems, if you look into it. If he was one to die for others not to, he'd have given himself to Voldemort the minute he appeared at Hogwarts.

He wasn't in Hufflepuff because he's not exactly hard working, and not fair - as in, he doesn't mind cheating.

tl;dr stop flanderizing Harry.
