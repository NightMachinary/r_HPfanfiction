He didn't think to buy Ron a new wand in CoS. He barely notices how Hermione is high strung in PoA, and when he does, he barely cares. It's very rare for him to give his friends a good word. He's just not the kind a guy who cares about everyone's problems, since he has enough of his own.

  Ultimately, he did die for the Wizarding World.

Debatable. He only decided to go to Voldemort when he realized he was a Horcrux. He died to kill Voldemort, which is pretty important for the wizarding world, but it's more of a personal conflict, in my opinion. Rowling herself said that, had Harry looked into the Mirror of Erised by the time of DH, all that he would see is Voldemort finished.

During the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry lets others fight and die for him, which goes completely against what the original poster said. If he gave himself up, Voldemort would've probably left the population of Hogwarts alone, which is not something that can be said about the Ministry takeover. Again, I'm not saying Harry would not give his life to save others, but he wouldn't give his life just for anyone and any purpose, like the original poster said. He knows his value, he recognizes his purpose, and he would only lay down his life for that to succeed.
