  Seems like a lot of writers spend most of their time making Harry how they want him to be

Of course we do. Many of us like different things, and want to tell different stories. Those stories usually need a character more proactive than canon!Harry is shown to be. Also, if an author didn't change Harry to suit the story, they would be accused of sticking too much to canon and thus being boring.

Also, our experiences shape the majority of our personality. The lessons we learn early in life shape our decisions going forward. If you change Harry's situation at an early stage in his life and he does not change because of that situation, there was no point in putting him in that situation in the first place. There would be no point in AUs, because changing the situation would do nothing to change the character.

Finally, a lot of writers are bad writers and can't do proper characterization. Thus, they don't count.
