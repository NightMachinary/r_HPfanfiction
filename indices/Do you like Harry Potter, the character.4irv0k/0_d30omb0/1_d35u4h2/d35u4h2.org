Don't forget snarky and sarcastic. One of my favorite things about Harry as a character is that in a lot of ways he is just a normal teenager who happens to have terrible luck. He's not infallible he's not perfect. And yeah I agree at the end of the day he is pretty selfless.

Example oh hey by the way there's this girl in the dungeon you have to save her from this huge monster snake yeah no problem

Evil professor and nobody thinks he's a danger totally going to go protect that stone.

He just jumps to the cause. Yes sometimes it's unrealistic, but that doesn't mean that it's not good
