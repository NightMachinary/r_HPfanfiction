I legitimately love Harry, honestly. He really is my favourite character in the series, and I know that's not really a common thought.

JKR did sometimes write Harry as simply a lens to view the world by or an engine to advance the plot rather than as his own character, but by no means did that mean his character wasn't there.

Harry's a favourite of mine because he's this kid who just feels the need to do what is right, despite any hardship he has or will experience along the way, and I really love that about him: he devotes his entire life to surviving and helping others survive, and I deeply appreciate that about his character.

It's definitely not a life that's made easy for him, but it's one he goes on with, and that's part of why the fics where Harry suddenly becomes selfish and only self-concerned upset me so much - it's simply not in his NATURE to completely give up thinking about everyone else and just get out of dodge. If it were, he would have done, and I bet he wished a dozen times he could just cut himself off.

But he can't. He couldn't. He'd never.

Speccy little shit. I love him.
