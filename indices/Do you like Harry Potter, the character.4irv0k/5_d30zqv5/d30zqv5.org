He's one of my favorite characters. He's tough, smart, a smartass, decent, brave, relentless, and forgiving. My favorite part is that he can be all these things while still being incredibly flawed. He's got a bad temper and an out-of-control mouth. He's reckless. He procrastinates about important stuff. He can be oblivious about people/things if they're not directly in his line of sight/part of a mystery. For better or worse, sometimes, he just doesn't listen to anybody. He's a total hero while still being edgy and frustrating enough to be totally human.

I wish there was lot more IC Harry fics. So many just turn him into a cliche. It's like they're trying to spice him up, but it usually just comes out boring and predictable.
