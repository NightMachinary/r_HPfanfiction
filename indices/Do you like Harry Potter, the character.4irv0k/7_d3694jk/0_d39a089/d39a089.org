Preach it! He's basically as curious as he needs to be for the plot to advance, and even then, he's generally a passive observer with little to no motivation beyond the present situation. Goddamn it, I used to really like him, but these days I can't help noticing how hollow most of the characters actually are in canon. It's all stereotypes and JKR's weird fixation on categorizing people into into cliques.
