Lmao, exactly. Dumbledore noped that philosophy almost immediately after Arianna and even then, he never approved of violence---always a pacifist at heart.

Grindelwald is an interesting character to say the least. I wouldn't say he was evil per say, but he definitely had sociopathic tendencies and was machiavellian to an extreme. Also, it's never been confirmed in canon, but I'm sure going after the Elder Wand and then trying to maximize it's destructive capabilities probably gave him a “God-Complex” which definitely fostered a detachment from the physical world and furthered his already frighteningly clinical “Greater Good” philosophy.

Authors always assume that Dumbledore is some sort of “Emperor Palpatine-esque” figure that tries to manipulate everyone from the shadows and wants to be some sort of supreme, deity-likefigure when he's really just a flawed, but well-intentioned man with, arguably, too much weight on his shoulders.

Fantastic Beast series is pretty okay. Not perfect but it definitely has some memorable moments. I'm not a huge fan of their physical depiction of Grindelwald, but Johnny Depp went all out with that character and I appreciate that quite a bit. The movies do a good job at showing how OP characters like Grindelwald and Dumbledore are; nobody can even contend with Grindelwald much less attempt to capture or kill him. Also lends credence to the fact that Grindelwald and Dumbledore were equals since a lot of people, even in this fandom, like to think that Grindelwald was some cheesy villain that Dumbledore defeated with ease. It's pretty obvious in the movie that the outcome of a duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald is up-for-grabs---so to speak, and that most of Europe is pretty desperate for literally ANYBODY to save them---in this case, Dumbledore.

Look forward to reading that story! Let me know if you have any other good Grindelwald stories to recommend!
