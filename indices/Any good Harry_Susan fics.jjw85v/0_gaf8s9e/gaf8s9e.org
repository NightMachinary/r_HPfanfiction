People usually suggest “Not the Only Redhead by joemjackson” linkffn(3882344), but I have to admit that I have never found a Harry/Susan story which would really made me happy. Not that I would have some fundamental objections to the ship, but just it seems like all those stories are essentially cliches without much character and even less of its development.
