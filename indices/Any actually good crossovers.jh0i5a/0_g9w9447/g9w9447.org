I just finished reading one which was a crossover with Battlestar Galactica despite never having watched the thing. I think it's good because I got the story even without Battlestar Galactica knowledge.

I'm currently reading one that is a crossover with Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Now FMA:B is something I watched and really loved. I am enjoying it so far. I'm not sure though if someone without FMA:B knowledge would get all of the details.
