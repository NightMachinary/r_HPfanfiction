I'm glad you enjoyed it! GoWithTheFlo20 is probably one of my favourite writers. They always manage to hook me in on the first chapter and I often find myself going back to reread their works. As much as I love their writing, I do get sad that all their works on ffnet are short and ongoing. I just have to keep hope they find the inspiration to complete one. But you should definitely check out their other fics - I'm sure you'd enjoy them too :)
