I second the Holly Potter rec. Sure, she's OP, and while her flaws seem to seamlessly complement all the Avengers in a too-perfect manner, it's still a fun romp with plenty of plot. I only wish it were broken up into actual arcs instead of one endless tale. My attention tends to wane around 200k words regardless of how much or little is happening in a fic.
