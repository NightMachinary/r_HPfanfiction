Linkffn(the girl who loved by darth drafter, violence inherent in the system by darth drafter) sailor moon and ranma 1/2 crossover. Harry apperates to the pools of sorrow and falls into the pool of sailor moon. Later accidental magic releases her soul from the pool and the story moves back to Japan before going to hogwarts. It's one of my favourite Crossovers.
