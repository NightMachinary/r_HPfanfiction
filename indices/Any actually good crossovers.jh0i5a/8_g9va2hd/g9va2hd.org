I mean, 'good' is super subjective. I enjoyed a few of the ones suggested to me when I asked a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jem3y1/i_am_a_sucker_for_well_written_crossovers/][similar question]] a few days ago.

linkao3(1113600) - Sherlock. Fascinating world building. Mild slashfic, though, if you're averse.

linkao3(1134255) - Sherlock. Also fascinating world building. Also mild slashfic.

linkao3(7353028) - Pokemon. Crack sort of treated seriously? I was not expecting to like this, but I did. HP/Luna pairing, but that's really not the point of the fic /at all./

linkffn(11426651) - Avengers/MCU. One of those fics where I'm left wanting MOAR of the author's vision.
