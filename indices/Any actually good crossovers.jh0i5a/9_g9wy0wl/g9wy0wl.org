It's x*Katekyo Hitman Reborn!*; the crossover provides an alternative magic system (in this case it's just 'deeper'/lost magic)... the main draw for me is the Author's way of writing and through that the way the story is told. I do also enjoy curbstomp fics so that's also nice...

But the main attraction when considering it as a crossover is that it's very attached to canon, first Harry Potter-story is gone through, then it transitions to Hitman's story... while excusing all the bullshit^{while fixing it} with old senile men in unquestioned leader positions combined with corruption/greed/cowardice.

There exists so many different types of Crossovers, but I do enjoy the ones where the things fused aren't trust forward.
