/Vox Corporis/ was... okay until Harry went to Hermione's for summer. I just couldn't buy it. I don't think Dumbledore would ever agree to that. It's also obvious in some parts that the writer is unfamiliar with certain aspects of canon. I don't mean the H/Hr relationship -- that's fine, whatever. But certain facts are just wrong. I also find it bizarre that this fic follows the films more than the actual books. I wouldn't mind if they used both as a reference point, but I can't get past that.
