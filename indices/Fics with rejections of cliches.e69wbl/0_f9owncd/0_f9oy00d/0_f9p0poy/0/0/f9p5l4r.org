I dropped it somewhere around chapter 80 because I got really bored with it, so I can only talk about up to that point, but yea, from what I remember the bashing kept going. But I gotta say that the James bashing never felt over the top or unreasonable to me. He deserved it. So that played no part in me dropping the fic.
