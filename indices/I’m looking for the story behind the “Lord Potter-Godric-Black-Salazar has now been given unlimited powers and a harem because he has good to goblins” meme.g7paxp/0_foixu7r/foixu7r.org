I'd like to think it's the prompt in this sub, you can find it at ”top posts” it's called something like ”how to write the most over done fanfiction” I doubt it being the /original/ idea that begun it but linkffn(king of magic) is kind of a pile of clicheness and sh*t and oh I gotta apologise for linking that monstrosity

Thanks for reading my disjointed train of thought
