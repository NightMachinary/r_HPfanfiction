For clarity, when you say silent, does that mean the portrait would never have dialogue?

I think it'd be hard to keep Voldemort true to character in this, given that I can't fathom a reason he'd keep a portrait of anyone with him to begin with that keeps him in character. I would read this, though, if it were well enough done.
