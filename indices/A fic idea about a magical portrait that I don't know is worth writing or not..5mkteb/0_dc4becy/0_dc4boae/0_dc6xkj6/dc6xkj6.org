Would Voldemort have discovered the portrait when he was at Hogwarts? Because from the way that you've worded things there, it sounds like he might have. That could work very well -- maybe he would have had something in common with the subject, somehow, and decided to keep it around.

Regardless of how you go about it, though, it sounds like a very neat little idea. I hope that you decide to go for it someday.
