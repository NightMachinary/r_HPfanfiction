Yes. The plan is for the portrait to never have dialogue. As for Voldemort, I've played around with the idea of a powerful-powerless thing a little bit. How the most powerful of the wizards used to be less powerful than the most powerless of magical objects mere years ago, and that makes him feel oddly sympathetic for a small moment. There are a couple of other ideas too that I'll experiment with if I end up writing it.
