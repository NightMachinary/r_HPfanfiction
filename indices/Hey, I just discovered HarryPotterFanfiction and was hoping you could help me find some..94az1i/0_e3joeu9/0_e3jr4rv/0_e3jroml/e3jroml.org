No worries the whole purpose of this subreddit is to recommend and discuss Harry Potter fanfiction. I would have given you specific recommendations, but I don't really read much Fleur.

Although I will say I really think you may enjoy the Lie I've Lived by jbern ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived]]) which features Harry/Fleur. This was the second Harry/Fleur (that I ever read) and I enjoyed it for the most part. The character of the Sorting Hat is worth reading it for alone, it is hilarious.

Summary: Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
