We could probably spend a weekend and upload an edited version so it doesn't destroy people to read it. Haha! We kept the fic in rawest form to give a nod to some of the worst garbage we have read and recorded from other fanfic writers.

Glad to hear that you're still enjoying the story regardless of Nate's horrendous spelling!
