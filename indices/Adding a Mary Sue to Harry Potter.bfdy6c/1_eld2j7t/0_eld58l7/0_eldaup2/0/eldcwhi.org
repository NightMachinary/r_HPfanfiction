The original spelling for her name was von Huffleclaw Slitherdor, but I messed up when first writing her name and it stuck throughout the whole fanfic. Hahaha! There was a lot more that was supposed to go in, like a random flashback to when the four founders raised her and then sent her to live in an orphanage in New York City, which was meant to clash with her memory of her parents. Buuuuut.... We forgot about that tidbit too while writing.
