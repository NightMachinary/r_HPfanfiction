Hermione-critical/bashing fics, because I'm a sock account who's only purpose is to take shots at the beloved princess of the fandom. ðŸ™„

Here's the recs.

(Disclaimer: Some are Ron-centric and some might not be favourable to Harry either.)

-I enjoyed Chilord's Sekrit Projekt fic: [[http://reader.7thpylon.com/chilord/sekrit-projekt.html]]. Harry and Ron are the stars of the fic and Hermione isn't so much outright bashed, but it definitely calls out her unpleasant behaviour. There's a Tracey/Ron shiptease that I liked. Unfortunately, it'll never be completed.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5858832/1/]]) Hermione's one-sided job interview. A bit unrealistic but then again so are most bash fics. ðŸ¤·

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die]]) has 58-year-old Harry and Ron go back to their 4th year. Hilarity ensues. Does contain some Ginny-bashing. (WARNING: ENDGAME HINNY!)

This community on FFN has some good fics as well: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/]]

-This fic has a Hermione with a Dumbledore-is-always-right attitude that forces Harry and even Ron to keep her out of the loop for quite a long time. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776013/1/Blood-of-the-Phoenix]])

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11378607/1/]]) Has McGonagall talk to Hermione about her long essays and tells her to cut them down. Hermione ignores her and continues to do whatever she wants.

-linkffn([[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]]) Hermione isn't outright bashed nor is it a big part of the story. It's more about how she would fail to cope in the real world.

-linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18935341/chapters/44954569]]) Hermione faces consequences for the bird attack in 6th year. Borders on bashing at times. Alternating POVs.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12942112/1/]]). PeggySue!Ron POV. Not favourable to Hermione (or Harry at times).

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10434054/1/Not-the-Smartest-Witch]]) Hermione is not as smart as she portrays herself to be. One-shot.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13318530/1/Broken]]), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346]]) SELF-PROMO! where Ron choses not to date Hermione. It's Hermione-critical, but Ron is also self-deprecating.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13204936/1/Hermione-Granger-and-The-Obliviated-Parents]]) Hermione un-Obliviates her parents. They only /pretend/ to take it well.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/1/Loose-Cannon]]) It doesn't focus on bashing, but it portrays Hermione as not perfect and definitely outlines her flaws.

-linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12613015/1/]]) is another one. Fem!Harry, Ron's a good friend, Hermione goes insane.
