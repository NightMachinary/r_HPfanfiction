Those are two storys, but to understand Sunrise you have to read Sunset.

It starts in the summer after the incident in the MoM in OotP. Harry is ill and has some overdue magical sickness what he should have been at 11 years old, but due to the mistreatment of the Dursleys it delayed. After that sickness he is the most powerful wizard in the world. But the prophecy is still there. And more will come. Voldemort takes over Britain and Harry and his friends have to flee from Britain and seek shelter in Ireland. Meanwhile Voldemort gets as powerful as Harry through dark rituals. DD and Snape will be bashed mercilessly, including Ron and Molly. Other part of the Weasleys have to take a more difficult route.

Most iconic pairings: H/Hr, DM/LG, RL/NT, GW/NL First chapters are thought, but the writing will get better and better. Including International Affairs, Muggle politics, Military, ICW, Rituals, Ghosts, a new school, House Elves and many many more. You won't regret the read.
