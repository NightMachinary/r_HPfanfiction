[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path][Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path]]

As the title suggests, its about runes. Harry became a savant in Ancient Runes after discovering his mother's trunk. Fair warning, the story involves harem, lemons and homosexuality. It also mentioned a plot hole from canon. Something that might have happened and wrecked havoc in Magical Britain.
