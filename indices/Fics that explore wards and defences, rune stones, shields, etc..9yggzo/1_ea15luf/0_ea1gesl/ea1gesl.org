While probably the best harem story around, it really suffered from the inclusion of Daphne Greengrass to the story itself and the "harem". It would have been way better as Harry/Hermione story who at some point decide to have a four-way with Fleur/Tonks, like what is going on and turn it into a relationship.

Only lesbian relationships appear "on-screen", so don't worry about weird ships with War Criminals like Snape or Malfoy.
