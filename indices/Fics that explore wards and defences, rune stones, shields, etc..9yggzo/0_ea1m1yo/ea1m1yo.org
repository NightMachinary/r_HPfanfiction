Linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure by jbern): has Harry spending the summer training as a curse-breaker with Bill in Brazil. It's 2nd person, but I have found if you listen to it on the app it's a lot better.

Linkffn(The One He Feared): has the best curse-breaking scene in the second chapter.

Linkffn(Black Luminary): Harry has something of a specialization in defensive charms in general.

Linkffn(A Black Comedy) has a subplot around breaking down wards and defenses.

Linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) has a few arcs about defenses and runes.
