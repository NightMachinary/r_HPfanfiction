This is a short excerpt I wrote:

[Hogwarts, September 7th, 1998]

Ginny: It's not getting better, a Hufflepuff second year blew out her dorm door last night. At this rate, someone will get badly hurt sooner or later.

Hermione: We need to find a psychologist soon. There must be a squib or two who work that field. If there aren't any here in Britain, I'm sure I can find some in other English speaking countries.

Ginny: I don't know how that Muggle psycho thing works, but I can guarantee you won't find any for tonight, which we need!

Luna: We can try a big sleepover in the Great Hall or in the Room of Requirement? Lots of people together can keep both Nargles and Others away.

Ginny: Others?

Luna: Yes, terrible tiny creatures that infest your mind. Every Death Eater and Snatcher I saw at Malfoy Manor had swarms of them.

She shuddered, Hermione and Ginny stayed very still.

Luna: Anyway, consider my suggestion. It wouldn't hurt.

Hermione: Bringing both boys and girls together, or should we separate the room?

Luna: Of course everyone should be together, it's not like they are going to have orgies.

Hermione: Luna!

--------------

Eventually, Hermione found a squib psychologist in Canada after two months. The therapy and counseling worked in a limited fashion, some got better, but many didn't.

This is postwar, this is not the innocent Luna from Year 6 and prior. She has suffered, she has seen suffering, she has seen many deaths, and she has killed.

I think by this point, most DA members are already using sex as a way to cope with their trauma, and some could be rather daring. Luna is no exception and she never shies away from speaking what's on her mind.
