Your appreciation for Puzzle makes me think you might enjoy this very short Snape/Lily fic by someone who left HP fandom years ago. It was posted in 2006, so the Lily reveal hadn't happened yet, and their "friendship" is tense and twisted (well, Snape's side of it, anyway). It has some of the poetic bitterness that infuses Puzzle.
