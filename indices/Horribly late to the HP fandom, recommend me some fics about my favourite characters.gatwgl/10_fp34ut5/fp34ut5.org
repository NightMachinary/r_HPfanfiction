[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/kelly_chambliss/pseuds/kelly_chambliss/works?fandom_id=136512][kelly_chambliss]] has written a lot of excellent Snape/McGonagall, some of it dark, some romantic, some amusing. She also writes lovely femslash ships among the Hogwarts staff and their contemporaries. The fics tend to be on the shorter side, though.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Squibstress/pseuds/Squibstress/works?fandom_id=136512][Squibstress]] has written a dozen Snape/McGonagall fics and another dozen for McGonagall/Dumbledore, including this epic series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/9046][Epithalamium]]

Dueltastic has a fair bit of Snape/McGonagall in her non-archived catalogue, and only a few have been posted to AO3. They're all archive-locked. I love her dry wit and brisk style. The longest is also a kidfic. I'm usually somewhat allergic to kidfic, but even I read it all the way through: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1018314/chapters/2024840][Circumstances of a Small and Accidental Nature]]

Two of my favorites of hers are a linked pair of Aberforth/Minerva/Severus fics that I love a lot, and I can post links if you're interested. The slash content is blink-and-you'll-miss it, but it's definitely a domestic threesome.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13844247/chapters/31840572][Come Once Again and Love Me]] by laventadorn is an excellent Snape/Lily fic in a more optimistic do-over vein, in contrast to the already recced (and amazing) Puzzle.

This might be something of an odd bird in answer to your request, and it's got mixed het & slash content, if that's an issue for you. It's basically a character study of young Professor Snape and a portrayal of the ways in which he's so fundamentally broken that his canon fate is inevitable. The pairings are Snape/McGonagall and Snape/Moody, and it's excellent.
