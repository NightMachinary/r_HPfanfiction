You /did/ say it wasn't a rhetorical question. Truthfully, I don't feel this is the best place for this conversation. It's a request thread - not a bashing or discussion thread. That being said, to answer your question, some people aren't looking healthy ships when reading fiction. They're looking for what they find interesting. This could include ships with serious power differentials, on opposite sides, or various other complications.

If you prefer ships which originate from friendship, are in the same age group, and so on... Great. That's good for you. It doesn't mean there's something wrong with people who disagree, any more than people should be shamed for picking the mean option in a video game. It's just two different ways of enjoying fiction. It's not hurting anyone.

I don't even really ship anything in this thread, though I've read of the odd Draco/Luna, but I also don't feel like people should be made to defend what's entirely subjective in the first place.
