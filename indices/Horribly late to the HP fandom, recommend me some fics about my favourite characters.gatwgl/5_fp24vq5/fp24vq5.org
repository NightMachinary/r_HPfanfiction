Snape mentors Harry: linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower; The King's Indian Attack by Nectere)

Severitus (Snape adopts Harry): linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville)

Petunia as a good mum/mentor to Harry: linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider by Starfox5)

Really nice character piece on Snape, probably one of the best I've read: linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi)

Big worldbuilding/time travel fic. Snape / character who has time traveled; it's essentially Snape/OC imo. linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part I)
