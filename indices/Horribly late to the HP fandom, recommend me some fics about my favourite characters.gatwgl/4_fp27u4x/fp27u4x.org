For McGonagall/Snape, I feel like it only works in some fanfics, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6703155/1/The-First-Cut-is-the-Deepest]]) is probably the best - it's set in the first war, and actually takes time to develop the characters/romance. ~150,000 words, and I believe there is a sequel.

A great McGonagall and general Staff Centric fic that's about them dealing with Umbridge in 5th year is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/Just-a-Random-Tuesday]]). ~58,000 words, 3 chapters.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary]]) is a great Luna centric fic - it starts off with a bit of a silly premise of 'What if Luna finds Tom Riddle's Diary' but slowly develops into a funny and sweet story. ~72,000 words.

Then there is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus]]). White Squirrel is an author who is often recommended, and you should definitely check out their other stories. This one in the later years contains some great Harry/Luna, but it's worth the read. ~700,000 words, with a ~170,000 word sequel still being updated.
