For McGonagall/Snape relationship (nothing romantic there, the difference in age of like forty years make my stomach funny when thinking about their romance) I suggest linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities;Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities), where unfortunately the main (Harmony) relationship is the weakest part of whole story, but side-characters (Percy, McGonagall/Snape, Fred & George Weasley) are really outstanding.
