This isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it's similar. I stead of time travel, Harry goes to an alternate reality where Neville is the BWL. It doesn't really focus in the war and Voldemort, but rather in Harry learning to be vulnerable with his newly alive family and dealing with his trauma.
