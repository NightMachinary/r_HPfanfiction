I honestly have not listened to your work yet. I definitely know how long it can take to edit multiple channels together. When I was working on a podcast it would take me hours to edit out the empty sounds, or removing people talking over each other...or removing language I didn't want in it. It could take me up to 8 hours to edit only 1-1.5 hours of recording. What audio editing software are you using and what mic are you using?
