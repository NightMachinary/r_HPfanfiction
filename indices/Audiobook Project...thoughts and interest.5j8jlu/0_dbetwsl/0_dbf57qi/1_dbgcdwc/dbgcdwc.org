Don't worry, I'm not offended, and yes, those are things I probably should learn. I tried to incorporate voices throughout my work but I found that editing the individual lines in was incredibly time consuming, so I'm just going to read it myself, with the dialogue in my original voice, which I'm aware can sometimes steal from the immersion factor, due to my American accent.

Yes, I am working on learning audio editing, the pacing (by "pacing" I assume you're talking about the incredibly long pauses) was completely my fault, and I apologize for that.

I wish you the best of luck in your project, Laika.
