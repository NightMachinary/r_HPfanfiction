As someone who has read the whole thing, it does get better in the latter end (I don't remember when specifically, but there was a point where it just sorta clicked into place and it became way less of a slog), and I definitely don't regret taking the time to read it all, but there are better fics out there to spend the time reading. Including by him, like Notus said. :D

Also, his actual novels are pretty fun too. He has a website for them, under Joe Ducie.
