It's been so long I really can't remember what trial you are talking about. I just really want him to have shorter chapter and get more stuff in, I could have done without the Bellatrix stuff, they've already pissed off the Dementors, and are about to break an ancient treaty with them, apparently unknown to everyone. My favorite part right now is the Regulus backstory, shit is stupid good intense
