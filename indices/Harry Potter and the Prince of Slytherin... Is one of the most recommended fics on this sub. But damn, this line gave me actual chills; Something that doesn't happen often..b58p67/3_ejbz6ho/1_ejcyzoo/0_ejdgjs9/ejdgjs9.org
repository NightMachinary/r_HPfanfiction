i think because its so stilted. i mean, its been what the past 8 chapters one every 3 weeks of interogating Lestrange and the background world moving to that? it gets old. back when i was catching up 500k words or whatever, it went so fast that taking 5 chapters to do a day wasn't boring at all

(just the series by mauraderlover7 - it feels like a character study of each character per book, but by gods the woe is me sirius black did start to bore me (too much angst) when we were getting a chapter every month with no plot development (thankfully i think we're past that)

n.b i still read them every couple of sundays when they update because im invested in the plot which i enjoy and they're some of the few fanfictions that i think actually have good writing. im no longer 13 and tolerate terrible terrible writing, i can't stand YA style anymore so i enjoy these. written by adults for adults with adult sentence structure
