You make a good point about the posting schedule thing and I'm not talking about this story specifically but amateur writing in general.

That's why I have a hard time staying with in progress stories to the end and only pick some of them up again after they have been completed.

Some authors definitely have a talent for keeping their readers entertained despite the long wait-times in between chapter updates, but others fail utterly at that. The list of stories I want to pick up again at some point is in the hundreds, sadly two thirds of those are probably silently abandoned.
