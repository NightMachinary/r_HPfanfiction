  Ps While my theory of it being partially caused by the horucrux isnt confirmed or denied, i just remebered that theres also another in story explanation of it that is confirmed, but if you hadn't read the fic I'm not going to spoil as it's a pretty good plot point

It's more than a good plot point, it's an exploration of something that in canon was treated as disposable but which /ought/ to have been given more consideration and the way it's suitably considered in this fic is entirely /brilliant/.
