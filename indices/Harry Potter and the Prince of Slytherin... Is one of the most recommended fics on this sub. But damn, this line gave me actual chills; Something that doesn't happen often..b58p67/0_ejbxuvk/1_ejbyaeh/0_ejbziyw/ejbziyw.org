The explanation is actually /really/ neat but, ultimately, just a way for the author to explain away his lack of desire to write 11-year-old children's dialogue as if... they were 11-year-old children.

Which is fine, and well done. I only mention it in that way because I don't think it's a "pretty good plot point." An interenting concept, but certainly not anything which, so far in my reading of 150k words in, of much import.

The idea is that wizarding children do /not/ go to any kind of schooling before Hogwarts. Instead, there are potions which have been designed to instantly impart knowledge of certain subjects to children. The drawbacks being that potions cannot impart any /magical/ knowledge and that the knowledge they impart is rather limited to the time period that they were created. For instance, a knowledge potion for physics would be almost entirely pointless as the understanding of the person who created it is outdated by about 200 years.

The potion which teaches children literacy, writing and language for English was... well, designed in the 1800s, so their language (at least, for those who aren't very social children and therefore cannot evolve it through natural communication) is rather formal and, obviously, not like an 11-year-old at all.

They also mention that these potions exist for other language such as German but that they have very old (1800s) accents, or some such.
