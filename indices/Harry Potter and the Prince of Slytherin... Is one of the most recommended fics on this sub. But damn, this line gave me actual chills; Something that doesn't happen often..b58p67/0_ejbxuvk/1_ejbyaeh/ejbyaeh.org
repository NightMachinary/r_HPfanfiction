To be fair, in this story, alot of this is implied to be caused by the horucrux shard (though it's not confirmed so that's just a theory) and even in story i think they bring up how harry knows the meaning of words that hes sure hes never heard before, it actually shakes him up a bit when he realizes it.

Ps While my theory of it being partially caused by the horucrux isnt confirmed or denied, i just remebered that theres also another in story explanation of it that is confirmed, but if you hadn't read the fic I'm not going to spoil as it's a pretty good plot point

PPS Also the potions, forgot about those honestly lol, but yeah the commenter down below got it right as well with the Author Notes just flat out saying he didnt want to write 11 year old dialogue, but the "pretty good plot point" I referenced is more about Harry's speech specifically but yeah please dont spoil here if you know it, PoS is a really good story so I want as many people to want to read it as possible.
