Hermione bit her lip. “Harry, I bet you can't do wandless magic anyways. We learn that in 7th year!”

Harry's eyes glinted with determination. He took out his wand.

“/Diffindo!/”

Hermione shrieked. “/What the fuck, Harry!/” A stream of blood was dripping from Harry's wrist. Directly into his glass of pumpkin juice.

“Hermione. I swear on my life and magic that I can do wandless magic. So mote it be.” Harry then downed the now bloody glass of pumpkin juice, his wrist still leaking with blood.

“Does that even work?” Ron asked. “That's /so/ broken.”

The blood was spilling into her personal space. Hermione panicked.

“You need to go to Madam Pomphrey! Do you even know any healing spells!?”

With a sizzle, Harry cauterized his wound. He stood up, leaving the silent table.

/This/ is why she didn't talk to Harry.
