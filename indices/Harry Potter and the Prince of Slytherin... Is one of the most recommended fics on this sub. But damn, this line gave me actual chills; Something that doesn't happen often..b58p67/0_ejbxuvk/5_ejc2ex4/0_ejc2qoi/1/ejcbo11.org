I mean I agree with stupidity of all those Lord Potters speaking like that (and yes, Marauder-era stories tend to be more sensible), but there is still too much I don't care on Marauder-era stories, that I will stay with (mostly) cannon and post-cannon stories (and historical ones, but that's another point).
