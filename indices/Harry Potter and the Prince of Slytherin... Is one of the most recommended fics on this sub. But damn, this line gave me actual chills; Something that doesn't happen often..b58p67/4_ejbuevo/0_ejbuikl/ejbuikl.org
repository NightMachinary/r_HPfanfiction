The story was far from finished when I last read it and followed it. I let it sit for a year or so, getting updates about it in my email before I decided to give it a read. So, I'm sorry to say, I don't know - because I've just started reading it again a few hours ago.

There is an Author's Note at the beginning, though, which states that there will be no pairings for anyone below fourth-year so, presumably, the answer is no (It's currently in third-year). That AN also states that the pairing, if there is one, won't be slash, if that's a concern.
