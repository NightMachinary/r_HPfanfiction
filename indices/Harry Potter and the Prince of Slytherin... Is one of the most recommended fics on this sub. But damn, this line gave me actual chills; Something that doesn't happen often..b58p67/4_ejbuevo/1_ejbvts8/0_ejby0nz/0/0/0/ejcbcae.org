Honestly, their relationship, romantic or not, has been pretty poorly developed, imo. They've barely interacted since first year, but every time they do, the narration falls over itself to remind us of what great friends they are. The whole thing reeks of "I Picked the Main Pairing Early On But I Forgot to Develop the Relationship" syndrome, if you ask me. Which . . . no one did.
