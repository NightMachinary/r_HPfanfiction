Here are my annotations: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lPG2TpL9a-t6q7TqMLQSbFiZy4yzYwwQ5oJ2KErWd6U/edit?usp=sharing][chapter 1]]

Generally I have a bit of a problem with this story, and it is that it feels like you constantly try to sound smart, smarter than you are. And you really try hard to do this.

Don't! Don't use long words and complex sentences to make your characters sound smart, do it with simple sentences that convery a lot of meaning! I mean look at this:

#+begin_quote
  Albus feels a fleeting emotion inside him, an adrenalized sensation that comes and goes in a single heartbeat without leaving proof of its existence.
#+end_quote

It basically says /nothing/ about how Albus feels, but it uses the words 'fleeting', 'emotion', 'adrenalized', 'existence'. Four heavy words, yet no meaning. That's not cool.

One thing that stuck out story-wise:

Have you watched the fantastic beasts movie? If not, I highly recommend it, if you don't want to annoy everyone who liked it.

Ariana is kinda explained there: She is an Obscurial. If you don't know that word, then definitely watch the movie. It explains so much about Gellert and Ariana, and what happened back then.

#+begin_quote
  It's something Albus has come to cherish, for her disabilities make her something quite different from their brother, Aberforth.
#+end_quote

She is learning Occlumency in in that scene, a mind-art that (as we're repeatedly told by Snape) requires control have. Look at the description of her given by Aberforth:

#+begin_quote
  It destroyed her, what they did: she was never right again. She wouldn't use magic, but she couldn't get rid of it; it turned her inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless
#+end_quote

This doesn't sound like someone who uses magic to protect his mind, this sounds closer to an Obscurial, and they usually don't willingly use magic.
