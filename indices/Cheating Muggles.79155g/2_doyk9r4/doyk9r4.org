just use the imperius on a very rich muggle - nobody cares about muggles anyway - and get them to give you all their money. Or force the people in charge of fort knox or something to give you all the gold. Or sell them a hangover potion and make millions. Or at least make platinum since gold and silver are the impossible ones. Or make cocaine in huge quantities and sell it after magically sabotaging muggle smuggling routes. Apparate into a bank vault or set a niffler free like in Fantastic beasts, then shake it empty. Kidnap someone important by apparating in and out, then ask for money to release them. Obliviate the apparition, they'll explain it away by having been drugged. There are so many options, why would you settle for copper? Last time I took all the wiring out of a house I was renovating, it was worth like 2 dollars.
