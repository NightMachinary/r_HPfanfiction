You would need tons of different numbered notes to duplicate, is my point. At any given time, half of your funds in that strategy would be actual notes, which defeats the point of trying to get rich by duplication. It would probably just be faster to sit in the middle of the City of London, and use fucking /Accio Money/ on passersby.
