Plutonium is a man-made element, so getting your hands on an initial seed would be difficult (assuming you weren't willing to steal from muggles). But you /could/ get a tiny amount of U-235 from a mass spectrometer, and duplicate from there. Of course, there's no way to sell it back to the muggles without attracting a ton of unanswerable questions, so the only real use is if you want to make an atomic bomb or a reactor.
