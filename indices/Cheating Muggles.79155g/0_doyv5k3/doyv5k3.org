There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6pxd4b/discussionrequest_wizardsharry_taking_advantage/][a similar discussion]] here a few months ago, and it seemed that nothing in the Canon prevented them from doing so. The exchange rate from Pound to Galleon also looked super favorable at 5:1 during the 90s.

My opinion is that they could easily memory charm their way to the top. For example, it should be quite easy to 'convince' the board of directors to grant you tons of stock options for your 'valuable consulting work' for the company. You might as well do something for the company after all, such as 'obtaining' lucrative deals, favorable court decisions, and easy government approvals/certifications.

Wizards casually memory charmed Muggles throughout the Series, and were never caught. I doubt the various Ministries would really care. After all, Oblivate and planting false memories were the cornerstone of maintaining the SoS. As long as they do not flaunt flashy spells in the public, they should be fine.

Beside memory charms, there are plenty other options:

- Reparo is a wonderful spell, opening a car repair shop could do. Or use it to fix up depressed real estate and flip it for serious profit, like what Bellatrix and Draco did in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]].
- Gemino is another great spell. You really don't want to use it on bank notes because even the largest one is only 1000 Euro and you end up with a bunch of identical serial numbers. No, you want to duplicate materials more precious than gold, which can't be duplicated according to canon. But there's nothing preventing you from making a killing with titantium, silver, platinum, and even plutonium!
- Legilimency and Veritaserum are excellent way to steal sensitive information. For example, you 'find out' that the FDA is going to reject a drug that most on Wall-Street expects to be approved. You take the opposite positions to them and watch your stock options increase in value by >1000 times.
