...er, that's the /Quibbler/, not the /Prophet/, I believe. So it's just a preposterous /Quibbler/ title, to be taken in the same spirit as "Cornelius Fudge bakes Goblins into pies and is in cahoots with the Rotfang Conspiracy" or "is Professor Dumbledore secretly a Cornish Pixi/Nargle hybrid?".

Of course, it also serves as a discreet joke on mpreg fics and Drarry, by implying that they're so preposterous they could only exist in any version of the /Harry Potter/ universe as a ridiculous rumor the Lovegoods would make up.

I don't really see the problem. There are some things that HPMOR claims are rational that can be argued to not really be that, but this... just isn't one of them.
