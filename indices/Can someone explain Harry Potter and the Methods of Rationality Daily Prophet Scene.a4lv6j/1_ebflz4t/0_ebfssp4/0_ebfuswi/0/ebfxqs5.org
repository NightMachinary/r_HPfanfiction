It's not really a non-sequitur.

Over the course of 40 paragraphs or so, Draco says something terrible about Luna, and in the process he reveals some extremely disturbing things about the state of justice and social innequality in wizarding britain.

Harry decides that a society that corrupt needs to be fixed, and he can start by persuading Draco (the son of a wealthy politician) that his worldview is flawed. One way to persuade Draco is to ask him to explain his beliefs in his own words, and then show at least one way they are wrong. So that's what Harry does.
