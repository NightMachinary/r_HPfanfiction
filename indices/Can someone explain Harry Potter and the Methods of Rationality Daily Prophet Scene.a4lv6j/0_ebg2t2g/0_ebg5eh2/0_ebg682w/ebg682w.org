Even if Luna isn't written as a seer, people can claim that the author intended for the readers to make that connection, but then there are also things that don't seem to be in it for anything other than humour. Plus, him saying that he did not consider the possibility doesn't tell us much about how it applies to the name that the article ended up having.

As such, I see no problem with writing that I've seen people interpret it in those two ways when that I have seen but I do not know enough about the author's intent to claim which group is more right in regards to the chapter as it is.
