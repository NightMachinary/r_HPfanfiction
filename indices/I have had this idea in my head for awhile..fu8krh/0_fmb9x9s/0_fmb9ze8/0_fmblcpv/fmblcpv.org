Good idea. But I feel as if there would be couple of corners you will back yourself into. Humans don't do well with surprise. two groups who muggles didn't have an idea even existed come to the forefront at the same time. Why won't muggles lump them together? Supernatural Vs humans. That would be the motto of muggles. What's the true differentiation between wizards and this third group? Atrocities? I give you the cruciatus. Looks? I give you goblins, trolls, half giants, werewolves all of which come under wizarding domain. Essentially non Muggle domain.
