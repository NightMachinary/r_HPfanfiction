I agree. It starts off promising enough. I especially enjoyed the scenes where Harry is infiltrating 10 Downing Street. But once they get to Buckingham Palace and meet the Queen it really goes down hill and I just kept cringing at every paragraph, so I stopped reading.

It's a shame, that story had some potential.
