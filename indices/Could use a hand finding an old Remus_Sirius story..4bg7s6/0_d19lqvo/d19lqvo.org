Hi! I've been active in that section of fandom since '99, and I've got a lot of stuff saved and bookmarked. It doesn't sound immediately familiar, but I'll look around!

Do you happen to remember anything else about it--rating, length, when you might have read it? LJ is notoriously hard to search--lots of old journals from the height of fandom there have been deleted or banned--so any further details would be super helpful.
