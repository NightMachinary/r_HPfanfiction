Yes, I think the Trio and Ginny were acting very rational after the Battle, in that the boys were trying to establish themselves at the Ministry, while sending the girls to Hogwarts. There would be NO WAY Hermione and Ginny were going to slack off after what they went through. They were going to organize the students and no longer let the corrupt Ministry bureaucrats decide their future.
