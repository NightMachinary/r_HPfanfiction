I always considered it a possibility. Originally I thought maybe Neville restarted the club as a extra learning opportunity. Peer tutoring and the like with a Dueling Club portion for the advanced students and tutors.

But my views changed with extreme nationalist views entering the mainstream around the muggle world the past 5 years. The DA was restarted by someone from the next generation with help or guidance from Neville when pureblood supremacy, Magical First, or other wizarding prejudice group attains mainstream recognition.

I like to think the muggle and wizarding worlds mirror each other in someway.
