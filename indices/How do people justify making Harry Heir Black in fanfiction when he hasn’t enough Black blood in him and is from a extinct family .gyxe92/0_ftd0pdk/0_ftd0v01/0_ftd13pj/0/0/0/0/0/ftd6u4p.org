The Law of Property Act may have abolished the Statute of Westminster II voted in 1285 better know as De Donis Conditionalibus and the mechanism of fee tail in real estate property law. But for example Scotland has abolished this form of entailments only in 2000 by Abolition of Feudal Tenure Act. And the English Common law still forbid alienating from the Estate settled chattels.
