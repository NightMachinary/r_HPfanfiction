1. There's no reason why Muggle rules would apply to the wizarding world.

2. In any event, there is no such rule of inheritance in (Muggle) English law that people with titles of nobility cannot "bequeath outside of the blood".

The closest thing Muggle law has to your proposal is the "fee tail", which was used to keep estates in tact. This form of property was abolished in 1925, however.
