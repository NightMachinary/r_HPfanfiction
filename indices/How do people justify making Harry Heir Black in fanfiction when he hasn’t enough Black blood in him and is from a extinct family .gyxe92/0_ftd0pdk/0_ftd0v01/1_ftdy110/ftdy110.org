That's quite easy, just make Harry's grandparents to be Charlus and Dorea instead of Fleamont and Euphemia(completely doable since their names are not in the books and only came out later in Pottermore IIRC) then make the Headship of the family's rules of heirship flexible to the current Head/Lord, following that they have to have the bloodline.

Then Sirius designates Harry as Heir, maybe even adopt him, or maybe make the godfather bond enough to be considered paternal in certain cases.

BAM! Done, you can even have Sirius cast out Narcissa and Draco so the nearest eligible male to inherit is Harry through his grandmother.

Or just make all that AND the Family Magic/Totem/Guardian recognize Harry over Draco, because Harry is powerful/has the Black interests in mind/looks cooler

Done.

I honestly don't see the problem here.
