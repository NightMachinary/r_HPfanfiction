Firstly I am asking about those fanfics that do it and use Euphemia as Harry paternal grandmother. I am well aware that with Dorea it is logical for Harry to be Heir Black in concurrence with Draco with the same family relationship.

Secondly Sirius would be restricted from designating a Heir outside of the family if there is an heir apparent as Draco is.

Thirdly the Godfather bond is no adoption so it as no relevance within inheritance. One cannot use it as a reason to bequeath as it was within family.
