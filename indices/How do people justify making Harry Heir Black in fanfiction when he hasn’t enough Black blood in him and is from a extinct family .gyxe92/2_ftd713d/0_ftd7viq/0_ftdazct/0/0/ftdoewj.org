First off you seem to be ignoring the fact that a "Lord" can designate anyone as a heir including those with a "lessor" blood connection. And that a "Lordship" would first fall to the designated Heir before it would follow any other rules of inheritance. It's only when there is no designated Heir that any "rules of Inheritance" would apply. And Draco was never designated as the "Black heir". Also that in the Wizarding world that Women can inherit.

Draco being a "second" cousin to Sirius (through his mother) means nothing if your relationship is not part of the same line. You also can't say that the family relationship between Draco and Sirius is the same as Harry and Sirius as Harry's family tree has not been fleshed out so we truly don't know how they are related.

If the Lordship or Headship of the family descends from Phineas Nigellus Black then when Sirius dies the primary line is extinct. It would then go to the secondary line (now that individual was disowned however the possibility exists that they could be reinstated by the current lord) it would not go to some second cousin in the fifth line (ie Draco).

Therefore, if an Heir was not designated by the current primary line it would then go to the secondary line (disinherited). After that it would go to the tertiary line Arcturus and his descendants still living. If that line was extinct it would go through the 4th line Belvina Burke nee Black and her descendants. Only if her line is extinct would it then go through the 5th line Cygnus and finally reach Draco. And that's only if Andromeda is not reinstated.

Now we know that Harry was the designated Heir. What we can't say with any authority is whether or not without that designation Harry would inherit the "Black Lordship" before Draco as we don't know how Harry may be related to the Black family as neither his paternal nor maternal family trees have been fleshed out.
