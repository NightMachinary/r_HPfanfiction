My argument is Harry designation as Heir Black is invalid as Sirius Black was disowned and so he cannot be Lord Black, so the inheritance laws are used. So logically Burkhe, Lestrange or Malfoy for the relationship as depicted in the family tree. Canon Harry has no black ties know, so his designation as Black Heir is only Sirius Orion Black Will, and so can be contested if he was disowned.
