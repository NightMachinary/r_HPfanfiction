I would believe that the Lord of the House would have the power to change the direction of the house. For instance the Black family motto is Toujurs Pur which is French for Always Pure (interesting that a bigoted house has a foreign "french" motto).

The question is What does that mean? What did it mean when the house was first founded? That's a question we don't know the answer to. Was it the bigots in the house starting with Phineas' father etc that started the family to look at the motto as "always pure in blood" versus something like "always pure in heart" etc.

Since we don't know those answers fanfiction authors can do what they want to move the house of black where they want it to go.
