You're either ignoring information or just missing it but either way you're wrong. Arcturus Black, Orion Black's father (Sirius Black's grandfather) was head of the Black family (and there is no information that he ever passed this authority to Orion). Therefore only Arcturus can truly disinherit Sirius from the Black Family succession. There is no indication that Arcturus did so. And since Arcturus was still alive when Walburga passed he would determine whether Sirius was a valid heir.

Since we have no indication in canon that Arcturus as the head of the Black disowned Sirius whatever Walburga did had not impact on the actual lines of succession. Eg Walburga had no authority to remove Sirius from the line of succession as she was never the head of the family. She could easily say he's not her son but if Arcturus did not ratify it would not impact Sirius' ability to become the Head of the family.

Therefore Sirius' designation of heir would stand.
