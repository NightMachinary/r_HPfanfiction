Maybe Arcturus gave zero shits to Voldemort, or maybe he thought Sirius had come around in the end. Probably JKR never thought about.

The important fact is that canonically Sirius hadn't been disowned only his figure was blasted from the tapestry by someone who lacked the authority to do anything more than that.
