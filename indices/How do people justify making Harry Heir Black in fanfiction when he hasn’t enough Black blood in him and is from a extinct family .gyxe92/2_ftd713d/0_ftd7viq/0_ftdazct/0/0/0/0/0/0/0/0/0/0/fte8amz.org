The House was founded in the middle ages, we only know about the beliefs of members from the 1800's forward we don't have any idea what the founders of the house truly believed. For one if they were as bigoted as the members in the 1800s - present then why did they have a french motto instead of latin (especially since all spells were in latin) and we know that the recent past black family members detested "foreigners"?

So it could be very believable that the beliefs of the house and the motto meant something different and that the members in the black family changed its interpretation over time.
