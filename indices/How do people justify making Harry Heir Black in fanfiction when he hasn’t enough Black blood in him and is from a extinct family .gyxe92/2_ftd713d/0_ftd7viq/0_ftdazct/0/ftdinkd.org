Relationship between Sirius Orion Black and Draco Malfoy : 1. First cousin once removed by Pollux Black and Irma Crabbe as common ancestor. 2. Third cousin once removed by Pr Phineas Nigellus Black and Ursula Flint as common ancestor.

Relationship between Sirius Orion Black and Harry James Potter : identical to Draco and Sirius.

Sirius dead, the Blacks are extinct in the male line, no heir by the male succession rules can be found.

1. The First Line of Pr Phineas Nigellus Black is died out
2. The Second Line by Phineas Black has been disowned for Muggle Rights fight
3. The Third Line by Arcturus Black II and Lysandra Yaxley, the Black estate goes to descendants of Harfang Longbottom and Callidora Black if living, if not the Black Fortune goes to descendants of Septimus Weasley and Cendrella Black ( I am laughing) so Arthur Weasley if Cendrella was not disowned. If disowned, the Third Line is died out.
4. The Forth Line by Belvina Black and Herbert Burkhe, two sons and one daughter, if they didn't die of course.
5. The Fifth Line by Cygnus Black II and Violeta Bulstrode, the Black Estate to Harry Potter if not disowned , if not to Bellatrix Lestrange as first of Cygnus Black III and Druella Rosier.

Yes I see what you mean so Longbottom, Burkhe, (Potter), Lestrange and Malfoy in that order.
