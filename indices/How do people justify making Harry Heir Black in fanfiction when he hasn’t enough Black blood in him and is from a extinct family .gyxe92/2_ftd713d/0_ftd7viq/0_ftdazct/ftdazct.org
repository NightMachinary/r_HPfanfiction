Draco is not the Heir apparent unless he was designated by Sirius as such and he wasn't. In addition if you're trying to push the Heir apparent through blood idea, Draco is descended from the 4th child/line of Phineas Black (and at one time Head of house Black) and therefore would not inherit (unless designated in a will) until all the descendants from the primary line (which Sirius descended from), secondary, and tertiary lines are gone. And according to the Black family tapestry, there are still living descendants of the second and third lines around. So Draco is not in the running for the Head of house Black via blood unless he was designated as such via a will.

Also, Draco wouldn't be the first individual bypassed in an inheritance because the Head decided to "give it" to someone with a lesser blood connection. That's true in real world as well ass fanfiction. Again it's the Author who decides how an inheritance goes.

Finally the books state that Harry is related to Sirius. And in the books Sirius was able to pass his inheritance on to Harry therefore there was enough "black Blood" in Harry in order for that to occur otherwise Kreacher would not have obeyed Harry as Head of the house (which is canon).

You're other problem is there is no 100% complete family tree so we don't know if or how Euphemia or Fleamont are related to anyone as we have little info on them.
