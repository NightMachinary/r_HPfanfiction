Very simply because Euphemia wasn't identified (via Pottermore) as the name of Harry Potter's grandmother until after many of the Books had already been published. Which means much of the fanfiction community believed/used Dorea Potter nee Black to connect Harry to the Black line. Because as was stated in the books to some extent all pureblood families are related.

Secondly, Sirius as the Head of House Black has the authority to designate who he wants to inherit. It's only when there is no designated Heir that various rules of inheritance apply. And in fanfiction (which is always AU) the Author decides what "rules of inheritance" they wish to follow as well as "who are Harry's grandparents".

And thirdly the godfather bond is what the parents of the child makes of it. IRL I am the godfather to the children of three different families. If the worst was to happen (god forbid) in two of the families very little would change. In the third, I would take over raising the children as that's what the parents put into place.

So it's up to the authors to decide what the godfather bond entails. Even canon suggests that harry should have gone to Sirius. But like many things it wasn't clearly detailed/identified.
