The other pureblood have the protection of family something Harry has lost. And I am not asking about the Black Fortune in this exemple but of the custody of a minor half-blood orphan without upstanding guardians and boy-who-lived. Every pureblood would try to take control of him by being his legal guardian until he is of age. Harry has no one to defend him, and the weapons of the Potter family are forbidden to him until he is of age so he is ripe for the sharks.
