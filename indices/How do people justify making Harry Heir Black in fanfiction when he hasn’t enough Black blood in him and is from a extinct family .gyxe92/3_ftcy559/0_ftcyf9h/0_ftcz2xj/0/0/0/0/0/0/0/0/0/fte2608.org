Again, none of these are canon, they are not implied, so the author can just change things around, for all we know the Ministry gives zero shits about that and Malfoy has to respect the will or be found a thief.

Again in fanfiction you can make any assumptions you want. So yes, what you are saying could be a thing, but the author can just change things around as they see fit.
