Ward of the Ministry is a expression to tell that he has no legal guardian recognised by the Ministry, if for ex Malfoy did go to the Minister or before the Wizengamot to gain custody, the muggles would not even be heard, Dumbledore would be hard pressed to defeat a upstanding pureblood because he is an old half blood that has already to many duties. And Harry would not have any say in the matter because he is not of age so cannot use his family ressources.
