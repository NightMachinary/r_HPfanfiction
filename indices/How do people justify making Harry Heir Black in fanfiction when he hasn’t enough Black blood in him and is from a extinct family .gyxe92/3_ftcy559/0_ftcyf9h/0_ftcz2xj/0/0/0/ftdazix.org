Not to be rude, but what the hell are you talking about? If this is an FF you want to write, have at it. However, the only thing that's canon here is Sirius made Harry the sole heir to the Black fortune with Kreacher as the only string attached. And the only person who could realistically seize Harry is Albus Dumbledore.
