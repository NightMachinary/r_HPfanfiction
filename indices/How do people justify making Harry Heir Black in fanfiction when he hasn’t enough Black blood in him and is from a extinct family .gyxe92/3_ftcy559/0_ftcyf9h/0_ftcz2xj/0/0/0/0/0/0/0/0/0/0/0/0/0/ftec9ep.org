Which weapons? Which guardianship?

It appears you are debating based on /your/ headcannon.

We don't know anything about wizardkind guardianship laws, all we know is from the Hogsmeade authorization paper and that is that you need a guardian to sign them or the Minister or some other official to waive the need away(Fudge basically did that, he didn't sign as his guardian he just authorized a kid to go on a very safe school trip).

Malfoy was persona non grata right after Voldemort fell, it would take some years for him to climb back up. Him trying to take the boy who lived would be seen as a Death Eater trying for revenge.

Harry was then placed with his closest blood relatives, the Dursleys and they are recognized as his guardians(since their signature would be accepted in the Hogsmeade paper) and that's it.

We don't know anything about Potter assets, maybe all that was left was in Harry's trust vault, we know from post-book material they had a manor and the house at Godric's Hollow, but JKR probably forgot about those because they weren't important for the overall plot. For all we know, whatever assets were frozen until the heir came of age.

Again, the same thing you do in using a little bit of canon and a whole lot of headcanon could be used the other way to say that Dumbledore has more people in the Wizengamot that would overrule Malfoy, or that Malfoy wouldn't want to go against Dumbledore so openly. Or that maybe this was all done behind closed Doors and Malfoy wouldn't know about it since they had no claim to any Black Fortune since they were from an unimportant matrilineal branch and so when the heir leaves a clear will they have no recourse.
