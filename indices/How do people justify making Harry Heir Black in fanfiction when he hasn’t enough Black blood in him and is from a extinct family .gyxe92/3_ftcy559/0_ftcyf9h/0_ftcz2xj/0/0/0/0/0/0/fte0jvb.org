Albus must have the legal authority to designate Petunia as guardian, but he hasn't a claim on his own to gain custody of Harry. basically Harry has no guardian in the wizarding world so he is the ward of the Ministry. And so for ex Cornelius Fudge could have claimed that it would have been in the best interest of Harry that his custody be transferred to him and use Harry assets and fame until he is of age.
