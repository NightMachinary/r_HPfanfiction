OK. For what it's worth, him being the Black heir is /canon/. Everything else of fanon fluff, but Sirius explicitly passed everything of his to him. Dumbledore wasn't sure it was possible until Harry was able to order Kreacher to "Shut up."

That said, his grandmother was also explicitly stated to be a Black before she married Harry's grandfather.
