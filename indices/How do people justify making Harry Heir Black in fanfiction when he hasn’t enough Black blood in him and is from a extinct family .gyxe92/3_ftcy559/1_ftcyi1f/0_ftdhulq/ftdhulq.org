The Dursleys are the only living family harry has on his mother's side. That tells us nothing about whether or not he is a related/distant cousin to the Black family.

For one thing we don't even know Euphemia's maiden name so for all we know Euphemia is related to Belvina Black via the two sons and daughter she had which would put Harry in the third line of Phineas Black. Or she could be related to Callidora Black or one of her other sisters due to their children (who are never named) which would put Harry in the second line of Phineas Black. Hell we only know when Euphemia died not when she was born.

Then there's the whole Evans family which we know little about. Could one of them be descended from a Black squib? We don't know as their family tree has never been fully detailed.

So you have no way of determining whether harry has any connection to the Black Family because neither side of his family tree has been fully fleshed out. So all we are left with is the canon details that say he is somehow related and the fact that Kreacher obeyed him which meant that Kreacher saw him as the "rightful" Black.

This overall lack of detail in canon allows the fanfiction authors enough flexibility to designate Harry as "lord Black" in their stories via the simple tie of Sirius' will in Canon.

And because of the lack of detail concerning Euphemia and Fleamont's birth and relatives (and then the same lack of detail in the Evans family) no one can authoritatively say that Harry has no Black Blood in them and therefore could not possibly be "Lord Black".

But the opposite is true. Eg that Harry can be "Lord Black, because all a fanfiction author has to do is point out that canon had Harry inherit from Sirius and afterwards Kreacher obeyed him.
