Not sure why your tone is so passionate when I already stated I don't really have a dog in this race. I'm simply answering OP's question: This is the general vague justification that a lot of fanfic authors use. Canon says very little about the inheritance, or whether wizards even follow Muggle laws of inheritance/nobility.

In fact, I would call into question Sirius being able to "will" anything to Harry at all, as he was a wanted murderer hiding from the authorities. He would not have been able to obtain a legally binding Ministry document in his own name, and even if Dumbledore was able to swing it, it's unclear how the government would even verify his death, since there's no body.

Presumably you could do it with "magic", but still. It's an aspect that goes unexplained because JKR doesn't include details of bureaucracy & politics very much.
