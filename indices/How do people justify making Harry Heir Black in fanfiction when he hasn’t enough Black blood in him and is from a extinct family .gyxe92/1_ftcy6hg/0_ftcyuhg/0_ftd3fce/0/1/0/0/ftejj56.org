By whose standards/laws? The author can just use the AU excuse and change them, and normally the Lord can do whatever he wants as far as we know, there's barely enough canon materials on laws regarding families, much less regarding that.

They are from a quaternary branch, with another surname, from a matrilineal line, in most systems you could cast them out of principle.

Sirius, now being the Head, could just say whoever supports Voldemort is going against him, the Head, and thus the Family, so he blanket casts out Narcissa, Bellatrix, Draco, and whoever he wants to that supports Voldemort.
