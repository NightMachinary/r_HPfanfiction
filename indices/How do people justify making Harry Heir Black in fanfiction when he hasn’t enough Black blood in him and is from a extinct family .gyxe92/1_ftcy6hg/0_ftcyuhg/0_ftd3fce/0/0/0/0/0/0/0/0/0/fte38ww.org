It is my belief that there are not any ties between the Potter and Blacks save Dorea and Charles because it is explained in canon that Dorea was near being disown that the family did not take it kindly for her to weed a Potter, a family that is not considered pure or not within the Pureblood Registry. The Evans are believed entirely muggle so they have never been taken into account.

You know you could just say that my analysis of the family tree was correct and say that I was wrong only with the belief that Sirius was disowned and forgotten asomeone from the Tree without having to list yourself the members to the succession .

There is only a mystery in the relationship between Harry and Charles, there are both Potter so it would fall to reason that there must be somewhere a common ancestor. Even if Charlie was from a cadet branch like the Potter that has gone to found the American MACUSA.
