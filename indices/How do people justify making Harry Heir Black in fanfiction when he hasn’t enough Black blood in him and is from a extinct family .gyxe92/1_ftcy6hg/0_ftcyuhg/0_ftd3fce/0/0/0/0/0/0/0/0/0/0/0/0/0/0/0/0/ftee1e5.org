Maybe they just didn't like Charles or didn't like his branch of the family. Or the head of the Family was more bigoted. For instance do we know if the complaint about Dorea marrying Charles was really from the Head of the family or from Dorea's known bigoted father Cygnus? It's very believable that Cyngus would object. It's not as clear if his brother Arcturus or sister Belvina would.
