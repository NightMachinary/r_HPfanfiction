I have forgotten only Charis in my list, it does not invalidate my list of possible. It this analysis I am talking about, the listing of all the lines and descendants. I have cited Callidora and Belvina but not Charis, I have forgotten Charis. On another point Canon doesn't state that Harry Potter and the Blacks are related, it just mentions in Ootp, that Charles Potter married Dorea Black but it doesn't tell the relationship between Charles and Harry so Charles could be from a cadet branch with only a common ancestor when the family has branched. So I think we can say that there is only one tie between the Potters and the Black in Dorea Black. Nor Canon nor Rowling said any different.
