Yes but canon did not tell that Charlie was Harry Grandfather and Rowling published on pottermore some information that tell us that If Harry has Black Blood it is too much in the past to be effective. Rowling released the info that Harry grandfather was Fleamont and his grandmother was Euphemia Potter (she did not tell the maiden name) effectively isolating Harry to the muggle side as the paternal family has been completely wiped out.
