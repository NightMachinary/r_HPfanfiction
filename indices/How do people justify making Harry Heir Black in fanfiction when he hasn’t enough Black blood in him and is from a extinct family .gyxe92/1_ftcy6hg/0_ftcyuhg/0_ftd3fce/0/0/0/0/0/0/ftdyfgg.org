First I was using it as an example of cousins and lines of succession. Lucrecia had no descendants so there was no possibility of her descendants inheriting. And I'll agree that as the oldest and assuming women are on even basis which I have then without designated wills/heirs her family must be extinct in order for Sirius to have inherited. It's a different story if wills and designated heirs exist then if she did have family they could be alive to inherit.

Second as far as I know "Orion didn't inherit" as Arcturus was still alive way after Orion died (in fact he lived passed Walburga as well).

You're missing a few. (And this is without considering anyone's reinstatement, any designated heirs eg no wills exist, etc, also just going by oldest child).

Callidora Longbottom nee black (still living) would be the head of the family. She had one son and one daughter so when she passed it would go through those descendants.

If they are extinct it would then go to Charis Crouch nee Black she had one son and two daughters and all their descendants.

Then if that line has gone extinct it would go through Belvina Burke nee Black. She had 2 sons and a daughter so all their descendants would be next in line.

Only if all of the others are dead (which at the time of Sirius' death we know they are living members of those lines) would the succession fall to Cygnus and his descendants. And at that point it would fall to Bellatrix Lestrange nee Black and then with their deaths it would fall to Narcissa Malfoy nee Black and then Draco.

What we don't know and can't say is where Harry and his family would if at all connect into the Black family. So we don't know if in a world without wills designating heirs would Harry appear in the Black Family line of succession prior to Draco.

However, since canon does have wills designating heirs, and we are told that he is related to the black family (but not exactly how) we know that Harry can become head of the Black family.
