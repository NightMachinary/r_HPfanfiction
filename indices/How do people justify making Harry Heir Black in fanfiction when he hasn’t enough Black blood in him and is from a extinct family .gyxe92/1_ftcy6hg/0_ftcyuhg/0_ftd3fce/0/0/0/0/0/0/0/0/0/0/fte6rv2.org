True but in my defense or blame (eg old detail oriented (some might say anal) computer engineer) I actually don't agree that you're analysis is correct). I also believe there is a lot of mystery remaining. We have a very limited look into Fleamont's family with no idea how he may be related to Charles let alone to any other pureblood families. We have no idea who Euphemia is related to. Hell we don't even know her maiden name. That's a huge mystery.

Canon states they are related we just don't know how.

On the Evans the question that arises is how do muggleborns occur? It defies logic and genetics that in a limited population within the UK that tens to hundreds of muggleborns with no magic in their family trees are suddenly born every year. Now we could just claim "magic" but that's just not satisfying.

I side with the fanfiction authors who develop a plotline that all muggleborns descended from squibs. That's how the magic gene gets in them and then somehow becomes active. Which means we really need a "full" tree for the Evans line. And the black family tree needs to be completed as we have no idea about Belvina, Callidora, and Charis' descendants.
