I agree with you on the second, but what about my argument about that Dorea weeding to a Potter was frowned upon, it is implied in the canon, so why would they frown upon the marriage to a Potter if they have done it already in the past ? Or it is fanon that their marriage was frowned upon ?

But finally I agree that if that hypothesis that Dorea was the first marriage between a Potter and a Black is wrong then with the fact that the family tree that we have are incomplete, there is the same possibility that ties exist like Hermione said for the probability of Salazar Slytherin being a ancestor of Harry Potter as he lived in the far past.
