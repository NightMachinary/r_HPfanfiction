It doesn't matter how far in the past it is it matters in which line of the succession it is. If lucretia Black had any grandchildren the Black "lordship" would go to those grandchildren even though those grandchildren are first cousins once removed (just like Draco) because they are in the primary line of succession.

The specific line of succession holds precedence over family relationship. Eg without a will a second cousin in the primary line would inherit before a second cousin from a secondary line.
