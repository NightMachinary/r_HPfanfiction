The difference with what I posted is that I believe that Sirius is the legitimate head of the Black Family and as such he could designate his Heir. And that from canon we know Harry has some Black Blood in him (though we don't know the "amount"). Therefore, that Harry now is the legitimate head of the family Black.

And if that heir designation did not exist the "headship or lordship" of the Black Family would never fall to Draco as there are lots of people ahead of him in the succession.

And depending on how Euphemia or Fleamont or the Evans plug into the Black family Harry could be Higher in the succession then Draco (though it's doubtful it would fall to Harry as he would also have a lot of folks in front of him). About the only way it would go to Harry is if somehow Euphemia is either the eldest child of Callidora or the daughter of the eldest child (which would entail a lot of young parents to make the ages work (definitely doable)).
