I was referring to those fanfictions where he doesn't do that and yet the author consider that a Godson is a member of the family not a ward of the family. Godson equivalent to son without the blood adoption is an idea in some Fanfictions I have read and I wanted to know from where this idea of godson equivalent to son without blood adoption came from ? And the blood adoption should have as consequence that The Potter bloodline is absorbed by the Black bloodline, ending the House of Potter (within those fanfictions with those concepts) ?
