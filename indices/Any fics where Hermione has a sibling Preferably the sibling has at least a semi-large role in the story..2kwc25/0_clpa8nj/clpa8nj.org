The entire premise of the Dangerverse series is that Hermione's older sister raises her (and a kidnapped Harry) after their parents are killed in a death eater attack. Its been a while, so I forget the details of how she meets Moony and ends up kidnapping Harry with him, but its an entertaining read. Fair warning, the sister is older and doesn't attend Hogwarts as a student, but does visit iirc. Not sure if you were looking for a more contemporary sibling or not, Hermione does end up being raised as a for all intents and purposes besides blood sibling to a number of characters.

Hermione is raised as Draco's sister in a world where Voldemort won the first war. It's more a retelling and focuses on Harry, but since Harry is friends with both Draco and Hermione, the sibling bits do come up.

Both are heavily AU, but cover the time period where Hermione is at Hogwarts and has a sibling. I haven't read anything that is both close to canon and involves a Granger sibling.
