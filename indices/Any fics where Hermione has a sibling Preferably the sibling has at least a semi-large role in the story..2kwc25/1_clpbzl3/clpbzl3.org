I don't remember the names and can't look through bookmarks since I'm on mobile, but I remember an incomplete fiction where around age 5, Harry uses accidental magic to do an animagus transformation to escape some particularly nasty abuse from the Dursleys. I don't remember if it was physical only or sexual too, not that it matters a whole lot. Harry stays in his animagus form for an extended period of time and wanders through the English countryside, eventually wandering into a yard because he smells someone like him. Lo and behold, it's the Granger residence. He winds up being raised by the Grangers and considers Hermione to be his sister and best friend. The fiction was abandoned sometime in year 1.

/Edit/ - I should mention that when I get home, I'll look through and see if I can find the link for you.
