The first four are Haphne fics that are all quite good. The next two are probably my two favourite ongoing fics, and the last one is a classic. Had the potential to be one of the best HP stories ever (some say it still is one of, if not the best) but it is unfortunately abandoned. Still worth the read, in my opinion.
