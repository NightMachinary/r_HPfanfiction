So you got most of the popular Harry/Daphne fanfics. Allow me to link you some of the lesser known but just as good ones.

Ice Cream - One of the uniquest takes on Daphne. It is an amazing heart warming relationship that is portrayed. A worthy read indeed.

If Not for Umbridge - A WIP (Work in Progress) fic that is under pretty regular updates. It is a very interesting story about Daphne joining the DA.

Dragon Chronicles 1: Muggle-Raised Champion - A really good story about Harry being forced to stay with the Dursleys until his name is drawn from the Goblet of Fire. It has a sequal that is WIP.

Novocaine - An amazing post-war story where we see Harry and Daphne doing their best to help improve the magical community. Plenty of touching moments inbetween as well, the story still gets updates just with a long time in between.

The Hogwarts Club - Harry and Daphne end up in detention. Snape ends up playing match maker. A very humorus one-shot.

Dancing in the Green - A one-shot of how Daphne demanding Harry to escort her to the yule-ball changes the world. I think it is a very interesting story and I wish there was more.

Make a Wish - This is a classic story. My all time favorite because of how unique of a world that is created. Plenty of humor and fun references. The author has many other classic stories as well.

Reminiscing a Life Lived - This is a shameless self plug. A less plot driven and more character driven story. With a bit of subtle and blantant world building going on. This is still a WIP.
