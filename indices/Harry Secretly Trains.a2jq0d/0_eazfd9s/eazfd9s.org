Linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) has Sirius training Harry in combat/politics post-PoA. It also has Flitwick start pick Harry up as a dueling apprentice during GoF. Hasn't been updated since 2017 but isn't abandoned.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change) has Tonks helping out Harry over the summer between OotP and HBP. It's complete but it's like 332k+ words (longer than the first three HP books combined).

Linkffn(Harry Potter & the Never Ending Summer) is a similar situation to Summer of Change but goes about it in a completely different way.

Can't really think of any others that are complete or long-running but in progress. Hope some other people make some suggestions.
