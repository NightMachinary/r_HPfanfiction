There's nothing wrong with asking questions.

As a whole we don't really see a lot of extra curricular activities from teachers in Harry Potter. The closest example I can think of is that the movies sort of present Flitwick as being involved in a school choir of sorts. But at the same time, the quidditch teams don't even really have a coach and are mostly just left to the students.

I would highly doubt that it would be an issue of 'time' from the teachers. Perhaps more interest. It could, conceivably, be any of the professors.

My own experience with school papers was very 'hands-off' from the teachers/professors. They mostly only made their presence known in event of an issue of sorts.

Perhaps the entire thing is best if done as a student-run organization with minimal oversight from a professor. At that point it doesn't really matter who the professor is as they shouldn't appear often.
