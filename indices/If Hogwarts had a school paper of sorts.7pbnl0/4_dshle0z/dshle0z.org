Likely a prof that doesn't have other duties (Head of House, groundskeeper, referee, etc.), so probably one of the elective teachers (though I'm curious how full Hooch's schedule really is).

I think in the schools I've been to, it's generally the English teachers who get the job foisted on them. Unfortunately, not an option in Hogwarts without some AU fiddling.

I like the idea. Seen it in a couple fics. Opens up getting Harry's story/yearly adventures out into the open without having the super awkward Great Hall scene where everyone listens in. Could also use it to discuss social issues and things like types of classes offered, anything that's glossed over in canon.
