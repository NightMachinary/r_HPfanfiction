I tend to justify it in my head as being very limited because Harry's pov is very limited; an unreliable narrative. Which means Harry's memories are mostly going to be caricatures of everyone and what they did. This would explain things like Harry's memories of his aunt and uncle.

One thing that bugs me (I've been relistening to DH) is the whole idea that Harry and Hermione never mucked about while Ron was away. I'm sorry JKR but you've got two seventeen-year-olds in the wilderness with no other human contact, under constant life-or-death stress - there's no fucking way they didn't do /something/, even if they felt awful about it afterwards and swore never to speak of it again. I know that's offtopic but it's been bugging me recently.
