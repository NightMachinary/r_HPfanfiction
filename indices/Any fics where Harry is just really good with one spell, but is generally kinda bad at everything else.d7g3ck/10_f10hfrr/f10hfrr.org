There is that one crackfic where i remember him using reducto a lot.

The one where he goes on an adventure one summer and the death eaters and other bad guys keep trying to attack him and die over and over in silly ways like apparating in front of a moving train and what not.

Cant think of the name but ill try to find it.

Edit: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]] is the one im thinking of.
