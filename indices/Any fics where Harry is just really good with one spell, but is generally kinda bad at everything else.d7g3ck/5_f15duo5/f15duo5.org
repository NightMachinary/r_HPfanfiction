Well there's this great series by who I consider a pretty under rated author by the name of JK Rowling. Now I wouldn't say he's terrible at all other spells above one, but the one he's good at, he's really good at. The spell btw is Expelliarmus. As a matter of fact, he uses said spell against the unblockable Killing Curse, and through the power of plot, wins with it. I know it's pretty fantastical, and is pretty unbelievable in some parts, but I enjoyed it.
