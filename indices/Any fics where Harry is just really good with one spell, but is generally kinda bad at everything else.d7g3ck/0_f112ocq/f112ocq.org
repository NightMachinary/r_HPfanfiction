I wanna see a version of this where it isn't a spell, it's flying.

He's already presented as something of a prodigy on a broom, why not dial that up to 11? Like have his innate magic be so in tune with a broom that he can get a creaky old school broom to break the sound barrier.

Like so long as he's got a floating broom in his hand, his reaction speed becomes freakishly quick - imagine the DoM battle but with Harry zipping around like a fucking madman cackling not even trying to cast spells, just chucking heavy objects at Death Eater heads, or twisting them around and getting them to accidentally hit each other.

You could do the whole series like that - Harry's special Occlumency is meditating while flying. He eventually thinks to shrink a broom and strap it to his chest and he uses that to zoom through the maze at the end of GoF (and subsequently flee from the graveyard ritual).
