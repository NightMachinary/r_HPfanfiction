Umbridge woke up, immediately noticing something wrong. She was standing in her office, on a chair, with a rope around her neck. Panicking, she got rid of the rope and stepped down from the chair only to find a letter on her desk. A letter written in her handwriting and with her magical signature confessing to multiple things, some of which she was even responsible for. Just as she got done reading it, the ink shifted and transformed into two words. "ONLY WARNING", before the letter vanished as if it had never existed in the first place.

An hour later, a freshly resigned and somewhat paranoid Madam Umbridge left Hogwarts.
