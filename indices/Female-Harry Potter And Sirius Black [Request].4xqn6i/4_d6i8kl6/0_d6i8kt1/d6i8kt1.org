  When Bella Potter meets Death, she takes him up on his offer to be placed in a parallel universe. She wakes up to find herself in Godric's Hollow on October 31st, 1981. Her mission now is to save & protect Harry, and give him the life that she never had. Simple, right? But with a certain doglike man annoying her, universe hopping doesn't seem all that easy anymore. Fem!Harry/Sirius
