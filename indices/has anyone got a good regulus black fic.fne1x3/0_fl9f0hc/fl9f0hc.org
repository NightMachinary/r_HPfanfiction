For Regulus as the main character, maybe try the Renascentia series. A lot of it is from his point of view, lots on how his mind works. They're long stories with original plot, era is AU of Order of the Phoenix. He's paired with Emmeline Vance. First one complete, second one wip. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11914698/chapters/26923794]]) linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14495823/chapters/33487077]])

If you like the writing style, then the same two authors have written another Regulus-centric story which is an AU on the first wizarding war. He's paired with an OC and it's a wip. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16375733/chapters/38325272]])

Then there's a time travel Harry one that's really good but a bit slow to update. Looks like Regulus will get a happy ending and end up with Harry but no romance yet. First wizarding war era and the charactization is top-notch. Wip. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]])

Blackpool is Regulus-centric and is very very angsty but with a happy ending for Regulus, although no romance. Marauder's era, first wizarding war. Complete. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663/chapters/34132413]])

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16417496/chapters/38435513]]) has a lot of different main characters and Regulus is one of them. He gets a happy ending and there's some romance at the very end. AU of the first wizarding war. Complete.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13552503/chapters/31096425]]) is a long time travel fix-it with Regulus in the supporting cast. Main characters are Sirius, Hermione, Ginny and Luna. Regulus is paired with an OC pureblood witch and I think maybe also with an OC wizard in the beginning. He has some chapters from his point of view and becomes more relevant around half-way through the story. Complete save for the epilogue.
