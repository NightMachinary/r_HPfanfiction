This story is in my top five favorite Harry Potter fanfictions and it has Regulus Black in spades. He has happy times and some angst. Also fair warning this is a WBWL, Slytherin Harry story and is really really long so if its not your type well then don't read it. He shows up around chapter 80.

Also there are these other fics on another similar question to this one.

Finally I remember reading a fanfic where Regulus survives the Inferi and becomes a Dark/Light vigilante person who helps Sirius and the Potters fight Voldemort but for the life of me I can't remember it.
