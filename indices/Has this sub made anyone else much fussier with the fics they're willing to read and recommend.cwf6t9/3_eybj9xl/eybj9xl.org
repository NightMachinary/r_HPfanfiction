This thread taught me about some tropes that are popular in this fandom, but since I don't like any of them all that much, I simply avoid those fics. I've noticed that I just have become very specific after reading several fics. But knowing what you want doesn't help much if that thing hasn't been written yet. Now there are even certain elements in the original novels, particularly those involving romance, which I cannot stand because I saw so many of them in poorly written fanfics.
