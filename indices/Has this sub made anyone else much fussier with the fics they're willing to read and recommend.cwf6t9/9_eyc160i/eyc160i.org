This sub didn't make me fussier since I've only been here a few months but been reading hp fanfic for a few years. The past few months I've only really been able to read fics that break wildly away from the typical Hogwarts storyline and I think I figured out why. We've all read the original story. First year Quirrel and the stone, second diary and basilisk, third dementors and Wormtail, Fourth Triwizard tournament... Many fics don't break away from the general plotline and we all know the story, the world, the layout of events to expect. For the most part we already know what's going to happen no matter what house Harry is sorted into or who he dates or how powerful or weak or smart or dumb he is. We've read that story a hundred times told a hundred different ways with a hundred different Harrys. And that takes a lot out of the excitement. It's not that the fics are written objectively bad, it's that we've already read fics just like them and there's no spark of mystery to the plot anymore. With no mystery and excitement even a well written fic can feel bland. Because when you read the same story over and over you expect to get something better each time.

The Arithmancer trilogy, for example, was an excellent story that broke away from some of the more general storyline tropes. It followed Hermione instead of Harry, showed her struggle as a muggleborn instead of Harry the halfblood orphan, and was written really well. If you were still new to fanfics it's definitely one of the top ones I'd recommend reading. But the first 5 years follow almost all the general Hogwarts storylines. And that means you know what to generally expect when you read it. You already know Quirrel is possessed, the diary is a horcrux, Sirius is innocent, a death eater is pretending to be Moody... It's an amazing fic especially for people who are new to fanfiction, but the first 5 years of the story do lack the spark of excitement that comes from not having any clue what's going to happen, even though The Arithmancer is great.

That's why fics that break away from the traditional tropes that happen Harry attends Hogwarts seem so good by comparison even if they're not written objectively better. Take Whispers In Corners for example. It doesn't follow any of the conventional tropes or plotlines. Harry isn't rich, he isn't all powerful, he's alone, and Hogwarts isn't involved in the story at all. The canon storyline is all in his past, this story happens years later. And that alone makes it a good read, we don't know what's going to happen. You probably haven't read that storyline yet and have no idea where it's going to go and it's exciting again. It's exciting to not know where the story will lead or what events to expect. Combine that with Esamas great writing and it became one of my favorite fanfics.
