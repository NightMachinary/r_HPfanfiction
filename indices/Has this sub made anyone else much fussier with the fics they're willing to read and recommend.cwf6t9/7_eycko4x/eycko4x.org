In some respects, yes. Commentary on what others like or see in fics that I have read often make me reconsider my own thoughts on the matter. Why /did/ I think that fic was so good? And what made it different from other fics that are constantly being spawned out (read: practically every fix-it fic out there)? But thats the point is it not - to get different view points and ideas under debate and hear different opinions.

In many ways it has made me more critical of certain fics and ideas. For instance, while Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived is a good fic, with time and new ideas I began to recognize its flaws (which so did the santi from his final commentary). It rather closely followed canon despite the setting, and often negelected character-building and storytelling for focus on the magic. While I still like it, time has tempered that view and allowed me to see it as an imperfect gem.

On the other hand though, I generally don't make recommendations based necessarily on what the 'consensus' is. My first focus is 'What fics most appropriately fit with the request?' If there are fics that are looser in that, I qualify it or offer a reasoning for /why/ I would offer my recommendation, but only if they meet the most critical parts of the request (i.e. who the main character is, what the focus of the story is, etc.).

I do generally avoid recommending fics with terrible or egregious spelling, grammar or plot points, if only because as a writer I cringe myself when reading them.
