I thought I was the only one with such views on fics. And I have the same problem- now I read fics I don't particularly enjoy because those I want to read haven't been updated or the author hasn't started a new fic. But I know a fic has to fit my preferences which include some characterization details as well.But I know that as long as that happens, I will not care about pacing or idealistic romance because I get what I want. But I am annoyed with myself for having a narrow focus because there's nothing to read:)
