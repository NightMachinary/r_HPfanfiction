If you have problems with /both/ Snape extremes, you're going to have a really hard time finding anything, more than any other caveat you brought up -- since authors almost always put him in one of the extremes.

Personally, when I started, I had no standards. At all. Eventually, I started developing preferences as well as repulsions -- some things that I previously didn't mind reading at all, I could no longer stand. As those stabilized, I almost exclusively read fics of certain kinds. However, I still have very low standards beyond "fic fulfills one of my preferences". Sometimes I read fics outside those, but that's rare. As I exhaust the (not all that large) list of fics with my preferences, I have a progressively harder time finding something that interests me, meaning I have to lower standards even further and increasingly read fics I've already read. At some point, I'll have exhausted the list of fics with my preferences completely and I'll probably stop reading HP fics beyond the occasional new fic that ticks my interest.
