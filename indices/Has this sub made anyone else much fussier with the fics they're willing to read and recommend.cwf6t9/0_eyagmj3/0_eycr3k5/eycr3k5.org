Easily the biggest reason I'm reluctant to write something myself. I once saw someone ask for reviews on a fic he/she was writing on the hpff Discord. Instead of constructive criticism, the author was completely roasted due to the fic setting off several of the things people in that place dislike.

While I didn't read the fic in question, from what I saw of it, it wasn't crack, meaning the reactions were genuine, which I found very offputting.

There's other reasons (I'd probably cringe at my first attempt after writing a bunch of other things and develop writing skills), but nothing that would stop me from writing entirely -- my mindset being "there's always something worse out there".
