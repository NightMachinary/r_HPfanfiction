From what I've seen I would not equate the Discord and this subreddit. From my experience the Discord is much more brutally honest and blunt with their comments than most here. When I've seen similar requests here most of the commenters are respectful when offering critiques/suggestions.

My story actually has come up on reddit a few times and the critiques I've received have all been fair and respectful. Not saying one is better than the other...just different.
