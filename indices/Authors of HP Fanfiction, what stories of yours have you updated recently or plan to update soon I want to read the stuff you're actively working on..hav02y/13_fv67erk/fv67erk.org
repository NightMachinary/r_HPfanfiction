I've got two WIPs at the moment:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24587908/chapters/59387440]]

Summary: Hermione Granger receives an unexpected letter from Astoria Malfoy and it invokes feelings that she has never felt before. Hermione x Astoria.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24777802/chapters/59914882]]

Summary: The Black inheritance had been dormant since the death of Lord Arcturus Black in 1991 and it had been left unclaimed by all the heirs of the time until the point of death. That is until 2030, long after the end of the War, when a twenty two year old Lily Luna Potter claims it as her inheritance.
