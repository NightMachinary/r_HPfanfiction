That's an intriguing metamorphosis! I haven't come across a story with that premise yet.

I'm working on two stories currently and updating them regularly.

The first is a very, very long fic: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16269131][Basilisk Eyes]] by Hegemone | T | [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16269131][AO3]] | [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160266/1/Basilisk-Eyes][FFN]] | [[https://www.wattpad.com/myworks/208609546-basilisk-eyes][WATT]]. Harry is blinded by the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets and while the story is primarily about how he adapts and the friends he makes along the way, there are threats and Harry isn't the only one with a past that haunts him.

The second is a collaboration with BrailleErin called [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22106113][Harry Potter and the Forgotten Lady]]. It is the third in the series. The first two were written by BrailleErin and are posted in full on ffnet (and she's posting them gradually on AO3). The first two in the series are: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6554218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sword-of-Gryffindor][Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6673903/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Blind-Seer-of-Durmstrang][Harry Potter and the Blind Seer of Durmstrang]].
