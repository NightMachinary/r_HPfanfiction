I'll be updating the next chapter this week or next week.

Summary: (or what happens when Tom Riddle realises the potential of mind control)

"You may think that the best kept secret on Earth is the concealment of the magical world from the muggle one, and you would be wrong. Millions of witches and wizards know that secret. No, the best kept secret on Earth --one that only a select few know-- is the concealment of the muggle world from the magical one." - Arcturus Black

Seven years after he left the magical world, Sirius Black's grandfather contacts him to say that his brother has gone missing. Sirius reluctantly agrees to work with his family to solve Regulus' disappearance by helping decode his brother's journals. Meanwhile, ex-werewolf-soldier Remus Lupin is hired as a personal assistant for Black Enterprises, Narcissa Malfoy tries to convince her sister Andromeda to run for the House of Commons, and Harry Potter is bewildered by the appearance of a stranger at Number Four, Privet Drive.

Very AU. Divergence after Tom Riddle's graduation. (rated M for coarse language (courtesy of Bellatrix and Sirius) and brief descriptions of violence)
