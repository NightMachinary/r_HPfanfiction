Huh - tastes do differ strongly, then. You're actually the first one telling me I'm too wordy! What would you do differently to get it less so? I'm really curious about in which ways it's too wordy and how to combat that. Cut back on scenes that focus on characters and their relationships in favour of more fast-paced plot?

Right now I only write for this series, since I'm horrible at multi-tasking, so there isn't much else to read that's mine. :/
