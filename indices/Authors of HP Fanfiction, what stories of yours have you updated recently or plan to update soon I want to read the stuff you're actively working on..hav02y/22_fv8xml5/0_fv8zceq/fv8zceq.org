Ok, I'm starting in on your work. I'm quite curious.

Edit: I'm sorry but it felt like I was punishing myself just because I told you I was reading it. It's well written but the constant back and forth gives me a headache. And the pace is very sluggish. I don't mind wordy chapters, I prefer them but they did not work in your favour here. It just felt like I was wading through mud. I read everything in the series including the one that was updated two days ago. I like the plot though. I'd love to take a look at anything else you've written.
