UPDATE: My laptop - the one with all the passwords etc saved on it - shat the bed earlier today, about ten minutes after the only shop I could get a new machine over the counter shut. Touch wood there's no data loss, and the fic itself is stored on a cloud service, but I'm more or less out for the next day or two while I get a new machine up and running.
