If you think Mal hasn't been working on that, you haven't been paying attention.

Also, do you know what happens if you get a couple of model aircraft jet engines and attach them to a racing broom? Speeder bike, that's what happens.

Also, re-enactment of famous national tragedy as private local farce, but more detail than that'd be spoilers.

EDIT TO ADD: Hogwarts is taking so long because of all the positive reviews I've been getting for all the digressions and meandering. Apparently people like it the way it is.
