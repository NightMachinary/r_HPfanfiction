Whew! I've made it a mission to read everything of interest in this thread. I just finished all 23 chapters. Nice work, I like it and I have no critiques on the writing as of now. If you want an in dept review let me know and I will give you one but as of now I'm tired and have more fics to read. Anyway, is Severus going to painted in an unfavourable light? I don't mind that but if we are redeeming the Dursleys please can you redeem him? Lucius and Severus are my favourite characters you see and I hate seeing them suffer. But in the end I can't actually force you to do anything because it's your fic. I'm planning on going over all the recommendations you gave next weekend. By the way, you switched Linear A and Linear B. It's the only thing I'm knowledgable enough to speak on. Though the science and mathematics are right up my avenue. I don't know a lot about law I'm afraid. I've read a few constitutions though. I'm done rambling, there's a comment below that I need to reply to once I get the energy.
