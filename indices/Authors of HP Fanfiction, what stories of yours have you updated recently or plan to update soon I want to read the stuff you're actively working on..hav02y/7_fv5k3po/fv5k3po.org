I'm currently working on Ciricnus, a fic set in 1984 in which Sirius's mother, Walburga, gets him out of prison and secures him a trial - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23559502/chapters/56518936]]

And I'm also working on The Dog Days of Summer, a fic set in 1970, which follows a summer adventure of Sirius and Regulus at their family's country estate. Magical creatures feature heavily in this one - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21737692/chapters/51857092]]

Ciricnus is definitely a more in-depth, emotional fic, whereas Dog Days of Summer is far more whimsical and just an amusing story to write, and, I hope, to read :)
