Well, I just finished the first draft of the climax to year one of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting), in which we finally get to see Tracey's plans to steal the Philosopher's Stone come to... something. It's going to need some serious revising, since I caught COVID halfway through writing it, but I hope to have it posted in ~1 week.

After that, it's back to work on linkffn(Departure from the Diary)
