linffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13586585/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enigmatic-Professor-Riddle]]) is my first and currently only piece of fanfiction. It revolves around an AU where Tom Marvolo Riddle didn't go all dark and become Lord Voldemort - he instead chooses a slightly different approach to achieve his goals. This means that when he asks Dumbledore for the post of DADA professor, Dumbledore is quite happy to accept him.

Now as Harry begins his first year, Dumbledore is dead, Minerva is Headmistress and Tom is Deputy Headmaster.

Do let me know how you find it!
