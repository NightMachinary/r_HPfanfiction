I'm going to say right up front that I haven't read Cursed Child all the way through and have no intentions of doing so anytime soon. Also, I've pretty much forgotten the Epilogue...

So, here are my ideas:

- Fred II takes after Percy more than any other Weasley, and doesn't quite "get" pranks. Gryffindor, though probably better-suited for Slytherin or Ravenclaw
- Molly II and Lucy, in turn, are the pranksters of the generation and drive their father bonkers. Molly is in Gryffindor and Lucy a Slytherin, but they still get along incredibly well
- I always liked the idea of Albus, Rose and Scorpius being sorted into either Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw together. Probably Hufflepuff.

  - Scorpius is the sunshine child who is much too innocent and happy for his own good. He plays peacekeeper between Rose and Albus. Scorpius sneaked out with Albus and Rose one year and discovered he really loves Muggle musicals...it's a long story that involves too many explosions and singing pandabears for anyone's health. He's determined to make the Fountain of Fair Fortune a successful musical, and accidentally guilt-trips everyone into helping him with this project
  - Rose is incredibly angsty and hostile. She loathes her name and the fact that her parents are always busy with work and her younger brother, who is slightly favoured thanks to his kinder disposition. Bit cyclical in nature, that. Rose enjoys blasting dramatic Muggle music and being /right/ (even if she knows she's not)
  - Albus inherited Harry's looks, but got both of his parents' pigheadedness, self-righteous fury and penchant for trouble. He and Rose bond on the matter of hating their names, but will often get into fights over who has it worse. Albus enjoys cinnamon and dislikes Herbology---says it's too boring. He declared war on the Whomping Willow second year and has deemed it the /root/ of all his problems and insists that it should /leaf/ him alone. Albus lowkey enjoys wordplay.

- Lorcan Scamander is a shy child who got sorted into Hufflepuff before the hat even touched his head. He's a bit of a conspiracy nut, but is the best Care student at Hogwarts. He invents a spell in his third year that would essentially turn his wand into a bubble wand. The bubbles taste like candyfloss
- Lysander Scamander is a hatstall---ends up going into Slytherin. Bit of a surprise for everyone, really, but he has a goal in mind: Lysander is going to prove, once and for all, that a Crumple-Horned Snorkack /does/ exist---no matter what it takes
- Dominique and Victoire fight like crups and kneazles, and it's only gotten worse over the years. If one so much as looks at the other the wrong way, screaming will be heard throughout the Slytherin dungeons---they're both in Gryffindor. Louis (successfully) pretends he doesn't know either of them; it helps that he's managed to get himself into Ravenclaw. Maybe it's his blond hair?

  - Victoire, when not arguing with her sister, loves playing both Quidditch and rugby, and enjoys traipsing through the Forbidden Forest. Somehow, she managed to get Lorcan to accompany her enough times to befriend the centaur herd, who begrudgingly agreed she could hunt with them every once in a while
  - Dominique is a bit of a fashionista, and is constantly petitioning for laxer uniforms at Hogwarts. She's surprisingly close to her aunt Hermione, as she also advocates for creature rights and the like; this relationship is something that makes Rose extremely jealous and short-tempered.
  - Louis always seems to be exasperated with everyone. He lives with two banshees and has some right devils for cousins, not to mention the war-heros for parents, aunts and uncles. He's just tired of all of the fuss, and nothing really phases him anymore. He hoards the Room of Requirement for himself and uses it as his own personal library

- Hugo is rather pleasant to be around. He was sick a fair amount as a child, thus leading to more doting from his parents and grandparents. He looks up to Scorpius as a role-model and big-brother sort, which makes both Rose /and/ Albus jealous (Rose is just a very explosive person, see). Hugo is still rather sickly, and will occasionally spend a week or two in the Hospital Wing; no one's quite sure what's wrong with him, but he's always so positive that people try not to worry about it
- Teddy alternates between being down and depressed and very mischievous. When he's in a good mood, he'll assist Lucy and Molly in their pranking endeavours. When he's down, his Metamorphmagus abilities falter a little, revealing just how similar to Sirius and Remus he looks like. He, like Bill, has some werewolf tendancies like preferring rare meat. Strangely enough, his mood mirrors the lunar cycle. He's also a dab hand at potions, and is secretely attempting to become an animagus. When he succeeds, he will be the first Metamorphmagus Animagus, as well as the first Colour-Changing Ball Python. Hufflepuff
- James is a very popular person. His humour is a bit like his uncle Ron's, and that leads to some hurt feelings, but he's usually decent enough about apologising. The exception to this would be to his siblings, to whom he is ruthless. At least, until Lily gets her wand. James has a pet dog his parents "don't know about" that he sneaks into Hogwarts every year. It's a really, /really/ tiny thing named Sneeze, and he lends him to Hugo whenever he's sick. Gryffindor
- Finally, Lily Luna. She's got a bit of a "Mad Scientist" flair, and was a hatstall between Slytherin and Ravenclaw, with the later winning out by a hair. She was inspired growing up by her namesake, who performed magic that held back death itself, and thus Lily Luna has become a bit obsessed with doing the same. Albeit, a bit more...permanently than what her grandmother did. It doesn't help that Lily is /brilliant/ and really more than a bit bored up in that tower.

  - Over time her tendencies towards the darker side of magic grow, and if anyone is going to discover the Chamber of Secrets again, it's going to be her. Let's just call it irony
