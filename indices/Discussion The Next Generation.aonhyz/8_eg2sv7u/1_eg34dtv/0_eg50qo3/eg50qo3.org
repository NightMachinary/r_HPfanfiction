Thanks! I drew upon the limited facts of the Epilogue and other information.

1) We know nothing about James' appearance, unlike his younger siblings. Even /post/ Epilogue, we know more about Rose (red hair) and Hugo (bushy hair) than James.

2) Lily is not mentioned /at all/ in the Quidditch 2014 thing.

3) Favoritism is, unfortunately, an extremely common occurrence. It happens for conscious and unconscious reasons. Ginny /is/ the favored child, so she thinks nothing of it, while favoritism is all that Harry knows in raising children because of the Dursleys.

4) Harry feels a severe need to defend naming his son Severus.

5) James is hopeful of his parents' attention, yet they ignore him, criticize him, and say nothing positive about him.

6) Ginny compares James to Ron, the brother to whom she was always rudest and sometimes even cruel.

7) Albus acts like a completely normal, if clingy, child, yet Harry and Ginny are so focused on him that they don't even care if James safely made it onto the platform. James could have been kidnapped and Harry and Ginny wouldn't have noticed until the train was leaving. They also insult James in front of Albus.

8) Lily doesn't interact with Albus, only James and Hugo. Favored children, like Albus, are usually alienated from their siblings. It seems he isn't close to Teddy, either, as he doesn't share his siblings' enthusiasm at the prospect of Teddy joining the family.

9) Harry likely favors Albus to subconsciously fill a void inside himself (in fact, JKR gives this as the reason for Albus Severus' abysmal name). He's still dealing with mental issues. Ginny does nothing to stop Harry's favoritism toward Albus because she prefers ignoring signs of an unstable relationship.

10) It's a cycle of abuse. (Refer to #3.)
