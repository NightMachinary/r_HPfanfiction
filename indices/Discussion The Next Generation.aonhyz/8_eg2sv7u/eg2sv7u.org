*Teddy Lupin (1998)*

A Hufflepuff with Slytherin tendencies. Gryffindor wasn't even considered as a House for him. He grew up with Andromeda but he spends the weekend at the Potters' house. He's extremely protective of James, who's often neglected in favor of his younger siblings. It's Teddy's idea to publish erroneous information to the newspaper regarding James' sorting.

*Victoire Weasley (2000)*

A Ravenclaw who is very practical. She's also very intuitive. Sometimes she relies on her instincts too much, although she's usually right in the end.

*Dominique Weasley (2003)*

Another Hufflepuff with Slytherin tendencies. She's uncommonly kind and patient, but also extremely stubborn, sometimes irrationally so.

*Louis Weasley (2006)*

Ravenclaw. He's blond like his sisters but that's the only Veela trait he inherited. His friendly personality naturally draws people to him. He also has a quick-witted sense of humor.

*Rose Weasley (2005)*

Gryffindor. She's honest, not brutally so but she'll speak without thinking, and sometimes that gets her into trouble. She's close to James, whom she regards as an older brother, and it's through him that she meets Scorpius.

*Hugo Weasley (2007)*

Ravenclaw and extremely creative. Unlike Rose, who's book-smart, Hugo is just very intuitive. He and Lily remain friends even though they're in different Houses.

*Fred II Weasley (2006)*

Hufflepuff. He has a lot of identity issues because he looks very little like his namesake. He absolutely hates Quidditch, has never pulled a prank in his life, and in regards to the joke shop, he's only interested in the business side of things.

*Roxanne Weasley (2008)*

Gryffindor. She's the one who inherits the joke shop when Fred decides he wants to be a writer instead. She doesn't have as many identity issues as Fred, but she does feel out of place with her darker coloring.

*Lorcan and Lysander Scamander (post 2007)*

Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, respectively. Lorcan's the more outgoing twin and he's protective of Lysander, who often has his head in the clouds.

*Molly II and Lucy Weasley (2002)*

Both of them are in Gryffindor. Molly's given name is actually Mary, but Arthur started calling her Little Molly because she reminds him of his wife. Mary and Lucy get in the most trouble out of all of the cousins.

*Scorpius Malfoy (2005)*

Slytherin. He's rather rude until he meets James, who takes him under his wing and protects him from bullies. He's not an outright bigot, but he does think Muggles are strange and definitely lesser than wizards. His relationship with Rose helps him to grow out of the ideology.

*James Sirius Potter (2004)*

Slytherin. Often neglected by his parents, he becomes extremely independent and forms his own family with his circle of friends. When he's younger all he wants is Harry and Ginny's approval, but finally he gets sick of the constant belittlement and moves in with Teddy and Victoire right before his sixth year. With his black hair and brown eyes, charismatic personality, and streak of independence, he often reminds Harry and Ginny of Tom Riddle. He's extremely protective of his younger siblings, although Albus doesn't appreciate it and instead further ridicules him.

*Albus Severus Potter (2005)*

Gryffindor. He's petrified of being in Slytherin after seeing the way his parents treat James. In the beginning he's close to Rose, but he rapidly gets jealous and rude when he realizes she's forming other friendships. His sense of entitlement also frustrates her and they stop being friends until he meets a Muggleborn girl who helps him change his attitude. He resembles Harry except for his light auburn hair. Harry specifically named him after Snape because he wanted Snape to have a part of Lily. When Albus finds out about this, he's disgusted; he's also talked to Neville, who doesn't sugar coat the truth about Snape. As soon as he's seventeen, Albus legally changes his middle name to Rubeus. He also insists on going by Al.

*Lily Luna Potter (2007)*

Gryffindor with Ravenclaw tendencies. When she was younger, she was a romantic, but as she grew older she realized her life wasn't as perfect as her parents pretended. She has a hard time dating because she doesn't trust herself to distinguish infatuation from love. She has trouble tolerating Albus, but she's extremely close to James. When James moves out, she often goes to visit him. She has dark red hair and hazel eyes. At first Snape's portrait absolutely hates her because she looks like a combination of Harry's parents, but then he starts to imprint Lily I onto her and becomes obsessed with her. As a result James ends up burning Snape's portrait.
