I play in the canon-verse a lot, but the more that has come out in recent years the more I have deeper I have crawled into my sandbox not really wanting to incorporate recent revelations into my own headcanon verse. I'm just very pick and choose off the revelation tree at this point. Through all that, my head canons for the Next Gen have remained fairly consistent.

​

*Rose Weasley*- Ravenclaw. Laid back. Intelligent. Book collector. Possesses the kind of intelligence where she never actually studies and still pulls passing grades. Loves (and hates) her dad's many nicknames for her. Will come after you with facts, logic and a punch to the face.
