Yeah they all should get their own names. It seems to be an unspoken literary rule to not repeat names unless there is a completely good reason since it can get confusing.

A good way JKR did it was make Teddy named after his grandfather but be known by something other than “Ted.” That decision was good. The rest of the namesakes are a bit tedious.
