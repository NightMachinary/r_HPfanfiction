This may be an unpopular opinion.

I think that Rowling got caught up in the success of the original series, and it intimidated her into writing subpar novels. It's understandable, how could anyone top Harry Potter? But still, her books read like fan fiction, and they come off as both trying too hard and playing too safe, which, like I said, is understandable but still disappointing.

Furthermore, to name a next gen character after a character in the original generation indicates epilogue. How could you possibly make that character his/her own character when the reader already has a set of feelings and impressions associated with the original character whom they were named after? In books, we cannot see, but I hope she won't go truly fan fiction and include “piercing emerald eyes” and “white blonde hair like ice” in every other paragraph.
