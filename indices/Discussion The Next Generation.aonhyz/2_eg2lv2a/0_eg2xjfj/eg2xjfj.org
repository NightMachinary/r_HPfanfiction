Seriously though! I can see using a middle name to honor a loved one, but I've always felt that more of (particularly Harry's kids) the 2nd gen kids should have had their own name. A name that didn't hold all this meaning they had to “live up to.” For instance, Albus. Who on earth wants to live up to a name like Albus when at first hearing it people would think Dumbledore...? I always thought that the addition of Severus was to give the name, the redemption it didn't fully get with Snape.
