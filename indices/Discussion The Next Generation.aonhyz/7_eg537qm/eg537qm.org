I'm not too set on anything to do with the next generation. I have some ideas, but I'm not committed enough to call them my headcanon.

Probably my favorite idea is that Harry and Ginny have only one child: Lily Luna Potter. Harry/Ginny are both busy people. They always have time for their daughter but just don't think they should add more kids to that. It's a hard decision because they both imagine a slightly larger family, but it works for them. Lily will often be found watching her mother's quidditch practices where the team loves their little mascot or writing letters to her godmother (Luna) in Harry's office where he's always happy to use her as a reason to procrastinate on his paperwork. Molly thinks they treat her too much like a little adult, but she's an overall happy kid. However, she does recognize from a young age that her dad has a dangerous job. She also knows he was an orphan and she lives with some fear for the life of her parents that becomes more low-key over time. She ends up a Slytherin because her parents, the Harpies, and the ministry workers have shown her determination and ambition as much as they have bravery. She faces some problems at school for it, but Harry told her that he was almost a Slytherin and Ginny told her that married an almost-Slytherin. It's still hard, but she get confidence from that (and hexes a lot of people.) She gets along with Scorpius, who dates Rose, but her best friend is Ivana Zabini. They're families had dinner together twice, both times resulted in the adults verbally savaging each other at the table while they watched in awe. Lily becomes an auror.

If I incorporated the epilogue, I still like the idea of Lily being the Slytherin. Albus becomes a Gryffindor but still is best friends with Slytherin Scorpius. He's better at research than practical magic but he's got some really strong hexes that Ginny taught him, and Harry made sure he could perform an impressive shield charm. He becomes an Unspeakable. James is very restless and exasperating. He's good enough at every subject, but leaves Hogwarts with no solid plans. He works in a shop in New York, assists researchers in Romania, and plays chaser on an amateur quidditch team in France and makes a few other stops. His longest job was as a fireman in the muggle world. He does return to Britain years later and takes the job of muggle studies professor (and then flying instructor...and then Care of Magical Creatures...).

I'm also fine with the canon stuff though. I seem to be one of the few people who is okay with Delphini and, if her story was ever continued, I'd like to see Harry visiting her in prison and being able to get through to her. My story for her is that she actually looks a lot like her parents. In prison, with drab clothes and the color gone from her hair, the resemblance is clear. She'll talk like she supports everything her father did, but she has no real investment in anti-muggle and anti-muggleborn ideas. She's desperate to prove herself more than she is power-hungry. Harry's a bit alarmed when, over time, that desire to prove herself and earn someone's favor becomes her trying to impress him.
