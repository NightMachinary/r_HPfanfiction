[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(7718942;12040341): The first story is a Star Wars crossover, in which Harry followed Sirius through the Veil and ended up in the SW universe. Emperor Palpatine captured him and successfully turned him into a vicious Sith Lord. Harry returned after 4 years in the SW universe, but only 41 days in his home universe, extremely powerful and terrifying. Hermione and Luna managed to moderate him somewhat, but at cost of becoming quite dark themselves. Together they embarked on a megalomaniac plan of global domination.

In the sequel, their plan was disrupted by treachery and they were forced to leave Earth through the Star Gate. Out there, the power Trio took their fight to the Goa'ulds, and their ambitions now extended to the Galaxy. They generally had benevolent goals, but would not hesitate to use tortures and genocides against their enemies. On the other hand, the Goa'ulds were totally filthy evil scums who made Voldemort and Palpatine look positively enlightened.
