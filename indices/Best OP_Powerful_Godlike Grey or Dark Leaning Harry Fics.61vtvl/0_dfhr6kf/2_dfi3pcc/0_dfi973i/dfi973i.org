Both Harrys are pretty strong. The writer is oddly good at making the story challenging, though.

You know the fics where the author is forced to one-up themselves by creating impossible challenges where the protagonist overcomes it with ease, only to be forced to create an even more impossible challenge?

This fic doesn't do that. It's refreshing.
