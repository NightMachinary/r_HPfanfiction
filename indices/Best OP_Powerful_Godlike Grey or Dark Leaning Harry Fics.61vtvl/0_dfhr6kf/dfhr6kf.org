It's not completed, but you're not going to find much better than linkffn(2705927).

Basic "Harry is sent to another dimension" story.

Dumbledore has done evil things but isn't an evil person.

Harry's parents - at least, initially - distrust him.

Harry's "alternate" self is a Death Eater. Kind of.

This is one of those honest, gritty stories.

Author states that there is Angst, but it isn't teen-drama bullshit.
