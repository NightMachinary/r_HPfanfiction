Bellatrix's character traits are fanatical insanity and loyalty, so doing this in character can be tricky. Some options

1. Change the character: You don't have to stay completely loyal to canon. Maybe Bella is one of Voldemort's more contentious henchmen who constantly questions him, and she just believes that you have to put on a loyal face in public. Or as some people mentioned, you can add jealously or something similar.
2. Dark Lord isn't evil enough: You can make Voldemort more pragmatic (He doesn't actually like torturing, he just does it because it works on his dark followers, he just wants power. If it makes sense he will lie low and forbid additional attacks until the heat dies off). By leaving Bella a fanatic and making voldemort more rational, you can have a conflict where Bella decides Voldemort isn't evil enough because he is making compromises and power plays instead of just going all in.
3. "He made me like this": Bella is a doe-eyed new recruit who volunteers herself to the dark lord, and he decides to experiment on her, warping her mind to his whim. Thus Bella is a creation of the dark lord, much like Nagini. Your turn comes from temporarily (or partially) bringing back the girl she used to be, and then having her go "My god, what did he make me do".
4. "I got help". This is more for a heel-face turn rather than changing masters, but you can have Bella address her insanity. Maybe she gets accidentally put into a Muggle mental hospital. Maybe she is captured on a mission abroad and they have better magical mental health services than Britain. You basically end up with Harley Quinn from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_and_Harley_Quinn][Batman and Harley Quinn]]. Again, this doesn't really work for changing evil masters, unless you are going to make Ginny less 'dark' and more 'grey'
