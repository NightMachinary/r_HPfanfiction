Thanks for all the help. I read your fic and I'm enjoying your work the one thing I will say is I don't like the fact that the dark lord calls Ginny, Ginny; I prefer it when Voldemort calls her Ginevra. Not only because it feels in character with him to use the more formal name, but it highlights the divide from Ginny's old life to her new one. Ginny is what her friends and family call her, but Ginevra is what the dark lord calls her.

This would work well in your story because it's another form of psychological control the dark lord has on her by renaming her. It strips her of her old identity and replacing it with one the dark lord created.

On a positive note; I enjoy the fact that Ginny isn't some god child who can steamroll her opponents. Her victories will feel earned. I also enjoy your foreshadowing if that scene in the great hall actually does happen in the end. (don't tell me if it does)
