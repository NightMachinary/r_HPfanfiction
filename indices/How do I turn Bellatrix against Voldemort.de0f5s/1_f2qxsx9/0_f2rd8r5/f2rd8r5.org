Something about your comment made something click for me. What if I don't square this circle? What if she doesn't stay with Ginny because she loves her?

What if I have her kill Voldemort and have her Bellatrix try and avenge the dark lord. So far Ginny's motives for keeping Bellatrix alive are that she enjoys her company and she does think that they were both abuse victims. What if the reason Bella stays with Ginny is that she wants to kill her. It's only that Ginevra proves herself as a capable dark lord that she does. That way Bella stays in character and I get a fun relationship dynamic.

Bellatrix never says she loves her or shows her any outward feelings of affection. Ginny gets to show how far she's cracked by having taunt Bellatrix that she is enjoying the world she's created while also playfully threatening her to smile cause it's the only thing keeping her alive.
