Bellatrix being mad about being shoved aside for a pet snake would make more sense if Nagini was a dumb animal, and not as much if Nagini was known to be sentient.

All the Death Eaters have seen Voldemort talk to her in front of them, and they know Voldy's sent Nagini off on private missions, like Arthur Weasley in the DoM on Christmas of 1996. At the very least, Nagini's contributions would be ranked among the lower-tier Death Eaters like Pettigrew.
