If she's cunning enough to achieve such a thing, the obvious way would be for Ginny to place Voldemort in a situation where it is convenient for him to sacrifice Bellatrix like a pawn in a chess game. Bellatrix may not be foolish enough to think the Dark Lord loves her the way /she/ loves /him/, but I'd assume she is still very devoted to the idea that Voldemort /values/ her more than anyone else, and would be heartbroken if he showed otherwise. Perhaps Voldemort has to choose between Bellatrix and Nagini, and, perhaps not knowing that Nagini is a Horcrux, Bellatrix goes ballistic when it becomes apparent he likes his /pet snake/ better than her?
