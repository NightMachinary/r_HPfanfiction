In my headcanon every single magical person has their own innate resistance to magic, so any transfigurations cast on them will eventually run out after a while as their own magic "attacks" the foreign magic affecting their system, like antibodies attacking a virus.

Muggles consequently lack this innate resistance so transfigurations cast on them would be permanent. That's why there are strict Muggle Baiting laws in place to prevent this.

As for conjuration? It depends on the complexity of the object in question and the power used in the casting, as well as laws of physics. Which means you can conjure water and its safe to drink because there is already water everywhere, the air is full of minute, trace amounts of it, unless you are in a very dry environment. However food is another matter, conjured food would lack any calorific content and would just be flavoured air given temporary solid form.

A wizard or witch, given enough power could conjure a chair and have that chair be permanent, but only powerhouses like Dumbledore and Voldemort could pull that off. Anyone else and the chair would disappear eventually.
