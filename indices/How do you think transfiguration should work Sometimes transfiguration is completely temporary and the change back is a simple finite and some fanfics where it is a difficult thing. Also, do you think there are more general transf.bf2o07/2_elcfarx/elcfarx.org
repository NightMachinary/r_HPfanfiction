I think that transfiguration can be made temporary (reverts after some time) or permanent depending on the spell used since both have their use cases. But even with the best permanent transfiguration it still 'remembers' the original shape and can be untransfigured without knowing exactly what the original was, which is why animagi can be untransfigured with a simple spell. It is also why a rock transfigured into food isn't edible, transfigured uranium isn't fissile and why you can't just transfigure lead into gold. Alchemy is a more advanced art that allows complete transformations that cannot be reversed, but it is much more difficult and requires catalysts. The Philosopher's Stone is a very advanced catalyst that can be used to create gold and elixir of life and possibly a few other things. A different alchemical catalyst may make the creation of edible food possible.
