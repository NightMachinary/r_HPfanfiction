Why would wizards and witches have gardens or anything when they could transfigure it from dirt? Why would the trio not transfigure it when they were starving? Conjuration is not inherently different from transfiguration I think. You're making something from nothing as opposed to changing something to something else. In the gamps law wiki “It should be noted that while food cannot be outright created from nothing, it can be multiplied if one already has some food to multiply, it can be enlarged or the food can be summoned if one knows the approximate location and is fairly sure the food will still be there.[1] It should also be noted that while "good food" cannot be conjured, consumable liquids such as sauces,[2]wine,[3] and potable water can be,[4] as they are not nourishing substances. “ Food wouldn't be good is what I am saying. You can make pigs with conjuration but they won't be nourishing. You can turn a desk into a pig but it would have the nutrients of a desk. Why would the philosophers stone be so big a deal if it was simple to make true gold from something else.
