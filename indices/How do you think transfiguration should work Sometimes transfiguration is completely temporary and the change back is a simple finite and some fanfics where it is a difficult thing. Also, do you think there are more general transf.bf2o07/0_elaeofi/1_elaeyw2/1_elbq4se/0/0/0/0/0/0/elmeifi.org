Because not everyone is good at it? Why is any industry a thing in Harry Potter when anyone can learn magic? Just because you can transfigure food, doesn't mean you're going to practice enough to be able to do much with it. Transfiguration is noted at being the most difficult branch of magic. There's no reason the average wizard would be able to transfigure a full meal if they don't focus on it.

​

Nothing in what you just said mentions transfiguration. It's specifically Conjuration. Transfiguration is altering matter at a molecular level. Conjuration is making shit appear out of nothing. There's a fundamental difference there. Gold is a weird exception, and that's noted in HP. There's nothing about other metals, so there's just something different about gold.

I can make my own sofa, but it's a lot easier to just buy one.
