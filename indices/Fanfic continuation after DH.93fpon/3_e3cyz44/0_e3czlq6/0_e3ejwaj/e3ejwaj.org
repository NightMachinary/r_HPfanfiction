There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3435601/NoahPhantom][The Albus Potter Series By NoahPhantom]], and while its introduction of new kind of magic that both explains some of the old and is innovative in turn is quite interesting, I have to warn you that there's a cliffhanger right at the end of the seventh book and that the authors involved haven't continued the few thousand words of the started sequel meant to deal with that cliffhanger for a couple of years now, though I have recently heard from someone that they are planning to do so still.
