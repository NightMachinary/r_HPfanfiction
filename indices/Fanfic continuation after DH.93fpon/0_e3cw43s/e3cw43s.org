Hi, welcome.

Lets get you started with some canon compliant stuff, first check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][this user]] they've written a bunch of stories that all mesh together for one wider world. Their stories aren't written chronologically but on their page, the one I linked, they list them in that order, I think 'Grave Days' is the first that picks up where the books ended.

After that I'd get you to check out works by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][Floreat Castellum]] who occasionally can be found on this subreddit. Her stories are fantastically well written and canon compliant.

after that you'll have fics like linkffn(4367121) which aren't by any means my favourite but are quite popular.
