Since it seems you want canon-compliant at least up until Cursed Child, I think little0bird is the author to read first. She hits almost every part of post-battle canon (canon pairings except some minor characters I think), canon professions, etc. The thing to know about little0bird is that her fics are not your typical Harry Potter adventure/mystery fic. They are very much an imagining of how Harry's life would have likely developed post-war, which means some PTSD stuff and normal life. One could argue that there is a distinct lack of actual magic in her world. These are very slice of life, character-driven stories. But they are very well written and capture the characters incredibly well.
