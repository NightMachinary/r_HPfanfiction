There's probably a hundred thousand of them. Like, once the seventh book came out, the most common starting point with fanfiction was the "what happens after the final battle and before the epilogue." It's how I got into fanfiction.

Truthfully, they can be kinda of sorted into a two different flavors. First is, what kind of job do you want Harry to have afterwards. Usually it's like Quidditch Player, Professor, or Auror. And secondly, its what kind of pairing do you want? Do you think Ginny and Harry immediately got back together and wasted no time in starting a family? Or do you think he explored his options a bit before committing, or think that Harry/Hermione is the OTP?

There's a few authors people recommend to starters. I haven't read these kinds of fics in a really long time, but I know of Northumbrian, Floreatcastellum, and littl0bird.
