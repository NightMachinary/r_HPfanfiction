swissdog's series Harry's Future, Professor Potter, Harry Potter and the Children of the Clan and Harry Potter and the Magic War (WIP, really slow updates) which have part of cannon post DH and other things not so much.

With that I looked in the deep bottom of my favourites and found back some old fics post DH that I read so long ago when I began reading fanfics. Unfortunately all are not completed. As for the quality I don't remember everything so I can't say if it's going to be good or not but it should at least not be awful.

all recs above may not be the best fics but as I said it's amongst the first fics I read and it's been quite some time. Hopefully you'll find something you'll enjoy.

As other already said, look for Northumbrian and little0bird who also did good post DH fics.
