You may try Realizations by sbmcneil....it's technically a H/G fic but there is a good amount on Hermione and does explores her flaws, but not in a bashing way. This is a post-battle fic (it's honestly my favorite one, but unfortunately incomplete...luckily not incomplete at a frustrating plot point).
