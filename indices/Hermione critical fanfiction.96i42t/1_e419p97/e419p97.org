That's actually a surprisingly tall order. The problem is that her /canon/ flaws (as opposed to her fanon flaws) are complex and are virtues half the time.

For example, if a character's flaw is that they are impulsive, that's easy to write, and it's easy to show the character suffering the consequences of that flaw and working to overcome it. However, Hermione's flaws tend to be more along the lines of her thinking that she knows what's best for everyone, and being willing to ruthlessly impose what she thinks is best on them whether they want it or not. To write the consequences of that sort of flaw, the author needs to set up relatively complex scenarios, with complex dialogue and characterisation.

This is further complicated by this flaw actually being a virtue---a part of what we call "leadership"---a lot of the time, because Hermione does accomplish a lot. Indeed, a whole lot of WBWL/Gray!Powerful!Independent!Harry fics actually treat this very flaw as a virtue when Harry does it.

Worse yet, her flaws are highly situational. In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), those traits that make her friendless in Gryffindor are the very traits that she needs to turn up to 11 to survive and even thrive in Slytherin.

Actually, now that I think about it, in ACA her friends /do/ call her out on her trying to run their lives for their own good, so that might be an example of the sort of fic you are looking for.

Another that comes to mind is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3682339/1/The-Golden-Age]]), where Hermione's ruthlessness and protectiveness has consequences.
