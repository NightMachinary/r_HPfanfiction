Actually, Hermione gets dissed quite a bit in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106):

She stared up at the professors with big, innocent eyes. I grinned. Not only was Ms. Granger clever, but she was apparently an adept liar and surprisingly loyal, considering our previous lack of a relationship. If she was as talented at dueling as she was the simpler magics, she would resemble a younger, saner Bellatrix. As we hurried to our dormitory -- dismissed by the professors -- I seized the chance to recruit a new minion.

"Hermione," I said sweetly, "Do you want to be friends?"

Merlin bless the simple interactions of children.

--------------

Hermione pouted. "So, that means we don't need to brew an illegal potion with stolen ingredients, knock out three of our classmates, tie them up in a closet, sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, and interrogate Malfoy?"

I gaped at her. "Was that your plan?"

I fear that Hermione may be the most evil of us all. That is concerning since I am a retired Dark Lord.

--------------

Upon closer observation, I had cast aside my early assumption that Hermione was this generation's Bellatrix. Her obsession with rules, goody-two-shoes personality, intelligence, and hidden cruelty were far more reminiscent of my younger self.

--------------

My jaw dropped in a very Weasley fashion. "You returned the time turner? But Hermione, we had the power to bend time to our will. We could have done so many things."

"That's why I returned it," Hermione said primly.

Traitorous, selfish, and unrepentantly evil...Yes, she was exactly like me at that age.

--------------

"Obviously," she huffed. "I'm just threatening to report that she's an illegal animagus. I also kept her in a bottle for a while."

I frowned. "For how long?"

"A couple of days," Hermione said.

"Did you feed her?" I asked.

Hermione paled. "It didn't really occur to me."

"You gave her water at least..." I said.

"Um..."

I shook my head, caught between admiration and shock. "And now you're blackmailing her? I don't know why you didn't just kill her quickly. It would have been kinder."

I have a great distaste for most forms of torture. My only exception to this is Crucio, which is much cleaner and does not have as many long-lasting side effects. Well, unless the victims are driven insane. I rarely kept prisoners long enough to reach that point, however, and opted to kill as often as possible. Further, I sought to never leave a child orphaned for more than a few minutes.
