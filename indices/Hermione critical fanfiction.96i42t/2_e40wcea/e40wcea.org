It's a 'Harry makes his own side' style fic. In my opinion the author does a good job showing the perspectives of both Harry, Hermione and Ron, exploring their rather severe choices while not outright labeling either side as good or evil. In particular, it explores how Hermione might have developed some bad personality traits due to the habit of having Harry reliant upon her. She is dismissive of wizarding culture and politics while being absolutely assured of her own high intelligence, so she is susceptible to certain types of manipulation. Eventually she has to face the consequences
