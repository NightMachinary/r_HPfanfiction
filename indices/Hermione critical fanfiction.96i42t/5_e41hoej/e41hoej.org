Tentatively suggesting linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key:Reloaded). It's not really a good fic (the ending is shit and characters don't really learn from their mistakes), but it has an amazing little arc where Hermione delves into forbidden magic simply because she's smart enough to do so, with predictably awful results
