Nah, it's just another bashfic. It's one of those fics that bashes a canon character for not knowing (and therefore taking advantage of) the author's fanon, sort of like Dumbledore gets bashed for not encouraging Harry to Swear on His Magic (So Mote it Be) during GoF or OOTP. And, it's all wrapped up in the classic bashfic package in which the author avatar righteously rants at the target, and the accepts the abuse meekly before either lashing out in impotent rage or running off in tears.
