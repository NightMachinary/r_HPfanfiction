I loved that one (even wrote a review, which I am not always doing - just when I truly like a story or a unique premises (like here! I mean with the time turner a promissing student could in theory invent a totally new rune language or earn their NEWTS early, become an animagus etc. the potential for use are litterally ENDLESS! Seriously, a time turner is a ridiculously powerful artifact and being given one for extra classes just makes no sense! This - that Hermione was given one to use it to its full potential and do great things? - makes far more sense than "extra classes"!))
