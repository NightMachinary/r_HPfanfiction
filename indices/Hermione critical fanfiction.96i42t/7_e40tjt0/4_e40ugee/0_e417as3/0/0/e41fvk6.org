The issue I have with the story is that the author obviously intended to write the story as a criticism on Hermione's character in the series. It doesn't develop off flaws indicated in the books or criticises her actions in the series, the brunt of the criticism instead comes from made up fanon which makes the story pointless.

I love stories that take a different perspective, but this story might as well not be set in the Harry Potter universe for all it's validity. It doesn't offer any useful insight.
