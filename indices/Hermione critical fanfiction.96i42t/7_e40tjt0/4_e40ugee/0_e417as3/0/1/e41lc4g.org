The outright fabrications and changes from canon from that fic:

- Elemental affinities
- An implicit obligation to abuse access to time-turners
- Arithmancy as a method for modifying spells accessible to a bright third year
- Hermione spending five hours preparing her hair
- Simple spells for hair preparation
- An obligation for Hermione to confess to starting the DA so she could be expelled along with Harry
- That it's reasonable to expect a teenager to immediately turn to lethal spells in dangerous situations
- Silent casting as a readily accessible discipline that an academically minded person would obviously want to pursue
- Hermione being jealous of Harry
- Hermione's grades slipping
- Harry beating Hermione in Charms and Herbology
- Hermione berating and forcing Harry not to go to Godric's Hollow (she just raised a reasonable objection about safety, and that objection turned out to be correct)
- Hermione spending time on the run studying 7th year material
- Hermione forcing Harry and Ron to do the same
- Hermione not trying to kill Nagini (there's no sign she shirked this duty; battles can be confusing)
- Hermione being able to make portkeys
- Hermione and friends being granted their NEWTs without sitting exams
- Hermione berating her friends for accepting that fabricated offer

The borderline stuff:

- Hermione modifying her parents' memory without their consent (movie canon, not book canon, apparently?)
- Bringing a person into a Fidelius-protected area not being enough to share the secret with them

The pure mistakes and implausible parts:

- A government organization specifically seeking out people who would break rules
- Sleekeazy's being sold when there is a simple spell that replaces it
- An academic organization preferring candidates who had not taken standard academic exams
- A government interview going through what you'd done as a teenager

And then there are maybe four reasonable points.

That's garbage.
