[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059), is very good H/Hr fic, but this Hermione got stuck in her 'good guys don't kill' mindset for a long time.

Hermione can be stubborn to a fault in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028).

Despite appearing more powerful and even more knowledgeable than in canon, the Hermione in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146), actually got lots of important things wrong. Harry had much better intuition and leadership skills.
