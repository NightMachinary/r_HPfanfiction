I don't want to spoil it... but Snape and Narcissa conspire to change Draco's personality and make him into a Gryffindor in the Innocent series! The story is about Sirius kidnapping and adopting Harry when he's 8 years old instead of in third year, and a lot changes based on that. I don't think Hogwarts happens until the second installment of the series though you do meet Draco in the first one. The whole thing is excellent and I suggest you check it out if you want some adorable Draco & trio interactions, plus some great mentor Snape!

Draco's internal conflict with his upbringing and father vs. the new people he meets and ideas he comes across is really well done. I think he's my favorite character in the whole story (and I'm usually not a Draco fan!).
