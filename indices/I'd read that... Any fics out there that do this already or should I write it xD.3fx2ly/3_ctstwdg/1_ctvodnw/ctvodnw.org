This is pretty good. A bit overly long, a lot of the dramatic tension in the plot feels forced, but the characters are enjoyable, if slightly overpowered. (May I also recommend linkffn(Be Careful)? It's a post-6th year Draco hops to an alternate universe fic, but it's a bit better IMHO than the main Dangerverse.)
