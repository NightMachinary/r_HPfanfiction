Realistically... I don't think he'd stop calling muggleborns "mudbloods" or the Weasleys "Blood-Traitors." Draco's not an orphan, and i'm sure his parents would still love him if he were sorted into Gryffindor ( maybe he'd transfer to Durmstrang?) Lucius and Arthur still have their feud, and Molly doesn't like the Malfoys, so I don't think she'd be knitting him a sweater any time soon. I don't think Draco would get bullied much either. In the first book, Pansy Parkinson seems to be on good terms/knows Parvati Patil, who is in Gryffindor. Houses don't seem to mean nearly as much as in canon as they do in most fanfiction.

Just my two cents
