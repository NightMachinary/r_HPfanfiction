I think he would just transfer to Durmstrang, since he wanted to go there anyway. If for some reason he stayed, he would probably ignore all of his housemates, and/or make fun of them, at least for the first year. Perhaps long-term exposure to Gryffindors, who generally are perfectly fine with muggleborns and hate the pureblood supremacy stuff would soften his heart a bit. But he still has outside pressure from his parents/friends he had before getting sorted into Gryffindor to pull him back. Even so, if Draco's parents figure out that he's being influenced, they'd pull him out of Hogwarts.
