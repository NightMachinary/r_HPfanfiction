Firstly, because it makes Voldemort mad. So does calling him Tom, of course, but the fact remains that Voldemort is very insistent that only his most trusted associates call him "Lord Voldemort" while others aren't worthy to speak his name. So putting it on everyone's lips would annoy him like all hell.

Secondly and more strategically, Dumbledore may well have foreseen that Voldemort would try to use the Taboo if he got the chance. So he wanted to close off that option to him by making the name so commonplace a Taboo Curse would be absolutely useless.
