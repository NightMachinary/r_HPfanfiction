Maybe because he chose it? “It is our choices that show what we truly are..." It is possible Dumbledore calls him by that name to remind himself that Voldemort chose his pitiful existence. Also, you'll notice he doesn't use 'Lord' before Voldemort.

Now another less probable reason... with a touch of Ollivander, here. "...After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things --- terrible, yes, but great.” To respect his abilities, no matter for what despicable deeds he uses them for?

The headmaster calls him 'Tom' when he pities him, or when he is trying to provoke him. After all, in the beginning, he was an orphan, simply mistreated, misguided, and likely to head down the wrong path.
