It is true that everybody uses just plain “Voldemort” more than I remembered (and how fanon remembers it, obviously), but certainly not always (more than once). For example:

#+begin_quote
  On the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort's old school things.
#+end_quote

(that's the finale of CoS and Dumbledore speaks rather semi-officially with Lucius Malfoy; certainly a good opportunity NOT to call him “Lord”)
