"Voldemort was a deliberate cipher: self-effacing, a wordless riddle. His manifesto was silence. The world's understanding, to the extent it has one, is largely a collage based on the confessions of his associates, yet insofar as a man can be known by the company he keeps and the ideas he spreads, he kept company the way a farmer keeps chickens and spread ideas like feed: their food was not his food, and though he had them in thrall, they had no portion in him. In a sense he had no followers; where he walked, he walked alone, regardless of who was with him."
