Honestly, quite a few of his death eaters looked like they didn't care.

He was a powerful symbol of the cause. I don't think he really believed it himself.

I think we give Voldemort too little credit on this sub. He's actually more competent than the order of the Phoenix, and would have most likely killed Dumbledore in book 5 had it not been for Fawkes taking a curse.

As for why, from what I understand, Voldemort's reign of terror only started around 1970. While Dumbledore knew him as a Half-Blood, he also probably didn't have the proof of his heritage until later on. It's not like he advertised it to the teachers at Hogwarts.

Not everything in the books was fleshed out, but I don't think expanding on this would have matched Rowling's style.
