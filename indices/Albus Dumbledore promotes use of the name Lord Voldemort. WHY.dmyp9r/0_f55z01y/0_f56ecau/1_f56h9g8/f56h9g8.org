You're assuming Dumbledore was a pragmatic mastermind without any morals.

It's been a historical reality that even after you win, you let your enemies survive, because killing them would generate more bad will than letting them go. More often than not, political opposition within the same culture group would be spared, with some scapegoats sentenced to death, usually. There are several historical precedents to affirm that (Roman civil wars, American Civil War, various European conflicts that are too numerous to list etc.)

As to Dumbledore spreading the knowledge about Tom. I admit, it's strange, unless all his Death Eaters were already aware of his ancestry, just didn't talk about it in public. Remember he gave his diary to Lucius Malfoy. It wouldn't take a long time for someone with the resources of Lucius to research the name Tom Marvolo Riddle. The fact that Voldemort was Tom Riddle wouldn't make any difference to his Death Eaters and wouldn't make the public fear him less. It might be embarrassing, but again, would it be crippling?

Of course, this is grasping at straws. We KNOW for a fact that Voldemort was terrible enough that people feared saying his name. Would they be less fearful knowing of his origins? I don't think so. They might find him hypocritical, but then again he was a monster. Is knowing that the person who killed you was a hypocrite makes you feel any better?

I know I'm playing devil's advocate here, but I don't think the easy solution, that many fanfic writers use, of releasing Tom Riddle's ancestry and life story as a sure-fire, one-way ticket to defeating Voldemort is the right one.
