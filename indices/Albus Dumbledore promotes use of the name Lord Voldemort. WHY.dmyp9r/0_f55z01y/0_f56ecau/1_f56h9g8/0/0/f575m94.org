Well, his larger than life persona was based on his ruthless nature and his extreme capability in magic. I don't know if it would matter much that he was a half-blood like Dumbledore. He would still be feared extremely, since he was a remorseless killer and an insanely powerful wizard.

I think people who went to school with him would connect the dots, that's true, especially with the first Death Eaters being his classmates (as confirmed by Dumbledore in HBP).

The only issue is, would they be less afraid of him then they would be if his origins remained a mystery. I don't think so. It's one of JKR's mistakes. Regardless any deliberate stupidity on behalf of the Wizarding World, they still seem to hold onto some semblance of logic (ironically the Quibbler and even Rita Skeeter), they would have found out.
