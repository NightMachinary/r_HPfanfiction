Well, yeah but the man was a school teacher who only reluctantly put on the commanders hat, he wasn't ever an auror or trained in anyway to fight anyone much less dark wizards, you can't expect a perfect strategist out of the guy.

Besides- they were fanatics, they might not have listened or cared and at the end of the day he was at least a half blood, far more powerful and most importantly to them on the pureblood side which makes up for a lot- not hurt by the fact if you betray him you get tortured to death.
