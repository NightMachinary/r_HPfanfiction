In normal humans, sure, but Dumbledore is a wizard. There definitely were a couple of times where it was said that he moved with the speed and agility of a far younger man, and other times where his speed is highly complimented. Also, supposedly he is 150ish.

Not sure how getting cursed with the ring is relevant.
