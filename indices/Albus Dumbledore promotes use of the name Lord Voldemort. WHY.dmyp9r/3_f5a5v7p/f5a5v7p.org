Honestly, it's because Rowling didn't come up with Tom Riddle until after she wrote Philosopher's Stone. In PS, Dumbledore's actions make complete sense, because Voldemort isn't just a title, /it's his actual name/. Dumbledore tells us this himself in that book...

  "Call him Voldemort, Harry. *Always use the proper name for things*. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."

It's only in Chamber of Secrets that he is given a secret, pre-Voldemort identity, which makes Dumbledore retroactively sound like an idiot in this scene. So many confusing things in Philosopher's Stone make a lot more sense if you ignore how they were broken by the later books.

Why did Dumbledore fly to the ministry? Because apparition wasn't a thing yet.

Why does Hagrid think Voldemort would have wanted to recruit a 'mudblood', like Lily Potter? Because blood purity wasn't a thing yet.

Why doesn't Dumbledore step in to stop the Dursley's abuse? Because Rowling hadn't decided he knew about that yet.

Why do people talk about Quirrell like he's been the DADA teacher for years? Because the one-professor-per-year curse wasn't a thing yet.

Why does Hagrid say there's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't from Slytherin? Because Peter Pettigrew wasn't a thing yet.

Why does Dumbledore promote use of the name Voldemort? Because Tom Riddle wasn't a thing yet.
