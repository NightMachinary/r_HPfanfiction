It is never implied, at least in PS, that saying the word "Muggle" in front of Muggles would be breaking the Statute of Secrecy. On the contrary, a wizard calls Mr Dursley a Muggle /to his face/ in the very first chapter of PS.

Which makes sense, imagine if the Harry Potter books didn't exist and you overheard someone say the station was "packed with Muggles" or you heard a little girl talking about "Platform Nine and Three-Quarters". Sure you would find it a bit odd, but you wouldn't have any idea what those words mean.
