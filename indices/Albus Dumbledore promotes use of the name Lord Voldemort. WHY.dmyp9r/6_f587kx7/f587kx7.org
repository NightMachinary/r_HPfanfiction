Pragmatism. Dumbledore wants to save as many people as possible. Dumbledore himself could get away with calling Voldemort Tom because he was a badass that could match Voldemort spell for spell even if Voldemort got pissed off about it. If he got people to start calling Voldemort Tom, and worse, it spread to the papers, Voldemort, an exceptionally powerful wizard that only lost to Harry due to Deus Ex Elder Wand, would go on more killing sprees in his rage. Basically, don't poke the bear whilst we carefully make sure that we can trap and bring down the bear.

That, and he wants people to take Voldemort seriously, but not be afraid of a word. It's a word, when the Taboo wasn't around, saying Bloody Voldemort 3 times in a mirror won't make him jump out and Avada you. "You-Know-Who" saying it out loud makes him sound like a villain known for his use of Owls, and "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" just sounds ridiculous.
