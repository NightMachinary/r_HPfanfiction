The fact that Dumbledore knew who Voldemort really was while the rest of the wizarding world didn't is actually an advantage to Dumbledore. The sea cave and the Gaunt shack were both tied to Voldemort's childhood and life as Tom Riddle, and if everyone knew he was Riddle it would increase the likelihood of someone finding some of his horcruxes. Voldemort would then have to find new, more secure places to hide his horcruxes, which would make things even harder for the good guys. By keeping people ignorant of his real name, Dumbledore created a false sense of security for Voldemort that the good guys exploited.
