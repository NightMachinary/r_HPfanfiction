I love filling in missing details in canon. I'm working on a story about how wee ickle firsties Fred and George acquired their reputation as pranksters when they first got to school.

I'm also working on one about how Remus and Tonks first met and started their relationship. It includes stuff like the details of the anti-werewolf legislation that Umbridge wrote in 1993.

Hm, I wonder why my links didn't work. Maybe editing this comment will help.
