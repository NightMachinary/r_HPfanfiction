This one is from Dumblodore's PoV. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9402070/1/Through-Older-Eyes][linkffn(9402070]]) and this is a good Remus and Sirius fic (the author has several canon compliant fics, mainly Remus/Tonks. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10268550/1/What-I-Have-Taken-Long-Before][linkffn(10268550]])

I've got one of my own about Sirius during OotP. The plot isn't much to do with canon but it does have the battle at the DoM from Sirus's PoV. I'm happy to link it if you think you might be interested but it is an OC fic and probably a bit niche.
