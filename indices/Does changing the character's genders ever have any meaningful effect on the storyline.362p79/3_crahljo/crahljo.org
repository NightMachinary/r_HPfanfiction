I can't read most fics where they're changed to the opposite gender. It's mostly for shipping and rarely brings anything new or interesting to the story.

The only good opposite gender fanfic I've read was Weasley Girl, where Ron was Veronica, first born girl of the weasley family. It got boring though.

Oh, and also this Dudley one where (s)he and Harry got together.
