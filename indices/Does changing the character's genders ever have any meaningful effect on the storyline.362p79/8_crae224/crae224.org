I haven't seen any that do. I sympathize with women wanting more/better female protagonists, and it doesn't really hurt the story in any way except sometimes being confusing. I feel the same way with the slash stories I've read. Mostly it doesn't add anything at all, except that now Harry is gay, which again doesn't usually hurt the story and can provide a protagonist that some people can relate better too.
