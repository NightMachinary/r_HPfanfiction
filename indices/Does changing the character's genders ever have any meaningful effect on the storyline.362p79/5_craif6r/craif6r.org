I can't remember the title, but I read a super AU story where women were much more socially powerful than men in the wizarding world, because it was more likely for girl witches to survive childbirth than boys and some other, more detailed reasons. The author gender bent a lot of canon males to female to create this dynamic without just cutting out a bunch of characters. It was a really fascinating read.
