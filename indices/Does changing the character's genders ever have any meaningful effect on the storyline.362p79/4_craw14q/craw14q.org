Sometimes such a story exists, though they seem to be outnumbered... But aren't "stories with plot" outnumbered anyway?

I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]], a story where there is no Ronald Weasley, but a Veronica Weasley. - this has lead to some changes in the plot line (and some changes well before the story even started...), which by now has diverged from canon quite a lot, while still having a canon feel! The dynamic between people is just ever so slightly different, to begin with...

The author has mentioned that any pairing will still have to wait for a bit and never will be the center of the story, so it's not as if it was written as an excuse plot to get any two characters together.
