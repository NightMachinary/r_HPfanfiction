i think about fem!sev a lot. i don't think she would have been sacked because of dumbledore reasons, and her connection with lucius who was on the something committee before the events of CoS and reps. for her at the ministry. but there's something really attractive to me about fem!sev, head of slytherin clashing with minerva for the house cup, potions and DADA/Dark Arts genius, spell inventor, secret agent that deceives voldemort, juxtaposed with the main protagonist and antagonist of the series. definitely a slytherin, but probably the bravest woman harry potter ever knew. best friends with lily evans, growing to love her, their fallout and her joining the ranks of DEs. renegading to try to protect her. even better if she stil uses the moniker 'half blood prince'. ahhh
