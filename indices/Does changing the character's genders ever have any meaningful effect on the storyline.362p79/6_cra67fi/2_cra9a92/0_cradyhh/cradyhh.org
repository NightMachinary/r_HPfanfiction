fem!Ron: suddenly not overshadowed by her older brothers, she's the first female Weasley- but she's not the /only/ female Weasley, since her spunky younger sister is right behind her. She's driven to prove herself- not to catch up with his older, successful brothers that he not-so-secretly worries he'll never match, but instead to outpace her younger sister, to make sure people think of her as more than just "the first" Weasley girl. She's got a 1-year head start, though, so much less of a chip on her shoulder about it. Year 2 is completely different- she doesn't ignore Ginny, because she /can't/ ignore Ginny, not when she's the benchmark she needs to stay ahead of.

male!Hermione - nerdy little boys get picked on, sure, but they don't get teased constantly for their bushy hair and buck teeth as badly as girls. He's still a social outcast, but doesn't feel the need to suck up to authorities as much (though he still spouts off answers in class) because they were never as much of a refuge against the other students. Maybe not as defiant about breaking the rules, though still brave- better-than-even odds of going Ravenclaw instead of Gryfindor, where he'd fit right in, though his spark of bravery might lead him to fall in with Harry anyway- or especially a fem!Ron. Troll scene never happens- Herman wouldn't be crying in the bathroom- so the way year 1 plays out would be different.
