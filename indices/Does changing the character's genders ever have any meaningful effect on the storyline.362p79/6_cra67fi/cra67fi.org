It's not about changing the plot. It's about making a character easier for half the population to identify with. While a woman identifying with, being inspired by, and seeing something of herself in a male protagonist is far from impossible, and vice versa, a gender difference is a barrier. This would be true if gender differences were more superficial than they currently are. And that's more than enough reason for someone to write fan fiction with gender swapped characters.

...Rowling might have hit on something when she made the plotwise protagonist male but utterly forgettable and then made the actual interesting major character female. I'm male and identify much more with Hermione than with Harry.

The vast majority of media involves white male protagonists. It's boring. That's reason enough for gender and race swapping.

You don't need huge plot shifts to make fan fiction worthwhile. It just suggests that, if you're writing a fic with gender swapped characters and want to engage an audience that is quite familiar with the original work, you want to focus on the events that are different and omit or shorten those that are largely the same.

As for plot changes based on gender changes: yes, that's quite possible. What if you gender-swapped Lily Evans and James Potter? Suddenly Jane Potter is a blood traitor who ended her family line, so she and Harry are both derided by all the purebloods around (even Augusta Longbottom, most likely; she forces Neville to stay away from Harry). Harry might end up ineligible to inherit from pureblood houses. The trust vault is intact since it was set up before Jane and Liam Evans's deaths, but the vast Potter fortunes and estates that a lot of fics talk about are /gone/, divided between the goblins and the Ministry. Maybe Malfoy taunts Harry by revealing that he lives in the old Potter estate.

Gender-swap Neville. Suddenly his lack of confidence is compounded by the additional social pressures of being female. Even odds he commits suicide by the end of first year.

Gender-swap Ginny. Now /Ron/ commits suicide by the end of third year, on account of all his friends and family do so much better than him at everything but chess, boardgames don't a career make, he can't deride his younger sister on account of her gender, and the occasional signs of wealth that Harry displays really grate on him.

Gender-swap Snape. Women don't get away with as much, ever, and in authority positions, they're more likely to be labeled as bitchy, controlling, or bossy. Severa Snape gets sacked or at least put under administrative review well before Harry gets to Hogwarts. Also, women's appearances are much more tightly policed. Severa Snape doesn't have greasy hair; she uses hair-care potions of her own devising and keeps her hair in a net while she's brewing.

Gender-swap Dudley. Delia Dursley gets a lot more shit for her weight than Dudley ever did. She lashes out, sometimes, but mostly she turns her stress in on herself. She develops an eating disorder and starts self-harm and overall has very few friends. Since Harry is present, can't run away, and is non-threatening, she eventually opens up to him, a little, and they form an awkward friendship. But when Harry goes off to school, Delia has zero friends left. Eventually she runs away and makes her way to Hogsmeade, relying on the bit of wizard blood she got from being in the same family as Lily Evans. She discovers that there's far less fat-phobia in the wizarding world, where a potion can change your appearance forever and you look exactly how you want, and ends up working as a cashier at an apothecary.

Gender-swap Harry Potter. Uh...well, canon Harry is kind of a blank slate. A more generic version of Ron Weasley, overall, with a /bit/ of competence in a couple subjects and a bit less character. Gender-swap him and you get pretty much no change -- there's not much character to begin with, and what character there is has almost no effect on the story. Harry's just a plot monkey. Oh, there would be a couple things -- someone who grew up as a girl in the muggle world isn't nearly as likely to confront Malfoy over Neville's Remembrall, for instance, so no Quidditch in first year. (Neither is someone who grew up in an abusive home, for that matter. Harry Potter in canon, though, wasn't abused at all. He grew up in a moderately loving home. His personality rather screams it -- moderate introversion but otherwise intact.) But those are minor things. And for the most part, the books are plot-driven, not character-driven. So, yeah, not much change.

If you have an ounce of creativity and spend five minutes thinking, gender swapping a character can have tons of impact on a story. Unless you've a misapprehension that men and women have only superficial differences in how they're treated by society.
