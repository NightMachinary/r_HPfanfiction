It can, depending on the reasons for the change in gender. Most gender swap stories are focused on the different social dynamics (who likes/hates/lusts for who) and the writer isn't interested in how the difference might change the overall plotline of hero quest/coming of age, except to disable all the difficult parts that would normally cause a character to grow more mature.

The rarer stories rework the plotline and theme to reflect the change- a coming-of-age story is different for a girl than a boy, and actually addressing the issues of identity (while tedious to the action-minded) can make for stirring empathy/catharsis. Then the story isn't about confronting the responsibility for defeating a bad guy, so really the canon storyline is there just for timing purposes.

It /can/ change a whole lot of things, but few writers really go through the effort of exploring the logical effects and how it could make things worse/more complicated rather than better/easier/sexier.
