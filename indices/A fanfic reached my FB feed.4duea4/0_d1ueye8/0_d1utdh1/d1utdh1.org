Hey [[/r/HPfanfiction]] mods, per the other commenter, my comment doesn't seem to be showing up and I'm not sure why since I didn't get message. Also, this account is new mostly because I wanted a username specifically used for fanfiction/writing.

Edit: Well that was weird. Thanks if any mods handled it! Looks like my comments are showing up now.
