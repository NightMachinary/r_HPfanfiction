I dont remember the name but there's one during GOF where Fleur goes after Harry because she wants fame and his presumed fortune. So she's going to have him knock her up. He's not immune so she thinks it's going to be easy, until its revealed that thanks to her allure, the Horcrux comes out as the primary influence, and it is into hardcore BDSM as a sadist.

Fleur ends up fleeing England after one night.
