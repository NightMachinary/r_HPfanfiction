The common justification is that the relationship wouldn't really /work/, at least not long-term, without Harry having at least some modicum of resistance, since Fleur is implied to look down on boys who get charmed by her Veela side.

He also eventually shrugs off the Imperius curse in-canon. Most fics that don't have him be 100% resistant, will lean on that angle to let him /eventually/ push through it - and we go right back to the first situation where she's interested because he's pushing through her mind-control.

There is at least one Harry/Gabrielle where he's not immune - Harry Potter and the Power He Knows Not ( linkffn(13160344) ) has him not-quite-immune but somewhat resistant (he visibly struggles against the Veela at the World Cup), and it makes the allure a semi-conscious thing that Veela can suppress or project to varying degrees. It's not a Harry/Fleur, but since Gabrielle is aged up to 16 it might scratch the same itch.
