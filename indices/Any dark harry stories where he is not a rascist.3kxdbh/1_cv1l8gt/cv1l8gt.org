linkffn(5904185) Emperor by Marquis Black

This story might match your request, *But* it depends on what you mean by /dark/. Does dark mean /Harry practices dark magic/ or does it mean /Harry is amoral, bad, ruthless and powerhungry/. /Emporer/ is the latter. Yes he probably uses some dark magic in the story (fiendfyre?) but "dark" magic is not a central plot point. Harry is not racist, not that it makes him more of a nice person.
