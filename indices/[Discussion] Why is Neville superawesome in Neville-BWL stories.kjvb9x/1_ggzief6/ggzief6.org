Hmmm I'd think because if he is the BWL he'd be raised differently. In general it'd be assumed that he did the magic that got rid of Voldemort. Which would mean less pressure from family in terms of magic I'd think. (They wouldn't throw him out a window because he's already shown magic.)

With his family not putting him down/pressuring him over that I think he'd be more confident/self assured earlier. As has also been mentioned he's likely to get a new wand rather than his fathers which would help with his spellcasting.

I'd imagine Snape wouldn't hate Neville as much considering that'd mean Lily is still alive so he might not be as aggressive towards him letting him perform better there too as we've seen some of Neville's poor performance is nerves/Snape.
