linkffn(12104688) has the real Mad Eye Moody (I'm still reading but I'm 99% sure at this point, if there is a major plot twist I will update) and I believe he's also going to train Harry but I'm not there yet.

EDIT: I can now confirm that Moody is actually moody in this fic. So far there is quite a bit of interaction but no training.
