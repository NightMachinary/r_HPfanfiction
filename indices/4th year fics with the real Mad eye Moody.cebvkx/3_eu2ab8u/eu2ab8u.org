[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): The good thing is that Barty Jr is not stupid enough to impersonate Moody here, but the bad thing is that the outcome is still the same as in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10991501/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Serpent-s-Renaissance][Hermione Granger and the Serpent's Renaissance]], linkffn(10991501): Year 4 is still ongoing, but I do believe that this Moody is real, although the author keeps everyone guessing here.
