I have to go with 'it's just the visible sign of a deeper link'.

​

Otherwise, what's to stop the Death Eaters' enemies from copying the Dark Mark to infiltrate them or just to screw with them?

​

For me, amputation of Death Eaters' left forearms is best left to their enemies, when they don't want to have to deal with a potential Dynamic Entry by Voldemort or other reinforcements if the Death Eater manages to activate his Mark.
