I do think it would successfully free the Death Eater from the Mark. In fact, I used this exact plot point in my story at one point (though the reason was much different from just "repentant Death Eater doesn't want to be a Death Eater anymore"). I imagine however that Voldemort would maintain a link to the severed arm, and be able to control it to strangle the turncoat Death Eater, kind of like Pettigrew's silver hand.
