Well, I feel like controlling the Death Eaters' bodies while they're alive, and controlling the severed arms, would be completely different things. The former would have to be some kind of remote Imperius Curse, which /does/ sound like a pretty hard thing to do; but the other one would be more akin to Inferi and Necromancy in general.
