I've seen it in a few stories as well, and I find it a believable solution. Sure, one could have it be a sort of soul magic that cannot be eliminated with the removal of one's arm, but I see nothing that requires it be so absolute.\\
And part of me really likes the idea of Voldemort retaining power of the severed arm, though that seems less believable to me, since he couldn't control his followers' bodies (only make them hurt), whereas Pettigrew's hand is his own creation. I still like the idea though.
