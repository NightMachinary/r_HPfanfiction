I know this might be a bit off topic for the main discussion. But I can imagine in a "Ministry prepares detection of Dark Mark's" fic where one DE goes in really early and gets nabbed. Then the rest goes "They're looking for the marks." and amputates them. And they all get a metal arm of some sort and no, you can't ask why. That's rude.

The magic stays, and Voldemort's call is like a really strong phantom pain. Though, that's sort of like how I view it already.
