There is a fanfic somewhere where Snape walks around with his sleeve pinned up because his arm was amputated. He doesn't wear a prosthetic because he wants to unsettle people and has no use for it. Draco Malloy had to cut it off with an axe when Voldemort tried to kill Snape through the mark. Wish I confined that story. (It was not the main part of the plot, but it was interesting.)
