I guess it all depends on how easily you want the Death Eater in question to escape Voldemort's rule. If the story is focused on other things, having a struggle to free themselves from the Dark Mark could take away from the narrative. Like if you're writing a Dramione heist story set in Switzerland or something, you could just refer to Draco having cut his Dark Mark out, or have him have to deal with having one arm only, as to be able to focus better on the story you want to tell.

Though I'm never against making Voldemort and his fellow antagonists more fearsome, so if it fits, I'd definitely go for making things difficult! In my eyes, one shouldn't be able to escape being a Death Eater that easily.
