If amputating would work, why not just get a surgeon and a scalpel to peel the top layers of skin containing the Dark Mark tattoo off the arm? Hurts like hell, but saves the arm. And you can regrow the skin, assuming that it's not tainted by dark magic enough that you can heal it with a spell.

Obviously, we don't know enough for sure, and it could be anything from a variation of a Protean Charm, to some kind of soul magic where a Death Eater had to make a magical oath before he would be marked. If that's the case, the intent of the magic matters, so physical removal won't change anything.

Though I have seen fanfic authors do it. Even going as far as Harry having his scar surgically removed by muggle surgeons to take the horcrux out. It seems farfetched to me. But I do admit it would make a funny crackfic for a Death Eater to leave the ranks by getting their Dark Mark lasered off at a high street tattoo clinic.
