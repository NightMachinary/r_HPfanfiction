What if Herpo bred the Basilisk in an attempt to try and figure out how to make his horcrux immune to it? Like some sort of spell-crafting in hopes of eventually perfecting his stake to immortality, since Basilisk venom isn't the only venom deadly enough to destroy a horcrux.

Maybe at one point he'd hear a rumor about how goblin-made weapons are impervious to it, and tries to steal this goblin secret to the detriment of the wizarding world's relationship with the goblin race?
