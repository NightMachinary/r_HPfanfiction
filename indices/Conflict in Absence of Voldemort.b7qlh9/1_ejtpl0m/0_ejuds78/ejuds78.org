Draft 1 had dementors as a more physical being acting more like an FMA:B Homunculus mixed with an Inferius and a Horcrux. It would act as a sentient but obedient container for the soul shard, but also seek out and consume other souls to fuel it's own immortality.

After more reading about what is known and what other fanfics have done with dementors, I think a more poltergeist resistance is most appropriate as well.
