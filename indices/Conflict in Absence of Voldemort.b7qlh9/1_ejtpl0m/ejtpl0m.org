I like this theory quite a bit, though I kinda prefer Dementors to occur just as naturally as Poltergeists, or perhaps even be an evolutionary offshoot of Wizardkind rather than fully unnatural spirits. (I also hold the headcanon that Herpo was not only the inventors of Horcruxes, but also the man who discovered that regret can unmake them, and therefore that he redeemed himself in the end and moved on. But that doesn't mean I couldn't lay aside that belief for the sake of a great AU such as that which you are proposing.)

Also, not to poke a big gaping hole in what I assure you is a theory I quite like, but... "bind one's soul to a Dementor" is kind of like granting custody of your pet canary to your pet cat. It doesn't sound very clever, is what I'm saying, to entrust your soul to the only beings in the universe known (or at least theorized) to have the ability to destroy souls. A better motive for your Herpo to create them might be that, like Basilisk Venom, they are a failsafe against a rival who'd try to use Horcruxes --- since a Dementor can presumably still suck out the soul of someone with a Horcrux, it just wouldn't make a very satisfying meal, so to speak.

Either way, the question remains of why, in the canon timeline, Herpo would have tolerated Lord Voldemort, and, indeed, even allowed some of his Dementors to swear allegiance to /him/.

  Creating a basilisk gives you and your descendants the ability to speak to snakes, or only a parslemouth can create one to begin with.

I've seen a very well-thought-out variation on the second option, where Basilisks are the reason Parselmouths are so feared. Because /anyone/ can hatch a Basilisk, but unless the breeder can order the hatchling to close their eyes immediately and then tell it not to bite you, then they are /done for/. Hence Parselmouths are the only ones with access to the magical equivalent of a nuclear weapon --- not in the sense that they're the only ones who can make one, but in the sense that they're the only ones who'd survive the blast. All a Parselmouth needs to bring the Wizarding World to its knees is ambition, a toad and a chicken egg. /That's/ what everyone is scared of.
