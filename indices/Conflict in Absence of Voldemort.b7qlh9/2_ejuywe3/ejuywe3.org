Well, you seem pretty keen on this Herpo the Foul idea, but just as a more general point, it should be remembered that you don't necessarily need a big bad uber powerful dark wizard for conflict. The first four books had plenty of conflict without a resurrected Voldemort. Aside from that, there are plenty of genres you can write that have different kinds of conflict: e.g. the boarding school genre, where the conflict focuses on a school rivalry, or the crime/murder mystery genre, where the conflict is based around solving the mystery rather than defeating someone powerful.
