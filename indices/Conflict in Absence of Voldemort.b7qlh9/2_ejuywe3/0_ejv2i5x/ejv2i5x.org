  The first four books had plenty of conflict without a resurrected Voldemort.

Who said "resurrected"? It doesn't matter if he's resurrected or not, Voldemort is still essential to the conflict of three out of those four, and his existence is still key to character's actions in the one dubious exception, /PoA/.

Your point that one can perfectly have a good story without a central Big Bad is of course well-taken, but I don't think any of the canon books ever did that.
