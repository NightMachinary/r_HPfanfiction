Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief) has Harry as auror and Hermione secretly as professional catburglar, it's a small miracle that their relationship doesn't collapse as their previous relationships did once he figures out what her real profession is. There's also multiple scenes where they fight each other in a burning mansion, in the sky over London and various other situations.
