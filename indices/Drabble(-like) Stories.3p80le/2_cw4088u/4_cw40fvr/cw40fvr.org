  “Must be one of those weird Eastern European languages,” the Muggle nurse says to their coworker as they write the time and date -- the last few minutes of July 31st, 1980.“Mmm,” the other nurse replies. “Lucky little bugger, though. It's probably not going to be every day that somebody runs up to you and says 'Avada Kedavra'. Whatever that means.” {A Harry Potter soulmarks universe one-shot; could become a series based on requests and interest.} So this idea showed up in my head and I couldn't not. I'm taking requests for other HP character POVs and one-shots, as long as they're actual speaking characters (or Marauders Era).Mentioned exchanges: Draco and Harry:(in Madam Malkin's)"Hullo," said the boy, "Hogwarts too?""Yes," said Harry.(on the Hogwarts Express)"Is it true?" he said. "They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?""Yes," said Harry.Ron and Harry:"Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out.Harry nodded."Oh - well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes," said Ron.

Ron stared."So that's where You-Know-Who-?""Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remember it."

Hermione and Harry:" [...] I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?"She said all this very fast.Harry looked at Ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learnt all the set books off by heart either."I'm Ron Weasley," Ron muttered."Harry Potter," said Harry.
