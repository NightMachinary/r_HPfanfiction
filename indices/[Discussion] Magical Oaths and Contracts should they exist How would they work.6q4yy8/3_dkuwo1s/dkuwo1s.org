I prefer magical contracts like the DA list: Break the agreement, and suffer the curse placed on it. Or pay a Curse-Breaker to deal with it before you break it - though that'll usually cost more thn breaking the contract will save you.

I prefer to ignore the Unbreakable Vow, yes, it's often taken too lightly in fanon, but if your life is on the line if you can't prove your innocence, then who wouldn't take a vow to speak the truth for 5 minutes or so? And that's not even touching the question why a Dark Lord wouldn't require a vow frm all his followers. Or the Ministry wouldn't require a vow in special circumstances. And so on. The unbreakable vow is a plot-wrecker and doesn't even add anything to canon.
