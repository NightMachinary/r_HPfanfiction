In my construction the person making the vow doesn't have to trust the person they're making the vow to in every way. They merely have to absolutely believe they will uphold the vow - which Snape certainly does. He fully intends to help Draco fulfill his task and kill Dumbledore. Narcissa believes he'll be true to his word, and Snape believes he'll keep his promise. Thus, they can make an Unbreakable Vow.

Not only is this a canon-compliant way to fill in a plot hole, it also is thematically consistent. Trust, love, and intent are all components of powerful magic in Harry Potter.
