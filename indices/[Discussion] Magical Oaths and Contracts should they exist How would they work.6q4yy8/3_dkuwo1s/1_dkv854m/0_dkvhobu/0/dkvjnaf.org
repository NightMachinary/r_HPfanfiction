A vow is an affirmation of trust. You make promises to friends even if you trust them. The Unbreakable Vow would be just that - the ultimate unbreakable bond of trust, being willing to die rather than break your word.

If you reread the scene in HBP, Narcissa never once mistrusts Severus. Just the opposite, she goes to beg his help specifically /because/ he's the only one she can trust to protect Draco. She even says why; Snape has always protected Draco at school, is an old friend of Lucius', and is the Dark Lord's most trusted servant. He's not just anybody to her.

She comes to him believing he is one of the few she can trust:

  “Now . . . you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?” Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair. “Yes, Severus. I --- I think you are the only one who can help me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and . . .”
#+end_quote

She's willing to reveal the Dark Lord's plan for Draco to him despite being forbidden not to speak of it, and is relieved to learn he is so trusted that he already knows it:

#+begin_quote
  “It so happens that I know of the plan,” he said in a low voice. “I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord.” “I thought you must know about it!” said Narcissa, breathing more freely. “He trusts you so, Severus. . . .”
#+end_quote

And she lays out her belief that she trusts Snape can help quite explicitly:

#+begin_quote
  . . . . Severus . . . please . . . You are, you have always been, Draco's favorite teacher. . . . You are Lucius's old friend. . . . I beg you. . . . You are the Dark Lord's favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . . Will you speak to him, persuade him --- ?”
#+end_quote

And finally, her request that the vow be made is absolutely not one born out of mistrust. Just the opposite, it is a bond of trust between herself and Snape:

#+begin_quote
  “Severus --- oh, Severus --- you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?” “I can try.” She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape's feet, seized his hand in both of hers, and pressed her lips to it. “If you are there to protect him . . . Severus, will you swear it? Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?”
#+end_quote

Her trust is born of out desperation, perhaps, but she absolutely trusts Snape to help Draco. So they make an Unbreakable bond of mutual trust.

There are other interpretations sure, but mine is an entirely acceptable canon-based one which helps make Unbreakable Vows more workable.
