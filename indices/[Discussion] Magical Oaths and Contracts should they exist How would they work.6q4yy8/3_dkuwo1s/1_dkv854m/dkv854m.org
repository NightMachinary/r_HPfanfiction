My personal theory is that the vow requires /absolute/ trust between the two parties for it to work. The person the vow is being made to must absolutely believe that person making the vow will keep their word, and the person making the vow must absolutely believe they will keep their word.

So in a courtroom setting this wouldn't really work because no one could be absolutely certain that the person on trial would actually tell the truth and someone on trial couldn't be certain of their own 100% honesty, making an unbreakable vow difficult if not impossible. And Voldemort likely has never trusted anyone in his life, so that counts him out. The vow only works when made between people who trust each other closely, and is more a symbol of that trust than anything else.
