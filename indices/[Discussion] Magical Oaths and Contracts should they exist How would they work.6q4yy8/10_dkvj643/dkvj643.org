I don't have a problem with those working - as long as you have to enter them willingly (so nope: Using the Imperius-Curse doesn't work, neither do drugs/potions/alcohol (so no signing a binding magical contract while stoned/shitfaced or drugged up!) and neither do things like the Goblet of Fire (using someone's signature from somewhere to enter somebody into such a contract simply can't be done!) or long term enslavement magic (the Imperius isn't a long term spell IMHO, unless the target is weak willed and already kind of wants to do the things you force it to do!) unless you willingly entered (so you put your own name into the goblet, then yes: It can bind you!)) and they only work if you have all the information (if the other party lied or cheated, then the oath/contract simply is un-enforceable!)
