Thanks for letting me know about the whole occlumency vs veritaserum thing - I didn't realise that was Word of God (thought it was part of popular fanon). I see your point about the severity of the punishment making the vow effective, but "Do Or Die" approaches are uncommon in most agreements and vows normally, so I thought there might be lesser alternatives.

Someone else pointed out that the Goblet is ancient and the heavy-handedness would make more sense in the historical context, so I'm warming up to that idea.

Sorry for the assumption about the "hows" and "whys" of Magic - my personal headcanon is that it follows rules but that they make sense thematically, narratively and emotionally rather than strictly logically; so that base assumption was underlying my OP. "They work by Magic, because of Magic" is perfectly valid too :)
