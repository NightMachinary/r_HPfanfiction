Rowling said there were many ways to get past Veritaserum, even Occlumency could do it. The Imperious can be broken with enough strength of will as well.

That's the point of Magic, there's a lot of pointless things that happen but make it ultimately more wonderful. Such as there being a whole book for a singular Summoning Charm or Several Spells that do the exact same thing in existence. What about the fact that Wizards force themselves through a hole in Space and Time to teleport when they could just create portals? A lot of it might be pointless but like the world, Magic is constantly evolving and so will the Wizards that use it.

  losing one's magic seems incredibly heavy handed

All the more reason to tell the truth. While in GOF the 'Magically Binding Contract' wasn't further explored, I imagine that it is like an Unbreakable Vow.

So yes, they do. Yes, they should because, why not? It requires consent to activate anyways. They work by Magic, because of Magic, no need for further explanation even if there was one.
