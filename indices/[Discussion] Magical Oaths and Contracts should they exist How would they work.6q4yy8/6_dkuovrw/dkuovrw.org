Your typical (historical and otherwise) contract of sorts that I think might be in the potterverse would be the geass. It's from Gaelic (Irish and sometimes Scottish) folklore. Usually a contract binding someone from doing something, or forcing them to do something in a specific way. The contract was unbreakable, and usually someone would find a way to make a hero break the geass so that they died, usually by catching them between a rock and a hard spot with their honor.
