I have no problem with them existing, but I have a problem with how quick fanfic characters are to throw around vows under pain of death just to show how deadly serious he is and how correct he is in a situation. It's pretty shitty storytelling.

I like the idea of the Unbreakable Vow being on its own tier of magic. I've posted this idea before, but there are concepts that seem to bring about an innate power. There's a certain power in giving your word and not breaking it, just as there is a certain power in putting your trust in someone elses hands (such as the Fidelius)
