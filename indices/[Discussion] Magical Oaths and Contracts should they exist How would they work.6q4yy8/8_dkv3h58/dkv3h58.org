I don't mind magical oaths and contracts sworn or signed between multiple parties where one person or object's magic binds another (like what we see in canon) so long as they are used appropriately.

What I despise, however, is the self-binding "raises wand and swears on his magic such and such" vow. It breaks all sorts of things with regards to character interaction and plot holes. And on top of that, I just can't fathom how that would even work. How do you bind your own magic with itself? I imagine it would be like trying to tie a knot with taffy, or trying to lick your own elbow, or pull yourself up by your shoelaces. It would just mold back into itself and you're back at square one or it just 'wouldn't bend that way'.
