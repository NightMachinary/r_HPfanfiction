There's so many creative curses you can come up with as a punishment for breaking a contract, it always annoys me when the punishment is death or loss of magic. Why not have curses that:

-leave you unable to speak so you can't speak more lies -give you bad luck -make you infertile - disfigure your face like Hermione did -cripple your hands so you can't sign more contracts
