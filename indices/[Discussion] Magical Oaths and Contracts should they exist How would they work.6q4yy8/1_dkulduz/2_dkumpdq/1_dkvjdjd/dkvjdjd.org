That's a great idea (some sort of reminder in the magic if you are about to violate an oath/vow or contract or the information slipping your mind if someone tries to read it via legilimency (kind of the magic of the contract protecting the person in question from violating it if they don't actively want to - even against mind-reading etc. - so that no slip of the tongue can sentence you to some nasty consequence (losing your magic is the most used!))
