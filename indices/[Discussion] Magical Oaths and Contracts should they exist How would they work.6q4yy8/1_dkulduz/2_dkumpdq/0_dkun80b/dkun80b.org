Curses like the imperius are difficult to cast; I think having a contract force someone to do something would be difficult. Perhaps it's only a specific kind of super serious contract set up by some super special person that actually forces someone to do something. Perhaps lesser contracts can inspire people to do things without making it so they have no choice but to do whatever the contract says. Like compulsion charms, confundus, and anti-muggle wards that don't make someone do something outright, but rather inspire strong feelings in them that encourage them to do whatever it is they're supposed to do.

But instead of compelling someone to do something, why can't a contract have different consequences? Say a marriage contract that if broken curses the breaking party with sterility. Or a marriage contract between enemies for political purposes that states if one party physically hurts the other, they'll have that same pain visited upon them. A business contract that when breached awards the innocent party with certain assets of the breaker.
