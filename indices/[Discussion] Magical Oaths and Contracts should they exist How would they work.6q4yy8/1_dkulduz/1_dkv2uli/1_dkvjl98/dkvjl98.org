Not really, this artifact isn't powerful (not really!) - if every cheap-ass deatheater can hoodwink it, then it's not powerful at all :(

So IMHO the "you have to compete" isn't because Harry truly has to compete (he could sit the Tournament out without any consequences - at least until after the first task, because that shows that he accepts being a competitor which also means he accepts all the rules and what not governing the Tournament! Entering people into contracts without them having a choice IMHO is a bad plot-device (why not make a freaking artifact that forces Voldemort to go to Azkaban if he doesn't want to lose his magic? Sorry, but the Goblet kind of is the ultimate weapon if it can do that to unwilling people! You could control the entire population with it...just enter all their names and force them to do exactly what the ministry says...if not? Instant squip...this way the purebloods would rule of the muggleborns with an iron fist and they would be slaves! So nope, this wasn't well thought out on Rowling's side!)), IMHO it's Dumbledore's wish that he competes (same for the Ministry!)
