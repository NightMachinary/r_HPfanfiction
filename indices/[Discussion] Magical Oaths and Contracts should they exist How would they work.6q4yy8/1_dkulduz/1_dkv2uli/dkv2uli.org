See, I agree with your main point that "at risk of your magic" is used far too frequently in magical contracts or oaths as a rule in HP fanfiction, but I'm actually ok with it as a punishment for violating the rules of the Triwizard Tournament. The Goblet of Fire is clearly a very powerful device that would have the ability to enforce such a clause and it follows that their would be major consequences for failing to fulfill one's duties as a champion. Bear in mind that the Tournament has been around almost a full millennia, and while we (and modern wizards) might consider it barbaric to put that much at stake to ensure participation, it isn't hard to believe that wasn't the case in prior centuries. Furthermore, it gives weight to the "you have to compete" logic in GoF, where the "why" was left unexplained.
