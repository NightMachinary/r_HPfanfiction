I understand what you're saying and if it were explained as such in fics I wouldn't mind it as much either. However, it tends to get thrown about so casually in some GoF fics that it makes me think of the author as less capable of writing a well thought out story.

As for why Harry had to compete being unexplained in canon, before reading fanon it seemed to me as if it were only because Crouch Sr. was under the imperius and Dumbledore wanted to see what happened to try to get the other side to tip their hand. So I don't need the extra explanation to satisfy my headcanon, but I see the appeal to you.
