Contracts and oaths make sense as we have them in the real world. But in fanon so many involve losing your magic, and I just can't see that as realistic. To many wizards (mostly purebloods, but I can see some muggleborns not wanting to go back to a pre-magic existence either), losing your magic would be worse than death. They'd much rather be dead than suffer the indignity of being a squib. I believe that's why the Unbreakable Vow kills you instead of taking your magic. So personally, yes on contracts and oaths, no on always losing your magic (especially in the Triwizard Tournament). Be creative people and come up with alternate consequences and curses.
