1. I was asking opinions on fanon additions to the canon and how they work together/if they work together; I was asking if fanon oaths and contracts should exist, not the existence of the Unbreakable Vow.

2. I was asking how fanon Wizard Oaths are relevant when they are existing canon constructs which fulfil similar roles.

3. Again, you are referring to canon as well as fanon. When did I say I wanted the world to be bland? My thinking process is as follows:

   - Fanon creates useful spell/artefact/whatever (i.e. Wizard Oaths)
   - How does it work?
   - What is its place in the world? Is it useful?
   - If it is useful, why isn't it used in every case? Is there a cost?

As in, you have a way in which to check the truth. Yet in both canon and fanon, people still lie. How? In canon Veritaserum is a controlled substance and difficult to brew, and the Imperious is illegal. In fanon, oaths are bandied about willy-nilly when plot relevant and otherwise cease to exist (in the majority of fanworks). The base idea is good, but as they stand they simply /do not make sense in the setting/. Hence, discussion.
