Canon includes too many instances of magically-enforced vows to toss out the idea entirely. I think there are different sorts of magically-relevant vows, depending on the criticality of the trust required.

I've used them in my stories but they're one of several functional changes I'd make if I were to do rewrites. One thing I always included, though, was the idea that a vow has to be between two different people. If someone vows, another has to accept it for it to have any meaning- such a thing is essentially a verbal contract, and the weight of it has to even out somehow. You can't promise someone to never lie to them if there's no way to judge how dangerous the truth-telling would get.

What I find intriguing about the Unbreakable Vow is that there's a third party involved- Snape has been accused of being untrustworthy, so enters a contract to fulfill some specfic obligations within the next year... as evaluated by Bellatrix. While it isn't explained thus, it suggests that Snape's compliance with the vow is going to be by her judgement rather than his own or Narcissa's.
