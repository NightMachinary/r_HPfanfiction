Unfortunately, due to how vows work in most fanon stories, this is exactly what people should be doing if they wanted to act rationally and get people's trust. However, the rest of the society clearly shows that this is not how their world works. Therefore, we need to look at rules that make more sense in the setting. The rules should not give an easy way out of situations (e.g. /"I swear on my magic that I tell the truth"/) but can create interesting situations (/"I swear to kill Albus Dumbledore"/).

My oaths are subjective. There is no all-knowing force judging whether people keep their contracts. Whether an oath is broken is determined by the unconscious mind of the involved people. This is important because this stops many exploits. When you swear to speak the truth, you can still lie if you are convincingly.

A contracts works similar to a list of oaths. Unlike oaths, they become active when all parties have signed the document. In addition, breaking one oath typically voids the rest of the contract. This is typically used in high-class business transactions and requesting a magical-binding contract may increase the price a lot.
