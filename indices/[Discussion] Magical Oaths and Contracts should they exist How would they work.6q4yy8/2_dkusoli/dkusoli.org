I don't object to any fanon magical invention, provided it is sufficiently well explained and integrated into the story's world. That said, I think there are several issues at hand with such oaths and magical contracts:

1) We must distinguish between contracts and promises to undertake or to refrain from some future action, on the one hand, and magical 'truth detectors' on the other. As far as the latter are concerned, we know that canonically the Imperius can be resisted by someone with a powerful enough will, and legilimency can be blocked by occlumency. I believe JKR has stated that good enough occlumency can stop veritaserum as well (which would imply that the potion prevents you from knowingly thinking one thing and saying another); even if that is not canon, I can still think of ways around it. For instance, suppose you obliviate yourself (or have someone do it for you), or that you temporarily remove a memory from your head (as Snape did in OOTP whilst teaching occlumency), or somehow convince yourself to entirely believe your lie. In general, I think if wizards really had a 100% insurmountable anti-lying device, it would have to either have a really serious cost to its use (such as the unbreakable vow, below), or else we would see it used for anything moderately important.

2) It is not made entirely clear how exactly the unbreakable vow acts upon its subject---does it exert a compulsion, or merely come in to force when the task is failed? Does it warn the subject when he is about to violate his promise? More importantly, how does it assign responsibility? Take the HPB example: Snape swore to keep Draco safe and help him complete his mission. Suppose Draco were killed somewhere beyond Snape's reach or knowledge, say he gets hit with an AK by a dark!Harry outside Borgin & Burke's at the start of the year, or better yet within the Room of Requirement. Does the vow then kill Snape too? How can it objectively judge if he had done everything in his power (because nobody is infinitely powerful or omniscient) to fulfil his promise? Does it rely instead on one's self-assessment of the same---in which case it can be deceived as above if you can convince yourself that you've done everything you can?

3) Now with Wizards' Oaths (or whatever you call them) as an affirmation of truth, as they are often used in fanon, we run into all of the above problems. Firstly, how exactly does it determine truth (or, rather, determine that you are not lying) and how can one be sure it works all of the time? Because for it to be used as it's used in such stories, there /cannot/ be a way around it, else it would carry no weight greater than your word. Moreover, what exactly are you promising? That you /won't/ lie about this specific thing to these specific people? In that case you run into the problem of magical compulsion in (2). That you /haven't/ lied about what you have just said? Then we're back to the problems of making magical truth machines foolproof, as seen in (1).

4) I do agree with what many in this thread have suggested, viz. that to a wizard, forsaking his magic is almost a fate worse than death. In which case, taking an oath on your magic is more or less equal to an unbreakable vow---so if you feel so determined, why not do that?

5) If there exist lesser oaths (i.e. ones which risk something less than your life or magic) then they are next to useless, for they suggest that you are hiding something after all, and we're back to the reliability of your word as a guiding principle.

Finally, as an indispensable element of free will, the ability to lie is an essential part of human nature, I think. The only way we've found around this 'prisoner's dilemma' is to play the game again, and again, and again. Build trust and reputation: the more you tell the truth, the greater the expectation you will do so in the future. I don't think the authors who write stories in which your truthfulness can be determined with a simple flash of the wand truly understand the full repercussions of that on people's relationships. It's one of those things which sound great in theory, but would make life as we know it unimaginable. Suppose you are possessed with jealousy, like Shakespeare's Othello---why wouldn't you force your Desdemona to swear a magical oath eventually? And when you did that, what they would happen to your marriage? Your friendships? In short, why would you ever want to trust anyone /if you didn't have to/?
