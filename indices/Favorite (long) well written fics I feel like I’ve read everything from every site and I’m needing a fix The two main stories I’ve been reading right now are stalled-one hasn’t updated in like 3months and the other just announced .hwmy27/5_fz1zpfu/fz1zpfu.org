Ah, a slow day? I hate those days when nothing updates and you are just in the mood to enjoy something. Fear not for I, The Phantom Keeper, Qazs, will present you with some very long enjoyable stories. I hope you like crossovers.

*FILFY teacher* - linkffn(12772385) - Highschool DxD Crossover: A super well thought out story has plenty of solid moments of family, action, and drama.

*Pack* - linkffn(13391615) - Jurassic Park Crossover: A surprisingly interesting one. Again lots of wizarding world bashing.

*Raptor* - linkffn(11689576) - Jurassic Park Crossover: This one is really good, less bashing in general but a bit of bashing of Hermione at first.

*When Harry met Wednesday* - linkffn(11674317) - Addams Family Crossover: There are quite a few of these surprisingly and they all are pretty good.

*Harry Potter, Squatter* - linkffn(13274956) - Percy Jackson Crossover: An amazing story about Harry explore the world of legends and myths all while finding a family.

*Heroes Assemble!* - linkffn(12307781) - Marvel Crossover: Probably one of the best stories I know. Everything ties into another really well and their is genuine chemistry between characters. Its an enjoyable read for sure.

*Amicus Protectio Fortis* - linkffn(11547735) - An interesting story about how the DA gets started in the first year and how it grows.

*Quoth the Raven, Nevermore* - linkffn(6652537) - An older fic that I think is still really good and certainly brought a unique take to Harry Potter and its world.
