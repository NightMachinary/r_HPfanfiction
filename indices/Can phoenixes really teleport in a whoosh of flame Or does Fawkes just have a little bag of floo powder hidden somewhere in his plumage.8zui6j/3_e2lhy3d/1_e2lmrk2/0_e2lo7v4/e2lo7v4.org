Well, modern Floo Powder clearly doesn't work /quite/ like Phoenix Flaming: it connects to the Floo Network and will only land you in a chimney, not anywhere you can imagine. Presumably, within the boundaries of this theory, the "inventor" was the one who refined natural Phoenix powder into modern, easy-to-use, regulated Floo Powder --- kind of like petrol vs. usable car fuel.
