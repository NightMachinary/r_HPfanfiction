How about where Harry was actually born a true Genius, but having a Horcrux stuck in his head severely crippled and limited him and now that his mind is finally free of the parasite his true potential is unleashed.

And I mean extremely intelligent. /Frighteningly/ intelligent. Like Sherlock Holmes/Sheldon Cooper style. Able to remember everything, see connections between disparate tidbits of information, able to plan and predict every action, reaction and outcome several steps ahead of everyone else. Able to process complex problems (be they logical, mathematical, behavioural, whatever) with ease, be able to visualise information, perfect recall of anything he has ever read or seen, ...

I think there is an interesting story here with how he would cope, how others would react, suddenly realising how limited he used to be and what to do with his future. Where on one hand is simple, cosy and predictable life with Ginny or on the other hand pursue his true potential and rise above all others, put his newfound genius to use for greater good?
