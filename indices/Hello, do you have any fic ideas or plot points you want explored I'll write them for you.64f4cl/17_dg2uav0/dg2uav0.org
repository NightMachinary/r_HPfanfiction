I wouldn't mind seeing some exploration of unicorn blood. We are told that those who drink unicorn blood are cursed, but we never actually know what the curse is. I would like it(possibly as a sidenote to a fic) that the curse makes your physical form change to match your soul. Hence Quirrel, had Voldemort sticking out the back of his head, as a parasite, and Voldemort himself was a scaley snaky monster, which exactly resembled the Scar Horcrux, albeit much stronger and more developed.
