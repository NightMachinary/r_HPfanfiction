I wouldn't say you look like your soul so much as you become it. All the people who would kill and eat unicorns would be pretty morally bankrupt anyway, so they become hideously disfigured. Imagine if someone had a literally rotten soul. That dude would just walk around with his body constantly decaying, necrosis everywhere, but unicorn blood doesn't let you die of natural causes while you keep drinking it. It also makes more sense for the end of first year. The blood protection lashed out against Voldemort's soul given physical contact. Quirrel got in the middle, and a large amount of soul magic got directed into him. Harry isn't able to randomly incinerate people possessed by Voldemort, its that Quirrel was reflecting the state of his soul while it was being damaged by Harry.
