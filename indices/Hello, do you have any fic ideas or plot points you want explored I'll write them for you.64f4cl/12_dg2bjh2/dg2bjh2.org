i have this story on my mind but as i'm writing two other i don't think i have the time to write it.

The story starts after the epilogue Hermione became an unspeakable and is working on a project about time travel Ron and Ginny go to visit her to work Ron is an auror and ginny works for daily prophet Harry is head auror and currently on a misison. they go into the time chamber because ginny is writing a piece for the newspaper. they talk a bit and when they go out they find themselves in a dystopian London where evil!dumbledore is ruling most of europe with an iron fist. voldemort defeated dumbledore earlier on and posed as him to take control of the magical world. after they find about this they have to infiltrate the ministry back into the chamber of time. they send their minds back in time to harry's first year (when dumbledore was defeated) to set things right unfortunally, because a miscalculation, they are sent back to harry's seveth. (harry age 17)

Harry never went to hogwarts instead he went to stonewall high, at age 12 he meet a girl that later became his only friend and latter her girlfriend. now harry works two partime jobs while studyng so once he becomes of age he can marry his girlfriend and move away from the dursleys. one day two girls and a boy aproach him telling him they are his bestfriend and wife from the future and that he has magic. harry doesn't want anything to do with them unfortunally he and his girlfriend are dragged into the world when death eaters try to kidnap harry.

The weasleys and the other good wizards formed an underground resistence agains't voldy!dumbledore and ginny ron and hermione think that the key to defeat voldy!dumbledore is harry.

focus a bit on the drama about harry having a girlfriend he wants to marry and his wife from the future. while they try to find a way to hunt the horcrux and destroy voldy!dumbledore.
