Romance Fics I'd enjoy seeing, or just smut fics with these characters.\\
- Marauders era Lily Potter and time travelling Harry Potter. Harry would feel conflicted about this since it's his mother while Lily would like him, and wonder why he was avoiding it.\\
- Rowena Ravenclaw and Harry Potter. Without it being Harry is actually someone reincarnated. (I've seen one of this before I think but it was Salazar reincarnated, don't remember the title though.)\\
- Myrtle and Harry Potter.\\
- Helena Ravenclaw and Harry Potter\\
- Death of the Endless (Sandman comic series) and Harry Potter. I've read like one fic with this.\\
- Delirium (Or Delight since they are kinda the same person/entity) of the Endless (Sandman comic series) and Harry Potter.\\
- Luna Lovegood and Harry Potter. There is just not enough fics involving this.\\
- Nymphadora Tonks and Harry Potter same as above.\\
- Female Vampire and Harry Potter, I've only read one fic with a female vampire and Harry that I liked.

---------------------\\
Non-Romance fics(Well just not specifically romance fics)\\
----------------------\\
Hagrid actually opened the chamber of secrets. Tom Riddle & Hagrid were both parselmouths, but Hagrid was the one who was actually opening the chamber and petrifying people. Tom knew it was Hagrid, but also didn't want to reveal the chambers location nor kill the basilisk he pinned the blame on the acromantula. Tom made the horcrux diary so he could be immortal, and so he could stop Hagrid if he ever tried again since he got off free. Perhaps have so the diary was placed with someone (perhaps not lucius) and they had a spell that would automatically place it with someone so it could stop Hagrid.\\
------------------\\
Showcase Hagrids and Madame Maximes time with the giants.\\
------------------------------------\\
Harry Potter cannot feel hate. Someone placed a charm on him, that is mostly permanent, it cannot be removed by anyone, but it could be possible that it could be removed. The person who placed the charm did not want another dark lord like Tom Riddle, the person was no Albus Dumbledore.\\
-----------------------------------------------\\
Harry, Ron, Hermione and Lockhart go down into the chamber. The instant they arrive they are petrified by a waiting basilisk. Make up some reason why Hermione is there with them when they go down into the chamber. The four wake up in the future where Lord Voldemort rules magical Britain sometime into the future. The four team up to attempt to fight him. Lockhart uses his memory charms to acquire info, and supplies from people, etc.\\
----------------------------------------------------\\
Harry Potter time travels back in time. Except everybody that went to Hogwarts, and was in the order while he was there also traveled back in time from the moment of their deaths. So we have Cedric from when he died in the fourth task, Sirius from when he went into the veil (or have so he didn't actually die when he went into the veil, but still came back. Could have the death eaters except Voldemort come back, so we have Death Eaters that saw that they lost, and their lord is thinking there is disloyalty because everyone is acting weird.\\
----------------------------------------------\\
Harry from an earlier year, like 3rd or 2nd year time travels forward in time to his sixth, fifth, or fourth year. Everything happened like normal up to that point. Could have past-harry time travel into future-harry's body or separate.\\
----------------------------------------------\\
Rita Skeeter realizes she wouldn't be allowed to write basically what she wants if Voldemort wins. Showcase how Rita helps in the war against Voldemort.\\
-------------------------------------------------\\
Voldemort is the defense professor in sixth year. Most people didn't believe Harry at first, and why would they believe him when he says that the handsome Tom Riddle is Voldemort? Ginny would probably have problems because he would look like an older Tom from the diary. Some would believe him, like Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Twins, Albus would already know, Severus. Perhaps they can't prove he's Voldemort, and Albus can't fire him. This Voldemort would be sane, or at the very least saner.\\
---------------------------------------------------------\\
An Idea I wanted to write but I'm terrible at writing.\\
The Horcrux decided to attach to the thing closest, and had spent a good amount of time near Lord Voldemort. Lord Voldemort's wand. Hagrid picks up the wand because either wanting a free wand and it's Voldemort's. Also perhaps some compulsion magic to keep it. Everything plays out normally. Hagrid slowly become Hagridmort. Perhaps because Hagrid is a half-giant lord Voldemort is in his body and they merge. So we have a Hagrimort who likes deadly creatures, is sadistic, and fears death. Add what you want to that. Perhaps have it slower than other Horcruxes so we can see the results when Harry gets to school.\\
---------------------------------------------------------------\\
Harry didn't kill the basilisk, or there was another one in the chamber that didn't come out. Everything happens normally until the final battle when Harry goes down with Ron and Hermione to the chamber to get a fang. They find a basilisk there and Harry convinces it to fight for their side in protection of the castle.\\
---------------------------------------------------\\
The Twins accidently lock the entire Weasley family, including themselves, into an Egyptian tomb. They can't go out the way they came so they adventure further in. Bill uses his knowledge of curse-breaking and the tombs to tell whats happening, The twins use their experiments they've made. Charlie (if he's there I don't remember if he is) uses his knowledge of magical creatures. The adults are general magic users perhaps, but Arthur is a bit knowledgeable in enchanting. (He did enchant a car to fly, be invisible, and eventually become sentient even if he didnt mean to). Ron brought his rat and eventually Pettigrew transforms to human just to save the Weasleys because he didn't want to be alone down there. They realize they have to work together to get out even if they don't like each other. If you want to make Ginny know parseltongue because she was possessed by Tom, and that helps because of snakes that are around.\\
If you have them escape (Your choice) Pettigrew would probably escape, and the picture was never taken perhaps so Sirius doesn't escape prison, but the Weasleys know he is innocent.\\
-----------------------------------------------\\
Fawkes doesn't/can't bring Harry and Ginny out of the chamber easily. They move the rocks so Ron can get through and get Lockhart to follow them. They adventure deeper into the chamber with the sorting hat and perhaps Fawkes follows them or leaves. They adventure basically.\\
-----------------------------------------------\\
Harry casts Accio on Sirius when he was falling through the veil, and it doesn't turn into Dumbledore bashing.\\
------------------------------------------------ Harry is a metamorphagus, he befriends Tonks who would be in a later year. (Like sixth, or seventh year). She teaches him how to control his abilities.\\
-----------------------------------------------

I don't have any more currently.
