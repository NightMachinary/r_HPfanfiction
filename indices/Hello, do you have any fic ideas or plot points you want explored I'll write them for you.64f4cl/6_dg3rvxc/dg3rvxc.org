Harry: Master of Death, immortalized at 17, cares for Ron and Hermione in their final days. This story revolves around the day Ron and Hermione die of natural causes, and concerns itself with the Golden Trio's reflections' of caring for and being cared for as they grew older at different paces.

PS: I imagine the three of them living in a cottage in the Forest of Dean.
