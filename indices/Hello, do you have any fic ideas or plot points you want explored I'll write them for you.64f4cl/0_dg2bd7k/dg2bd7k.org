I kinda have this plot point in my head but I don´t write fics in years (and I don´t trust my english enough to write a complete fic) so here it goes:

A next gen fanfic where Auror Harry has to deal with a serial killer who kills people in a way of representing all the event´s that marked Harry´s life (like killing a couple with the death curse and leaving their 1 year old baby alive with a lighting bolt mark on his forehead), besides reproducing the scene he leaves tauting messages for Harry, puzzles so he can try and guess his identity. Harry is having a hard time because he doesn´t know how to deal with someone with no identity, no ideology and no goal besides tauting him.
