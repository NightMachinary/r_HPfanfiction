Voldemort greatest weakness is his allergy to troll bogies. Quirrell sets on fire because he grabs Harry's wand after it's been up a troll's nose. Maybe Harry could dissolve horcruxes in troll bogies.

Could have chapters from Voldemorts perspective avoiding troll bogie traps and making other death eaters deal with trolls.
