It's Harry's second year at Hogwarts, the Statute of Secrecy is now just a piece of paper, and the British wizarding community is forced to deal with the aftermath of a nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States. Unfortunately, Voldemort has noticed the destructive potential of the nuke. Things are about to heat up.

Bomb shelter smut would be great.

Gilderoy Lockhart, reputation in tatters after the revelations of his fraudulent nature, makes a new start in lucrative Memory-Charm-related contracts with Muggle multinational corporations. That's when the aliens signal their presence and Lockhart is finally put to the test of unifying world leaders against them through memory modifications. Likeable and compassionate but misunderstood Lockhart with a human heart who regularly brings us to tears is a bonus.

Story is a bureaucratic thriller set in Grindelwald-era Britain during the 1920s, and follows Reginald Rookwood, fresh out of Hogwarts, fresh into the Department of Records, noted for his ability to wandlessly cast spells through his nose, who by coincidence (or fate) becomes Head Junior Unspeakable at the Department of Mysteries. The central plot is a newly-made prophecy that seems unimportant at first, but gradually grows to concern the entirety of the wizarding world. The points of tension and conflict is Rookwood's frustration with getting anything done, the hierarchy of the workplace, the mystery of his Department, getting away with things he normally wouldn't be able to as an Unspeakable, and the enormous amount of paperwork involved. His work involves "creative prophecy fulfilment", that is, finding word loopholes in order to exploit prophecies to their best. A conspiracy is uncovered that the Ministry of Magic is a creation of the aristocratic class to occupy non-aristocrat wizards with pointless work, and nobody apart from the Unspeakables really does anything. Oh yes, and there's a romance in there too. Look for inspiration in Max Barry's /The Company/, Catch-22, and The Trial. Should be extremely fast-paced and generally in the comedy genre.

just thought of this one

Muggleborns and those living outside of the wizarding world (including Harry) are prevented from entering Hogwarts or knowing about magic at all until the age of 15, severely crippling their magical education (this was started by the purebloods to widen the disparity between them and the Muggleborns), but this has the interesting effect of making these children more susceptible to powerful outbursts of accidental magic. And they can control it too. Hermione should probably feature pretty prominently, and a political subplot wouldn't go amiss. Characters from below Harry's year can be at Hogwarts
