Switched at birth - Lily decides to deliver Harry in an NHS hospital for added security through obscurity. While there, a tragic mistake means that the Potters take home a muggle baby while that baby's biological parents take home Harry.

Does the prophecy still come into play? Does the muggle baby survive Halloween 1981 or do Lily's protections require magic in the person being protected? If the baby survives, what happens when society realizes this child doesn't have magic? What happens with baby Harry? Does he live the life of an anonymous muggleborn?
