I want to see more Transgendered Harry where Harry uses magic early in life to change her body to match her gender. Kind of like linkffn(9037058)

Maybe visits Pomfrey in her first week at Hogwarts and asks about her gender issues.

I'd prefer it to be either no-pairings at all if it goes on long enough, or if there is pairings then no Snape or Draco. Femslash is fine though.
