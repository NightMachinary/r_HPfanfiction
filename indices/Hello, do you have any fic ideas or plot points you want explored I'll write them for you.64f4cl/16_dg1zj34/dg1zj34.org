I want a harry who has the jumping ability from jumper, and do what any kid/teenager would do with such an ability while also having access to magic.

Also could him having 'unlocked' his jumping ability either when he is in hogwarts removes the magic tracker on him while also optional give him the ability to do wandless magic. If young he can do magic without a wand.

The main reason i like this concept is 1. Has No range 2. Can be used effectively in fighting sitiuations as shown in movie and 3. It looks like fun.
