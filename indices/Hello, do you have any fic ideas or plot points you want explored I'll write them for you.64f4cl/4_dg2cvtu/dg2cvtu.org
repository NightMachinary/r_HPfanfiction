I'll try my luck because these fics just /do not exist/ anywhere. Maybe you can blaze this trail with a short 10k bit.

The headline: Bellatrix / Sirius

I really don't know where to place this, so I'll just outline a few possibilities.

1. Bellatrix and Sirius are ordered by their family to marry. Both of them are difficult children in the eyes of their parents. They're rebellious - if in completely different ways. They're talented and powerful in their magic, yet use it only for mayhem and chaos. Somehow they're really two sides of the same coin. When they are told of their marriage, Sirius doesn't get away to the Potters. He will marry Bellatrix at the age of seventeen. When he tells this to hid friends in his seventh year, they try to get him away from it, but fail. The only way into a bearable life is to make the most dysfunctional marriage on the planet work.

2. Sirius duels Bellatrix in the Ministry of Magic. During their duel one of them brings up that they should have been married. Sirius ends up convincing her to come with him (maybe with the promise of a family? I'm not sure of the angle here). He gets an Unbreakable Vow of loyalty and Bellatrix ends up switching sides.

3. Neither Sirius nor Bellatrix died. They faked their deaths and are now living under new name on a fideliused island, smoking cigars and drinking mojitos. The story is about them reminiscing of their reasons to do it.

4. The exact opposite of 1. Sirius and Bellatrix are both promised to other families. Bellatrix is facing a loveless marriage with Rodolphus Lestrange, and Walburga has negotiated the terms of marriage with Jasmine Parkinson. During the dinner where the second agreement is announced, Sirius and Bellatrix plot out a plan to get out of their shackles. They marry behind their parents backs, but then face a problem. Voldemort? Dumbledore? The Blacks? Where exactly does their new family stand and how will they ever know that, when they can't even agree on whether or not to keep the motorbike?
