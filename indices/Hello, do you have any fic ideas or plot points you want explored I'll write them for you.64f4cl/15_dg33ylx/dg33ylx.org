Here's one: Voldemort died at Goddrick's Hallow, but Dumbledore has been quietly convincing both factions behind the scenes that he's about to come back in order to keep his authority unchallenged. Harry discovers this (and Dumbledore dipping into his vaults) and exposes him.

(Pairing not required, but Harmony requested if present. Thankee.)
