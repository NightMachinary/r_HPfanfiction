I think this one will work best as a sub-10k word fic.

A post OOTP independent Harry fic which takes the fact that Harry is an inexperienced 15 or 16 year old to its natural conclusion --- Harry miserably fails.

You know the tropes common in Indy!Harry tropes --- diagonal alley shopping trip, Lord of a million houses, new trunk, Dumbles/Moldyshorts, order of the chicken, big ass speech comparing Dumbledore to Hitler, that sort of thing.

In this fic, Harry tries to do what Harries in those fics do, but ends up antagonising everyone and ruining everything. After all, it stands to reason experienced war veterans would know more about strategy than a 15 year old.

It would be even better if the tropes were explicitly subverted. Like Harry inherits half the noble titles in the land but all that those houses have is a load of debt (that's why nobody had claimed them until now). Or maybe he tries to form an alliance with Amelia Bones and she humours him but then informs Dumbledore, because who's she gonna trust, the Chief Warlock or some skinny 15 yo?

Dumbledore's actions through the books should be cast in a sympathetic light. Can be crack!fic where Harry doesn't even realise he's screwing things up or a serious fic where he realises his mistakes.
