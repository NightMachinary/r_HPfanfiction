I had a few ideas, First, the burrow gets attacked by death eaters during Neville's and Harry's birthday party. Attendees are weasly family, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, Remus, Sirius, Fleur and Maybe Dumbledore. Harry saves Several of them from killing curses but gets killed taking a killing curse for tonks. They're all hurt alittle but alive. But after while they all sit around the table exchanging harry stories along with regrets, maybe funny and embarssing confessions of love, He wakes up as if from a nap. Walks into the dining room with everyone. Begins to eat like it's no big deal..its just the start of a longer fic Harry/Tonks with no Bashing please. I might just try to write this myself but I've never written one before
