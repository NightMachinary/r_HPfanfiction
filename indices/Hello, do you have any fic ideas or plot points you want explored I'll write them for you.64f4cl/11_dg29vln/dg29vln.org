A Harry/Cho fic.

Start 4th year to cut off all the Cedric stuff. She is a Ravenclaw a year ahead of him, she can help him prepare for the tournament? Harry could ask her out(before the ball thing) or ask her for help or just bump into her. (He feels he is going to die and wants to ask out someone he has a crush on?) Bonus points if you pair up Cedric and Hermione to make some interesting fireworks.

You can focus on the effect Cho has on Harry's thinking. Make him consider the tasks better, think things through, have multiple strategies. Draw focus to the fact that Cho is a Ravenclaw(and thereby quite intelligent) and the effect that someone like that (who doesn't poke, prod, nag, manipulate and who he actually likes and wants to impress) would have on him.

Cho as a Ravenclaw would be smart and competitive. She has a crush on Harry too.(it can start off as hero worship or just wanting to know the truth behind all the rumors about the last three years and his life)

You can do the main bits. Their meeting, the help/strategy sessions, the tasks, the ball, their relationship developing(14/15 yos are old enough to experiment in a place with virtually no adult supervision), how their friends react, maybe add some Luna too(because Harry is connected to Ravenclaw events via Cho).
