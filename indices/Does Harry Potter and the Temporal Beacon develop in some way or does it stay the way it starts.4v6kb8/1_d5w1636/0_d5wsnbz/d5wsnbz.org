Yeah I really want to read stories with more or different triwizard tasks. There's basically this, the jbern(?) one that ends pretty suddenly, and the sorting hat's stand. None of them are really great, other than the possible jbern one until he's like "fuck this story. I'm done writing it, but here's an ending because I'm a decent dude."
