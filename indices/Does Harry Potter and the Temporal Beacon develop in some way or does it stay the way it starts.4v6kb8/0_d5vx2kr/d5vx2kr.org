Not... really, in my experience. It adds some Dumbledore bashing later on, because one cannot have a time loop plot without a seemingly unbeatable threat, in this case a moderately competent Eeevil!Dumbledore. At least iirc, it's been a while since I attempted to read it, and I've since mostly gone off reading H/Hr.

It was an overly long and thoroughly mediocre read, though, as I recall. Sorry to say it.
