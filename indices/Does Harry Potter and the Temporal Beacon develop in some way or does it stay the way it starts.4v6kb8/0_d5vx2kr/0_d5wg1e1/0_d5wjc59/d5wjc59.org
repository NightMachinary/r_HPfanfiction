Not really. And he's not really evil, more like, another iteration of “greater good” Dumbledore. What makes him look evil is his deep trust in Snape who is like 10 times more assholish than the canon one, and his inane plans concerning Snape and Harry (which results in him pretty much sending Harry to his death “because Snape says so and Snape is a holy knight”).

So ... yeah, if you are looking for a competent evil Dumbledore, bother not.

That said, it does have a rather nice approach to the triwizard tournament in general.
