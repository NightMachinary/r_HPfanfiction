This is an pretty specific request but maybe some lord of the rings crossovers might have this. A decent amount of those have harry there involuntarily and wanting to get home. Game of thrones and a song of ice and fire tend to have have harry getting there on purpose. As for the romance part... idk some marauder era time travel fics probably have this.
