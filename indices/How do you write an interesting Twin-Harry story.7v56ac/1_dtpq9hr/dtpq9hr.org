A loving family. Lily died for Harry so she certainly would not abandon Harry, for whatever reason. Dumbledore can say what he wants, it's not happening.

The twins have a good relationship. There's enough shit going on with Voldemort, no need for more melodrama. Also no drama for drama's sake. With a bunch of genocidal terrorists running rampant, we really don't need Harry's girlfriend cheating on him.
