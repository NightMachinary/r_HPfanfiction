I know it's stating the bleedin' obvious, but you write an interesting 'Twin-Harry' story the same way you write any other interesting story. You write a proper plot arc with engaging, well developed characters and pay attention to SPaG and formatting. And you finish it. If you do all those things you'll aready be ahead of the curve.
