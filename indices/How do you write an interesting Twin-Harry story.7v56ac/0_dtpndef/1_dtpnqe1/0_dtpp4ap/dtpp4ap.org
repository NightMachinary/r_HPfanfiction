Not too sure really. Maybe someone made some satire fanfics with them.

Some of them are:

1.Harry is 'abandoned'

2.Harry is the 'true' Boy-who-lived.

3.Dumbledore makes Harry out to be useless and sidelines him

4.His parents seem to get absorbed in the fame/responsibility of the 'boy-who-lived' and ignore Harry

1. Harry is usually the older brother and thus the 'heir' to the family name and fortune

2. Many fics make him a cripple magically, usually by him losing his magic when Voldemort attacks and being said that his twin used/drew on his magic to 'vanquish' Voldemort using a 'twin bond'

3. Harry either spends his childhood in the Potter home forgotten and/or ignored at all major events or even outright abused, and/or is sent to the Dursleys for his own protection/to ensure his twin can be trained without 'distractions'/because Dumbledore wants him gone/his parents want him gone/because he is corrupted by Voldemorts death/because he is a 'squib' and it would be 'cruel' for him to stay in the magical world.

4. Many such fics have him sorted into non-Gryffindor, usually Ravenclaw or Slytherin

Should be many more, but I can't recall off the top of my head now.

Prince of Slytherin has managed to do wonderfully with the twin-fic genre. Since you love those stories, if you haven't read it already, you really should.
