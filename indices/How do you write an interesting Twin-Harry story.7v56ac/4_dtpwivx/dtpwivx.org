Twins generally fall into two categories: Inseparable and interchangeable (i.e. Fred and George) or trying to be as different from each other as possible (i.e. Parvati and Padma). Probably don't go for the Fred and George style unless you're doing a comedy/crack and want them to bounce one-liners off each other. If you go for 2 different perspectives working together at the challenges of Hogwarts then it could be good.

P.S. Magical twins always seem to be identical.

P.P.S. If you have a smart twin then there's no reason not to kill off Hermione.
