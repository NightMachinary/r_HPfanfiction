Have them share an unbreakable bond that is continuously tested over the years. I'm doing it in a fic I'm writing now where Harry is Darker and Neville (the BWL) defends him with everything he has. Not exactly the same, but people have commented on it and I got some good reviews for it.

Lily died for Harry, as did James. I cannot fathom them ever abandoning Harry or any child.
