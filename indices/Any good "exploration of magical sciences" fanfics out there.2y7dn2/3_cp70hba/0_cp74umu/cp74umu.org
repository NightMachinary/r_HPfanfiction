In my opinion HPMoR is not a good starting point because the universe in which it is built is slightly different but with mayor implications. Obviously ultill the final arch is completed we cannot know all the differences but only seeing the "interdict of merlin" we see the basic assumptions are completly different. And we know that from different axioms we get different results. Hpmor is a standalone group in the "hpuv-magic" group, we don't even know if they intersect (if hpmor magic is femtotech they don't for example)
