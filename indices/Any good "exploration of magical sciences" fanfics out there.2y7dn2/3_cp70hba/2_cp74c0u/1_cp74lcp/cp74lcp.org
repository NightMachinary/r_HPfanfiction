It has that in every arc. Original plot development, foreshadowing that will make you bang your head for not catching it the first time. Interesting challenges, a Professor Quirrel who doesn't suck, lots of action sequences in the form of Defense battles. It's not just didactic, there's a lot of good story there. But it's unconventional story.
