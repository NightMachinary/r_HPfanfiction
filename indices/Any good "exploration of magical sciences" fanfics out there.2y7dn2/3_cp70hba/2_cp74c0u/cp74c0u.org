That's what keeps putting me off starting to read it. I don't need or want a story that is trying to teach me something. I read for the character and plot progression. I want to see the conflict, the climb, the climax, and the aftermath. Does it honestly have that stuff? If you say yes I will take your word for it and read the entire thing.
