HPMoR is one of my favorite fanfiction ever, and I'm by no mean a EY fanboy.

Yes, he scientific stuff can be off-turning /if you think really hard about it/. But if you just float along with it, you'll find EY is excellent at intrigue and plot development, as well as being generally condescending.

The science stuff is most jarring in the first few chapters (where, I presume, he had less experience writing to a fanfiction audience), but it gets better. Also yes, the scientific stuff - while I think it's not as blatantly wrong as many critics deem it - is also contrived to suit his needs. But isn't every fanfiction like that? That's no reason we stop reading other stories, so why should we for this one?

Honestly, I think the only really /valid/ complaint against HPMoR, rather than the usual bandwagoning hate comments, is how EY asks for donations from the readers in exchange for faster chapters. But you know, I never gave him a penny, and neither do you have to. Just enjoy one of the best fanfictions in the HP universe and shut out the rest of the world for a while.

Also, it's mostlyrather too late for you now, but [[/r/HPMOR]] was an experience this past few weeks. Never seen anything else quite like it.
