Sure you can. Just make a hypothesis based on what you think you know, and test it. Figuring out the basics of a new world isn't the same as publishing something for peer review. It's a daunting task but if you're just trying to get a rough idea, you can burn through as many hypotheses as you can think of, and most will come out false. So there's no need to be exhaustive about it. Shape first, details later. Hence the whole deal about locating the hypothesis. So your original way of thinking about how the world works drops in probability and hopefully, eventually another idea begins to make sense.

So his old prior still work, because obviously that's how some subset of Reality seems to function. But he has to update them with every new observation. It's clear from the very beginning that those priors are either incomplete or simplified from some higher reality. But it's not like someone turns into a cat and atoms suddenly don't hold themselves together with the nuclear strong force. But something lets a human mind change those atoms into other atoms at will. He updates on every observation. But being someone who has read all but the final 5 chapters or so, I can tell you that he hasn't stumbled upon the ultimate secret of magic. He might be getting close. He's learned things that certainly sound relevant.
