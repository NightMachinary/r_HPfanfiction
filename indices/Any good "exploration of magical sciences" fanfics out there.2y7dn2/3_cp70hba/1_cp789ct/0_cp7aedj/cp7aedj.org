I only remember rare instances where his hypotheses immediately turn out to be right. And those aren't just spitballing something that sounds good. It's things he has spent time thinking about before, but missed a far simpler hypothesis. The comed-tea for example. One where I think the criticism is completely fair is with the dementors and patronus 2.0. But I don't think it's a bad guess and between Harry's character and narrative conceit, I didn't have a problem with it for that reason. There's also a recent plot revelation which may explain a certain intuition he seems to have from time to time.

About the medelian pattern: yeah something screwy is going on there. Witches messing around with love potions and muggles isn't a completely satisfying explanation, but it's possible.

I agree, science is not what it's about. Nor is it a comprehensive guide to figuring out all the secrets of a world where you point a stick of wood at something and say 'wingardium leviosa' and it floats.

Bayesian rationality doesn't require prior information. Even if you start at even odds, you just update with every new observation and it helps you approach truth. Obviously it doesn't work if you misuse it and pull probabilities out of your ass because you think it helps your preferred hypothesis, but pulling probabilities out of your ass and being honest about prior probability is actually a helpful method. I've used it before where concrete probabilities made no sense.
