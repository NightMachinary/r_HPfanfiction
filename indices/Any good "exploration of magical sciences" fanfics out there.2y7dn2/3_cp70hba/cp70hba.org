It's part of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] Which a lot of people around here find to be overrated, but I'm not one of them. In about a week, the final arc will be finished so now is one of the best times to start reading if you haven't already.

If you're not aware of the story, it's an AU with a good plot wrapped around teaching basic rationality. It tries to illustrate how a rational agent might try to discover truth in a confusing world. So just to let you know, it doesn't have a coherent theory of magic handed down from on high. The wise old wizards don't have a clue how magic really works. An abnormally smart genre savvy Harry Potter is looking for shortcuts to godhood.
