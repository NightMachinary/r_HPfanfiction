Hmmm...

I don't have a link handy (because for some reason known only to them, the admins at Fanfiction.net took it down), but Ron becomes /extremely/ loyal and protective towards Harry in /Nightmares of Future Past./

It's an extremely popular fanfic, so it shouldn't be too hard to find an archived copy.

That said, it probably doesn't fit a "Big Brother Ron" sort of deal. Ron is very much Harry's equal.
