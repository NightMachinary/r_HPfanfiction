There are two authors that write really good "canon-compliant" fics about life after the battle ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]). I would definitely recommend them. The story "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]]" by little0bird is probably one of my favorite stories of all time. It's really good, and it details the characters struggling to pick up where they left off.

I would give you my story, but I've only got a few chapters finished...so you probably don't want to wait around for a WIP. Maybe some day!
