I know which story you're talking about, but I'm quite certain they aren't the same one. Good idea, though! In the one I'm trying to find I'm quite sure that Harry is at school for the whole 7 years, only gets scars from his usual Hogwarts shenanigans and doesn't grow very quickly the whole time he is at school.
