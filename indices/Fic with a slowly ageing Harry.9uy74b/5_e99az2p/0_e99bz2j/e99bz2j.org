I'm quite certain it isn't this as I've read it before - the one I'm thinking of had better writing style. Don't get me wrong, Fate's Gamble is one of the few stories I really enjoyed despite issues with the writing - every chapter felt like the author had fun writing it. The one I'm looking for though didn't have this. Harry also looked relatively normal apart from the age thing.
