Also, I love the way the Triwizard Cup is handled, double-subverting the reader's expectations about it being tampered with. It's a Portkey! But it does exactly what it was supposed to! But Harry gets ambushed by Voldemort anyway!

The Forest was a much more interesting task than the canonical dragons, and the politics between champions was a nice twist.
