Hahaha no I think the one I'm referring to was just for marrying Voldemort.

If you are okay with slash and don't mind Tomarry, might I suggest Heir Apparent by MonsieurClavier? (No explicit scenes there at this point.) Also Dark Livestream by anna_hopkins. Both are just so silly. Not complete and haven't been updated much as of late but I love those two. They are almost borderline cr@ckfics hahaha. (Again and Again by Athy is a more serious Tomarry that's also excellent.)
