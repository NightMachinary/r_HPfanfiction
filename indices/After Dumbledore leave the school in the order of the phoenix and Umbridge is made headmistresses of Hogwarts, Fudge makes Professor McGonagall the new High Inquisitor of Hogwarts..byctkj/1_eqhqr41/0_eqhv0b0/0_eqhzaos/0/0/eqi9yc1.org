Well the greace in his hair and his robes alone should weigh about 50 kg if, we say that Snape is 5'8 and can only imagine him underweight so I guess he is about 60 kg, so in his normal attire he should weigh 110 kg. If my following calculation is right, mind you I failed math two years in a row so this might be complete bogus, we should get a satisfying answer: if 110/x=90 x=0.8181818181818181818181818... so 300/(90/110)=245.454545454545454545454545454545454545...or simply 245.45 meter the question however is who is more aerodynamic Snape or a 90 kg rock and if the fanon of Snape enchanting his coat to dramatically billow whenever he makes an entrance, does this have an impact on aerodynamics?
