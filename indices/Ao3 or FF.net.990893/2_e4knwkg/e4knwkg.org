Style-wise I prefer AO3, but the sheer amount of Drarry over there puts me off a bit. There's also far less fics there. I also find the tagging system a bit confusing, and sometimes it doesn't actually give 100% of the results. Not sure what's going on.

Then again, I've found out that the same thing can happen on FFN, with fics being hidden from search results.
