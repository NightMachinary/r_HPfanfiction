It all depends on you.

AO3 can be difficult to browse at times, although the new exclude search function really helps it along, even if the kinks need to be kicked out of it. AO3 also has, in my opinion, mostly slash, so if that's not your cup of tea then it's hard to get around.

[[https://FF.net][FF.net]] on the other hand has 2 decades worth of work and an easy search function. FF also has the C2's that allow you to easily find something new to read while only searching through stories that would interest you.

Personally I use both, but FF will always have a special place in my heart as the first website that I both read and posted fanfiction on. Also it's a lot easier to keep track of your favourite stories on FF.
