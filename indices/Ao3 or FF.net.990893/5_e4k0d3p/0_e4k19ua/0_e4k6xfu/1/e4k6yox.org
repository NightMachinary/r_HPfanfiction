  When he'd fallen, the last place Loki had expected to wake was in the middle of a forest. He also hadn't expected to become involved in a world of magic, wizards and one very interesting Potions Master.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][*/Professor C. Binns: A Personal History/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/PurpleFluffyCat/pseuds/PurpleFluffyCat][/PurpleFluffyCat/]]

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  2. Once, over the course of two memorable weeks, an escaped Chizpurfle wreaked havoc inside the castle. “A what?” Ron whispered, when it was announced at dinner.“A Chizpurfle,” Hermione hissed back. “Newt Scamander wrote about them in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. They're small crab-like parasites that feed off larger creatures like Augureys and Crups, but they're also attracted to leftover potions and objects with high magical concentrations.” “My mam told me about them,” Seamus Finnigan said darkly. “She said once when I was little, we had a Chizpurfle infestation in our house. Turns out they were after her wand and some of the rare spellbooks she kept in the attic.”“They eat wands?” Harry asked, horrified.“Yeah. Mam told the neighbors it was rats. Had to live with my uncle Angus for three weeks, while the Ministry pest control cleaned ‘em all out.”

  Tabitha beamed. “I wanted to run an idea by you. We were thinking, you see. It's coming up to the end of October, which means the anniversary of your first defeat of You-Know-Who. Thirty years! So we thought it'd be great to have a whole feature on, you know -- your life now. The Boy Who Lived -- Thirty Years On. No Longer a Boy ...” She was leaning forwards now, tone hushed, fingers wiggling to emphasise the supposed enthrall of this title. “We'll interview you, ask you all about how things have changed for you -- and we were thinking we'd go to Godric's Hollow, where it happened, to do it --”Harry blinked. “You want to go to the scene of my parents' death to ask me about my life?”“It adds an emotional dimension, you see,” explained Tabitha, apparently without irony.“There is already a fairly emotional dimension for me,” said Harry. “You know, since they died and everything.”
