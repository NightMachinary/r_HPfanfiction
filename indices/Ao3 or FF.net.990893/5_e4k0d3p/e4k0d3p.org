I prefer Ao3. It's easier to search and I have found that there tends to be better stories in general than on FFN.

Ao3 tends to have a lot more originality in my opinion-but that may be because different tropes are on Ao3 compared to FFN (and I am more familiar with FFN tropes after initially reading on FFN).
