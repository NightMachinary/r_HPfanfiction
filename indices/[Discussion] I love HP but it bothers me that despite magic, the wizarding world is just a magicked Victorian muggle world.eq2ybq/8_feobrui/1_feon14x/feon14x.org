That's an interesting headcanon, don't fully endorse it bc I think it's a bit of a stretch that Dumbledore would be censoring purebloods like the ferret, but I can see a fanon world built where we get more details like that with Little details like dorm segregation and stuff like that. and yeah I would say that a huge part of the lack of world building is due to Harry being an inattentive little Berk (and JKR being a shit writer).

Could you please find that fic you mentioned? It sounds right up my alley and I would very much like to read it.
