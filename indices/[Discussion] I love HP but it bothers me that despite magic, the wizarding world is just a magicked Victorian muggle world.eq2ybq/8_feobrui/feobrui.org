I like the idea that because we see things through Harry's (unobservant) eyes that there are things going on that we aren't aware of. I also headcanon that Gryffindor, as Dumbledore's house, and by extension, as much of the school that Dumbledore can influence as possible - is more accessible to muggleborns and less traditionalist in terms of magic than the other houses might be, following his lead or command. (conveniently enough for our muggle-raised hero)

Following my headcanon, this actually means that people like some of the Slytherins we see have a point - the kids, at least, and some of the adults. Of course, some of them take it to extremes of racism and terrorism, and they have attitudes of prejudice. But the same could be slung at Hermione 'wizards-have-no-logic'/'Divination is all rubbish' Granger - those are attitudes she has brought from her muggle upbringing and hasn't challenged within herself within a new environment where they might not be quite accurate. (for example, this isn't a bash - Hermione is the only muggleborn character we see in any depth)

For an in-canon example, I don't remember which fic pointed this out (probably whitesquirrel, it sounds like that kind of observation), but there's zero indication that there are separate changing rooms for boys and girls playing Quidditch. The Gryffindor team frequently have team meetings all together in the one changing room before going out. This fic took that as-was and suggested that there aren't actually such separate norms of gender roles in the witching world, and that those are a muggle quirk. (as an aside, a lot of that Lord and Lady/gender roles stuff is complete fanon, and quite recent fanon too)

Anyway, back to my headcanon, I imagine that actually in Slytherin and perhaps Ravenclaw, things /are/ done quite differently, and its only the moderating influence of Dumbledore that mutes them out in public. Where, of course, they see muggleborns being /indulged/ while their own ways of doing things are quashed. Naturally, that breeds resentment.

I guess the alternative is that 1 in 4 kids in this world is just all bad and rotten to the core.
