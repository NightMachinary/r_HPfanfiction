You made some good points. You're right it isn't Victorian, I guess I got affected by the one too many Lord/Lady fics. I do like what you pointed out about mentality.

Victoria Potter is one of those fics that have amazing world-building, the kind of world-building I want to see, but with a plot that I personally couldn't enjoy and bashing of characters that I can't enjoy. That said I've read up to the latest chapter anyway just because of the world-building. That teardrop potion thing was fascinating.

Most wizards are bad at magic, sure, but the way you described them, it's almost like they should live as muggles who can do a cleaning spell. That honestly sounds so mundane and... Well, it ruins the idea of magic.

I could be wrong, but what I find fascinating about the premise of Harry Potter is that this is a world where they use magic every day as if it's just a mundane thing, as if their wand is just an extra limb. The great wizards are those that invent new magic or research highly complex things, or can do fantastic battles, but the everyday wizard is a person who has his whole household automated with a wave of a wand, who can travel large distances with a thought, who for the most part does not have to worry about most muggle dangers like wild animals or starving, who can build themselves a house and manipulate the internal dimensions.

Maybe that's too OP, sure. But honestly? I'd rather that over a real-life copy but with Magicâ„¢ (that's practically useless for you unless you're then next coming of Merlin).

Honestly, when Im reading about the Magic world, I wanna feel like "yeah, I'd love to be a regular magical and go to Hogwarts" rather than feel like "well, you know this is kinda similar to technology and me studying a CS degree and it's just as boring and annoying".
