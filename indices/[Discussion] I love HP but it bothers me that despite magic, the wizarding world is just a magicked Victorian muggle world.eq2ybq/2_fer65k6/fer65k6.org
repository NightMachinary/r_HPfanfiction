I think there's a few different responses to this.

*Wizarding Britain isn't very Victorian*

This is commonly stated in the fandom, but it's very much a fandom rather than canon thing. I'm struggling to identify a single thing in canon that is "Victorian".

For example, people often talk about robes as being old fashioned. But they're not really. At no point in British history did laypeople wear robes as their everyday clothes.

At most I think you can point to Diagon Alley being a cobbled street with lots of independent shops, or the Hogwarts Express being a steam train. But these are incredibly superficial things.

And in lifestyle, wizards are not Victorian at all. For example, wizarding dating culture is pretty much identical to Muggle dating culture in the 1990s.

*Most wizards are bad at magic*

Most wizards are fine with daily household spells and the magic they need for their profession, but it seems like most wizards can't cast most spells.

This rings true:

- It reflects Muggle levels of academic attainment, with most students being quite bad at most subjects.

- It is similar to how most Muggle adults wouldn't be able to do (for example) basic trigonometry once they're a few years out of school.

So when you look at wizarding society, you can't be looking at it as if every wizard is a Dumbledore. Rather, the typical wizard is probably a lot more like Lockhart (good at one thing, useless at most other things).

*The idea that wizarding Britain is backwards is often based on values that make little sense in the wizarding world*

People have a tendency to look at the most superficial of appearances and jump to conclusions. Wizards wear robes, they occupy buildings made of traditional materials, they don't build grand monuments; they don't build infrastructure - therefore they are backwards.

But this is a mindset very much embedded in a Muggle perspective, and a modernist, consumerist Muggle perspective at that.

So for example: yes, wizards could use magic to build giant skyscrapers which dwarf Muggle ones and choose not to. Is this really a sign of being backwards? Or is it rather a reflection of different cultural values?

Wizards do not seem to share the "bigger is better" mindset of Muggles, and why would they? Magic completely disconnects a thing's outward appearance from its utility. You could have a small cottage that has as much interior space a penthouse.

I actually like the idea that in wizarding culture, making things look shabby on the outside is considered a sign of class; only the most gauche of Muggle-lovers would think that the way a place appears from the outside is in any way indicative of its true value.

I conclude with a section from Victoria Potter, from the summer between first and second year:

  The Muggle world felt /wrong/.

  Hogwarts was filled with nooks and crannies, hidden alcoves and spiral staircases, but everything was neatly rectangular at Number Four, Privet Drive. The anemic electric lights were a pale imitation of a flickering, crackling fire, and the front garden was little more than a patch of grass, not a single blade out of place, its perimeter brimming with meticulously arranged flowerbeds. Just like everything else in the Muggle world, there was nothing wild there, nothing truly /alive/.

  Claustrophobia was setting in, and Victoria found herself longing for wide, open spaces---forests and valleys and sprawling castles perched atop tall cliffs. Little Whinging's park offered some respite, but even that felt cramped, the busy road never out of sight. She was therefore jumping at every chance to leave the house, accompanying Petunia on trips to the bank, post office or the shops.

  When they weren't out and about, she was put to work in the garden, weeding, watering and planting new flowers. It was awfully dull compared to herbology---the Muggle plants didn't even fight back when you pruned them---but under Victoria's magical touch the garden had blossomed to become the envy of the neighbourhood. As word spread, Petunia's friends began visiting for afternoon tea with increasing regularity.

  "Never seen roses that colour before," they would say, "bright purple! A new breed, is it?" Or: "Tulips in July! Well I never!" No doubt Petunia suspected that Victoria was doing something unnatural, but she seemed content to feign ignorance so long as the garden continued to draw admiring comments from the members of the Little Whinging Garden Association.

  For her part, Victoria hadn't intended to use herbology---it had just slipped out, an instinct that was difficult to control. She wasn't even sure if she could tell the difference, now, between magical and non-magical handling of plants. Was stamping on the soil to summon worms magic, or was that something Muggles did too?

  [...]

  Vernon left for work, and soon enough Petunia drove Victoria down to Great Whinging high street, where a number of charity shops were to be found. As they looked for a parking space, once again Victoria was struck by the strangeness of the Muggle world, all concrete and plastic and glass. It was as if the Muggles were determined to kill off all connection to nature.

  She had been thinking about this a lot over the summer. Muggle technology depended on the laws of nature, and yet Muggles seemed so disconnected from everything green and living. Meanwhile, wizards lived in close contact with the natural world, even though their powers continuously defied it. At first Victoria thought that it was simply because wizards didn't need things like electricity and roads, but her time in the garden had made her rethink that idea. Magic was supernatural, yes, but it was also closely connected to nature. It was an interesting contradiction.

  [...]

  The broom was just skimming the top of the white, fluffy clouds, so close that their feet could almost touch them. Through the gaps in the clouds she could glimpse the world far below, the buildings and roads so small that they could have been a toy model, and though the sight made her feel quite dizzy, she couldn't help but keep looking.

  As they made their way north over London, Victoria noticed something interesting: though there were in fact very few clouds, their route never took them into clear skies where Muggles might spot them. It was as if the clouds formed a constantly shifting network of roads in the sky, acting to conceal them from view.

  She began to relax. The sun and wind had dried her out quickly, and now the broom was level she could sit back in the saddle without having to clutch it with her thighs. At first she didn't think they were going that fast---certainly the breeze wasn't too strong---but when she risked another glance down, she noticed that the clouds where zooming past beneath them, faster than any car. They quickly left London behind, the urban sprawl giving way to farmland dotted with small towns. Victoria took a deep breath of the cool, clean air. At last she was out of the crowded Muggle world with its smog and litter. /This/ was where she belonged.
