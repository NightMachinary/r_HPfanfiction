This post will probably ramble on a bit, since I'm basically thinking it through as I write it, so here goes.

The magic of the canon universe seems to shift wildly between being whimsical/fantastical and rigid/predictable. A large, LARGE part of this in my opinion is how JKR decided to write her magic system. She wrote it as a hard magic system, but writes like it's a soft magic system.

In a hard magic system, there are clearly defined rules, costs, and limits to what magic can do. In HP, this translates to a spell can only do what it was created to do. Lumos cannot create a laser beam of light, nor can it lift a heavy object. There are other rules, like “it's impossible to truly raise the dead or create love,” things like that. Potions as a discipline is pretty much entirely a hard magic system.

In a soft magic system, the rules and limits to magic are incomprehensible. For example, in Lord of the Rings, it's never really clear exactly what Gandalf/Sauron/Sauruman can and cannot do with magic. When a soft system of magic is used, the writer must be very careful to avoid making it the solution to every problem the characters encounter.

Now, JKR takes her hard magic system, and just adds whatever bits she needs to progress the plot. There are so so many potions and spells that she casually adds out of hand that could be horrifically abused, and when she gets called on it, comes up with shit on the spot to explain it away. Veritiserum is probably the most irritating example (a truth serum that is able to be fooled easily enough to make it useless unless the plot says otherwise), but love potions are near as bad. Fanatical, illogical, all consuming need to please someone? And is easy enough to brew that the twins can mass produce it for sale? Absolutely terrifying.

Got off point there - SO to OP's point, I feel like the “magic” of magic died in small steps as the books progressed and JKR shifted from books for kids to books for young adults. She added more restrictions, took away the whimsy. There's a lot more mention of casual displays of magic in the earlier books - Harry's introduction to the Burrow stands out in particular.

As much as Fantastic Beasts is annoying story wise, it also gave us the best examples of what adult witches and wizards using magic should look like. The MACUSA was able to completely repair all the damage that was done to the city in minutes.

I think something people generally take out of context is the “shield hats” quote from one of the twins - where they comment that most people can't manage a shield charm. I think this has less to do with the aptitude of your average magic user and more to do with the curse on the DADA professor's post, combined with the fact that a large portion of students - those intending not to go into law enforcement, for example - probably drop DADA after their OWL year (or at least they would when there's no active war with a Dark Lord going on).

Argh tangents. MY POINT IS, magic was more magical before JKR decided it shouldn't be to drive the plot forward. Things like “magic can't make food” so that the trio would be starved so Ron would leave for a bit; “Veritiserum isn't infallible” because otherwise all the Death Eaters would be locked up and Sirius wouldn't have been. JKR was less focused on consistent world building and more on telling a story.
