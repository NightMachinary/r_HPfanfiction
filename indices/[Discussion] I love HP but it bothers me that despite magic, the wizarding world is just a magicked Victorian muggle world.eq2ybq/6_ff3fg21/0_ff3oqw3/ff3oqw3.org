Yes yes yes! Thank you! You've verbalized EXACTLY what I've been feeling.

There's a bit more that I feel you didn't mention like the cultural and social impact of magic, but what you wrote is bloody fantastic and clearly expressed, thank you.

That said, thank you for introducing me to the concept of soft and hard magic systems. I've been trying to find a way to express what I see and my annoyances about this but I couldn't find a way to describe it.
