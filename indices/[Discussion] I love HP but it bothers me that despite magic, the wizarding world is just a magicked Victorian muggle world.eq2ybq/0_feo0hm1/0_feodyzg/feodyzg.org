Not to take away from your overall point, but the frequency of the average person's baths didn't change between the early middle ages and the mid 20th century. Before ~1950 a common british house wouldn't even have had a proper bathroom, nevermind a shower or hot water from a tap.

The average englishman would take a heated bath once a week, usually in the same water their family had already used and would spend the rest of the week using a sponge. Quite in the same way a peasant in 1200 would.
