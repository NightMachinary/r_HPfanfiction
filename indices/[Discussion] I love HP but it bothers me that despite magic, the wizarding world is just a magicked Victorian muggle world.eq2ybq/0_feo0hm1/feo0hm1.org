My headcanon for why the Wizarding World looks like a magicked Victorian Muggle world?

They peaked early.

Think about it; by the Middle Ages when most non-magicals were still trying to figure out that showering regularly was important, the Wizarding world had magic. Magic brought about a higher standard of living. Even the poorest people we see in canon (Weasleys) have food, clothes and a roof over their heads. It's a /luxury/ poverty, not a /necessity/ poverty. This gave wizards a huge advantage, along with the equal rights for women, education for all and a stable economy. If anything, the Muggles copied wizards in those days (Wizard=wise and Muggle=gullible, so they must have been doing something right, according to the non-magicals) and wanted the comforts of magic. Comforts they couldn't have. During and after the Plague, the envy that non-magicals had for their wizarding counterparts must have hit an all-time high (the condensending attitude towards Muggles by wizards didn't help much) and so the witch hunts began. The beginning of the hunts prompted wizards to slowly start hiding away until the Statute was signed in 1689 and put into effect in 1692.

Afterwards, non-magicals had to find a way to 'prove' magic never existed, and then came the Renaissance. Enlightenment. Technology. Ways to at least try to replicate magic. And they did, so much so that wizards took notice (radio, Knight Bus, Camera, Hogwarts Express, etc) and took their inventions.
