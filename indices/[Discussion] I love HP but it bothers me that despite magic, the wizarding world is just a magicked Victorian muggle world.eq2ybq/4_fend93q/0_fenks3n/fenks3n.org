I understand, but we are in a fanfic sub, haha.

Mini rant: but frankly, other than the spark of an idea of having wizards and witches in this particular way, JKR has fucked up too much from normalizing the idea of forgiving abuse, forcing kids back there, and literally insisting that blood relation is important, to fumbling up the world building, the glaring plot holes, the mis-characterisations (I mean really, the Hat tells Harry he should be in Slytherin then Harry proceeds to use 7 books to show he is not cunning or even attentive?), The disgustingly neo-liberal views espouted such as everything is instantly alright once the big bad guy is gone, not like there was a year of hunting muggleborns and killing off non-wizard-nazis. Also, Ron and Hermione is a clear example of what abusive or at the very least terrible relationships start off as. At best it's hate sex in a bickering marriage. It's not right that this is what we grew up with thinking is okay.
