  But I'm also a big proponent of reunified the two worlds in fics so I tend to view things through the les of â€˜We're not so different, you and I' rather than elevating one or the other above each other. Just a personal preference.

fair enough, but the magic discoveries being a progression doesn't mean that the worlds would be that similar.\\
people were still discovering things in prehistory, and just with magic giving magicals longer life magical research would surge ahead of muggle research, unless a magical dedicated themselves to muggle research and there probably were. Like Herpo created the first known horcrux in Ancient Greece, thats roughly 400 years before Ceasar. being immortal gives you a ton of time to experiment.\\
and if we accept that lack of common sense of wizards being related to the innate randomness of magic then the lack of a scientific method wouldn't be a detriment to magical research and might be a boon.

Add in ghosts that could remain behind and teach new magical researchers, like there's no way a magical researcher hasn't died in an accident and remained behind because he wasn't done with his experiment. there's no way the magical world and muggle world are that similar that after 400 years of pure separation the magicals are just living like muggles from 400 years ago.

I actually don't think an even more separated Muggle and Magical world would be a problem for a reunification fic because as you said, magicals are still humans, so the root of conflicts in both worlds and between them are the same and magic can't fix it in either world.
