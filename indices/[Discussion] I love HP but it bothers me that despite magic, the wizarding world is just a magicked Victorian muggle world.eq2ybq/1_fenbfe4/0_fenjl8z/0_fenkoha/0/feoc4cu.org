  Except that canonically that isn't the case

except OP is arguing that Canon is fundamentally flawed. If magic has been around forever the whole foundation of magical society will be different. EVEN WITH living among muggles for the majority of history and pre-history, bits of magical only culture will form, and will rapidly expand and spread with the official separation with the implementation of the Statue.

Just the fact that in general magicals live longer lives would have drastically changed how magical culture developed and spread. multiply that by the 2000 years from prehistory and history before say 300CE when Christianity rose to prominence in the Roman Empire, and thus the hardcore opposition to *all* magic is spread to large part of the world.

I would imagine that in the 900s Godric, and other magcials would have been better at blending in with muggles as the worlds were tied much closer together and they don't want to scare off the muggles that they need to interact with. Hence he could use a sword and they built with stone and mortar. and maybe he just liked using a sword. Mad Jack Churchill famously fought in WW2 with a claymore and longbow. so just because better stuff is out there, wands/rifles doesnt mean everyone is going to use them.
