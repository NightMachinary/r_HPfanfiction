I don't know why your harping on about gender inequality when that isn't a thing in the wizarding world. Women hold positions of power in the government, teaching positions, even in the Death Eaters there are women, Bellatrix being one of Voldemort's strongest and most loyal followers. Overall what your describing is already seen within the wizarding world.
