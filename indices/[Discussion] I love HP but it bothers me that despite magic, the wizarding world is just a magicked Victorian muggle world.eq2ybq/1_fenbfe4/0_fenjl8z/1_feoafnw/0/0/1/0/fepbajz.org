McGonagall is fairly old by the time she's seen in the books, and no mention of a family either way is made. It's only through Pottermore that we know she /had/ a love, but he was a Muggle, and she broke things off thinking it would never work, and thus never sought another partner.

Umbridge is horrid, and I can't imagine anyone putting up with her long enough to start anything resembling a family. But to each their own.

Amelia lost a lot of family in the war, which would seem to me to make her the biggest candidate for wanting to grow a large family of her own, but like many career driven women, it seems like she might have wanted to put it off until a better time. She's unfortunately killed before that can happen.

Madame Maxine is a half giant like Hagrid, which likely makes any dating or courting exceedingly difficult.

I know nothing of Sprout's home life outside of the school, or any of the other teachers, really. Burbage is only mentioned long enough to kill off, Hooch only shows up for flying lessons and as a referee, Sinistra also pretty much only shows up for Astronomy, Pince and Pomfrey are both also rather older, similar to McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank is a substitute, and Vector is only ever mentioned by name. I don't think she shows up personally in the books ever.

And Bagnold, quite honestly, I didn't even realize was a woman. That character stops being relevant before the book even starts, more or less.

I also wouldn't label any of these women aside from McGonagall and Bones as being particularly powerful. They all seem very average at best.
