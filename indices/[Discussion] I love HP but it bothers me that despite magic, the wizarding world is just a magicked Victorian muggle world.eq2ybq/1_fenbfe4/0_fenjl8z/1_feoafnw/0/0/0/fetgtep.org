  but canonically there's not really a lot of reason for us to see women with children

Do we see a lot of men with children either? I'm thinking of Lucius and Arthur. I'm trying to think of others, am I forgetting some obvious fathers? If we saw more mothers I wonder if people would get upset that there weren't more fathers to make it even.

Would Neville's grandmother be considered a mother for the purposes of this conversation? she is at least a guardian that raises a child and (although flawed) manages to be an interesting character in her own right.
