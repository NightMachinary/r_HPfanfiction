How many adult women do we see that we actually know much about? Keep in mind the frame of reference for most of the story is the trio, one of which is an orphan, one of which has working parents that are muggles, and one of which has one working father and a stay at home mother.

That's not exactly representative of all wizarding culture. Most of the other characters, male or female, that we see during all 7 books are either school aged, or we just don't see much of their private life at all.

I can't speak to outside sources, like I know Rowling has given tons of background information that apparently never made it into the books, but canonically there's not really a lot of reason for us to see women with children.

We do know that Hermione, Ginny, and Luna, all of whom prove themselves capable, all go to eventually have kids. Tonks had a kid and was an auror, and it didn't stop her from fighting in the war.

To my knowledge, we don't know what the familial status is of pretty much the rest of the side characters.
