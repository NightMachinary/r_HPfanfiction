I think it's because all the powerful women I can think of are childless. The families we see the best example of - the Weasleys - are a very traditional family. Ginny isn't allowed to fly because she's a girl, Molly stays home with the kids, Arthur's the breadwinner, Molly doesn't go on missions but just cooks for the order and acts as a housekeeper. Even Molly vs Bellatrix was sexist - JK wanted Bellatrix put down by a loving maternal housewife to contrast the two women and their lifestyle choices.

Obviously Molly chose that life, and was happy with it, but we don't really have any other examples of working mothers apart from cursed child - and that's set today, where it's normal anyway.

(There might be someone really obvious I'm missing. But point is, if you want a career, you apparently don't have kids, for witches.)
