That's where you're wrong though. For example, having magic alone would bring about gender equality for witches and wizards, the way technology has for muggles.

Being able to use magic means witches would be able to greatly reduced the time and effort it takes to take care of a household and children.

Being able to use magic would also mean physical differences are negligent since magical ability is gender-neutral and therefore wizards aren't inherently stronger than witches. As much as it pains me to admit it, physical differences between men and women for us muggles did bring about some of the inequality.

Furthermore, wizards and witches are extremely unlikely to follow sexist traditions brought about by religion, specifically Western Christianity in it's various puritanical forms. In fact is eager they'd do the opposite.
