That would be "Patron". Now, if you want almost pure fluff, it's not for you - my stories generally have happy endings, but the road there can be a little long. On the other hand, I don't consider "Hermione accepts her place as a third-class citizen as long as she is with Harry" a happy ending - evil systems tend to get torn down and replaced with a better system in my stories, and evil people tend to get killed. Divided and Entwined has a typical ending, for example.
