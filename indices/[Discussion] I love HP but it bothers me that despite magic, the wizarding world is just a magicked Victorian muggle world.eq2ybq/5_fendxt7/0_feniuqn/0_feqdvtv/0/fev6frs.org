I actually have read a lot of your work before and I love it. read prologue to a revolution, Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution, Divided and Entwined, Democracy. Tried to read the dark lord never died but goddamit it was too painful.

Which one are you referring to?

I just want to add that I currently mentally cannot handle any stories that aren't almost pure fluff so do give a warning if it's so.
