I've written a story where Wizarding Britain is more like you seem to prefer - far more different from muggle Britain, in parts far more progressive, in other parts more archaic, but magic is used far more than in canon, with enchanted robes being standard - and a status symbol, the more magical the better, including illusions and similar contructs.
