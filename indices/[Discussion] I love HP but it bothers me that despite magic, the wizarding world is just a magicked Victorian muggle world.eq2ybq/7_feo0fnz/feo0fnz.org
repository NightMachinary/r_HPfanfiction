I think that if Rowling had intended for the series to be directed at an adult audience, she'd probably done a lot more regarding world building. But since it's (in the end) meant for children, there really wasn't any point in doing so because it would only confuse the young readers.

She is slowly building up on that world though, but through Fantastic Beasts instead. I hope the 3d movie will show us more about the international relations of wizardkind, even if it is set in the 1920s.

Fortunately there's always us fanfic writers who are ready to apply our own ideas on her limited universe. :)
