linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon)

This fic is not everyone's cup of tea, and there's been some drama over it because of underlying racism and sexism. I try to avoid thinking of that. This fic got me through some hard times, and I can't recommend it enough for those who like slapstick and dark humor.
