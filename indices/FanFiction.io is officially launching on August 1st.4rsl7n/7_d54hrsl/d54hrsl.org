I just signed up and published a story. A few things:\\
* it's weird you don't have any ways to classify your story, how will readers find a story they feel like reading if they can't filter?\\
* I don't like the way the description of the story sits really close to the real story, it almost seems like it's a part of my text. * Also, to be really honest, ads don's usually bother me that much whilst reading. The people that are bothered by them will have installed an ad blocker anyway, so why go through so much trouble to go adfree?\\
Apart from this, I like the site, it looks pretty nice.
