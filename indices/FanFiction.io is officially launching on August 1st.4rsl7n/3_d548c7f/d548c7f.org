A few things I noticed:

- There's no word count when scrolling through stories
- There's no chapter count when scrolling through stories
- No information on main character when scrolling through stories
- When I went to add my fic, there was multiple "Harry Potter" options. They all seemed to default to the same group but it seems to be a bug.
- when copying my chapters into the doc manager, if I don't hit spacebar or enter, it pastes my chapter in reverse, with my last paragraph first and my title at the bottom.
