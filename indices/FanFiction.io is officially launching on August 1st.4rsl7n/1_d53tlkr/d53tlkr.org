Oh! A new fanfiction site!

Some questions:

1) Would the rating system be more detailed compared than fanfiction.net's one?

2) Can this site be browsed through Android?

3) Would it be more... um, (don't know how to write it- controlled perhaps, or filtered?), than AO3?

4) How defined are the search function or when entering in a section? (Show only fanfics with this "rating letter", "time period", "book or movie universe", and more criteria)

5) how are the rules or guidelines about the fanfics' themes? (In a scale from fanfiction.net (restrictive) to AO3 (freer? I think))

Sorry if the questions feels awkward after reading it, English isn't my first language.
