One of my favorite time travel fics is about Hermione going in the past to study Frank and Alice Longbottom in hopes of using her fresh memories of their mannerisms for a new healing procedure. She doesn't intend for things to change, but her temporary presence alters things big and small. One of the best examples of the butterfly effect IMO, I quite enjoyed it
