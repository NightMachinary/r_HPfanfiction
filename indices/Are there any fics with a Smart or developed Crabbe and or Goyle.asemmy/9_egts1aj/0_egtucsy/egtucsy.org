My desire to read about a smart Crabbe or Goyle is really just about me wanting to see how others adjust to encountering a new version of Crabbe and or Goyle. Kind of like the Mirror Mirror episode of Star Trek or Flowers for Algernon.

on having them fleshed out a bit more? Maybe somebody has an interesting take on them. True, they are flat, one dimensional characters in canon, but maybe somebody has written something on them that can make them more interesting.
