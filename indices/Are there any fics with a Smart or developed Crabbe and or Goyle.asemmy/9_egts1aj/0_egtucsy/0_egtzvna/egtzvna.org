At the end of Philosopher's Stone it's noted Neville scrapes by, and that Goyle, surprisingly, passed too. From this I like to imagine that while not bright Crabbe and Goyle might put in some work behind the scenes (if only to not be a disgrace, and/or due to Snape/fathers pressure).

Of course in canon iirc they fail later, but I think anytime a bit of depth can be added to a character it enriches the story. (big dumb mean Dudley, his gang all "big and stupid", Millicent is a hag, Slytherins look like trolls, big dumb mean Crabbe and Goyle... )
