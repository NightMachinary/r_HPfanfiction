I read something once that may have been part of a collection of one shots where Crabbe and Goyle spoke really differently when Draco wasn't around. Can't remember where I found it though.

There's also one drabble I remember where Goyle seems to have been frequently beat up by his dad as a kid in coz his dad was jealous that Goyle was smart. Fast forward a few years where Goyle had a kid named Gillian who got into Ravenclaw. Will try to find that collection of dabbles.

Edit: I seem to have mixed stories up in my head. I did find a story that did have a Gillian Goyle in it here, though it's different from the one I had in mind:
