(typing from a phone, sorry)

It's a coming-of-age ensemble comedy. The overarching plot is explained in the summary:

#+begin_quote
  Armed with spunk and sugar and a blatant disregard for the laws of physics, Hogwarts' resident inventor Bea Chang walks the fine line between genius and mad scientist---especially with her latest extraordinary plan, which Fred-of-little-faith deems "extraordinarily impossible."

  But then it catches the eye of Scorpius Malfoy, budding entrepreneur and heir to magical Britain's largest and shadiest company.

It's more focused on the characters and their friendships, much like the show Community, if you've watched that. There's a lot of small-but-grand scale antics, the kind I always thought would happen in a place like Hogwarts. The fic begins a little crackier than the rest of the novel, as a heads up.
