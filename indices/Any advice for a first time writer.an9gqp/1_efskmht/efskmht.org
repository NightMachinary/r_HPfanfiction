For the love of all things Harry Potter, please, please, whatever you do, try to find a way without bashing or using random Out of Character behavior to justify your ship. You've got to find a good, solid reason why the canon ship isn't working/won't happen.

Nothing irritates me more than seeing a fic make Ron an openly spiteful bigot against all Slytherins or wanna-be tag along, or making Harry and Ginny break up because of Ginny's old celebrity crush on him, making her just a fangirl or a golddigger.

It just doesn't do justice to the original characters, and it's lazy writing, making the whole thing contrived and forced.

Listen, I'm down for some different ships, but not if it's at the cost of other person in the original relationship. If someone doesn't like Hermione/Ron, that's fine, but using the fic as a platform blast Ron just drives me nuts.

There was a fic recommended here a while back. It was a Sirius/Hermione time travel story, and it worked extremely well, all without making Ron a loud, brash bigoted asshole.

In fact, in the fic Hermione went back in time, partially to reclaim the parts of Ron that she fell in love with, as the strain of the war and grief of losing his brother took it's toll on Ron and made him lose his humorous, fun side, as he used all his time and energy to try to keep his family together. He didn't change into someone unlikeable and unlovable. He just changed.

And soon, the circumstances around Hermione changed, and she herself changed, and she still wished all the best for Ron and loved the man that he was, but she also loved Sirius.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that breaking up the original ship shouldn't be some cut-and-dry,"that other person is to blame because they're bad and they should feel bad but they won't feel bad because they're too stupid and dumb" story.

If you're going to have a break up come up with an argument they might have about something, like if it's post Hogwarts, and Harry's an Auror, and he's still obsessed with catching Dark wizards. He could be spending too much time working overtime, or he's getting injured too many times, and Ginny can't bear to see him get hurt over and over, or Harry's gotten too brutal with how he's taking down Dark Wizards because they kept on hurting Innocents or killed one of his friends.

Maybe they just lost their romantic spark along the way. Maybe the Montser in Harry's chest isn't pining for Ginny like it once did, and now they're two people living together and figuring out that they just aren't compatible.

Maybe without the constant threat of a Dark Lord over their heads and teenage hormones going wild, they realize it just wasn't meant to be.

You could even go the magic sinister route with that, and say that the remnants of Tom Riddle's soul that was latched onto Harry recognized Ginny as prey, or manipulatable, and influenced Harry to become attracted to her in the first place, and now that the Horcrux is gone, Harry's attraction to her receded somewhat as well.

Or it could be the Horcrux has the opposite effect. . Ginny had a crush on Harry, and when she wrote to Tom she she might have saw what she wanted from Harry in Tom in the Diary, and soon she began to associated Harry with Tom and Tom with Harry, and after her first year, she's still utterly terrified by Tom and has night terrors, and now she can't find comfort in Harry's arms, because she unconsciously feels Tom's presence in Harry because of the Horcrux or the remnants of the Horcrux.

Anything better than making her a slut or golddigger just for the sake of another ship.
