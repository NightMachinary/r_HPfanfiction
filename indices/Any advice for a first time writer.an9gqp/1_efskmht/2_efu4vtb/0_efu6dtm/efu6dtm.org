I had to look it up, but this is it. Lots of great characterization for the Marauders in there as well, and the author had a really clever method for doing that characterization. Honestly, this was one of the more enjoyable HPfanfics that I read last year, and I'm usually not one to deviate from canon ships. Enjoy.
