Ahahaha thank you for helping me not stray the path of bashing and being lazy about it D:

I'm going to keep that in mind. My story might end up longer and/or might take me longer to write because now I feel like I have to visualize and put myself in their shoes. I just hope by the end of it I find a path where my style suits the characters enough to justify the changes and new plot I'll be making. Hahaha I think its blessing always because there are these amazing characters that I'll never get to imagine if it werent for the original book. I hope I don't botch it too hard hahaha.

Thanks once again! I scrapped the beginning of my fic now in order to make way for a cleaner break from the two. :)
