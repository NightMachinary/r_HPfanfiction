Awesome! I feel like I'm making the fanfic community better already.

Just remember that in whatever story you tell, whether it's fanfiction or original, every character is a person. They're not just a plot device or a scapegoat for you to use. They may serve that purpose in a story, and it's important to think about their purpose in the story, but ultimately, they are people who have their own agenda, their own experiences, their own thoughts and feelings and aspirations that defines who they are and what they do. They have a reason for doing things even if it's not something they consciously think about. Like Ron getting in fights with Slytherins; it almost always happens in canon because those Slytherins insulted Ron's friends or family, and Ron's loyalty to those he cares about are second to none.

If you establish to yourself who that character is, and why they are doing what they're doing, then you'll become a better writer for it. No matter how complex or simple your plot may be, as long as you get the characters right and can build upon what you write about them, it can be a compelling story. Writing fanfiction is both a blessing and a curse in this regard, since you have the characters established already, but need a valid reason to deviate that character's arc away from canon, all while still keeping it close to the character already established, which can be hard to do.

Anyways, I'm glad I was able to help you brainstorm a bit. Good luck with the fic!
