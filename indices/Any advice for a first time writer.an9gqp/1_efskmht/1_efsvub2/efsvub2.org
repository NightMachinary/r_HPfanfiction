This absolutely amazing and just the push I needed to help me launch my story. I've been racking my brain for ways to justify a new relationship and having read so many fics that pushed other characters to the side to make it work, I'm desperate to not do the same thing. It just doesn't feel right to me and I feel like I might as well have created new characters. That being said I'll make sure I won't trash any of the characters. I like your ideas about how to break up harry/ginny by the way! They're all plausible and I think will be better than having Ginny do Harry bad in my mind ahaha. Thank you so much for this! I'll do my best to steer away from any character bashing.
