Outlines are by no means required but it's so easy to write yourself into a corner that you can't get out of.

George RR Martin is pretty famous for being a writer who just sorts of writes and sees where the characters take him, and look how that's turned out for him. A Song of Ice and Fire may well never be finished.

So yeah, outlines are in general recommended, especially for your first time, but if you just feel the spark and want to get some words down on paper then go for it!
