Didn't Ginny date only two blokes before Harry, and she never overlapped or cheated on either of them? I don't buy the slut!Ginny trope.

Anyway, do you want your story to be about their separation, or do you simply want to write Harry post Hogwarts in a relationship with someone else? I think it's safe to just ignore the epilogue or just make it clear that they never got back together if your goal is to have Harry available to date someone else.

Adding something like "Canon compliant up to the epilogue" or "AU post Hogwarts; epilogue never happened" can save you a lot of trouble trying to break H/G apart and just let you jump into the story you want to tell. Of course, if you do want to write a story about a marriage falling apart then go for it.

Other than that, I would personally recommend trying to write a one-shot first, and if/when you do go for a longer story, put together some sort of outline first. It doesn't have to be super detailed, but even a vague chain of events can help get things line up in your head.
