Thank you! I'm trying to tune down my ideas and jotting them all down now so that I don't put too much on one story. I'm thinking of starting slow and slowly build it up. I'll make sure to not throw too much in it to avoid ruining it ahaha.

I'm brushing up on my grammar and spelling ahahaha. I've never been the best grammar student but my spelling's pretty okay and it does irk me as well whenever I see fics that have misspelled things. Even though my brain corrects it, I still wish it was bit more polished so I'm hoping I wont make the same mistake.

Thank you! I'm trying to plan out my story now as we speak because after everyone's advice I have a feeling I will run out of things to say in the middle and forget how and where I want to go. Thank you again for all your advice! Hope you stumble in my work sometime in the future! :D
