I'm not a writer myself, but some advice based on bad fics I've read is to limit your ideas. These will be your first steps into fanfictions and you are probably brimming with ideas that are cool. And while original storylines are very much appreciated they very quickly end up convoluted. I much rather have one or two ideas worked out to a satisfying conclusion than ten different ideas all ending up half finished.

Second advice I'd give you is to check your grammar and spelling. Writing in an interesting way is not a talent that is given to everybody, and even those that do it well have to work hard at it. However proper grammar and spelling is far less difficult to achieve. Authors constantly misspelling things like canon names (which are only a google search away) can really ruin my reading experience.

Third advice is to roughly plan out your stories. It can be cool to just start writing chapters as they come to you, but after the initial plot bunny runs out the quality usually plummets. I'm of the opinion that in general, most fanfic authors are very adept at writing from a prompt, but once that prompt is done and the story isn't finished you can see the struggles. By roughly planning the direction you want the story to go in you have some more guidance while writing.
