Start of writing what you feel like at the moment. Helps to prevent burnout. Keep it off FFN for the time being if you're just trying to find your style and you're unsure what you want to stick with (unless they're one/two shots, in which case they're good for documenting your progress).

If something really lights a fire under you, try to have a general idea what you want the story to be about from start to finish and some of the major themes. Something I like to do, especially when I'm just starting a new story that will be long, is to write everything I feel like for the first chapter. Then, when I'm editing it I cut out like 10-ish% of what I've written, especially if the chapter is 4K words or more. This forces me to prioritize what really matters to the content and motivates me to learn how to write more concisely in general.

A big thing most people fail at in writing is just getting to the point. As someone who reads a ton of fanfic from a number of fandoms, it can be so annoying to see clear dancing around for the sake of padding or else because the author wasn't sure how they wanted to write their way to the end. A nice trim makes so many problems less likely to happen.
