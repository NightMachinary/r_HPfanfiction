I'm planning on keeping the story that I'm planning off the sites first until I'm 100% sure I like it. I will try to do one shots or smaller fics in between to keep myself motivated and to listen to advises that people may have about my writing. :D

I'll try your advice as well and just keep on writing ahahaha. I think I'm going to be suffering from the "getting to the point" mistake a lot and I'm not sure how I can avoid it yet at this point.
