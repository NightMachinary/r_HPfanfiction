If you do, wait and go back after a long while, and often inspiration arrives, and while you remind yourself what it was you were writing, you can polish as you go.

First drafts are always terrible, so ideally, keep the first draft, finish the story, then fix and polish and publish the second. Thus, if you hit a dead end, no readers are left hanging, and if you decide foreshadowing is needed for a chapter near the end, you can go and stick it right in there and look really clever.
