Not really.

Lily's hair is consistently described as dark red and her eyes are emerald green.

Ginny, like all the Weasleys, has flaming red hair. In short, her hair is lighter and brighter. If anything, she's a carrot-top.

Ginny's also consistently described as short and small. At first, this may just be because she's the youngest of the Weasleys but it continues up into /Order of the Phoenix/ when Bellatrix taunts Harry about the Death Eaters torturing "the little girl," (despite Luna and Hermione being present) and /Half-Blood Prince,/ where a vendor offers a medallion to Molly to "[her] little girl" and when Ginny comforts Harry after the battle "a much smaller and warmer hand enclosed his."

We're never given much attention to Lily's height but given that she's never described as much shorter than Severus or James whenever we get a glimpse of them as teenagers, we can reasonably assume she's at least of average height, if not slightly tall.

Then there's their personalities. Ginny takes after Fred and George in appreciating a practical joke and defying authority--though Umbridge being Umbridge, the scale may not be entirely fair. Lily despises the pranks the Marauders and pseudo-Death Eaters pull alike, though she does note that the Marauders don't use Dark Magic.

Ginny is also of a much quicker temper--when she sees someone she cares about get picked on, she's much quicker to intervene and she's not afraid to fight back. She has a well-earned reputation for the Bat-Bogey Hex. Lily threatens to intervene when James attacks Severus, but we don't see her do so.

So, in short Lily Evans and Ginny Weasley no more resemble each other than, say, Seamus Finnigan and Draco Malfoy, as they both have blonde hair in the books.
