I see no reason why Ginny should look like Lily. It's a weird fanon trope and method for people to say Ginny is wrong for Harry.

Ginny doesn't share Lily's most defining feature--the green eyes--and yes, while she is redhead, people with red hair are perfectly capable of looking different.

And anyway, my mom's a brunette. Is it creepy if I date brunettes? Hair color is just a small part of how someone looks.
