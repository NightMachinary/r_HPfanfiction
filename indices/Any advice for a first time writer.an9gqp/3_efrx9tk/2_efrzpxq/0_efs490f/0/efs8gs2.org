The advice I gave is for my writing style, so you may not write for hours straight like I do, and you may not need a time limit. I do encourage you, however, to set yourself â€˜work/school' and â€˜sleep' times. Make notes in your notebook during these times, by all means, but I would err away from getting out your computer or opening the doc during these times. I used to write during classes in school. I know. The paranoia will get you and you'll learn to read 0.3pt. /shudder/

For your word count, it is whatever you feel comfortable and confident in doing without compromising on quality either way. The pace of your story over-all will also have a bearing on your chapter length; I find shorter chapters lend themselves to a fast-paced story, or portion of the story, while long or multi-part chapters are for slower stories, or slower parts of a story.

I got lucky with my editor, really. It was a chance meeting on whisper and we've never actually met - as I said, he's British, I'm Australian. My real life friends know I write, and they hear about major achievements, but I keep it otherwise separate from them. This is partly because only about 3 out of the group know about my life in BDSM. The editing loop is terrifying and really hard to get out of, hence why I was eager to warn you about it. Luckily, I've never fallen too deeply into it. My editor and I compliment each other in personality and writing style, but that doesn't mean we only praise each other's writing. Having an editor will be hard. You must set boundaries with them, and let them know when they're being too harsh. Don't be afraid to say no to them, just be aware that they may ask you why you've done this, why you want to keep that. If your first editor, even your second, third and so on, can't give constructive criticism without being rude and mean, ditch them and look for another. An editor is there to help you improve your work, pick out mistakes and fine-tune the product, not to bring you down, and you need to be aware of this and make sure you don't let them do so.

I do tend to write a lot when I'm giving writing advice because I want to thoroughly cover every base, although I try not to go on too much because I don't want to bore you. Writing a lot of smaller things first is good. Bound is not my first fanfic, but it or it's sequels may well be my last. I started when I was 14 and I was BAD. I didn't write for HP, I wrote for a cult-like musician-centred fanfiction site and I never finished a story. They were lewd and poorly written, pumped out at 1,000 word chapters, one or two a day. I still have those, but I will likely never go back to them. What I'm saying is, all of us who write, we do it to get the story out of our heads, though not necessarily out there for others to read. Take your time, learn your craft, and figure out your style. I started with first person, and within that story, I had moved to third person, and there I have stayed. Your one-shots are your â€˜back-story', your writing history. That said, I always started off being in it for the long game, then fizzled. You have to find the story for you, the one that won't fizzle, and that can be a long journey. You can do something with those fizzled stories if you like, but bear in mind how disappointing it can be to get into a story, then it ends suddenly with the author rushing to tie off loose ends and not doing a great job. You're better off taking scenes, or bits and pieces from that story and turning them into one-shots, or letting them feed into your main work.

I've written 10 pages again ðŸ™„ Anyway, thank you, I will take care (once I get rid of this stupid flu) and happy writing, always.

P.S: As for my story, you may or may not have seen it here, depending on your interests, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13457028/chapters/30847965][this]] is the direct link, and I will also link the bot below. My one shot isn't on AO3, but I go by the same name on Wattpad, so you can look me up there if you do wanna read it. One day, I'll get off my butt and move it over. Maybe.
