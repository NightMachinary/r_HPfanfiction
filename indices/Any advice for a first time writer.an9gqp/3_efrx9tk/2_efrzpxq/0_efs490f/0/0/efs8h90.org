  When Hermione's magic pulls her away from her friends and Hogsmeade village to the top of a hill, the decision she makes will open her eyes, shining a new light on the world around her - a very hot light. With a lot of learning and some extra homework, she will learn that some people are FAR more than they seem. She may even find love in an unexpected place. **Slow-ish Updates** Set in Hermione's 6th year, beginning the weekend after her birthday. She is 18 at the commencement of this story. Just as you should be if you're reading it
