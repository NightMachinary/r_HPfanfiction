Well, it looks like you've got everything sorted, or you're aware of all the important stuff I can think of. To answer your question, my current editor was my second. I had a go with someone over on ffn and that just didn't work out. They didn't want to do the work and they were a poor critique. I intend to keep my current editor because he is brilliant. I really hit the jackpot with him. Good luck in your editor search. Never be afraid to say no, or ask why. As for Bound, it is NOT everyone's cup of tea. It's a story written mostly for me, so it's for a very specific type of audience. I do try to educate through my writing, though, unlike some other authors (E.L. James springs to mind..) If you do end up enjoying it, don't forget to leave me a comment to let me know you're there, but don't feel pressured to read it if you don't like it.

Anyway, I'm sort of getting better. I have to get up for work now, so I'll be off. Have a good one!
