That is true, about my editor. And it's no worries. I think it's our duty for those of us who are more experienced to try and help the inexperienced. I'd rather give you pointers on how to be the best you can be, than tear you down before you've even really started. I suppose it is always good to expand your horizons, so I hope you enjoy reading and writing. Don't worry if you flop, it's not for everyone. If you really want to do it, persist, but you should be able to recognise if the writing side of things is not for you and there's no shame in leaving it. All the best!
