Ahaha, I'm so happy I posted. It definitely helps my train of thoughts now. That feels bad. But if you didn't experience the bad first editor then you wouldn't have met the awesome second one! Ahahaha. I'll do my best to find a good one as well. I'm going to read it anyways to expand my horizons I guess. I'll be sure to leave a comment once I finish reading! :) Thanks for all your help. Means a lot.
