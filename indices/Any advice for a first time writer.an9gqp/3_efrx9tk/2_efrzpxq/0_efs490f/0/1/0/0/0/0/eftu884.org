I'm glad there's people like you that like to look out for new ones! I've always admired people that are able to convey exactly what they want in this form of literature and I guess that's what made me finally get up and want to start writing (apart from my current obsession with the ship and lacking stories to fulfill my needs ahahaha). I don't really mind if I flop or anything, this is just for myself and I'm only going to publish it to share and not really to fulfill anyone's idea of how they want a story to turn out. Although I wouldn't mind if someone went on to tell me how to improve points in my writing. I think it'll be cool. Thanks again. Really enjoyed this conversation! Hope I get to talk to you again sometime in the future! :D Take care!
