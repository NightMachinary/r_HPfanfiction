I'll take the advice of setting time for writing and sleeping and work ahaha. I'm finally going to be able to use all the notebooks I bought for some writing that I never got around to. Hopefully I'll actually manage to write down several ideas and not get too bored.

Okay, I'll keep the word count quality in mind. I'm going to have to figure how I do things and hopefully I'll get to adjust chapters based on what my story needs.

That actually sounds fantastic and extremely lucky! I'm half wishing I meet/befriend a British person I can personally ask about all things Brit because frankly I think it'll be hard for me to write about new locations, or behaviors or language without committing errors. I can only read so much about it. I'm glad you found an editor that compliments you! Is this editor first one or did you also look for new ones along the way to finding this one? I'm grateful for all the advice about editing. I've never thought about that part of the writing but I'm going to make it a priority to not be stuck in a loop and find an editor to compliment my style as well and give me them critiques. Ahaha.

Its okay, I don't actually mind all these advise. It doesn't bore me at all. It took me days to think about submitting a post here because I get anxious and feel like I won't get any substantial responses at all but here you are giving me crucial ones and rest assured I'm taking good note of it. I'm going to read Bound! I can't say I've looked for things like this because I mostly read for my ships but I will give this a shot because you wrote it! :) Thank you for giving me all these advice to help me not fizzle out. I'm hoping this time I won't run away from trying to write again.

Like I said I appreciate the advice! You can make it 10 pages and I'd still read it HAHA. Oh get well soon! :) Drink lots of water and rest.

Its currently tabbed on my browser. I'll get to it don't worry. A million thanks!
