I"m currently listening to classical music mostly and some gaming soundtracks particularly the FFXV piano collection. It just evokes so much emotion from me. I'll try to look for more things to listen to! :) Is it better to set a time limit for myself whenever I'm writing? I usually have my word document open and I jump into writing even just a few sentences whenever my attention is on it. I've never been a person that can keep doing something for 2 hours straight but I think I can do it for this assuming I have enough motivation ahaha.

I really like your advice about the chapter and word count. I'll keep that in mind. I think its practical and thats a part that I'm unsure with. Right now I just hit 4k words on a single chapter but I'm highlighting a bunch of stuff that I want to edit out or change and I'm not sure if its healthy for me to write 4k words every chapter. I'll set a upper and lower limit for myself when I eventually find out if I can maintain the quality of longer chapters.

Okay, I guess I'll have to stop being a lurker and find online friends to help edit. I'm not comfortable with telling any of my actual friends that I want to write because I'd like to keep this part of my life separate I guess. That kind of scared me though (being in a never ending loop of editing) ahahaha and I don't think I'd want that. You're lucky you found someone that compliments(?) and edits your writing! Don't worry I won't ever post anything unedited. I don't think I'll ever allow myself to open anything off the internet if I do that ahaha.

Don't worry I appreciate it! Wow. You write a lot! That's really encouraging and I will keep all those in mind. I tend to have so many ideas I never know where to start but it could be better to write smaller things first that could diverge somewhere in the future when I decide its time to write big? I'd like to write a big story one day. It doesnt even have to be the coolest thing. I just want to get it out there and get it out of my head.

Thanks for all the advice! I appreciate it all. Its gonna help alot. Take care as well.

P.S. Not sure if I've read your work yet (I'm not too active here and I'm not very interactive with people etc etc but hopefully you can link me your works/profile so I can read! ahahaha thanks again!)
