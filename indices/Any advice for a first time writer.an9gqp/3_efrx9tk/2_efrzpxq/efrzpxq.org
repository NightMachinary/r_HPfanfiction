Also, find something that gets you in the groove to write, then use it every time you write. It can be music, a tv show, silence, white noise, anything, really. I use a specific set of live concerts, the main one being about 2 hours long. You can eventually use this when you're not really in the mood to write (this does not mean forcing yourself when you're unwell) to help you get in the mood. You can also use it to limit your time so you don't disrupt your sleep too much, and so you don't get carried away going in a direction that you will look back and go, ‘This is really not what I wanted it to turn out like.' Stopping for the day is good. I, for example, use the end of a specific concert, so if I feel like I'm going to need more time, I'll start one or two back in the playlist. If I go over my set limit, I will carefully read and evaluate what I'm writing, then decide whether to continue (and set a second, absolute last limit.)

I would also recommend setting your minimum chapter length, and also a maximum chapter length. This way, you have manageable goals and can make sure you're giving your (eventual) readers the best quality product you can. If your chapter goes over significantly, enough to form, or almost form, two chapters, then split it and reread. Often, you'll find the ‘under' chapter is lacking some detail where it could really use it. Other times, you'll find yourself rambling on about something that, while interesting, is not relevant enough to have so many words dedicated to it. Always write the chapter first, then split it and flesh out, or edit down. Don't stress too much about length. Personally, my minimum chapter preference is 2,500 words. This is the minimum to keep the pace of the story that I'm trying to achieve, and my average maximum is 3,500, which is roughly what my chapter lengths are now that the story has become more intense and busy. My absolute upper limit, with no exceptions if it can be helped, is 4,000 words.

The next step is to get an editor. I have a lovely British editor, who checks me on my Australianisms and who has a similar, but slightly different, writing style. He is also a he and I am also a she. In the context of my particular story, it also comes in handy that he is older (not significantly) and I am younger and that he is a Dom type and I am a sub type (I am the more experienced of us both in that area.) I will just mention that I was about 18 when I met him online and he was in his 20s. You don't have to, but we both edit and fact-check for each other as we are both active (ish, in his case) writers and it works well for us. If you can't, or don't want to, get an editor, I suggest you write your story without looking back too much, then leave it a few months to a year+ and edit once or twice, rinse and repeat. That last was a suggestion from either Andy Griffiths or Kate Forsyth. Can't remember which exactly. Or maybe Richard Harland. I don't know. Anyway, you may edit it up a couple of times on your own, then decide to bring in an editor of some kind, or you may edit once or twice and find it ready to publish. The problem with the ‘no editor' route is you can't really publish chapter-by-chapter as you write. If you do choose to write, edit and publish chapter-by-chapter, you do seriously risk getting caught in eternal editing, where you will over-edit, never write any new content, and never publish past that point. I know I'm prone to this, which is why my editor, great help that he is, will often say, “It's done. Time for you to comb through for any grammatical, spelling, etc. errors that we might have missed and send it out.” At which point I do just that. But, it really is up to you how you go about it. Just never publish anything in-edited. Please, for the love of my brain cells and yours.

This turned out longer than I expected. I just want to finally say, I have over 100,000 words to my name on my sole work. I will, occasionally, write spin-offs of it, playing with scenarios in the distant future and toying with the dynamic of certain characters, but I don't allow these to become more than 3 chapter works. In fact, the one I do have published became 3-4 chapters and I aced everything beyond the first. I had several false starts, I think 2 in total that I actually wrote content for, and I still have that content, but as I got further and further in, my ideas changed and suddenly these initial ideas became more-or-less part of a bigger story. There was a backstory that had to be told first, but now it didn't start until late 1996; suddenly a side-character, occasional play partner, was part of the full-time relationship, taking it from a D/s dynamic to a complex and interesting D/D/s with more to it than meets the eye. I still have all the unused, unedited chapters from those two major false starts, I even have the notebook I used for one of them, and I refer to them for scenes that I want to use and for ideas that I don't want to let go. So think about your multiple ideas, because maybe they're all part of a bigger story, and believe me, the bigger story is so worth the effort of writing.

That got away from me again. Enjoy writing, have fun, and take care. -Silver
