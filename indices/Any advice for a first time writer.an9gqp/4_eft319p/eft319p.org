Write and re write as many times as you can.

I abandoned two fics before I published my first, very sweet, little thing I did for a friend, so it was not a serious effort, but my second one, I was determined to have a good time and that is important- writing for fun SHOULD be fun!

So, yes,I started with a small fic and then, I set myself a challenge to keep me going: daily updates. Nowadays I look down at my around 2000 words posts, but it was importnat to get a flow and because the ship I was writing was a niche, I had constant support in form of reviews, kudos etc, so it was very inspiring.

​

My practical advices:

1. start small, one shots of ficlets are great places to start;
2. do not overdo it with writer notes : keep it simple and direct, if you feel the need to clarify something...you have to trust the audience to come to their own conclusions and, if not clear in the text, the beuaty of a fanfic is that you can always re write. (better re work your text than to have to explain it with a note.)
3. stay aware of your expectations and of your readers: if you are writing but are not, in your opinion, receiving as many reviews or kudos as you thought you should, keep going. Remember that most readers do not leave reviews. Also, if your summary is selling a romance, but you are writing am action comedy, you are bound to hear some discontent. So do not promise something just because you think it will bring readers and then not do it for whatever reason.
4. try to stick for an update schedule: this should keep you and your readers motivated with the story. Trust me, once you miss a schedule and keep pushing it forward, is quite hard to get back on the horse.
5. have fun.

As for breaking up Harry and Ginny- you can either add an unexpected element to justify the departure from Canon that would fit their personalities ( I don´t know, like Harry deciding that he should accept a mission last minute and missing one of Ginny´s games? Then they realize they are not each other´s priorities at that moment in time?) or you can simply have them on a break due to their schedules and having gone somewhat apart, break up amicabily?
