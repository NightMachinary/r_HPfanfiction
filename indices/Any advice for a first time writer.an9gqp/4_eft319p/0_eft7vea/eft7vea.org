I'm going to keep writing! :)

Why did you abandon the two fics? I'm glad you found something you liked to write about. Right now I'm having fun writing about the ship I like so I'm taking note of every little idea that comes into my head. I just wish I started sooner hahaha but thank you for reminding me that it should be fun for my part :D

I'm going to try and do away with writer's note because frankly I don't read those myself whenever I read and I only generally look back on it when I feel like I'm missing something. Hopefully I won't need it.

As for reviews, I'm not really expecting anything since I probably won't even bother to share my work. I'd be glad to share anything for anyone willing to read it ahahaha. This is just so I can satisfy my need for a story that revolves my favorite characters ahaha.

I'll try to get a schedule for myself so I don't feel lazy. I have a feeling I'll get lazy if I do miss it so thanks for that.

Hmm, that is actually very likely as well. I might consider using that for my story! I think its a realistic view and it doesn't paint either of them in a bad picture which is great.

Thank you so much for all your inputs and advice. I appreciate it :D
