You should never have to explicitly explain something in a story. It breaks the flow. Just drop us enough breadcrumbs and we'll follow. When you write Harry's POV you're telling us Harry's thoughts on stuff, Harry's feelings and showing us the rest. Harry doesn't have to be objective. Harry talking about Dudley being a pig in a wig isn't. You can just have Harry not want to talk about it. To avoid the bad feelings. Have Harry and Ginny split as an event in the past with no details just some negative feelings. The reader can fill in the details themselves.
