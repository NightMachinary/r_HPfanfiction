Thank you for that advice. Its wonderful. I've been wondering just how much I should spoon feed through my writing but I guess I'll just have to trust the reading process. I haven't explored writing in someone's POV yet but I'll keep that in mind. I'll also find a way to keep a Harry and Ginny split as realistic as possible! Thank you so much for your help!
