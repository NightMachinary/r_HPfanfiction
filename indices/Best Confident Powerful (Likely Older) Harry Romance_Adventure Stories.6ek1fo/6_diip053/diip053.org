off the top of my head I can think of this one by Athy linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/439865/chapters/749908]])

the only problems I guess could be that it's unfinished and hp/lv slash, but those parts are easily skipped/skimmed and the romance doesn't drive the story and is only regularly present in the later chapters (as long as you're chill with reading that). harry is definitely mature and powerful, knows what he's doing, and the politics and mechanics of magic are explored incredibly well and they are what drive the story most. there's also a tag for Dumbledore bashing but it's not at all outlandish or cliched and quite well justified within the story. I realise you asked this question about a week ago now but I hope this was helpful, if limited :)
