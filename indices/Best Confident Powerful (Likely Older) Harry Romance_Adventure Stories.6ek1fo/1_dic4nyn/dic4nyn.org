linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh), but it doesn't have that much adventure

linkffn(Browncoat, green eyes by nonjon), but it is a crossover

linkffn(Wizard from Earth), but it only has a /relatively/ powerful Harry. (Pretty much exact) same premise as long journey home.

linkffn(A black comedy by nonjon), but it's more of a crack story - it has a lot of action though.
