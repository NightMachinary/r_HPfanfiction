Fair enough, although I will say that I said "while they don't have to follow cannon, I am not looking for anything too crazy or crossovers or the like."

I dont mind if they sort of follow aspects of cannon (Harry has to kill Voldemort, Dumbledore tries manipulating, Political scene is a bit of a mess... and so on). But obviously the main thing was a different Harry. One whos powerful (political/magical), confident, and isn't going to be pushed around, and is going to chart his own path.

As for examples, well to be honest I have not read anything recently that would be a good example, and the last "confident" Harry story I read was a bit different than what I was looking for (It was "The Ilvermorney Champion" i believe).

Again, I appreciate the suggestions and attempts, and it sounds like what I was looking for sadly is not super common.
