Because powerful and confident outside edgy!indy!Harry is rare - especially if you want a different story than seven years of canon repeated.

That is why I recommended every single story with a big "But".

linkffn(Magics of the Arcane) is also there along with linkffn(By the devining light) - but they too don't. If I get any more ideas, I can add them.

However, the other recommendations by everone else in this thread also have similar problems. Hope by jaconais for example, has a confident Harry, sure, but there is little adventure and every problem is solved within twelve seconds, and the romance is of the forced kind (I don't wanna spoil it for you what exactly happened, and it's still a definitly readable story that fits your request!). Harry's power is important for like two scenes.

In short, these are all stories that I know that are

- well-written
- Do have a story outside of canon-rehash #3244737 - because it sounded like you don't want that
- Have a powerful Harry
- Have a confident Harry

I mean maybe you wanted something different, but you didn't even give one example of what you actually want. :)
