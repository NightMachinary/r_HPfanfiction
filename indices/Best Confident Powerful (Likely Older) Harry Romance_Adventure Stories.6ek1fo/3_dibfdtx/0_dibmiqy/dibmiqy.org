Ok so I know very little about the Dresden files, but isnt Lady Summer's real name Lily? If so that's hilarious, regardless of if its a coincidence or not.

Also, I don't mean to doubt you, but I have come across other Dresden file crossover recommendations from people saying the exact same thing (that you don't need to know the series to understand). More often then not from my experience trying to read them... that's not true and not knowing the Dresden Files really hurts the story if you are reading it.
