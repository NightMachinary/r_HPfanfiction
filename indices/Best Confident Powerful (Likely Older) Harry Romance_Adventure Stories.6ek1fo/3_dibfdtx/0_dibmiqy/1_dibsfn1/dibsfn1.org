I can't speak for what your experience will be, but personally I read this crossover before I read any of the Dresden Files, and was able to enjoy it and understand it quite well. I'd definitely recommend this fic, it's one of my absolute favorites, and it's what made me get around to reading the Dresden Files in the first place.
