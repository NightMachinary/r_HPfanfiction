I think you might be interested in [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]], which is Harry/Gabrielle, features a ludicrously powerful Harry who really doesn't enjoy being manipulated. It suffers, of course, from the same thing most powerful!Harry fics do- as much conflict as a wet paper bag- and a few more problems depending on your feelings about the ship, but it's quite well written and the plot is surprisingly interesting...well, until the end.
