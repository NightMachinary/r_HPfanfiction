I would be shocked if you found any non one-shots that are not just Harry/Fleur or Harry/Gabriel in this style.

I have long requested Harry fics where he attends either Durmstrang or Beauxbatons OR fics with Harry paired with girls from those schools and there seem to be almost none of either. For whatever reason basically no authors have really tried branching out beyond Hogwarts as a school other than ones that are mentioned in passing or just blips in a journey, and none that I have seen have tried pairing Harry with anyone other than Fleur or Gabrielle when it comes to different schools. Likely because beyond those 2, you basically have to completely create a character from the ground up and it would be easier to just do an OC at Hogwarts.

I wish you luck, and I certainly will continue to keep my eyes open.
