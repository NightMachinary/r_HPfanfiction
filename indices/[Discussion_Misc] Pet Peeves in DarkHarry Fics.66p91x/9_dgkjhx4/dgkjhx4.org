I hate that Harry goes to Hogwarts, because he always finds some bullshit place with extremely rare books and shit. It would be way more cooler if he went to a different school, because then you can actually believe that he might find one of those books. But Hogwarts? No. I can accept finding some basic Dark Arts books in Durmstrang, but definitely not in Hogwarts. I want a Dark!Harry fic where instead of Voldemort being his mentor it's Dark!Dumbledore, and Dark!Dumbledore doesn't have control of everything. Back to my original point, Dumbledore might have some Dark Arts books hidden in his office, but I doubt you can just find whatever book you want in the RoR.
