Kind of yes and kind of no. While I do acknowledge that it is how you use magic that matters in the end, and the classification of some things as dark or light or whatever else probably is caused by bureaucracy rather than anything sensible, in the stories this is about the excuse that the unforgivables were used for something else in the past and had oh-so-great medical or whatever uses is just nonsense and this is what matters. The Killing Curse requires the intent to /murder/, the Cruciatus Curse the intent to /torture/, the Imperius Curse the intent to /enslave/; if anyone manages to cast the Cruciatus curse on a person's heart “to prevent heart failure”, then the first question asked should be “what the fjord is wrong with that medic?” because they just demonstrated that they somehow had the intent to torture someone, and quite likely the person who was dying.

People who use those kinds of excuses do it only because they forget about those casting requirements. Don't forget about them and it becomes nigh-impossible to use the unforgivables to justify anything. Not to mention that there is at least one set of two spells, one of which is a charm and one of which is a curse and thus dark, where the basic effect is the same but the latter is classified differently because it has a secondary effect that is definitely there just to cause more harm; the spells in question are Diffindo and Sectumsempra, the latter of which leaves cursed wounds that cannot be healed, and that serves as a demonstration that at least in some cases there is no need to reach for what is classified as dark magic unless you want those secondary effects to happen. Certainly, dark magic is probably more effective in combat so I can see using pragmatism as a way of justifying its use, but going “oh, the Cruciatus has oh-so-great medical uses” is not pragmatism, it's just bullshit.
