"For the Love of Magic", it is a fic that shows a Harry that dabbles with what is termed as dark magic. To the point of even willingly sacrificing people just to make a dagger or test some anti-wolfsbane potion thing. (not spoiling too much).

It starts off pretty AU with Harry being abandoned by the Dursleys and thus ending up having a completely different childhood. Beware though, it has a lot of lemons, so if that's not your cup of tea then do not read it.

As for a completely Dark!Harry fic: I recently finished one where Harry is raised by Voldemort, under the alias of Harish Blake (or something along the lines of that).

"The Power of Potters": while a mid-rating fanfic, imo ,it does show us a Dumbledore that's at least portrayed as selfish, if not a bit evil and selfcentered. I didn't get the vibe that he is made out to be the grand mastermind of evil, but he does play an antagonistical role, although he has helped a bit along the process.
