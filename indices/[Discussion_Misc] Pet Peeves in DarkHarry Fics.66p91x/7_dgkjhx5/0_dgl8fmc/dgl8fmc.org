My understanding is that Hogwarts Library actually has books on Dark Arts, in the Restricted Section, which can be accessed without restriction by NEWT students. (They might even have unrestricted books on jinxes and such.) In fact, IIRC, books on horcruxes were to be found there, until Dumbledore removed them. Hogwarts doesn't teach Dark Arts as such (except for the year of Voldemort's reign), but DADA involves seeing enough of them to be able to cast Dark Curses, that's for sure. (Harry learning Cruciatus and Imperius is one example of a student picking up Dark Arts from Hogwarts materials; Hermione's Parchment Jinx may have been another, since it resisted reversal by professional healers.)

This is getting into headcanon territory, but I think that the difference between the Durmstrang's approach and the Hogwarts's approach is that Durmstrang actually has students practice Dark Curses, learning Dark Arts under supervision, which Hogwarts does not, so students have to learn on their own if they want to, or be taught by their own families, like Malfoys and Blacks. This is important, because Dark Arts are inherently dangerous to learn without supervision --- even more so than non-Dark magic.
