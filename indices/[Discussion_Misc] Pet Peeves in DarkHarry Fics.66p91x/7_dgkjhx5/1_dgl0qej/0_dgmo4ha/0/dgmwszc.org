It has never been clearly stated, but the clues all point to it being a dark item:

First of all if they were legal no one would bother with the floo network. Which would a snob wizard prefer? Going somewhere through a fireplace and ending up covered in shoot or entering a simple cabinet?

Second: the fact that there is one in Borgin & Burke's, while not being an outright declaration of such items being dark, combined with the fact that no one else has them can only mean two things:

1-They ARE illegal or 2-They are not usefull....and we know they are usefull

After all (that's point 3) they can even bypass the protections of hogwarts, as they for example allow one to apparate inside the grounds of hogwarts, something that the school's protections do not allow.

Of course since a lot of the wizarding population did use them during the first wizarding war we can conclude that:

A)They are a legal grey area

B)They were classified as illegal sometime after the first wizarding war

OR

C) They are not useful (something we have already ruled out)
