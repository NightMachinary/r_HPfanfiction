Nothing you said follows.

  First of all if they were legal no one would bother with the floo network. Which would a snob wizard prefer? Going somewhere through a fireplace and ending up covered in shoot or entering a simple cabinet?
#+end_quote

Considering that the cabinets have two nodes and the floo network hundreds or thousands, the floo wins every time. Who want to send their cabinet on ahead every time they want to go somewhere?

  Second: the fact that there is one in Borgin & Burke's, while not being an outright declaration of such items being dark, combined with the fact that no one else has them can only mean two things: 1-They ARE illegal or 2-They are not usefull....and we know they are usefull
#+end_quote

That's some pretty faulty logic. It could mean any number of things. Maybe they're expensive? B&B doesn't seem cheap; the Malfoys shop and sell there. Maybe they're difficult to make. There's no mention of them being illegal, and, indeed every argument you've given to them being so is incredibly weak. They're useful, but their use, or availability, but probably both is severly limited.

  After all (that's point 3) they can even bypass the protections of hogwarts, as they for example allow one to apparate inside the grounds of hogwarts, something that the school's protections do not allow.

No, they don't. It gets the Death Eaters into the castle, much like the Floo would. Unlike the Floo it's unknown and not controlled.

As or your final points; maybe A or B is true, but there's precious little reason to think so. As for C, they are useful, only in a very limited way compared to other means. Combine that with the fact that they're in all likelihood somewhat rare and expensive; of course they're not going to be in common use.
