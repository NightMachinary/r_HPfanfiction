Voldemort found out about horcruxes from Sluggy and the restricted section...horcruxes...freakig soul ancors that can help you maintain a retalive-state of immortality and can even help you posses, affect and control others...even after you go caput. So how you it be weird for a dark arts introduction book to be somewhere in Hogwarts' restricted section? Or somewhere on a long forgotten classroom (cause many are unused). After all a book in a potions classroom, left there for people who had no books of their own (HBP, Snape's Potions Book) had a scribble with a dark cutting curse, Sectumsempra...a curse created by a student while he was still attending Hogwarts...now, even if he was in Slytherin...Snape was kinda of an outcast, so where else could he have learned about dark magic and stuff? Restricted section of course. Or do you forget that a vanishing cabinet, an item registered as dark, was in the room of hidden things?
