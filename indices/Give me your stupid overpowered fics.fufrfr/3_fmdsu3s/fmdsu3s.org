Technically, linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) qualifies though neither Harry nor the story is in any way stupid.

Harry is ridiculously overpowered though there is a very very good reason for it. He has some glaring weaknesses though since almost nobody knows about them, most of his fights are completely one-sided.
