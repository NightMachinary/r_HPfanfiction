Inverarity's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] is very good. It's a gen story with Teddy Lupin as central character. Inverarity is one of my favorite fanfiction writers; he makes good words.

Bad Mum's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5199992/1/A-Strictly-Legal-Matter][A Strictly Legal Matter]] is Draco/Rose and works as a story better than it seems it ought to.

Deadwoodpecker's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4337434/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-II-The-Book-of-Albus][Backward With Purpose Part II: The Book of Albus]] is astonishingly good writing that centers on Albus Severus Potter. You probably should read BWP Part I to make sense of it, though. This is no real chore, as it's one of the best stories in the fandom. Ella (Deadwoodpecker) also makes very good words.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] also has several next-gen stories that don't feature that pairing.
