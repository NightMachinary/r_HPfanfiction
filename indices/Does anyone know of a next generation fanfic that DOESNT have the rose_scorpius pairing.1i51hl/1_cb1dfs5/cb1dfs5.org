I know lots! With every kind of character and genre :) Would you like to be more specific, with genre or length?

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309592][All The Abstract Nouns]] - Molly, Gen. Most relatable coming of age that I've read.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] - Victoire/Teddy/Molly, romance/drama. My favorite romantic drama, excellent characterization and Weasley family politics.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] Rose, gen. Another coming of age, also mostly focuses on the Weasley family.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=283722][Starving Artists]] Scorpius/Lucy, humor. Very British humor, light on the romance, heavy on the downtrodden.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294705][Bathing in Roses]] Albus/OC, romance/humor-parody. If you're more interested in a well-written romcom, but it's also pretty light on the romance too.
