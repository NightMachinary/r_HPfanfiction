I'll give two more! And I also write next gens and just finished a [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][long novel]] myself.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=268282][Morning Waffle]] is one of my favorite humor fic; it's incomplete, but totally readable anyway.
- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=297210][Out of Time]] Something different from the rest - it's Lily II/Moody time travel :)
