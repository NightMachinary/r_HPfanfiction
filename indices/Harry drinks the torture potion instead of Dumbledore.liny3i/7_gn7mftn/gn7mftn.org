HOLY SHIT. THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. I posted a prompt a few weeks back, about Dumbledore snapping one day and doing whatever he could to end the war as soon as possible. Never in my wildest dreams could I have thought about doing it in this beautifully written manner. I want to see more! Do consider turning this into a full-length fanifc! Or if not, I'd also be willing to turn it into a fic, with your permission of course!
