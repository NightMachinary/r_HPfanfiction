Well, okay. this is what I had in mind: with Dumbledore still around and having pulled out all restraints when it comes to defending the students Hogwarts definitely wouldn't fall, and having seen the effects of the potion on Harry he would probably decide against having anyone either underage or alone hunting the Horcruxes, so Harry would petty much be confined at Hogwarts while he takes Moody, MacGonnagal, Bill, Snape or Kingsley with him as support. He would probably just look through the list of students or ask Snape to figure out who was R.A.B. even if a single brainstorming session didn't provide him with the answer, then a short call with the stone and he would know the location of the Horcrux, he would still need to wait for Harry to wake up and call Kreatcher before finding out Mundugus took the locket, but this would just be a matter of time.

After the locket he would be starved for ideas of potential locations of the other Horcruxes, so maybe he would consider interrogating other death eaters since both Lucius and Regulus were entrusted with helping protect them, and since he just killed Bellatrix and has the stone... calling her could or not wield accurate answers depending on if or not she was compelled to answer, but either way her reaction would already give him a direction for his search, from there capturing and interrogating the other Lestranges would be a no-brainer, though how he would manage it would be up in the air, other than that he would also start looking into place where Bellatrix would be likely to keep such things including any house the Lestranges may or not have, eventually he would arrive at the conclusion that the locket was in Gringotts, and since it would be petty much political suicide for the Goblins to let him or the ministry confiscate the vault of political enemies we would have a rerash of the bank robbery, but this time with Dumbledore at the lead-role. He would still be understanding enough of the goblin's position to not start a slaughter, but I still think he could make a far cooler job than Harry & Co at it. Either he managed to cover perfectly his tracks (no way for him to convincingly shift the blame to Voldemort) or the goblins join Voldemort's side.

The diadem is the one I honestly don't think he would find, this would fall to Harry quite against Dumbledore's will, the way I see it being confined to Hogwarts while the war heats up after a very traumatic experience and with knowledge of Horcrux is exactly the type of thing that would drive Harry up the walls in frustration, enough that he would consider the possibility of Voldemort hiding one at Hogwarts and search for it, if for nothing else than to alleviate his own frustrations. He already knows Voldemort used the founders artifacts, knows that the locket and potentially the cup (don't think Dumbledore would be cruel enough to keep him out of the loop worrying if Voldemort is still immortal after what he went through) were used and found and that the sword wasn't used, so he would ask his Ravenclaw friend (aka Luna) about Ravenclaw's artifacts leading him to ask the grey lady and find out the location of the diadem. A quick jaunt to the headmaster's officer later to furnish him with the sword and the second last Horcrux is now gone.

Then comes the climax with Dumbledore and Voldemort ducking it out without restraints. Dumbledore knows that Voldemort still has Nagini and Harry tying him to the mortal plane, but at this point he will settle for either imprisonment or temporary decorporation as ways of gaining more time to try preventing Harry's death while Voldemort would eventually find out about the destruction of his Horcruxes and freak out completely leading a full-attack on Hogwarts while using the passages on the chamber to infiltrate the castle with some of his best soldiers while the staff is distracted (which Snape wouldn't be able to tell since he didn't kill Dumbledore and so died by the end of the year along with the Malfoys, making Draco an orphan alongside a compulsory guest at hotel Azkaban: /now with more dementors than ever! Visit our new dementor nursery and help provide food for the newborns, or don't, they will visit your room regardless any time they feel peckish/). Even without the warning about the true plan Dumbledore would probably still be weary enough to evacuate the students, though Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna would find some way of staying inside and use the map to keep an eye on the fighting (maybe in the RoR).

As they watch the staff of Hogwarts keep the bulk of Voldemort's forces at bay they notice the dark lord himself and his most trusted lieutenants making their way through the castle to attack the staff from behind, Nagini with them but kept under guard and away from the fighting since Voldemort isn't willing to either let her too far away from him or too close to Dumbledore who have already destroyed almost all his Horcruxes.
