They then decide to split up, Neville, Ginny and Luna go to Dumbledore's office get the sword to kill Nagini while Harry, Ron and Hermione try to either delay Voldemort or at least warn Dumbledore. They cast all spells they can to prevent detection and use the cloak before going after Voldemort's group, however Voldemort seems to have had the same idea since only the map shows he is there, they follow him at a distance and when they see their dots on the map standing still behind the Hogwarts staff (probably taking aim) they all take it as their clue and cast the flashiest, loudest and most destructive spell they know (probably some kind of blasting curse). The spell does it's job and they not only manage to prevent Voldemort's group from catching Dumbledore's unaware, but also injured/killed at least one of them. Naturally Voldemort is furious that he lost the element of surprise, but isn't foolish enough to show his back to Dumbledore in order to to kill the trio, meanwhile, even not having been caught unaware Dumbledore still has to fight a battle on two fronts while keeping Harry and his friends from getting killed on the crossfire, and so comes the scene I am absolute sure I can't pull out competently, the four layers free for all battle between the dark army on the front (compromised of the bulk of the death eaters, werewolves-so probably on a full moon or almost since they got to chose the time- dementors, giants, Acromantulas and any other dark creature) raining destruction against the defending army (formed by Hogwarts professors, the order, some aurors, Hagrid's giant brother, the suits of armor and anything else they can enchant or transfigure), Voldemort and his inner circle and Harry's group who are arguably in the best position for both attack and defense but are definitely the least skilled.

While the bulk of Voldemort's army would represent the greater number of combatants they would have to deal with not only the enemy force, but also Hogwarts' wards keeping them from attacking at full force, while Dumbledore's group would be free to cast as they wished at the army but wouldn't be able to crush them because most of their attention would be directed at the more skilled forces behind them while having to pull their punches as to not accidentally hit their students. Voldemort's personal force on the other hand would be casting as much as they pleased without caring about the damage, and then Harry's group would be taking cover on the grounds of Hogwarts while taking potshots at Voldemort's group, which wouldn't be able to return fire in earnest since it would mean showing their backs to Dumbledore's. Meanwhile Voldemort and Dumbledore start ducking it out as best as they can while keeping an eye on the other combatants and would be evenly matched with Voldemort focusing on casting curses and spells and Dumbledore focusing on transfiguration and enchantments. Some highlights of the fight would be Voldemort sending a dark smoke that rots everything it touched at all those around only for Dumbledore to conjure a wave of insects to absorb the curse while animating their blood in thousands of almost solid needles targeting Voldemort; Flitwick suddenly expanding and diminishing the space surrounding them to either give them more time to counter spells heading on their direction or giving the enemy less time to do the same; Harry managing to nail Voldemort with a sectumsempra as he is defending against a best conjured by Dumbledore only for the Dark Lord to turn around and send a wave of Fiendfyre at them in anger with them barely managing to run ahead of it (Accio brooms maybe?) and eventually be right above Voldemort with the curse still after them when Voldemort feels Nagini's death making him lose control of the fire, killing some of his group and forcing Dumbledore to focus on defending against it while Voldemort recovers and sends an AK at Harry in rage sending him to King's Cross.

About Harry, the potion's effects on him would have deeply traumatized him, Dumbledore, his friends and Pomfrey would eventually manage to get him somewhat functional, but he would still have bouts of depression and anxiety plus the occasional nightmare. He would also be quite conflicted about Dumbledore since on one hand he is his beloved mentor and is fighting the war efficiently, while on the other he was using the kind of magic he seemed to always refuse to in doing so, so upon arriving at the in-between he would find his parents waiting for him and have a long and very emotional conversation. He would start genuinely wanting to go to the beyond with them, but they would eventually manage to convince him to keep living and he would go back reassured (though not knowing about the Horcrux since his parents didn't really wanted to tell him).

When he wakes up Voldemort and Dumbledore are now having a full-on brawl while everyone else scraps for cover. Voldemort is laughing maniacally and taunting Dumbledore while Dumbledore is petty much foaming of anger. Then Harry sees Ron about to die because of some curse Voldemort had cast all around him. This is the moment he fully understands Dumbledore's choice and willingly does the same, his morals are not worth his best friend's life.

When he casts the killing curse there is no true hate behind it, he isn't killing Voldemort because of revenge, he is doing so because the alternative is having the blood of his friends on his hands. He casts the curse with no intent of having Voldemort feel fear or suffering, only wanting him /gone/ so his friends will be safe, as a consequence of this pragmatic efficiency his AK hits an unaware Voldemort petty much instantly, giving him no time to block or even notice it coming to him. His face doesn't even change into surprise, he just didn't have the time.

After that... honestly no clue, an epilogue I guess.
