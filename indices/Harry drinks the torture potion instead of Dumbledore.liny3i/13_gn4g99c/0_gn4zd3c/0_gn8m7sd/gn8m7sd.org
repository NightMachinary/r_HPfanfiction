Personally, I'd be interested to know how you'd think the presence of this Dumbledore - newly resolved to protect all of his charges - changes the war. What do you imagine the lingering effects of the potion would have on Harry? What does Voldemort do in response to the death of Bellatrix/his other Death Eaters? Snape is no longer on the run. What happens to the Malfoys, now that Draco has failed? Narcissa saved Harry in the forest, so that plays out entirely differently if she's murdered by Voldemort. Does Draco redeem himself following his mother's murder, or does he blame Dumbledore for his own failing?
