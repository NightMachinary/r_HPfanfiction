  With a heavy heart he cast a spell he had previously only theorized about more for the intellectual exercise rather than any plan on actually letting it ever be cast. It was based on the protean charm linking two people together to the point of metaphysically superimposing their selfs, than on a changing charm designated to pass on the attributes of one object into the other and on an ancient Sumerian ritual destined to heal a person of all wounds in exchange for part of their life's. And so it happened that MacNair was abruptly brought back from the edge of unconsciousness by the burning pain on his arm as his hand quickly withered into nothing and the curse quickly traveled up his now old body. Dumbledore looked him in the eyes as he died feeling it was the least he owed his former student after robbing his life, then went on his path to the hospital wing, faster now restored to his 40 years old body, both his hands now healthy and unmarked and how he loathed the sight of them so clean when they should be dripping blood... but dying was the easiest thing someone can do, it is just giving up and washing your hands from the world, living only for life's sake is selfish, but to keep fighting for what you believe when all you want is to lay down and die, this is the right choice.

  'at least' thought Dumbledore grimly 'I dearly hope so'.
