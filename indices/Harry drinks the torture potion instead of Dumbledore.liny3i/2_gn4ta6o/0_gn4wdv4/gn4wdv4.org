I was trying to be mysterious, guess it backfired a bit ðŸ˜…. Essentially Dumbledore would have invented this spell that lets him heal himself completely by passing on his injuries and curses upon another. What he did was make it so they were metaphysically the same being to some extent, then cast the healing ritual simplified and then the changing spell in a way that made it so MacNair paid the toil alone while Dumbledore benefited by having him take on Dumbledore's curse and the toil in exchange for his age. So Dumbledore walked away perfectly healthy and physically at the age MacNair was at.

I imagine this will be confusing too, so no, Dumbledore didn't actually steal the years of MacNair's life, MacNair died because his body couldn't deal with the sudden weight of both the curse and aging up, Dumbledore's vitality for a lack of a better term is still the same, but with a younger body there is less of a chance that his body will fail him until he has lived all the time he still has in him.
