His reaction was what I call “Fire and Brimstone” already, so I would be tempted to say something among the lines of “Appocalypse Now!” Only I have no idea of how to make him crumb-stomp the death eaters even harder that doesn't feel like kicking a dead horse. Though then again maybe seeing children around would have made him consider a less graphic way of doing the killing.
