I can't see this as full-length story material but maybe a short story with only a handful of chapters?

After this attack Dumbledore realise that the Horcrux hunting must be moved forward. It all comes to a showdown on on Harry's 17th birthday as the blood protection is gone. Before the battle Voldemort casts a killing curse at Harry. He meets Sirius/his parents in the inbetween, who tell him to keep living or something. He wakes up again while Dumbledore and Voldemort are still battling so he grabs the Sword of Gryffindor, which conveniently laid beside him, and kills Nagini because she was coming at him. Something happens (what? Dunno) and Harry kills Voldemort with an Expelliarmus.

He may now start his 7th year in peace.
