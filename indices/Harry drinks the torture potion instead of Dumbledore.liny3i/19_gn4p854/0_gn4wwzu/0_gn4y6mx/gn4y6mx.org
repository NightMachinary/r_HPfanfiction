Sorry... autocorrect. I was just wondering that if Dumbledore in his crusade against the Death Eaters lost every ounce of morality, then why not just kill every single Death Eater? At that point he'd be like "fuck the Malfoys. They've chosen their path willingly and I'm not giving them any protection."
