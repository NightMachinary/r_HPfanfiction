You could play it as a breaking point by looking and how frustration built up inside Dumbledore over the years seeing every year a member of his staff suffer a brutal fate, seeing so many of his former students killed or mutilated, having the whole world turn against him when he tried to encourage the ministry to take action the previous year.

And going further from there, Dumbledore proceeds to kill Voldemort but fall himself victim to the seductive power of the Elder Wand and in attempting to establish his utopia in which all wizards live in peace, he turns into the villain.
