Eh, not a bad idea, Draco /did/ let know killers enter and go around causing mayhem at Hogwarts and he was having a truly terrible couple of years, though considering how far he was willing to go to protect Draco and that he technically /is/ still under his protection that change would probably take longer to come about, like, I still have flashbacks to Daenerys terrible and rushed descent into villainy from GOT and am still weary of characters changing completely overnight.
