Wow this was amazing!

I was literally just reading Phoenix Insurgent (where Dumbledore started to fight back after getting ousted in OotP) and this gave me the same vibes, more or less.

This is much more righteous anger though. Although I think it's nice to see him super powerful, and kind of slipping into what he feared he would fall into if he ever really went all out with his power.
