Thanks! Though I don't think it will ever get to be a full story. I probably could try stretching it out a bit, but really at this point it would be basically Dumbledore crumb-stomping death-eaters on his path to Voldemort and then a duel I honestly don't think I could do justice to. Still glad you liked it.
