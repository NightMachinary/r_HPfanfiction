I imagine that in this case Harry would be beyond furious with Snape and Malfoy (not knowing the plan), he may even decide to put the hunt on hold for a few days to infiltrate Hogwarts and confront Snape, and of course, if he somehow manages to land a killing blow (supported by Ron and Hermione plus faculty and members of the DA he would probably have a good chance at it, even more so with the cloak of invisibility and the map to track him down).

This would end having quite a few consequences, Voldemort would probably become even more determinantes to haunt the trio down and the light-sided faculty and students would potentially have to leave with the trio to escape the repercussions (Grimmauld Place maybe?) the Death Eaters would probably be a bit afraid that one of their master's inner circle was killed in the supposedly most protected place on Britiain petty much instantly after being assigned there. And of course Harry wouldn't know about the Horcrux in him, so even /if/ Voldemort decided to give him the self sacrifice option for some reason he probably wouldn't take it, not sure how it would go beyond that though, but definitely interesting.
