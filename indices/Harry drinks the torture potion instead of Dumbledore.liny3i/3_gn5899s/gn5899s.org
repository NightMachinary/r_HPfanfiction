Even better is the fact that I'm pretty sure this would hurt Dumbledore more. Not physically, of course, but. Knowing that Harry loves him enough to do this. Knowing that he's put Harry through a lifetime of pain and he's going to have to keep doing it. Knowing that he's planning to have Harry /willingly walk to death/ and confirming that he absolutely will, given the choice, and even when /specifically asked not to/. Having to look the consequences of his actions in the eye, and tell himself "Yes, this is the plan we're going with."

Harry's had a lifetime of pain, taken both willingly and unwillingly. What's a little more, if it keeps someone else fom hurting? Dumbledore's plan managed to succeed beyond his own expectations.

I feel like it makes for more of a punch if Dumbledore doesn't get a Get Out of Death Free card, though. Harry wakes up in the hospital wing, with full faith that Dumbledore's fixed everything because he always does, and Madam Pomfery's fussing over him, and someone has to tell him what happened to Dumbledore. He's dead. Because that was the plan the entire time, for Snape to do it. Not that Harry knows that.
