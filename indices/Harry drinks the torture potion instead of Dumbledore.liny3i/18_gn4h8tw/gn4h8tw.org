It's an interesting point of divergence. What might Dumbledore do with 6 months worth of extra life?

Bold of you to assume Harry could ever pull off a silent switching spell.

If you mean thoughts on the drabble, it's certainly an interesting idea. And there's a lot of potential. But your writing tells far more than it shows, needs editing for grammar, and the formatting needs to be changed. A lot needs to be cut out. As it is, though the concepts are interesting, it's a bit of a chore to read. For example:

#+begin_quote
  The elder wand purred seductively in his hand as he raised it quicker than any of his enemies could see and with less than a thought all of a sudden the tower turned into a death-trap, telescopes and random bits of equipment turning into knifes, than being extensively cursed with spells that give experienced curse-breakers nightmares and then animated to seek their targets with flawless accuracy and speed greater than any muggle gun could ever reproduce.
#+end_quote

First of all, this is too long of a sentence. This is meant to be combat, fast and risky. The length of this sentence and the amount of needless exposition results in this seeming like it takes ages to do. The adjective "quicker" doesn't fix the reader's first impression from the length of the sentence alone.
