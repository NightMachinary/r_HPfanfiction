Eh, he /did/ manage to cast it silently to fill up the mead on the cups after Aragog's burial.

I would argue about language and the auto-correct, but to be honest I make the same mistakes in grammar on my native language, so it is mostly a moot point. And definitely, on rereading some parts sounded really awkward, always had this problem with show/don't tell and those specific parts are arguably the worst in the entire book to delve too deeply in character thought process, kind of felt the need though cause without it it seems like a switch just got flicked and Dumbledore started killing without caring. Will probably edit it tomorrow, if for nothing else than to at least smooth out some of the more awkward bits, correct the words that /did/ get changed by the autocorrect, try to divide some of the longer sentences and fix Dumbledore's seemingly three arms which was what annoyed me the most while rereading.

Anyway, thanks for the feedback, it was very helpful üëçüòÅ.
