You're welcome. Glad I could help.

  The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed, Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slughorn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill.

As an aside, Harry used the refilling charm for the drinks, not the switching spell. And had the Felix Felicis to help him out for the charm. To be honest though, it doesn't really matter, I was mostly joking about Harry's magic skills.
