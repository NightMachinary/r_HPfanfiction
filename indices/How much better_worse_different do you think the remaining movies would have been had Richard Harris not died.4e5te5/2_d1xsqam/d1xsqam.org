If we're talking about fantasy situations, how about if Ian McKellen was willing to replace him...a fan can dream.

IMO, the movies would've been better with Harris. Gambon did what he could, but he just /isn't/ Dumbledore in any imaginable interpretation of the character. If anything, he would've made a better Aberforth.
