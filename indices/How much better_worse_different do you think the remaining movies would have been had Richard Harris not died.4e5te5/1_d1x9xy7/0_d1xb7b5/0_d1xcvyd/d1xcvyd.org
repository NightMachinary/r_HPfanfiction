Possibly, since most of his other work in the series was good. He did play Dumbledore more intensely and emotionally, though, than Harris (who played him more serene and cards-close-to-the-vest), so it's not beyond the realm of possibility that even if Gambon didn't choose to play the scene that way, he might have agreed with that direction. Either way, I think Harris would have resisted such direction, since it was so markedly different from the way he played Dumbledore, resulting in an improved scene. I don't think Harris's way can be called /objectively/ better for the rest of the series, though - just different.
