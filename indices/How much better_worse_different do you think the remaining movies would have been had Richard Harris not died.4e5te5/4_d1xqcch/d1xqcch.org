i think gambon gets way too much hate. it think he did a good job of fitting what dumbledor needed to be as the series got darker and darker in later books. I can't imagine harris being as good in those Scenes. I get that people complain about that one scene in the fourth movie but honestly I can get past that. of all my issues with the movies Casting isn't one of them...
