I'm not averse to occasionally poking fun at Gambon's portrayal, but I agree that directional style had more to do with those gaffes than anything else. It took me a while to fully acknowledge that Watson, Radcliffe, Rickman et al. weren't to blame for everything that was missing from the movies, nor everything that was hammered in.

Damn you, Yates.
