Maybe physically he would have struggled but acting wise he'd definitely have been up for it - this was a guy who supported the IRA for a while and nearly ODed on coke in the 70s. I mean, he wasn't a Saint himself, and it would have been interesting to see if he could have tapped into the inner darkness, I guess
