I know one where he becomes a teacher, however doesn't feature Draco or Ginny travelling back with him. It's called Narcissa's Chance ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12870119/1/Narcissa-s-Chance]])

There's also a few other fics by the same author, ReluctantSideKick ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1094154/ReluctantSidekick]]) that follow the same premise.
