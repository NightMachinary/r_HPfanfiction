Well, it's not what I am reading right now, but I would recommend reading Linkffn(Princess of the Blacks), it's finished(and so is the series it is a part of), however it has some...triggers...and rather disturbing things in it so...be aware of that...seriously, it has some really f'd up stuff in it...it gets less disturbing(at least on some areas) and the disturbing stuff feels somewhat acceptable based on the setting and what is happening and the fact that even in the story it is clear that it is evil, but still.

On a happier note you have Linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus), which is a fanfic where fem!Harry is death, to be honest anything by "The Carnivorous Muffin" is in my opinion really good, although if you are not into psychological dilemmas he presents it might not be for you.

​

Linkffn(Escapologist Harry) is bloody glorious. It's not serious whatsoever, but it's just gold.

Linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist) is interesting.

Linkffn(Almost a Squib) is also good.

Linkffn(Darkly Dreaming Harry) is dark, and not finished, but I liked it(not dark as in disturbing but more in a murdery sort of way).

Linkffn(Blindness) is also good.

​

I hope at least one of those is something you can enjoy.
