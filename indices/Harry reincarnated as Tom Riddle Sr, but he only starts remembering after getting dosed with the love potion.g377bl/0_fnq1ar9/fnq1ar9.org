Dear Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,

You don't know me. I'm in the body of a muggle being dosed with a love potion by Merope Gaunt. The Gaunts live outside Little Hangleton and are the last of the Slytherin line. Think, hillbilly wizards. They are literally the worst. Well, second worst. My son is the worst, worst. He's not born yet, but he will be. Fortunately the love potion makes me love Merope, but not that little bastard.

I need you to do me a favor. Kill the little shit. I know you're all about second chances, but seriously, kill the little shit. He'll grow up to kill half of Wizarding Britain, create 6(ish) horcruxes that, I tell you, were a pain to track down and destroy.

You're probably asking how I know this. The same way I know you'll eventually duel Grindelwald and claim his Wand. You will also be very interested in Merope's family ring. The ring itself isn't much, but the Stone in the setting... Tell Ariana you're sorry and never use it again.

So, to recap, kill my son, Tom Marvolo Riddle aka Lord Voldemort aka He Who Must Not Be Named aka You Know Who.

Signed, in body Tom Riddle by mind, Harry James Potter, born July 31, 1980

Harry looked up at James, "Dad, why does Professor Dumbledore keep looking at me funny?"

"I dunno, son. Powerful wizards can be a bit eccentric."
