The fuck are you going on about, just because someone has the privilege to do bad things to you doesn't mean that it gives the person the right to do that to others. Also, Tom Riddle Sr. didn't love Merope, never loved her. He was under the influence of the love potion and then he saw that apparently the woman who was from the weird family which was probably also rumored to be in witchcraft was bearing "a" child that she said was his when he had no recollection of ever being with her and never even liking her at all and the fact that even if merope was abused, she dragged someone else into this just because she liked him. So, your argument makes no sense since your basically quoting a pureblood by saying that THERE ARE NO RIGHTS ONLY THOSE WITH POWER, SO MAGICIANS SHOULD RULE
