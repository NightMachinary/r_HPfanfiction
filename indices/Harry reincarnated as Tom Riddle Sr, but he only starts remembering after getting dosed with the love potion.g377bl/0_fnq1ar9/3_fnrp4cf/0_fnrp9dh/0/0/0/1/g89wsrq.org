What the actual fuck ??

He is not obligated to become the baby daddy of the bitch who kidnapped brainwashed and roofied him.

How do you get this morally righteous about shitting on a rape victim?

Rights are what you should be morally entitled If you strip away rights it doesnt make them actually privileges because its possible to construct a situation where they can be taken from someone. It means you are being amoral and inhumane by stripping them away.

What the fuck kind of logic is this? Its like saying if I cut off your arm it was never truly your arm because i could take it.

Also how is this sentiment exclusively american? The last I checked pretty much all countries believe in rights .
