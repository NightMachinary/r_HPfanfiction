Lol it'd be pretty hard to have a poly relationship if you're the only person to know about it. Actually, that would be funny to read. Dumbass protagonist thinks he's in a polyamorous relationship with multiple girls, only to have all of them dump him when they find out about the other girls. Or maybe they string him along with some dastardly plan.
