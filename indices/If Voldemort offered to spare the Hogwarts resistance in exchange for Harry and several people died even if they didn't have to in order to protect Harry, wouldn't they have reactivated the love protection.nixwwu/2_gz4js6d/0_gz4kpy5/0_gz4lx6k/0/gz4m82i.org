I don't recall ever being stated that Harry passed on his mother's protection. He just re-did the whole thing when Voldemort asked him to come to the forest as he had allowed his friends to die for him and if he doesn't he threatens to kill all people that may try to harbor or help him. And that's when it goes into effect.
