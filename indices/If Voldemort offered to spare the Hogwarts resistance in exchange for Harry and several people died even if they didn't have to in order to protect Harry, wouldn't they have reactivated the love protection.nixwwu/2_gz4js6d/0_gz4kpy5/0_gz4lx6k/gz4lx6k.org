As mentioned, Harry had the protection and as such had the ability to pass it on. And again, if Lily didn't do something ahead of time then why aren't their any other People-Who-Lived in the current day and age? Besides, it's mentioned in Voldemort's return speech in GOF that he was academically aware that the sacrificial protection was a possibility(Old Magic, he called it if I'm remembering correctly), if not seen in use for ages and therefore incredibly rare and likely complicated to preform.
