  Also Harry performs no ritual and still gives everyone else the protection.

Ah, no. That wasn't the protection, at least not the same one from Lily. That was the elder wand rebelling against Riddle. None of those spells rebounded on Riddle, did they?

I mean look at Riddle's final fight before Harry reveals himself in the Great hall. He's fighing three people, at once. They're holding their own against the guy. Then Bella dies, and instantly all three people fighting him get knocked down because his magic reacted through his body instead of the wand.

Riddle lost this war at the end because he was too stupid to realize the wand he was using was still fighting him after Snape died. Had he used his original wand, he would have(at the very least) killed Harry in the great hall.
