The ritual part is fanon. In fact Voldemort finds the Potters completely unprepared and Dumbledore uses the word 'unknowingly' several times when referring to Lily's protection. Also Harry performs no ritual and still gives everyone else the protection. He is also asked only once to meet Voldemort in the forest.
