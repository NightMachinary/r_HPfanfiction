There's a LOT more to the protection than simply dying for someone, otherwise there wouldn't be only one ___-Who-Lived. For instance; Voldemort would have to do the killing (which he couldn't have due to sitting out the battle), the person dying must have preformed whatever ritual/enchantment/potion/spell/process ahead of time or already been in possession of the protection, the individual dying to activate the ability specifically must be given a chance(or three) to be spared, and the example in question didn't deactivate it was only potentially weakened and no longer fueling Dumbledore's wards on #4 Privet Drive(which paired with Voldie's ability to physically affect Harry from GOF on made it useless against anything except for the AK in conjunction with Harry's semi-Horcrux status).
