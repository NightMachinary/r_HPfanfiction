Did Riddle himself kill those people? Besides, it isn't love for Harry, in this case. Save for a few people, it's loyalty to Harry, or to Hogwarts. There are those who chose to fight because Britain under Riddle's thumb is unacceptable to them.

Also, Riddle got knocked to the floor because he inadvertently killed a part of himself. Aside from this instance, Canon does not tell us what happens when someone destroys their own horcrux. Had it been the protection reactivating, Riddle would have been incorporeal again.
