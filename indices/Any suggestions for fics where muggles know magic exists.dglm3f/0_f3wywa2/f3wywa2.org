Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

Muggles find out about magic in 1996, and with secrecy no longer being a concern Voldemort changes strategy to take over the entire world, not just the magical one. After taking over North Korea and getting his hands on enriched uranium, things get way out of hand.

Tl;dr: Many, many people dead and quite a few cities turned into radioactive craters. Oh, and a biblical prophecy gets fulfilled cause it was created by an actual seer.
