This may be a controversial opinion, but I think the source material has more than one valid interpretation. Canon presents us with magic that has many mystical aspects such as the power of love, casting magic on ideas, etc. while simultaneously presenting the outline of a structured system with rules and limits that can be studied and verified. So both the mystical and scientific interpretations of magic are equally valid interpretations of canon in my opinion and I enjoy reading fics that use either especially when they are well thought out.

Personally, my headcanon leans toward the scientific interpretation. A world where symbols and belief determine the power of a wizard's magic is a lot harder to build a good fic around in my opinion as that essentially opens the door to Swiss-cheese plots and solvus plotus type spells unless the author is particularity talented with their world building. Good fiction requires internal consistency and that's just harder to achieve the more you deviate from reality as we know it.
