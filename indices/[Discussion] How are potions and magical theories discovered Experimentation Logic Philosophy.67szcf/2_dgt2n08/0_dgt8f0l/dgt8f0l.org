In The Shadow of Angmar it's worth pointing out that while I have tried to keep a certain canonicity to the potion making process, it is still informed by the existence of the Lord of the Rings crossover aspect. What follows is a short explanation of the system I ended up with. No spoilers, but if you're reading the story and want to discover the nature of magic alongside Harry, you might want to skip it.

What I went for, basically, was 'if viewed through the lens of LotR, how would Harry Potter magic work, and how would it extend beyond what is seen in canon'. This caused me to think of things as strains or melodies in the original song of creation. When creating a potion you are taking those elements and combining them, constructively and destructively into a new song, a new power. That new melody modifies the world (which is itself a song), to create the desired effect. But to be able to do this, one needs to be able to hear the music, and sing the connecting notes to bring it together into a complete whole. This is the meaning of being a wizard in my constructed crossover world.

In SoA, the Harry Potter world is Eru's second creation (the Elves have a legend which says that men, after passing on, go to Eru and will in time join him in singing a new world), and it is one that does not wane over time as Arda does. The Men who sang it into existence, or their children still live within it and are always adding to the orchestration.

All people, muggles included, have some limited ability to hear the music, and this is why things like folk remedies tend to be a part of the ingredients I use in my potion making process in the story. While no-one is all that good at hearing it and understanding the meaning, over the millions of people, the wisdom of crowds sees them find the kernel of truth. Wizards are, of course, more attuned to the music, and so are much more able to work out the uses of potion ingredients.

That's the idea underlying it, anyway. I might have talked at more length, but I'm on my phone.
