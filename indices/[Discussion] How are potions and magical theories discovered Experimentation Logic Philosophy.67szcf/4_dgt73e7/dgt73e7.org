Logical deductions revolving around a conclusive base. Theories are educated guesses backed up by logic. Understanding Magical Theories would make brewing new potions fairly easier because you'd understand what you are aiming for. You can't mix random things and hope for the best for example, a potion generally has ingredients related to it's use.

Let's take the Polyjuice potion, a potion that let's you successfully take the appearance to that of another. Each Ingredient represents a concept, if we were in a time where the polyjuice wasn't yet made, it would simply be a theory. The combination of ingredients to get a certain result those ingredients represent what you are trying to achieve.

So let's say you're a wizard/witch and you're doing a ritual for immortality

A circle with a slash down the middle The flow of your blood mixed with another persons blood flowing down the line in the middle On both sides there are the hieroglyph for both the /sun/ and /moon/ You activate the ritual under a solar eclipse

There is symbolism behind both and they are opposites. The circle with a slash represents balance, the blood represents your being and will which acts as a medium the mixture of blood represents two blending into one. The hieroglyphics represent the sun and moon while the solar eclipse is when the moon passes between the sun making it a stronger time-frame.

Focus your intent on certain aspects of the sun and moon

Moon- Immortality, eternity

Sun- Rebirth, Strength

The notion of Sacrifice would also be relevant due to the mixture of blood to "take" their life as your own and add it to your own. Thus you would have to continue to do this more then once to continue living.

You wouldn't be able to do anything without first understanding the concepts and what they represent

Everything is connected to your end result, Magic is connected to what you want to do, which would explain cases of young magical children and accidental magic. This is overall how I view it
