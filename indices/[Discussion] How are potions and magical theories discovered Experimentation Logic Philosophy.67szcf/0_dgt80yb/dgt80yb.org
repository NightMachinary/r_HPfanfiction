I think the best model is something like the natural philosophy of Galileo or the physics of Aristotle. That is to say, it's a combination of ideas inspired by observation with the building of narratives from the armchair about the nature of phenomena.

I dislike the idea that magical theory is mathematical immensely. For a start in terms of tone it makes magic feel far too much like science. But on top of that, Hogwarts teaches a large amount of magical theory but does not teach mathematics, so it seems mathematics is not needed to understand the magic. I therefore feel like looking to modern science and especially physics is not a good model for magical theory.

(Yes there is arithmancy but it is a non-essential subject and the students successfully study a large amount of magical theory without it, and on top of that there's very little in canon to back up the fanon idea that arithmancy describes the fundamental nature of magic).

I think it's important to consider the heavily conceptual nature of magic. The currency of magic seems to be abstract ideas more than physical quantities, with you being able to cast magic on abstract items like job positions, names, and secrets. I therefore picture a large amount of magical theory as being involved in properly understanding the nature of the concepts involved in the branch of magic you're using, or the specific spell you're using.

For example, before casting the fidelius charm I imagine you have to read about the true nature of secrets. A fair limitation on the fidelius charm would be that a secret has to belong to you before you can use the fidelius to hide it. Not only does this prevent the absurdity of any wizard using it to destroy items of essential common knowledge, it's also implied by Flitwick's description in PoA of moving a secret from your soul into the soul of the secret keeper. The secret has to be in your soul to start with i.e. it has to be yours. So I picture there being a fairly complex analysis of when a secret can be said to be yours and when it has become common knowledge and therefore is not capable of being hidden by the fidelius.

In many ways this analysis represents philosophy, but it also bears a strong resemblance to the kind of reasoning made by courts.

Now, from the DoM we know there is a place for observation. But I don't see this as the kind of systematic observation of modern science, and more like the observation of Aristotle. It inspires ideas but it is not precise.

On top of the above conceptual analysis, I picture there being more systematic narratives about magic which link up the concepts into schemes of understanding. These schemes would represent the large scale "worldbuilding" narratives about the world created by philosophers like Hegel. There would be a number of them in competition with no real way of determining which of them are true, but with plenty of arguments for and against each. And understanding them would increase your general appreciation for the nature of magic even if they are not "true" - they would each capture some part of the essence of magic. And over-reliance on a single view of magic could result in one dangerously ignoring aspects of magic which are given greater prominence in opposing views. Ideas like the power of sacrifice.

TLDR: magical theories are created, not discovered.
