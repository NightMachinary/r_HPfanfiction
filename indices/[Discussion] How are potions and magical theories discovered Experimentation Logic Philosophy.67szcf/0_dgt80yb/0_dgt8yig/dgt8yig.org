This.

  I think it's important to consider the heavily conceptual nature of magic. The currency of magic seems to be abstract ideas more than physical quantities, with you being able to cast magic on abstract items like job positions, names, and secrets.

Abstract ideas are certainly prevalent in HP magic, but there seems to be some evidence that physical quantities effect magic. Things like distance effecting apparition or weight effecting levitation. Though those two examples I could only find from extra-canonical sources.

Less obvious would be the idea that the shield charm blocks "magic." What type of magic it blocks isn't based on some abstract concept. It blocks certain types of magic and fails to block other types (dark magic such as the killing curse for example). This doesn't seem to be some abstract concept, but dependent on some actual magical property or attribute.

  Now, from the DoM we know there is a place for observation. But I don't see this as the kind of systematic observation of modern science, and more like the observation of Aristotle. It inspires ideas but it is not precise.

I'd say in support of this, most wizards seem to shrug off anomalies and inconsistencies in magic as though they were commonplace (and they seem to be). An example would be when the Weasley car comes to life, and nobody bats an eye. Now whether this is because the particular wizards we see aren't knowledgeable enough or interested enough to examine such anomalies is up to debate.

There do seem to be some strict/iron cad rules that magic follows, but those aren't explained in any great detail in canon.
