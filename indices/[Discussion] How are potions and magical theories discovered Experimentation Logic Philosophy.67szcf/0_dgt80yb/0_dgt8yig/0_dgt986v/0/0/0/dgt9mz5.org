Hah! I've chatted with you before on this exact topic, so I knew I was fanning the flames here. What I understand of your position doesn't mesh with your statement about the shield charm only failing against the killing curse (which admittedly may imply a misunderstanding on my part of your thoughts on the subject).

A counter example would be Fred's and George's shield clothing in HBP which only protects against minor curses and jinxes, but are useless against powerful spells such as the unforgivables (not just the killing curse). However, if you're headed out the door I'll digress... for now :).
