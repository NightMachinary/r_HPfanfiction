Sorry should have restated that this is in response to the statement that abstract ideas appear to be the currency of HP magic. I'd say that abstract concepts play the major role, but literal attributes do seem to play some underlying role in magical interaction (but not necessarily in the same way that math and physics do in the physical realm).

I think we may be in agreement here
