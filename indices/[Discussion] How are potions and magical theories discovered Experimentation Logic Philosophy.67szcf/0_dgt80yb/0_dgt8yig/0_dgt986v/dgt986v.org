  Less obvious would be the idea that the shield charm blocks "magic." What type of magic it blocks isn't based on some abstract concept. It blocks certain types of magic and fails to block other types (dark magic such as the killing curse for example). This doesn't seem to be some abstract concept, but dependent on some actual magical property or attribute.

I feel like you've drawn an overly universal conclusion from a single example. The Killing Curse is the only spell we know of that cannot be shielded against and is particularly noted several times for the uniqueness of its unblockability.

The shield charm handles other dark magic just fine.

(On a speculative aside, I always felt that the unblockable nature of the killing curse represents the inevitability of death. So that too would be conceptual.)
