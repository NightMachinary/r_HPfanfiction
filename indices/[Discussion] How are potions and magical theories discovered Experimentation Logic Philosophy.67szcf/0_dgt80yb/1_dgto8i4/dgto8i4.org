I really like the idea of competing philosophies about magic. Three questions out of curiosity though. Do you believe that there are hard limits to magic? As in, there are things that magic simply can't do no matter what philosophies you are using, or abstraction/conceptualization you make? In canon bringing back the dead or conjuring food was presented as a hard limit.

The other thing is your opinion on belief magic. It's a common trope where Harry does things that are considered difficult or even impossible, due to his confidence in his magic, or because he didn't know about the rules he was breaking.

Finally, I agree that a magical philosophy or theory concerning math would be a bad idea, simply because abstract ideas like love can't really be defined using math. But, you did say that there could be competing ideas. So imagine if a muggleborn attempted to create a magical philosophy that uses math. Or attempted to explain magic using math. He wouldn't be able to apply this to abstract human concepts like love, but it would work for a very narrow range of magic, so narrow that the idea is discarded because other philosophies are better. What are your thoughts on this?
