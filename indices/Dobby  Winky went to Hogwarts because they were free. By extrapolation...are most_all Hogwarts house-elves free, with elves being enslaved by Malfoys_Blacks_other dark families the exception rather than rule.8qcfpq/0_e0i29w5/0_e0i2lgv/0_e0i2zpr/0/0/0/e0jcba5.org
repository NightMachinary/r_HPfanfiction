I mean, they don't roll their eyes and stick out their tongues when Dobby mentions about enjoying freedom; they back away from him like he's the center of a danger zone. And from the writing it sounds like they're more afraid than angry when Hermione goes on about their rights. Do some of them remember getting help from well-meaning people in the past that ended badly?
