I doubt it honestly- remember that the Hogwarts elves were looking down on Dobby and Winky- not helping Winky- only Dobby did that, taking care of her when she was the house elf version of a depressed alcoholic drinking herself to death- which never gets resolved as far as I know- she's probably dead by now. So much for SPEW.

And Dobby still wanted to work- I imagine free house elves are snapped up wanting pay or binding or however that works- it's never clear beyond clothing freeing them, after all, free/cheap labor is amazing.
