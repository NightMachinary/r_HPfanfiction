In Canon, Hagrid stayed in the cabin over night and then took Harry to Diagon the next day.

If Vernon killed Hagrid, he wouldn't be noticed missing until the next day when he was supposed to return to Hogwarts after the shopping trip.

Once it's noticed that Hagrid isn't back, Dumbledore would be quite busy finding out what happened, and by the time he found Harry and Hagrid's bodies in the cabin the Dursleys would already be in another country and Quirrel would have succeeded stealing the Stone from Gringotts.
