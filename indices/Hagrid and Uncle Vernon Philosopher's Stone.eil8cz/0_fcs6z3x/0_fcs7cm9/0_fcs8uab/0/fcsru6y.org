I would think that Vernon would have an excellent self-defence case. For the prior few weeks, they've been getting letters from a mysterious stalker who seems to have become obsessed with his nephew. For everybody's safety, they decide to hunker down on an island in the middle of a lake. A large man barges in, won't leave when asked to, is clearly deranged, ranting about taking their nephew away. His wife and son are also there. They are on an island in the middle of the storm, and so they can't run. (This is assuming I'm remembering canon correctly.)

I think that even British law would find that lethal force is justified under these circumstances.

It's a good point that /wizards/ won't miss Hagrid until two days later---but the Dursleys wold call Muggle police, which would arrive as soon as they were able, and they would be well into their investigation by the time the Obliviators get there.
