Yeah exactly. I'm not going to judge someone for liking trash (God knows, I'm enjoying a crappy fic right now), but writing is certainly not 'in the eye of the beholder'. You can objectively discern great from good from bad storytelling -- and most of the FFN's 'most favourited' fall squarely into the last.
