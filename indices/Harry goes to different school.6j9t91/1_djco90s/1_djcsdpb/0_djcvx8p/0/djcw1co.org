Yeah. The amount of reviews a fanfic gets in no way correlates to how good it is. Case in point: Rorshach's Blot and his hundreds of thousands of plotless, conflictless words on the first page of the 'most favourites' tab for HP fanfiction on FFN. I guess some people still like that kind of stuff, which is fine, but it doesn't mean it's a well-nailed-together fic.
