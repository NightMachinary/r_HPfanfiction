There's Kwan Li's story, where Neville was marked instead of Harry:

Other than that there's very few completed ones, but a lot of WIPs that can be recommended. For example:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by The Santi.

They're two of my favourites and the first ones that spring to mind where Harry isn't the BWL.
