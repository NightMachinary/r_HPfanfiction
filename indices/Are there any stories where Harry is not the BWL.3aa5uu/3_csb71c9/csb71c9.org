I like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10511318/1/Just-Another-Orphan][Just Another Orphan by ValwithV]].

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

Hasn't been updated in a while, but the author told me in a PM it's not abandoned, so I'm hopeful. It's a Neville BWL, where Harry is sorted into Slytherin.
