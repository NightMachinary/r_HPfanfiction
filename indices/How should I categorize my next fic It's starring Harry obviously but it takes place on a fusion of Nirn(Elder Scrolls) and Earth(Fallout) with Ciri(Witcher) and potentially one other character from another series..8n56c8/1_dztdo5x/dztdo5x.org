List it under the Witcher and HP tags. Most people were introduced to the Witcher series via the the video games so Ciri teleporting to different worlds/universes is one of the few canon things associated with her. Harry Potter in different universes is almost as common as the HP fan fiction tropes like "Lord Harry" or "Magic wards".
