It's not tenous, JK Rowling has long admitted that Hermione is a more extreme version of herself ([[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-connectiontransc.html][cleverer and more annoying]]). She's also said in the past she has a lot of Harry however too, so not just Hermione ([[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0804-ebf.htm][and also other characters as well]], but emphatically not Umbridge)

To some extent authors will always have a bit of themselves in a story after all.
