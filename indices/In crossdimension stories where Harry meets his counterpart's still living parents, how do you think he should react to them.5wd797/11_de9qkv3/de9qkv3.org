In my fic, Lily believes that canon!Harry is still her son, even though he's from a different universe. But she's desparate to have her own Harry back, and struggles to understand his change, so when our Harry shows up he's almost like the son she remembered and wants him to think she's his mother too. She knows she is falling into a trap.

Harry on the otherhand, knows she's a stranger to him. His heart aches for her, but what he really wants is his real mother and tries to remain distant. And he has to remain distant because he has to go back to his world and if he develops a stronger relationship, it would be devesating for them all.
