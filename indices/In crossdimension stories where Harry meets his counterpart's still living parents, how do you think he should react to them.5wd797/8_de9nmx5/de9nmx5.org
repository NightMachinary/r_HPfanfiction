I would think of it being similar to finding a long lost sibling. Sort of the stories where a pair of siblings are adopted by different people, or an adopted kid goes back and finds his parents after many years for whatever reason. They always seems really genuinely happy about the discovery, but aren't sure about where to go from that point, what to do, what the relationship is, etc. I think a happy yet uncertain, semi-reserved outlook would be the best on both sides.

Edit: Maybe even have scenes of them working through their lives, seeing what each has done - lily talking to harry about the life hes lead in a meaningful way and vice versa - not the fanfiction bullshit where harry goes "I was abused!" and lily and harry have a massive angst fest and become super close in like 1 interaction.
