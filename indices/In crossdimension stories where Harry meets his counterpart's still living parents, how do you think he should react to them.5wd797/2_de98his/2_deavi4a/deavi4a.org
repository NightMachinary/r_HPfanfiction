Proud to be fucked up! Haha.

I would be the rare ones that would just break down into manly tears. You see, I've always been a very emotional person. It could be because of the mental conditions I have or my less-than-happy childhood.

If my mum died and I somehow lived on and I saw her in the street one day I would probably cry and begin to apologise for every wrongdoing I did in my life, even if it didn't concern her. I'd turn into a clingy child and just force myself to be with her. I would be the easiest person to fool in that aspect because I would ignore any different mannerisms in order to spend time with her.

I agree with you on some extent, I just wouldn't be able to walk away. I know that it wouldn't be my mum, but I would do it anyway.
