  she is not 'a stranger that just happens to look like your mom'. She is your mom from another dimension. She would have the same personality, character and (depending where the dimensions split off) the same history and background.

People are shaped by their experiences. If she made different decisions and lived a different life, it means she is not the same person; she could have been, but she isn't. This also means that her personality might not be exactly the same, and in any case Harry didn't really know much about his parents. As such, whether or not he would react to a person like that depends on him rather than some kind of set-in-stone rule.

Harry didn't know his parents, and his efforts to learn about them were never desperate; this means that trying to show him as “an orphan who desperately wants to get to know his parents” isn't really right. And as for the different mindset, let it be known that he talked with the shadows of his parents through the stone of resurrection, and yet for all we know he never did it again; this shows him to be someone who would be content with being himself rather than trying to present himself as somehow related to people from another dimension just because they are similar to his parents.
