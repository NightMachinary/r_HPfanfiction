Yes, definitely. I forgot to add that I was mostly talking about a young-ish Harry - like till his 4th year or around. I would say Harry's age is an important factor in this question. A young Harry would probably not hesitate if it means being with his parents.

An older one, though, would be more wary. I feel like he would want to be with his parents. The yearning would still be here but he would also think of the 'family' he left behind (Ron, Hermione, Sirius, Luna...) It would be an emotionally torn Harry. Plus, he would be a bit wiser and realise that it's another Lily. Same as his mother but not his mother.
