I think that's the crux of the difference between the two answers, then. A young Harry definitely hadn't come to terms with it yet and he most likely would try to get closer to people from another reality who are the equivalents of his parents. The stories where Harry travels across dimensions generally are about an adult Harry, which is why my comment higher up the chain pertained to that one rather than a kid Harry.

Young Harry, sure, he would try to get closer to anyone who could in any way be family to him. I mean, he kept on trying with the Dursleys up until the very moment when he left for Hogwarts if not for longer, he immediately accepted Sirius, Hermione was like a sister to him and Ron like a brother. Throw Harry of that age into another dimension where James and Lily are alive and I can see them needing a crowbar to detach him.
