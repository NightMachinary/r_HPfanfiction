That's way too simplistic. I agree with the general consensus that he would probably try to stay cool and relatively reserved, because they aren't really his parents, but they are way more than "a stranger wearing his parents face" - at least if the alternate universe is in any way close to his own.

Just imagine never getting to know your parents and here's a perfect replica of them including their emotions, life-experiences and everything else. I can't imagine an orphan not wanting to get to know them, even if they aren't 'really' his parents, they are still the closest thing to family he's got.
