  IMHO that's a very different situation... there's lots of undertones in the story how the hallows are kind of dangerous and how people can get obsessed with the ressurection stone in particular. Not to mention all the Faustian themes going on.

Yes, but do remember that this isn't the first time Harry encountered something that was dangerous in quite a similar way, and this time he was able to reject it on his own whereas the previous time Dumbledore needed to tell him to stop and actually make it impossible for Harry to continue. Faustian themes aside, that might or might not mean that he did come to terms with the fact that they are dead and won't come back, because this time he managed to stop on his own rather than only when someone else forced him to stop.

Not to mention that there really wouldn't be a universe in which either James or Lily would have the exact same experiences as his parents (because that set of experiences led to them dying), which means their personality could also be different. Sure, that doesn't necessarily mean much, for the very fact that they are wearing a familiar face might be enough to make Harry see them differently than he would any other people, but automatically presuming that they will each be a “perfect replica” is also way too simplistic.
