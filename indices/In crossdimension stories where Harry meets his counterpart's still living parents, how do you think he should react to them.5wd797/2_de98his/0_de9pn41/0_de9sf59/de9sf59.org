  I can't imagine an orphan not wanting to get to know them, even if they aren't 'really' his parents, they are still the closest thing to family he's got.

And on the other hand, Harry could have gotten to know his parents better via use of the stone of resurrection, and yet he chose to instead discard it somewhere where nobody will find it. Of course he did have other reasons, greater than his desire, but considering how the stone is supposed to tempt people I do think it is a sign that he did actually come to terms with it at least somewhat and as such wouldn't need to treat some people from another dimension as his parents' substitutes.
