It just sounds unrealistic for the first thing Harry to do is point out to his alternate parents that he isn't their son, and they are just strangers that look like his parents. Not only is it incredibly insulting to to them, sort of implying that they aren't their own persons, but it's also ridiculously unreasitic for Harry's character. He's been starved for attention his entire life, told stories about his parents, love the memories that other people had of them. If he suddenly woke up to see them alive he'd either start crying and embracing them, or completely shutting down emotionally and ignoring them.
