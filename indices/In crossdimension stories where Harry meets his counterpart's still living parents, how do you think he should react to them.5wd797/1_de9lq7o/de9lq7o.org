If it's pre-Hogwarts canon-ish Harry, I think he would be surprised, and then maybe hurt, possibly thinking "Why didn't they love me enough to rescue me?" Especially if he doesn't realize that he's in a cross-dimension situation.

If it's post-Hogwarts canon-ish Harry, he'd be very suspicious and disinclined towards trust.
