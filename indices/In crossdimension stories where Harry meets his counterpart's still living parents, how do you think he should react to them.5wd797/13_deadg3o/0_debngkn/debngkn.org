The other Potters are such a non entity in this story though. Their only 'use' in the story from a literary perspective is to get Harry / Ginny and Hermione / Ron broken up so Harry / Hermione can be a thing.

And that by itself really isn't even the meat of the story, just the potatoes. The main point of the story is Harry fixing hogwartz and the ministry.
