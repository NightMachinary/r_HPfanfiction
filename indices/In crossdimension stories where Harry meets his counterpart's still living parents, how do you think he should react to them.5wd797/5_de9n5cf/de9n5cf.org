Again depends on the type of Harry, Dark Brooding Harry Post War or even Mid War, he would distance himself try and seperate himself from them

Happy Better Adjusted Harry, It would be shock attemps to befriend them would happen

But either way he's getting close and a good chance he ends up Mister and Misses Potter Baby Boy. Unless you just don't want the Potters in the Story, or would like to Bash them, they were loving kind people and adding a child that IS theirs, but lacked the love it required growing up would push the Potters to take him in, care for him, love him.

You forget people seek out comfort and while Alt Lily and James would still feel the lost of her child and Harry would of grown up sans parents that doesn't mean Harry can't come to Love Alt Lily and James as Parents and Alt Lily and James could and should come to care and love Harry like Another son
