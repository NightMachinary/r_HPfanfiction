I usually avoid gender swap fics because it's often tastelessly played for laughs Ã  la Freaky Friday, or it's just a prompt for smut when characters get aroused over how sexy their gender-swapped bodies are.

However, I thought the change was handled very well in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11482921/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Danse-Macabre][Harry Potter and the Danse Macabre]]. Refreshingly, the character still focuses on what matters most to them and copes with the changes to their body /without/ devolving into hysterics, feeling like less of a person, or altering their personality just because they have different plumbing.
