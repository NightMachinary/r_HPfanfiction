A basilisk in an urban area would be /terrifying/. It's one of those things that seems too powerful to not break the setting. It destroys cameras and kills or disables anyone who gets close enough to identify it and report back. How many people would die before the authorities even figured out what was going on? I think it would be plausible (though not certain) that a well-placed RPG would kill it, but how many people would die before anyone could get close enough to do it?

(A lot of wizards live and work in isolated areas like Hogwarts/Hogsmeade or any professional Quidditch team. If the muggles could /find/ them, they could nuke them if they had to, but I doubt they would just because of the nuclear taboo.)
