My headcanon for mandrakes is that their kill range is actually very short--only a few feet. You can hear it and only get knocked out or a bad headache at longer range. This is based on the actual mythology, where uprooting a mandrake kills /only/ the person who uprooted it, and on they way they were used in the Battle of Hogwarts, tossing them over the wall without any thought to friendly fire.
