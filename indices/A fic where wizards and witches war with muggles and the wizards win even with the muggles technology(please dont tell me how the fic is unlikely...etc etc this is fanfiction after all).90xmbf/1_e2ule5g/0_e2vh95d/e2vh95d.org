While there are plenty of ways to use magic to kill people, I think you need to consider what the wizards' victory conditions are. They have an established preference to simply be left alone by Muggles, so presumably a wizarding victory is not "kill all Muggles" but rather "return to status quo".

With that in mind, the key magic is not how to kill lots of people, but rather how to make all the Muggles forget that wizards exist.
