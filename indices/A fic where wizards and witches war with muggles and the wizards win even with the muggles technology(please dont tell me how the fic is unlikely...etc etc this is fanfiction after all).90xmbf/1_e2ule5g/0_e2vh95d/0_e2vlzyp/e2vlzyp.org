I think the Fiendfyre argument arose when people started thinking about end-game scenarios. What if the goal eventually switches to "exterminate"? Then even one half-decent wizard left could be the muggle's downfall with those Fiendfyre strikes.

But you're correct. There is no need for the wizards to destroy muggles.
