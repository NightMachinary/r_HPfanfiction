Wizards would win.

Step one. Apparate somewhere, muggle heavy. Steo two. Unleash a basilisk, a Nundu or better a Fiendfyre. Step three. Enjoy.

Muggle can't counter attack with Nuclear bomb, because if they do it will result in heavy casualties for the muggle side as well.

Sooo... If you want a great fic with wizards vs muggle where wizards win, you are probably going to enjoy Rise of the Wizards. Can't link it because I'm on phone but its really great!
