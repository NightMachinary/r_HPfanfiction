Rise of the Wizards linkffn(Rise of the Wizards): curb stomp the muggle world

Abraxas linkffn(Abraxas): arguably the best initial muggle maneuver to finish off the wizards, but the magical world gets its shit together and starts tearing them a new one.

I can't remember if there was a war, but..linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation): muggle technology advanced so far that the magical world could no longer be successfully concealed, at least without completely separating their societies altogether.
