In many ways the wizards have already won without the Muggles ever realising there was a fight, given the way they interfere in the highest levels of Muggle government with impunity.

What's really interesting about this is that the British Ministry arranged for a foreign President to forget a call, which also implies a high level of cooperation between magical governments -- far more than Muggle governments.

Sometimes I feel that thinking of the magical community as a collection of magical nation-states is misleading. In many ways they're more like an Illuminati-style international conspiracy with regional chapters.
