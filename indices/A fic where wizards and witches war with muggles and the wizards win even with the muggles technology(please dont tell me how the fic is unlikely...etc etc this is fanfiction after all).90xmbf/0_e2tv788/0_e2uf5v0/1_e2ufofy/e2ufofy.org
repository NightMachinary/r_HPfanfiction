Yeah, I always figured that even if magic was live-streamed to the internet, the magic being unethical in nature, that an actual war would never really start. Isolated hate crimes, sure, but never a true war. Wizards can just waltz into the Prime Minister's office whenever they want, and as you said, do whatever they want with even other presidents.
