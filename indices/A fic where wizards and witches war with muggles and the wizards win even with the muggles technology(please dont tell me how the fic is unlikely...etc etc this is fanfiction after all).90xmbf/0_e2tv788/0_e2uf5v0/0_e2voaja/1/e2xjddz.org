You're assuming that secrecy magic wouldn't affect computers just as much as it affects Muggles. I don't see any reason why it wouldn't. Stuff like the enchantments on Hogwarts keeping it hidden aren't some kind of mind magic - it's not magic cast on the minds of specific Muggles who approach the castle. Rather it's magic affecting the relationship the castle has with the outside world. For example, Hogwarts castle has no location. A computer will be just as unable to plot its location as a Muggle mind would be. Similarly, there's no reason why the spells on the Leaky Cauldron keeping it from being noticed wouldn't work on cameras.
