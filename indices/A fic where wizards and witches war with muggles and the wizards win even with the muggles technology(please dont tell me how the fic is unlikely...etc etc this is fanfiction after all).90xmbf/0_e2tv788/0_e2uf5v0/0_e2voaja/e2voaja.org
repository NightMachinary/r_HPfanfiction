That's true enough for the 90's. The thing with muggles today is that they have computers everywhere, whereas most wizards barely even know what a computer /is/. The more muggle technology advances, the more things will be automated, and even hiding things with magic will cause anomalies that won't be simply dismissed as bugs.

I don't think the muggles could completely defeat the wizards on their own. Wizards are too good at hiding. But muggles could certainly cripple wizard society and make it near impossible to assemble in large groups to organize any resistance. At that point, muggles could be more effective at finding and recruiting muggle-born children than wizards are, and they eventually win by attrition.

On the other side, I think wizards would have an even harder time beating muggles if they started it, given the sheer numbers difference, even if magic was a large advantage over muggle weapons and technology.
