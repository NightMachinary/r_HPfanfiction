It's not cut and dry for either side, honestly. Muggles have technology that may as well be magic and destructive capabilities beyond what's shown wizards are capable of, and would be able to take out unsuspecting wizards with things like snipers and drone strikes. They also outnumber magicals by like 100:1. However, wizards would be able to infiltrate and corrupt with seeming impunity, and would be able to theoretically take out muggle leadership simultaneously with relative ease. But then there's also the question of the magical knowledge of muggles required for such a thing, and the inevitable magical resistance to trying to exterminate muggles which would serve to further complicate things. /Also/, it would be difficult for muggles to unleash the most powerful of their arsenal, such as nukes, against magicals as their major centers of commerce and government are integrated into major population centers.

All in all, it would be a shitshow.
