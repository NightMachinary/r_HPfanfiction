I think you're underestimating one of the key wizarding abilities, which is that of not being found in the first place. You can't snipe someone if you have no idea where they are.

I imagine a Muggles vs wizards war which the wizards did not wish to fight would go like this: Muggles spend years trying to find a single wizard, fail, give up. It later turns out that the Prime Minister's pet cat was an Auror.
