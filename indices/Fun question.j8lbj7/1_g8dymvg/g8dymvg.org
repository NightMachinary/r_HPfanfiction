Oh, I'd totally love to attend at either Dumbledore's time or Tom's time because I suspect that Hogwarts removed some lessons. I'm actually only a little over a year older than James so I would be in my second year during his first, and my fourth year during Albus's first, and my sixth during Lily's first year.

I would probably be a Slytherin because that's most of my traits. I'm not really driven for most things, though I certainly am ambitious for others, so I probably won't make it to Slytherin, and I'm not really interested in schoolwork (because most are not practical) but if my love for reading and practical knowledge means anything then I could make Ravenclaw. I'm less suited toward Hufflepuff because I hate people and I'm not really loud at times, so Gryffindor is less likely. Plus, I lie a lot and I'm not really "loyal" so I don't fit into chivalry.
