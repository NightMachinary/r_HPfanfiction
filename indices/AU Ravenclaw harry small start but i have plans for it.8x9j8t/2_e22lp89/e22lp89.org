I don't read stories with chapter lengths <1k words out of principle. A short prologue chapter like this might be okay, but you'll have to put more work into your other chapters if you'd want to keep my interest.

I hate to agree with the other commentator, but the writing is a bit clumsy.

Keep at it though, learning by doing and all that.
