Oh.

OH.

/OH/

finally I can pull this out of its original posts.

My [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fzSyIRlXGa1_rtjjhxOVogz_l_-5ZuhMFvbBYwdlDeM/edit#gid=0][Masterlist]]! There is slash rec in there, but platonic (non slash/amorous) pairings are indicated. Just pick those with an X under the G column and you're good to go.\\
I've also made an additional sheet for platonic pairing to help having a better view of what's available. It's updated very frequently, and you can see the last updates in the according sheet "Updates Notes".

Edit: for your particular request you may be interested, specifically in linkao3(The Train to Nowhere), linkffn(Warning Signs Read Desolation), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) (and its sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis), Hit the ground running, which has been pulled from ff.com, but the dl link can be found in the masterlist I linked. linkffn(Keep Your Enemy Closer) would also be worth reading.

Harry remains relatively good/neutral, while still joining Voldemort in all of those.
