I don't like Harry getting shipped with Draco because Draco was one of the bad guys in the movies and books. The same reason I don't like Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort, Harry/Grindelwald or Harry/Lucius. Yes, even if Harry gets genderbent.

Harry/Bellatrix or Harry/Narcissa also turns me off.

But I like it when the stories between these characters becomes that of friendship or mentorship. It's a bit rare to find those, though.
