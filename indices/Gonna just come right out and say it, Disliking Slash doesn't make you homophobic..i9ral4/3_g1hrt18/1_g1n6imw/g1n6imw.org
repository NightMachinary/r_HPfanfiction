My personal opinion is that ships are the worst part of fanfiction. Don't get me wrong, I have OTPs and like to read shipping fics, but I also think that ships lessen the quality of fanfic in general for non-romance-centric stories. They distract from the main plot and are often not that well written. I wish AO3 had a way of showing that the ship isn't very central to the plot. In general, I find that M/M means that the ship is going to take over too much if in fics that didn't start off as romance, F/M is default so it's a gigantic toss up whether it's romance or just a side plot, F/F is default romance, Multi is not going to be very good, and Gen half the time is a lie and that "platonic" pairing of "Character A & Character B" is actually just pre-slash. I love AO3, but its reliance on authors to tag properly makes the search useless half the time.
