I'm not asexual, however do agree with you on the gen fics. While I have no problem with the occasional romance in stories, I tend to avoid stories tagged with romance, as any other plot is entirely secondary. Even when the story starts out really really good plotwise, as soon as the romance ie added, the non romance stuff takes a nosedive in quality. I'm not interested in reading Harlequin romance stories.
