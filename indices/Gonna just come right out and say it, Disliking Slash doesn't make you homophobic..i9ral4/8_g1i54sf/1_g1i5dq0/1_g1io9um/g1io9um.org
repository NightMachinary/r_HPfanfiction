pretty much this. i see a story is slash, i don't make any comments or take any other actions, i just move onto something else. though i will admit i will get annoyed with authors who don't specify that there is a non-cannon slash pairing in the story (if it's cannon and you have a problem with it, why the hell are you reading fanfics of it?)
