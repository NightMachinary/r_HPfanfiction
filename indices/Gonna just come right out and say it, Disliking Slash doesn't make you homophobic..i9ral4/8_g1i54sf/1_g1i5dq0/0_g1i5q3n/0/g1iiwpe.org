Truly someone should start up a slash HPFanfiction subreddit. That way slash shippers would have a safe and homey place to make requests and share there favorite stories. I don't necessarily agree that the subreddit is homophobic, but anyone who complains that "Harry isn't gay" has completely missed the boat on what fanfiction is.

Edit: because HARMONY is the OTP IMO
