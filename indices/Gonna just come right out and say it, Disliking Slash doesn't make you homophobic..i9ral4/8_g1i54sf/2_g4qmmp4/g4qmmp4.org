I don't like HP slash fics because the pairings are dogshit.

I don't mind MHA slash, I don't mind Naruto slash, but I kinda hate HP slash.

Draco, Severus, Tom, Bill, Charlie. It's all kinda fucked up. I don't want to read Deku/Shigaraki, I don't want to read Naruto/Orochimaru.

If the main Slash pairing was Harry/Ron, or Fred, George, Seamus, Dean, or whatever else, then there wouldn't be as much hate for the genre in the HP fandom. But the three main slash ships are Snarry, Drarry and fucking Harry/Riddle.

Also, about the "But harry isn't Bi/gay" argument. I refuse to read any Dumbledore or Weasley bashing fics, because I think they're not based on anything in canon. I also don't read "Dark/Grey Harry". Sure, it's fanfic, but it's changing details that I don't like to see changed.\\
So, not wanting to change a character's sexuality in fanfic is just as valid a opinion as not wanting bashing fics, or not wanting "dark harry" fics.
