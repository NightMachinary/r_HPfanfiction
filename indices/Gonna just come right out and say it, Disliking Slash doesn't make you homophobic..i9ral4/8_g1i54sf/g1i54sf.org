No, you get to not enjoy it and that's okay, but the fact that this community AS A WHOLE is known for disliking Slash... is pretty homophobic. I learned pretty quickly not to ask for Drarry, Wolfstar or other slash fics here because people don't take kindly to it.

Not your thing? Ok. But the constant "bUt HaRrY iSn'T bIsExUaL/gAy" comments (per example) is pretty stupid in itself because... this is FANFIC. It's all about reinventing storylines, characters, etc.

I'll probably get downvoted for this but it really needs to be said.
