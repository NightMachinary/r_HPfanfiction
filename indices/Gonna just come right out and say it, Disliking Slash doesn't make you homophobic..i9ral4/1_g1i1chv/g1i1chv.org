I agree with you. Everyone is allowed to have their own personal preferences in what they read. Especially when it's for pleasure or to simply unwind. What makes me frustrated with this sub is the complete disregard to slash topics in general. This is an hpfanfiction sub so all facets of hpfanfiction should be able to be discussed equally and without judgement. Especially when these topics are largely ignored or down voted. It sorta makes a whole subset of readers feel like they don't belong.
