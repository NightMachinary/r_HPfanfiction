That's not what the mods are doing.

They banned a frequently used word with zero warning to appeal to an extreme minority.

They banned the word “trap”.

The word is common in anime circles and is used to describe female appearing male characters, it is not used to describe trans people.

After the first wave of backlash, instead of the mods doing their job and actually listening to what people want, they instead insulted their users and said that they wouldn't roll back the rule.

Throughout all of this, the mods have been doing shady stuff.

The mods secretly changed the rules to allow them to ban lurkers.

The mods went to other subs to complain about the backlash, painting an utterly one sided picture so that people would come to the sub and defend the decision.

The mods initial post about the rule change was set to contest mode so it would be impossible to see how the user base actually felt about the change.

The mods follow up post had the comments disabled.

The mods have started to artificially shadowban users by using a bot, users are now doing constant shadowban checks.

The actual ban of the word itself broke their own rule concerning current politics.

A new subreddit was created for those leaving the sub, the mods banned the name of it.

The mods are on a high horse and refuse to listen to their users.

They aren't doing what they should, they aren't following their own responsibilities.

It's not just the ban of the word itself that's got everyone riled up, it's the response of the mods.
