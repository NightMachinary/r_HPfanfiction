Sorry but it does, at least a bit.

I'll usually avoid weird pairing stories because as soon as you see something like Harry/Dumbledore you know it's going to be bad. But I'll read a story where two people get together in a realistic way - and I don't care if it's m/f, m/m, f/f or anything that adds extra "f"s or "m"s *as long as it's written well*.

Having said that, I do tend to dislike most Gay!Harry stories but because they're shit - not because of the idea. Irritatingly, my go-to story for explaining why seems to have been deleted. It was by "Athey" and was great except when Harry tortured Skeeter to death but that was okay because... reasons. Everything in that story basically broke because of that.

But TL;DL, if your only reason to dislike a story is "teh ghey" then... yeah fuck off.
