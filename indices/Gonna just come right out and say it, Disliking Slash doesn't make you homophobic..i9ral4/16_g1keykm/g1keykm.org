Not wanting a single queer couple anywhere in the story is homophobic. Not wanting the main characters to be queer is a personal preference to some extent but it's also privilege. If you're straight and you get frustrated by the amount of slash fic in the fandom, imagine being queer and going into a regular bookshop. It's so much worse. If queer people only read queer literature they'd struggle to find books and miss out on classics. Imagine if someone said ‘oh I haven't read any Jane Austen because I don't read books where the main couple is straight' that's what it's like if you won't read some of the best fics in the fandom because the main couple is queer. (To be clear, not liking a certain couple is fine “I started reading pride and prejudice but I didn't like Mr Darcy so I stopped reading”)

The fics that make me the most uncomfortable are the ones where EVERY. SINGLE. CHARACTER. has to be paired off by the end of the story and all in het relationships. To me that screams homophobic author.

Personally, I frequently start gen series that start in first year without checking what the pairings are going to be because if it's written well enough then the couple should make sense by the time they get together.
