Personally I don't like slash because I can't picture Harry in a gay relationship, maybe Ron Draco because it's obvious they're secretly in love with each other, and for me it's the main reason that Ron went with Hermione, because Draco showed clear dislike for her, it's obviously to make him jealous xD
