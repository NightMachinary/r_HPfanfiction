Meh. Their first comment could be read as deflection. That's why I asked point-blank - do they treat older female/young male stories the same as they do older male/young female?

Respectfully, you're also barking up the wrong tree trying to impress the seriousness of pedophilia on me. The whole reason I'm not active on this sub is it's full of dudebros who think Harry/Bellatrix is totally hot and fine but Hermione/Snape is gross.

But the person you're defending has said elsewhere in this comment section before the mods removed it, that they think homosexuality is unnatural so I dunno if this is the hill you wanna die on.
