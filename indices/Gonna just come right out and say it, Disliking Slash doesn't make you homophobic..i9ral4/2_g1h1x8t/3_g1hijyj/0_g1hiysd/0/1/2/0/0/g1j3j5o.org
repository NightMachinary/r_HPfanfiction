Never said I picked a hill to die on. I don't think it's terribly out of place to point out you came across as a bit hostile, honestly kind of bordering on flat out accusatory that it must be okay to the person if the roles were reversed. No such thing was said or even implied. It didn't read as a deflection to me, though text can be ready differently by anyone so I'm not going to say you're wrong for how you interpreted it, I myself just saw the answer in the response without it being explicitly stated 🤷🏻‍♀️
