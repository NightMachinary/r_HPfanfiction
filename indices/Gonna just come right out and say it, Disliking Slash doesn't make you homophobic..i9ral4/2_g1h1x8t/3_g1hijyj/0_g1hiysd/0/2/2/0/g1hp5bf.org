Funny, I find your support of torture sentences disgusting and morally repugnant. Due to the same reason I abhor the death sentence. What if an innocent get's erroneously convicted?

Go watch the Green Mile.

Also, are you saying that all, and I do mean /all/ relationships between 16 year olds and adults are unhealthy? Bold claim, quite hard to prove aswell. Impossible, I'd wager. It's an absolute statement, and nothing is absolute in the real world.

Also, fiction is a reflection of the real world. Fact is, those kinds of relationships exist in the real world and, as such, they also exist in the fictional world. And there is nothing morally wrong with writing/reading such a fiction /regardless/ of the real world morality. That was my point, that you completely missed.
