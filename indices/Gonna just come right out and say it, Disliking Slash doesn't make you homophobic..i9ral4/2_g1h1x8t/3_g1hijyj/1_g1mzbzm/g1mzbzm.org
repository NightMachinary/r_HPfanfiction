I actually don't tend to mind Harry/Remus, Harry/Snape, Harry/Sirius, or even Harry/Tonks, but I /do/ dislike Harry/Voldemort. Harry/Riddle is fine, though. If he's diary Riddle, that is.

Harry is usually sixteen or seventeen in these fics, though, which makes him either an adult or past the age of consent.
