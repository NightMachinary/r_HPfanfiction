I don't read slash because the pairings are often just strange, and often creepy, to me.\\
Harry/Tom, Harry/Sev, Harry/Draco, Harry/Charlie or Bill, they're all so... fucked up. And those are the pairings that pop up the most if the fic mentions it's slash in the description.

I don't read Hermione/Sev, Hermione/Draco, Harry/Bella, Narcissa or whatever fucked up het pairing either, so it's not like it's just Slash that I don't read.

Like, if I go to [[https://ff.net][fanfiction.net]] right now, and look at fics updated in the last month, all those slash fics are just fucked up pairings, or the description mentions Dumbledore bashing and other pet peeves that are just bad writing.

Sure, there are good Slash fics, and I've read a few, but in general I've found that most popular Slash pairings are... just horrible.
