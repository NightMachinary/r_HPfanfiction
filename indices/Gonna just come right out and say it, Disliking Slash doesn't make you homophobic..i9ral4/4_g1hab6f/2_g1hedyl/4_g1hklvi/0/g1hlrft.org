I suppose that's true if you also follow the canon pairings, but people re-write plenty of elements of characters to make het pairings work or have chemistry where there was none.

I think your description fundamentally describes my point - queer people often have little or no option when it comes to reading and are perfectly capable of relating to characters with a different sexuality. Straight people who've grown up with het as default believe queer characters are so different to them as to be unidentifiable.
