Fair, I'm just really bad at explaining what I believe. And I may or may not be always quite agressive.

Also I never said he was wrong, or at least I believe I didn't, I just tried to explain my point of view. Which is quite flawed, as are all points of view anyway. I'll just go on my merry way, having learnt an important lesson.

I really suck at writing things.
