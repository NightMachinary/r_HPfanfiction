Heh, I think the only way to stop drama is to stop trying to make drama. That's why even through I may complain and bitch around a bit, trying to explain things that I don't fully understand, making sure my views are heard, in the end I don't really care. Unless the author tries to holds me hostage until I say his fic is great because it's slash in which case I'd have worst problems than just gays people kissing in fictional writings.

But quite frankly, I don't know if that's how I came across with all my posts, but I don't hate slash fics. I don't even dislike them - they're just a bit like the "dark" or "indy" tags : warnings that something I don't particularly care about is gonna be one of the main selling point of the fic. And sometimes, writers don't know how to tone it down so it's not really good, and combined with the fact it's slash romance, it puts me off. But it's because it's /slash/ *romance*, and not because it's *slash* /romance/. Romance as a whole seems like a bad main selling point to me, and the slash bit just adds to it because I can't even identify to it. (I don't know if I'm expressing myself correctly here so I'm gonna stop)

I'm pretty sure everyone has been a cringe writer at first. Hell, I remember the first fanfic I ever wrote, which I never posted ; not a self-insert (thankfully for my ego) but a really bad OP OC. I still have some sketches, and nowadays I still use him as a villain in my writings because I wrote what ultimately was a better antagonist than hero lead.

It's kinda sad that you burnt your first creations - you should always keep them to see how far you've come. Sometimes, I look back, and I'm sitting there, just thinking "wow, I really sucked, THAT was my best main character ?". I also started writing female lead characters only after a bit of maturing - and also because I absolutely wanted to explore a constantly drunk 14 years old asshole, and I wanted to play the sole female character of this RP game we were doing with friends. That really helped. A lot. And now it's my favourite (and most fleshed-out) character. And also an antagonist. Kinda. My story is complicated and a big lot of bullshit.

Aaaaand I have gone off the rail again. Yay me.

Also I misused the word "asexual" because in my language "asexuel" means a totally different thing, so I'm always confused - so I'm sorry about it.
