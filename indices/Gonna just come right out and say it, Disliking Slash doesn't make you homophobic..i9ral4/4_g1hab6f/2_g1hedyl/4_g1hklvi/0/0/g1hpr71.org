It's not "because I've grown with het as default" that I can't identify with a non-het relationship. As a matter of fact, I grew up with a good amount of non-het influence in my family, and it never really did more than make me go "huh, you're gay then ?".

Through to be fair, if we're going by personal experience, then I can't read ship fics because I'm asexual at best, or aromantic, never cared enough to discover which one it was. And after ten seconds of research I know even less because apparently, for what I'm talking about, *in the english language, it's not spelled asexual*, so I'm now quite confused. So let's go with aromantic, that's the same idea with the other thing I was thinking of anyway.

I may have gone off the rail there, so let's go back to what I was trying to say : if you're talking about "not being able to read slash because of personal experience", then I just shouldn't be able to read pairings at all. If you're going with influences in my life, I shouldn't have any difficulties reading slash. Which I kinda do, but not that much ?

​

So let's back off a bit, just so I can approach this at a better angle and explain how I see it.

I think we do not swear off slash fics just like that. It's just that it's kinda less enticing, because it's one of the biggest changes you could "inflict" upon a character - making them suddenly thirsty for the same sex, I mean. And depending on what you're trying to read, it can really makes you believe "to much is to much".

For example, to stay in HP communauty : Harry and Draco are as straight as can be depicted without stating it. So, to pair them up, you either need to genderbend one of them, or to use the "homophiby beam" on both of them. Or my personal favourite (lies), genderbend both of them THEN turn them gay.

In a way, all of those options sucks because you're changing the character(s) at its or their core. Especially if your fic is there for the pairing.

​

Aaaaand now to be honest with you it's been like 15 minutes since I started writing this and I'm kinda lost with what I was trying to say so I'ma cut it there with these words :

Slash isn't cringe but writing slash just because gayz kinda is

(And to be honest, if you see slash in the same way as you see Dark, Indy Harry, then it all starts to make sense as to why people don't like it : as a plot device, if it's the only thing you have, which is quite common in fics, it sucks)

---[Part 2]---

Now something else, yeah there's not many LGBTQ+ in medias but that's kinda normal, because even IRL the LGBTQ+ are a minority, like less than 5% total I believe ? (I don't have the exact numbers but I'm pretty sure that it's still a minority)

So it's a loop, people don't read/write LGBTQ+ content because the majority is not, so the LGBTQ+ write their own to have some, but the majority don't read because it's far removed from what they feel at their core.

​

I'm done I wrote to much I really need to stop going on tangents.
