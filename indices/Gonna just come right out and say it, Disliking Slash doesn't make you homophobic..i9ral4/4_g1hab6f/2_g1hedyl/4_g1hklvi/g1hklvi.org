It's great that you can read fics where the main pairing isn't of your sexuality, but uhhh ... Many people, myself included, likes to identify themselves with the MC, and that's why slash puts them off. It's not an issue, it's the same as not wanting to read a fic because the MC is unlikable : you can't identify yourself in the MC, therefore you're never really into the story.

At least that's the way I see it. It may be that slash in the fandoms I follow never really works because the characters are canonically as het as can be so to write slash you need to massively tweak the characters.
