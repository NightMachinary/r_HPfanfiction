  Homosexuality is not normal, it is an abnormal behavior.

... I am quite surprised you haven't (yet?) been down-voted for saying this. I mean, from a certain point of view, for a certain definition of "normal", it's true; anything with prevalence of under 5% could be called "not the norm". But I'm surprised you aren't seeing backlash.

I wouldn't call myself bisexual, but I have a theory that everyone ought to be theoretically capable of it. I mean, love, including romantic love, is something you can deliberately cultivate and develop, yes? So being utterly incapable of loving anyone of a particular gender, whether it's your own or another, doesn't seem to make sense.

(Similarly it seems like anyone could theoretically acquire a taste for slash fiction if they had the motivation to do so and invested the time.)
