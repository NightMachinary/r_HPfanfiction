  Though by definition they are not straight if they can love romantically, Eros, someone of their own sex.

That's kind of my point, really. We pigeonhole people as gay or straight, but I don't think the vast majority of people are actually incapable of leaving the pigeonhole. If those labels mean that you're literally incapable of romantically loving someone of a non-matching gender, then I think that both "straight" and "gay" are disabilities - but I think very few people are actually afflicted with either one.

In practice, of course, as long as monogamy is the norm, /behaviour/ can be described as either gay or straight. /People/, though, are more complex.

It's like, you can write either left-handed or right-handed, and we call people left-handed or right-handed based on what comes easier to them, but just about anyone ought to be able to learn to write with the other hand given enough practice. If you absolutely can't, then there's something weird going on.
