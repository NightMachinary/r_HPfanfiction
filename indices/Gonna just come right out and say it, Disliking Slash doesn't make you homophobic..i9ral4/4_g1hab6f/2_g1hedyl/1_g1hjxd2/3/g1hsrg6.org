  they generalize slash niches to all of slash, like saying all of it is DE pairings
#+end_quote

Literally the three out of the four most popular slash pairings on AO3 are exactly that, Death Eater whitewashing and revisionism. Namely Harry/Malfoy, Harry/Snape and Harry/Riddle. And they make up over half of all slash fics in between them (61804/113982). Although to be fair, some of them might have the whole thing as rape and therefore not whitewashing.

I did not know that 54% was a small niche, because the word I would use there is absolute majority. And that's just with the 3 most popular characters, throw in the other Death Eaters and you are probably beyond 60%.
