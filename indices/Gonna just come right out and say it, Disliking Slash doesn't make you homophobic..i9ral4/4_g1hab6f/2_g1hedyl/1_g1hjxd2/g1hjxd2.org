i feel like a lot of the language around slash being unreadable also centers around critiquing a generalized vague notions the user has of slash fandom - vague since often the person critiquing slash has not interacted with slash very much.

rather than talking about slash fics themselves, like they would any other het fics, where some fics are bad and other fics are good, they generalize slash niches to all of slash, like saying all of it is DE pairings or whitewashing or pwp etc.

it would be akin to saying all het fics are indy!harry curbstomps, or harems.

slash critique also centers around vastly generalizing the people who write slash & why - it's all "girls looking to fetishize men". and generalizing the people who read it.... as just all being straight teenage girls. lol. despite, again, the person critiquing rarely having interacted with people who read and write slash.

why not just focus on the fic than get trapped in this weird narrative of trying to show how slash is bad because of teenage girls. which is also rlly odd?????? whats wrong w teenage girls.

and to me it frankly often feels like skirting around the issue of why it is that people find it uncomfortable to read about two guys liking eachother, when it's just harry/cedric, 1899 albus/gellert, harry/ron, etc.

as a side note, often harry/ron gets lip service as the "good pairing" or "allowed pairing" in a way that comes off really strange to me.
