There isn't a whole lot of it, but Golden Trio OT3 is a thing. It's basically a Harry/Ron/Hermione dynamic where is Harry admitting his feelings for Ron and Ron admitting his feelings for Hermione and Hermione basically saying she's been in love with both of them since she was 11. I wish there were more of it because it's a very poly-positive ship.
