What I find puzzling is normalisation of not reading slash because you don't like it. If it's PWP, I understand - you're only going to look for porn you're into.

Queer people (myself included) read het stories - fic or otherwise - all the time without objecting to it.

I do think there is a fundamental issue with avoiding fics because you (not you specifically) don't want to see gay relationships.
