I'm a straight man who won't read slash sex scenes. I'm also a straight man who won't read straight sex scenes.

I'm tired of the constant inundation of sex. Most of the time if feels shoehorned in without regard to the pacing and plot. Not to mention the ages of the characters.

One, maybe two scenes that I can skip past, fine. I can deal with. My limit is three. There's no reason stories involving kids should have more sex than a romantic show aimed at adults, especially considering how old most Harry Potter fanfic writers are now.

I'm married and have a great sex life. It doesn't mean I want to read about a bunch of kids having sex, especially if it's with adults decades their senior.
