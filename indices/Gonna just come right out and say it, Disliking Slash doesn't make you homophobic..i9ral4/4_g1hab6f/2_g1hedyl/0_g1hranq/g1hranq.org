Let me point you to the Rizzoli and Isles fandom. Two female characters with (only) straight relationships in canon. But, woe be the author who dare post a het fic about either one of them (or even a gen, really anything that is not the two of them in a lesbian relationship). Authors have gotten bullied off platforms over it. It's ridiculous, really.

Avoiding fics because you don't want to spend your free time reading them is fine. Being nasty to people who don't see your ship is NOT. I know multiple people that'll only read slash, and others who won't read MC slash. And others that'll read both, or sometimes. All's good as long as you keep respectful towards each other.

Now, underage or non-con stuff I think gets more leeway for criticism or snark and idealising it can be very problematic. Whether that be school-aged admm or mmhg or sshg or snarry or harry-bellatrix or whatever other pairing regardless of gender.
