I think it can really depend on your perspective. A well written fanfic which involves a large portion of Harry trying to get with Draco would be of no interest to me, slash or no slash. Just like any fic where it is primarily about unrequited love, or anything that is just PWP. I want to read a storyline, with well developed characters. If that character happens to be gay, then that is fine, but if the author has focused on a person's sexuality as the main focus of that characters personality in the story, then that's where I find I don't enjoy a story. People are more than their sexuality. I enjoy reading HP because they aren't romance novels with a side of a problem/resolution, and I want the same if I'm reading fanfic.
