I dunno if the bot still works, so here it is: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15465966/chapters/35902410][The Second String by Eider_Down]].

It's very well-written, and satisfies the itch people on this sub have for Harry fics with time or dimension travel. I have seen it being looked over on this sub however, as it has a Harry/Gideon relationship. (Which doesn't feature until halfway through, and the romance is not the point of the story.)
