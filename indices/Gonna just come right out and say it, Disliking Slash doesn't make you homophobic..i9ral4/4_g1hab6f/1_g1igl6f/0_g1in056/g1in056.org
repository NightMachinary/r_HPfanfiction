I really hate people crapping on this story too, especially since Harry doesn't even meet Gideon until just past halfway (I think). The author of the story made it explicitly clear that they were going to focus more on the plot than the romance. Seeing people hate on the story they haven't even read just because it has a slash pairing you only see towards the end of the fic is really sad

Edit: spelling
