Disclaimer: I don't hate gay people and I accept them like every other person around me.

Slash that is denoted in the summary of a fanfiction is usually an indicator for me to stay away from the fic, because the times I tried one of those they were overly filled with sexual themes and in some cases depicted not only borderline criminal stuff.

That is not to say that it is true for all of them. Many are probably good stories without these problems, but when I am on the search for a good read I go by my own experiences. The best slash contents I read were the ones that simply so happened to be in the story without being denoted. They felt like a natural inclusion to the story and not like something that was tagged onto pre-existing characters and felt almost cartoon-ish.
