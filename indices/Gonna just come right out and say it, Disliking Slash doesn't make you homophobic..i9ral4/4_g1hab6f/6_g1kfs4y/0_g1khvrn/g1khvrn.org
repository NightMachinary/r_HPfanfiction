you have a valid point but there are countless het fics that are the same. like why write of a fic because of the sexuality of the characters, people have got it in their minds that slash is some kind of separate genre of fanfiction when it's really not.

i've read both, i fic slash more rewarding for me as it's nice to have queer representation, 9 time out of 10 fics that are recommended on [[/r/hpslashfic][r/hpslashfic]] are very very good.
