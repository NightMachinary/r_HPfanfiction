Yeah. Fics like Crammer, Of a Linear Circle, Of Wizards and Heroes... people miss out on great stories because they just don't want slash. I HATE Snape as a character, but I've read Linear Circle like 6 times because I love the hell out of the story.

A lot of the resistance against reading slash is upbringing, I think. I know that it took me a long time to get over my avoidance of them, partially because of the whole 'women who read slash are just fetishizing it' thing (which is hilarious in retrospect because asexual), but also because I was raised catholic by homophobic/racist parents. It's baggage, and I eventually trashed it, but dammit it's /hard to do./
