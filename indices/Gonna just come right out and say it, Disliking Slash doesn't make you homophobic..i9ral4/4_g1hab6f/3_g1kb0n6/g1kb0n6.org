/Worm/ is a fantastic piece of writing, yet you will find many thousands of people who read fanfics set in that world yet /refuse/ to actually read Worm itself. Why? Because it's a very dark piece of writing. If they aren't gonna enjoy reading it, why would they do it? Reading is something we do for /fun/.
