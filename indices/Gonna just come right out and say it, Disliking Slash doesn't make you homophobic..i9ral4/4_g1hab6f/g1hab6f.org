my issue comes when you rec a fic or suggest one because it is so so so well written for example, hermione grangers hogwarts crammer for delinquents on the run or turn, theyre incredibly well written, a true gift to fanfiction but people won't read it because it's slash? like why would i recommend this if it was trash. i'm very very picky with my fics but i've been downvoted to hell for suggesting fics that happen to be slash.

i'm not reading fics for gay stuff, it's nice to have some queer literature as a queer person but that isn't the driving force. it's frustrating and childish. when people won't read a well written fic bc of slash- this feels like it could be homophobic.

it's the same in the media, people won't watch series because they have a gay relationship etc, it's honestly angering as a queer person.

i agree that some shippers of slash, particularly drarry are fetishising gay relationships but this is just as bad as people refusing to read a slash fic just because it's slash.
