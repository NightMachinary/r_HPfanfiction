First you dislike slash without qualification, then you only dislike certain tropes or bad writing found equally in het fics. And now apparently you do like slash. Seems a lot like you got called out as a homophobe based on what you said, and now you're scrambling around to justify it.

If that genuinely is your view, then you should go and edit your OP to specifically say that "disliking slash" isn't even the topic under discussion. You only wanted to talk about disliking certain pairings and tropes which are found just as much in het stories.
