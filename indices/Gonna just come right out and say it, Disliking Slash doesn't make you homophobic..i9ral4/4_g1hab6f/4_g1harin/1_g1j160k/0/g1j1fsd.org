I have pointed out multiple times that I can barely stand any story that pulls what alot of slash fics do, I will not go out of my way to read slash, but I still have a few pairings that I still read that I have pointed out on here multiple times before, Harry/Ron and Harry/Cedric are two of the main ones.
