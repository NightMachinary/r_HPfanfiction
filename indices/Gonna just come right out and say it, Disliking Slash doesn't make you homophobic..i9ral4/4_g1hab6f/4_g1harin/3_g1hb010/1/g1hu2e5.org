  like i don't understand, how can you write of a fic just because of the relationships
#+end_quote

Not the guy above, but I tend to insert myself into the characters. So if the male character is gay, there is a big disconnect which throws me out of the immersion since (from my perspective), why would you want to bang some dude if women exist? And yes, I also vastly prefer lesbian PoVs for that reason, wanting a woman is something I can relate to. Hell, most male tropes are utterly worn out on male characters (Macho soldier, strong leader and so on) but are refreshing if the character is female since it is rarely done.

If the story has many switching PoVs with no thoughts (just dialogue and exposition) or minimal romance, I don't mind gay characters, even main ones (Frederick the Great in Arose out of the Azure Main over at alternatehistory.com would be a good example). But fanfiction is not written that way in 99/100 cases. It usually follows the MC.

Also, more specifically to the HP fandom, the only interesting guy in Harry's age group is Harry, with the next two being Sirius (fucking your dead best friend's son would be very weird) and James (only interesting due to his relationship to Lily), followed by Moody (again, no suitable partner in the age bracket).
