I don't hate slash - I've written a Harry/Ron/Hermione relationship myself - but I hate the Drarry, Snarry and especially the Tomarry pairings. I don't want to read stories where a big part of the plot focuses on a relationship with a Death Eater. If you need to whitewash your Death Eater for the story to work anyway, and add time travel because the age gap is too much for you (never mind the "I killed your parents" stuff), why not write a Harry/Ron story from the start?
