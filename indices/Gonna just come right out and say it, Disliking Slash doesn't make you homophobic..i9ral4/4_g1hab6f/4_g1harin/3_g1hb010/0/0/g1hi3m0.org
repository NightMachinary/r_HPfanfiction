so this isn't an issue with slash then... like there's other slash pairings other than them. you cannot say slash and only mean those three ships you don't like. slash pairings also include cedric and harry, dumbledore and grinderwald, luna and ginny, i think i've seen a neville and ron one (adorable). generalising like this is not a good move. there are also plenty of het death eater parings as well... like hermione and tom etc so please don't make it about sexuality when it's just about the themes with in the fic
