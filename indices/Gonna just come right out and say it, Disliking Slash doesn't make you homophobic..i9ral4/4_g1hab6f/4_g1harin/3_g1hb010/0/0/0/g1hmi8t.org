To be fair, Tomarry, Snarry, and Draco/Harry are the three biggest slash ships out there. The rest might as well be a footnote in comparison. If the biggest representation of your fandom is just unpalatable, you can't really complain when people don't like it.

I have no problem with Remus/Sirius, Cedric/Harry, etc.

I also hate Snape/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, Draco/Ginny, Lucius/Hermione, Ron/Hermione, etc. Basically, any bigoted/older character with Hermione. I tend to ship Harmony, but I can deal with Hermione/Neville or other non-bigoted characters.

Also, Tom Riddle with anyone is just fucked.
