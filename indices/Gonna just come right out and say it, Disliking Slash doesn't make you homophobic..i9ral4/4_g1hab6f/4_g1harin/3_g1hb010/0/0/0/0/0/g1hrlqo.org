There's a pretty large pool of evidence that Harry is bi, honestly. He describes a /lot/ of guys as "handsome", waxes about how pretty they are and such. I swear every time Cedric is mentioned Harry thinks about how cool/handsome/beautiful/pretty/chiseled his eyes/eyebrows/jawline/figure is. A lot of other characters are also described as "could be handsome, if".

Much of it can be attributed to the series being written by a middle-aged heterosexual woman, but I like using the watsonian explanation more.
