I think it's the fact that a decent amount of people fetishising gay relationships that makes reading slash a bit of a coin toss for a lot of straight readers.

You have a chance of having a decent wholesome plot driven story, with little bits of romance

or you have a chance of having a Romance filled schlockfest where Harry and Draco pull the "will they won't they" bullshit every five minutes.

I can barely stand that in Het stories so why would I read it in Slash, especially since I don't enjoy slash generally to begin with?
