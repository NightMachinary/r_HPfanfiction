I made this thread in response to a comment someone else made on another thread, i'd do the same if someone had said "disliking Het pairings makes you a heterophobe"

Het fix, like i slightly touched on in the original comment but didn't elaborate can be just as bad and as much of a coin toss as Slash, I have plenty of instances where i've opened a story only to nope out because of shit that I don't like in regards to the het pairing.

A good example is theres a fic where Hermione fucking dies and Harry ends up fucking her mother because "she looks like her" and her mother goes with it because her Husband dies and "She needs someone to love"

it's cringey bullshit, and a coin toss the same way a good amount of slash fiction is.

People need to get it through their damn head that Fanfiction AS A WHOLE is spotty at best and their is a reason most of the fics that are recommended on this reddit are the same fics every day.
