> reading slash a bit of a coin toss for a lot of straight readers

Exactly this! I'm cool with reading a slash romance. I'm not looking to read slash smut. It can be incredibly hard to tell the difference from a description and it's not always a clear line.

I can only imagine this is equally annoying for gay readers reading het stories that become surprise het smut with no warning.

I guess the solution would be better tags but we all know how inconsistent authors are with tagging.
