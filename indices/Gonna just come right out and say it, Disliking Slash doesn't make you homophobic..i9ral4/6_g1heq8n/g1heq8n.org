I don't usually read stories where the main couple is heterosexual bc I'm not straight and I don't want to see that, but I don't go talking about it all the time or downvote fics that have them. It's also very weird how defensive some people are or how they don't seem to tolerate even a hint of slash. Maybe you don't like Drarry, so you wouldn't click on a story where that's the main pairing, that's completely understandable, but if you don't like slash to the point where you can't tolerate the author making Seamus and Dean a background couple... that's homophobia imo.
