I can't see myself ever being with a girl but I still read straight fics. Just saying that to make a small point.

I totally agree with you, though. If you don't like something, just ignore it. There's no reason to bash on someone for pairing Harry with Draco over Harry with Daphne. I personally like both and will devour any good fic with them that I can find. And no one sees me hating people and downvoting them because they like to pair Harry with Voldemort because I can't understand how you can pair Harry with Voldemort who's like fifty years his senior and bloody insane. (Tom Riddle/Harry is pretty cool, though.)

And being homophobic toward background pairings is /so/ annoying. Like, what are they doing to you!? And I'm actually genuinely surprised when I find people who down ship Seamus in Dean because it's so obvious even though Dean did date Ginny that one time.
