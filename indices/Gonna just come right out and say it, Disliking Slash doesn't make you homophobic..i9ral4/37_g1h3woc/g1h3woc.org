My reason for avoiding slash here is different. I specifically avoid slash on the HP fandom despite reading it in other fandoms because here, it tends to be one of two things: either having the romance completely overshadow the plot (drarry), or sounding like it's written by a sex offender (65 y/o voldemort possissively petting 12 y/o Harry, anyone? Or worse, "You just think you're straight and I'll molest you until you change your mind"). Like I just don't get what it is with this particular fandom. Obviously there are some good slash fics, but if I went through my entire stash of links I'd probably be able to count ones I bookmarked on my fingers, and only one comes to mind right away.
