I'm straight, but even I can tell when slash is written by someone who has no clue about slash relationships (or healthy relationships in general), which is unfortunately what a lot of slash fiction on HP is. There is a difference between reading someone like [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/esama/pseuds/esama][esama's]] fics and reading a preteen's take of relationships.
