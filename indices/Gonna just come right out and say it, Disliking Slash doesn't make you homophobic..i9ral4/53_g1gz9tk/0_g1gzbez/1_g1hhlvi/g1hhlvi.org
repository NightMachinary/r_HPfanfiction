Because almost all of them have to go through huge hoops inorder to sexualize non sexualized characters. There was only one fic that i enjoyed that was a slash TMR / HP but the main character was a necromancer who was developed as thw past lover of TMR and reincarnated into HP. I care way more about the magic of the world than petty sexual pairings. HP verse didnt even delve into relationships so that isnt part of the story i focus on. I care about magic. ppl can downvote me its fine. Easy way to filter most bad stories is to look at pairings and keep scrolling
