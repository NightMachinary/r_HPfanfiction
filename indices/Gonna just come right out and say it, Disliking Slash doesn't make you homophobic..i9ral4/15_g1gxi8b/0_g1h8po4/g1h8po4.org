I don't read slash in fiction with a main PoV since I tend to immerse myself in those and try to follow their thoughts. The MC pining after a guy is immersion breaking since I don't like guys. Same reason I don't like to read in the perspective of heterosexual women.

If there's an alternating PoV which is aimed at telling a story rather than telling the story of a character. Gay Frederik the Great in "Arose from out the Azure Main" was a joy to read because the narrative was never from inside Freddy's head, thinking about how hot some guy was.
