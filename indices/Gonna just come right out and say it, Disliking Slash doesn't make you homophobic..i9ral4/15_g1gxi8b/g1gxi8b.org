I think the attitude of saying disliking slash makes you homophobic comes from the fact that a disturbingly large chunk of the fandom think that its completely ok to say "If a fic has even a hint of slash, I hit X. It absolutely disgusts me."

Someone saying "I don't really read slash pairs, they don't interest me." is very different and much more reasonable than saying "Slash is disgusting."

If reading about two guys holding hands disgusts you, then...you're a homophobe.

And there's also a world of difference between "I only read Gen fics" and "I don't read slash".

But the one that really, really annoys me is "I don't read slash because its OOC". Like...guess what, most of what gets written involves people acting out of character. Ron not being a jealous berk is out of character. Hermione having proper social skills is out of character. Harry being remotely interested in self improvement is out of character. Almost every fic involves people being out of their canon character in some way. And the ones that don't have things that aren't canon happening - its fanfiction, its never going to be exactly the same as the books and criticising it for not being canon is just silly.
