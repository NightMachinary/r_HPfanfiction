  a disturbingly large chunk of the fandom think that its completely ok to say "If a fic has even a hint of slash, I hit X. It absolutely disgusts me."

A disturbingly large chunk of the fandom is disgusted by slash because a disturbingly large chunk of the slash fandom consists of H/Snape, H/Draco, H/Voldemort, H/Lucius. All characters a large chunk of the fandom finds disgusting. In 18 years of reading fanfiction I've read a single H/D story I enjoyed and a single H/Voldemort. I've happily read Harry/Regulus and Harry/Blaise stories, however.

  If reading about two guys holding hands disgusts you, then...you're a homophobe.

Accepting homosexuality does not equate celebrating it. To give you a personal example, I enjoy the fact that gay pride parades take place, as they are a sign of a well functioning democratic society. Would I take part in one? No, because I have things to do that I enjoy more in my spare time.
