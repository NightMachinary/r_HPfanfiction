  I've happily read Harry/Regulus and Harry/Blaise stories, however.

So you see a difference between Harry/Death Eater Old Enough To Be His Father and Harry/Different Death Eater Old Enough To Be His Father? Cause Regulus is old enough to be his father, and was a Death Eater. How is that different from Snape or Lucius?

As for Blaise, he's a blood supremacist just like Draco. So I don't really see why Harry/Blaise is cool with you and Harry/Draco isn't.

  Accepting homosexuality does not equate celebrating it.

You'll note that said if it disgusts you, you're homophobic. I don't mind whether you genuinely don't care about it, because that is different from being disgusted by it.

Since you gave a personal example, I will as well. One of my best friends parents were watching Torchwood with him a number of years ago. The first time that Ianto and Captain Jack kiss on screen, my friends mum ran to the toilet and vomited, my friends dad shrugged and went back to his cross word puzzle. 2 very different reactions, neither of which is effusively celebratory or positive, but only one of which is homophobic.
