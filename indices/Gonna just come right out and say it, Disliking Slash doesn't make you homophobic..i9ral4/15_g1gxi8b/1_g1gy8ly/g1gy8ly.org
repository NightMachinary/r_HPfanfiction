The I don't read slash because it's OOC thing makes SOME sense but at the same time, why would you read fanfiction if you want characters to be completely true to form? some of the most fun fanfics I've read where because the Author changed Harry or Ron's character to fit with their vision of how the character should be.

Hell most fanfiction has Harry be OOC anyway because they have him be a super proactive Protagonist when he has never really been one, Harry's a reactive Protagonist who tends to wait for something to happen before he acts, at least in the first 5 books.
