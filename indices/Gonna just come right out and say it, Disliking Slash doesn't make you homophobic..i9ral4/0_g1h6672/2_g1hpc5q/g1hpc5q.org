Yep I got down voted on that thread mentioned above because I laid out my personal opinion about the drarry ship (and dramione and harmony). I thought the down vote was for bad posts, not for ones you just didn't agree with! Not that its a big deal really, and I'm not here for the karma, but it kind of hurt my feelings a bit that people couldn't take the time to explain why they disagreed with my opinion... I was hoping they would that's why I posted! I love debating HP (and other fandoms of course) but to just blindly slap a down vote seems nasty and passive to me for some reason. It's a pretty negative environment around here to mention any ship at all it seems like. I like understanding why people would pair off characters I wouldn't normally, because it might open me up for reading something new. That's why I follow the generic hpfanfic sub as well as the dramione sub.
