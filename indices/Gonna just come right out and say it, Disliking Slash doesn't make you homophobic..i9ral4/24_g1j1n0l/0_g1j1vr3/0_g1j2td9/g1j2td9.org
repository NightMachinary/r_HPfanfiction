  So, if a gay person doesn't want to read het romance because it's a het pairing it's Heterophobic?

Yes. Spoiler alert: there's not a gay person like that out there. We've all been inundated with near unceasing het romances in fiction our entire lives (forced down our throats, if you will). Everyone is very much used to them and quite capable of dealing with them without the instinctive dislike so common in reverse.

It's not a question of demographics. A movie with a black main character isn't meant just for black people, any more than a story with a gay main character should be restricted to gay readers. The fact that you think only gay people are in the demographic for any slash fiction is just as homophobic.
