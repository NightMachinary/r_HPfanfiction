So, if a gay person doesn't want to read het romance because it's a het pairing it's Heterophobic?

Not being intrested in a gay pairing because you don't fit the general democraphic for said pairing doesn't make you a homophobe, that's like saying a boy who doesn't like cartoons targeted towards girls is sexist, or a boy who likes My Little Pony is gay.
