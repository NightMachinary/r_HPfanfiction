The act of posting shit like this on the internet to incite arguments that have happened three million times before is stupid, unnecessary, redundant, and is historically linked to bigotry.

You're absolutely right in that disliking slash doesn't make you homophobic. It's your personal preference what genres you want to read. That's established. I wish people would save the downvotes they give slash recommendations for the actually bigoted posts.
