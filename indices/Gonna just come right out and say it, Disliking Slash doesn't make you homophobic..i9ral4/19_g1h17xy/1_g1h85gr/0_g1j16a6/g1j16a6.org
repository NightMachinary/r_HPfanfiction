Any Draco that either Harry or Hermione would date is practically an OC.

JKR /literally/ modeled him as a Hitler Youth, you can see it in the movies.

He never shows anything other than bigotry, hatred, and only backs off out of self-preservation.

He basically turned to the whole school and said something to the effect of "And you will be next -perjorative term equivalent to whatever the nazis called jews-"

As he grew up he only got worse, he supported Voldemort, the genocidal maniac, from the beginning, he knew his goals and actively went with them, he only started backing off when he realized he and his family could be in danger too.

People say he was feeling guilty in the sixth book, but all evidence points he was only afraid of failing and being punished by Voldemort.

AFAIK he had no redeeming qualities, at all.

I enjoy some fics where Harry befriends him, either by turning him into a decent person when he's young or when the Malfoys are not evil.

But I know that's just a different Draco, practically an OC with almost nothing of the actual character.

At least explain why he's different.

It's almost the same thing with Daphne, BUT, she's not defined in the books, so she's a blank slate and the author can write her as anything they want.

I don't enjoy slash, it's just not my cup of tea, and I prefer not to read it but I don't have a problem with it existing.
