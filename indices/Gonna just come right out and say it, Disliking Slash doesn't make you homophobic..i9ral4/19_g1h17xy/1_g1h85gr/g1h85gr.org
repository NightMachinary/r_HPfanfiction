Honestly, lol...I think that Drarry is the superior one, for the reason you stated. The conflict to see how Harry and Draco will get together, and the ensuing fiery chemistry and hot scenes (if that's your kind of fic), is amazing!! Just in my personal opinion...heh.

Whereas, a Haphne fic wherein Harry is with some rando that we barely meet in the books, so the author could turn them into their random OC or Mary-Sue, well...for me, that is a big "No, thanks!" If I wanted to read OC stuff, I'd go pick up a regular book, not be reading fanfiction.
