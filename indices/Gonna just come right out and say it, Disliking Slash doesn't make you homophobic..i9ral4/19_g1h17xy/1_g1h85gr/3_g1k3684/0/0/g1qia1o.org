Haha, that is true, book!draco was not described very greatly, and while Tom Felton is cool as heck, I never really got any kind of intimidating rival feel from him. I'll keep that last point in mind, plus I will say, y'all are lucky you have so much content, and I'm sure talented writers too from how popular they can be, tbh it's seems like a pretty chill fandom (at least in comparison to...some others), have a good day/night!
