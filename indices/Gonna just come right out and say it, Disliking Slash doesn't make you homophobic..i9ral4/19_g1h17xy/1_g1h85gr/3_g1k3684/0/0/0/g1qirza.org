Aww, thanks! Yeah we are certainly lucky, there are tons of fics out there! My first intro to handsome!Draco wasn't even a Drarry, it was Cassie Clare's novel-sized adventure fic on Schnoogle. She created the Draco who wears dragon hide boots and drinks a martini with a pink umbrella lol. Now she's a real author and her YA series was originally HP fanfic. I used to read her fic in my highschool computer class secretly, after finishing the assignment.

Yeah, Felton only increases fanfic power. I certainly had a crush on him watching the films as a kid so, that didn't help matters. After seeing Felton, it's easy to imagine a handsome Draco Malfoy for any fic in any ship he's in.
