Look, you're absolutely right, he is an insufferable git but...this is why there's fanfiction! Lol. It's the excitement of such a big “what if...” that makes it intriguing to new Drarry shippers.

If you ask me, having Draco turn good isn't the biggest trouble with any Drarry fic; the dude is clearly a coward and terrified of Voldemort, after all. The biggest “leap of faith”, “suspend disbelief” that Drarry fics ask from readers, IMHO, is the idea that Draco Malfoy could be handsome and tall and muscular, rather than a weaselly skinny pale kid. But, many fanfics ask this (Ron, Harry etc. aren't known for being handsome, Hermione isn't a hottie, etc.) so, in that sense Drarry isn't as different from other ships as you might think. :)
