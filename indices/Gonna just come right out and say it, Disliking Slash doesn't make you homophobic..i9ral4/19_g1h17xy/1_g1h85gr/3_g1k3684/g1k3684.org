Ehhhhh, I mean I'm cool with slash, but even if you disregard the supremacy stuff he canonical had (although this is fanfic, so canon's not too important tbh) Draco's a whiny brat, like I get FoeYay/rivals shipping is fun, but to me Draco was so insufferable and "my father will here about this!" that I couldn't take it seriously. Dunno, I respect your opinion though.
