Ah yes, filling forms for prison visits, very romantic.

The stake? I thought that was useless against wizards.

Honestly though, anything with Malfoy is one of those things which ought to be logistically impossible since Malfoy should never be allowed to set a foot outside of prison for the attack on Katie alone. If you want a believable Malfoy romance, you need to diverge so early and in such a way that Malfoy is unrecognisable and basically an OC as well (I outlined two possibilities once). So you might as well go with Daphne and spare yourself the mental gymanstics.
