I'm sorry, but Drarry is my original fic love from when I was a teen, and I can't give it up! Admittedly I read other ships these days anyway, and rarely anything with Harry himself in it. But I've seen so many good fics with Drarry.

I think part of it is that a lot of great Drarry fics came out before book 6 and 7 did. Draco was more redeemable when he was just the school bully and not Death Eater Jr.; you make a great point about how what he did to Katie is a crime that should put him in jail, and I totally agree. Nonetheless, my love for Drarry remains and I still find good fics with this pairing.
