James never targeted Lily though. He was just an arrogant moron who dished out what Snape gave him.

Draco spent 6 years belittling Harry, trying to humiliate him, and at times either actively tried to cause him harm or indirectly tried to kill him (Books 6 and 3, respectively). He even joined a supremacist cult and only backed out when he realized he was in over his head and wanted to save his own skin.

Comparing James/Lily to Draco/Harry is completely disingenuous.
