Difference is that James never bullied Lily and lily never bullied James, and that Rowling mentioned in an interview she always liked him. But I generally think that Lily ending up with him is so convoluted and godawful, she sounds so gullible to me, and James lying behind her back also sucks. Hell, even Sirius and Remus admit as much. They couldn't even find a way around that.

They went from denial to dating for maximum two years to marriage and a domestic life. I'm the same age they were when they started dating and I cannot ever imagine myself in a commited relationship from /now/, I want to live my life before having children at like, twenty, and marrying at nineteen.
