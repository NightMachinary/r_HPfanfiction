Harry asks Sirius and Remus about whether he stopped hexing Snape. They say she started dating him after he had deflated his head /and/ stopped hexing people for the fun of it. However, when Harry asks if Snape was included they told him that Snape was an exception and that James didn't drag him on dates and hex him in front of Lily. It just read like complete dishonesty since she dated him under the pretense that he had changed, and Lily also sounds completely infautated or gullible (or both) to not question it or sense anything suspicion, especially as Head Girl.

'She didn't know much about it, to tell you the truth'
