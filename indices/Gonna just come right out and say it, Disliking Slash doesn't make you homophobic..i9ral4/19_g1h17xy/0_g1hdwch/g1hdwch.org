Exactly. The blank slate gives you an “OC that isn't an OC” and the Slytherin dynamic is super interesting as well

I wish there was like a male version of Daphne that would get popular so that slash writers don't have to always use Draco for that Slytherin dynamic. Blaise and Nott aren't as popular as pairings for instance, but they're used a lot as secondary Slytherin friends
