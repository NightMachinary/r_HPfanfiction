eh, like i said in a different post, as long as it's not explicit (and preferably side characters), i don't really mind slash all that much.

hell, one of the authors i like to recommend on here a lot, Miranda Flairgold, has some gay relationships in the story. but they are with side characters (also OC's) of it. largely vampires who are depicted as generally be willing to screw anything on two legs and do it as part of their internal politics to show dominance.

this includes Harry's (who goes by a different name) best friend as well as his mentor (defacto king of the vampires and inventor of that universe's version of Blood Magic and Necromancy).

however, it doesn't go into any details about such situations, which leads to me not caring about it. damn good stories. shame they were abandoned.
