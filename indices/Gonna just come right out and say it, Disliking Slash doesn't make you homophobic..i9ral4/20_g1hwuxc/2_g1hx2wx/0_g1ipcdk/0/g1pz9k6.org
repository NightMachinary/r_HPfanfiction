I blame JKR's low-key homophobia for the entire mess that was Lupin/Tonks - she was so desperate to crush any suggestion of Wolfstar that she came up with a totally unrealistic, two-dimensional, contrived romance between two characters who were never even seen together until that point.

And then people try to explain it away as events happening between adults off-page, that was just missed by the Harry-filter, but when JKR has in fact shown that she can very adeptly drop hints and foreshadowing of events developing off-page, it's not very believable.
