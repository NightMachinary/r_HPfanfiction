I think it's also related with how some people relate with characters, and them having a different sexual orientation interferes with that.

Harry Potter uses the Monomyth structure, The Hero's Journey, and one of the things is that the reader can see themselves in the MC's shoes. I think most people do that.

One thing that grinds my gears personally is when practically every male in the story turns gay, I laugh at that. And I don't read it, it just seems silly to me.
