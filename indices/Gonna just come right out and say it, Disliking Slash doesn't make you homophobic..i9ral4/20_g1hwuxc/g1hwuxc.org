I'd say that actually, if the only thing that's making you not read something is because the characters are gay, that is homophobic.

That's an entirely different situation to not wanting to read gay porn, mind. I get that. The vast majority of the time I don't want to read any kind of porn either.

But it's like ... if every time there was a gay character on a TV show you liked you stopped watching the show, I'd find that homophobic too.
