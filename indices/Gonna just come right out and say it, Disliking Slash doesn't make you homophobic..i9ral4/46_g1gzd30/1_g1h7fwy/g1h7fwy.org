I'm also bisexual (and male) here. Not a fan of slash. Not against it, it's mostly just, as you said, the writing quality is generally shit and I just don't like all of the popular pairings. The only slash fic I've actually picked up and enjoyed was linkao3(Full Circle), which is a Harry/Voldemort fic no less, and the main reason that the pairing works is because they constantly reincarnate as soul mates and are well past the age gap issue by the time they actually get into a relationship together.
