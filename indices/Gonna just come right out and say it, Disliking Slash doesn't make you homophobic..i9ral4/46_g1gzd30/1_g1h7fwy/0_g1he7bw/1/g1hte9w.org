I don't read them because the ones I've come across are pretty bad. Maybe some are good, I wouldn't doubt that there are some that are well-written, but like I said, I don't like most if the popular pairings.

Not interested in Drarry, I've seen very few fics that do Draco well in general fanfic. Don't like him in canon and I don't think any fic would make that work without going down a Draco in Leather Pants trope or make Harry a Death Eater sympathizer, and I just don't think the pairing works at all.

Wolfstar I'm cool with, but I'm not really interested in Marauder-era fics so I generally see it as a background ship set when Harry's at Hogwarts.

I also don't look for Dumbledore/Grindewald fics as I'm not interested in that generation or their relationship, but I could see that being decent.

Snape is a vile creature and I don't support shipping him with any of the main cast. You'd have to drastically change his character to make it work, making him an OC with Snape's name, or have a really fucked up relationship between him and whoever you pair him with. The only way I see him paired with anyone is if it's someone outside of the main cast, and even then I have my doubts about how well that would work considering how much of an obsessive creep he is towards Lily. Ultimately canon Snape doesn't deserve a happy ending and all of the parts of him that make him a good character vet stripped away when people go the DH route of making him a "nice guy" all along.
