  I'm also bisexual (and male) here. Not a fan of slash. Not against it, it's mostly just, as you said, the writing quality is generally shit and I just don't like all of the popular pairings

rlly? i genuinely find slash has the most well-written fics. wolfstar, drarry (the ones that aren't pwp), grindeldore ... even the obscure snape slash pairings like snape/james, snape/remus, snumbledore, etc, are ime usually very high writing quality.
