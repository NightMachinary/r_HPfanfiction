I don't read slash just because its never caught my attention. Regardless of how good the writing may or may not be, I just have zero interest in picking up a fic with a slash main pairing. I'm actually heavily interested in seeing other slash couples in a story as I find they provide an enjoyable addition to the story. But it just doesn't catch my attention if it's the main character. Same reason I will often ignore fics not focused on a main character of a series (in this case harry). I've seen some really well recieved fics with "side characters" being the main focus but I find them easy to skip over. I really don't think that needs a rationalization. The idea that I could be called homophobic because I just haven't put my personal reading time into a story that hasn't caught my attention is really baffling and off putting. Similarly, down voting a post or fiction rec because its slash is stupid. The arbitrary hatred (and attempted perpetuation of said hatred) is quite firmly homophobia. One day it might just click and I finally decide to pick up the slash side of Fandom but if I do or don't I really don't understand what business it is of anybody else what I read or don't read regardless of how well its written or how mutally agreed upon its greatness is.
