There are three reasons to dislike slash for me. First, I don't like characters behaving OOC. Most characters in most books are heterosexual. So, most slash fics contain an OOC behavior. The second is that while you can to filter out all the slash in search results, there are no option to exclude all slash fics *except* the ones from specifically chosen authors or with specifically chosen keywords, so the only option is to search for them manually. It's very annoying. Third, some authors are forgetting to use tags properly so you can didn't find a good fic while searching for gen only (or het, or gen and het) because it's didn't labeled as gen, het or slash at all. I also want to point out that dropping fic at the smallest hint of slash isn't the same thing as just not being interested in reading slash fics for the slash relationships sake.
