It's wrong when people assume that slash is nothing but smut, that's what I have an issue with. It's fine if you aren't a slash fan, we all have our preferences, but assuming it's all smut, when it's not, is what I have an issue with.

I love this fandom, but I hate when people berate others for what they like. I like Harry, he's an interesting character. I can see him with multiple people, in different situations.

I can see him with males and females alike, so why on this reddit liking something like Harry/McGonagall, Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Bellatrix, or whatever okay, but liking Harry/Snape, Harry/Draco or whatever wrong?

It's called fiction, we can use the characters in ways that the creator hadn't intended.

Not all slash is smut, not all slash is bad. If it's just a preference thing, that's one thing, but if you never tried to read it, or such, that can be considered homophobic.

I see people be like I'm fine with all pairings, just not slash. So what? Harry/McGonagall, Harry/Fleur, Harry/Bellatrix is okay, but anyone in a slash pairing is wrong? That's why people think they're homophobic.

Edit: Also Daphne is a made up character, with nothing more then a name attached to her, Draco is an established character. There's a huge difference between them.
