Honestly, I hate pairings with large age gaps. I can tolerate a teen boy with an adult female, as it's basically a teenager fantasy many had. But female or male teen with a male adult twice their age is a big no-no for me. I've never bothered to keep my disgust hidden.

I guess some may call me sexist, but I just find pedophiles disgusting, and the mental image of Snape or someone else grooming a kid under their care makes me rage.

P.S I hate all pairings that mix a death eater with a "light" character, regardless of sex or genre. Keep that shit away from me!
