"but if you never tried to read it, or such, that can be considered homophobic" You see, I really have nothing against gays in real life, but I never could read slash. When I started reading fanfiction I heavily avoided slash because I knew I wouldnt like it but a friend of mine said I should give it a go at least. I read a fic where the MC was gay but the relationship was very background. I found it way more disgusting than I tought I would. I always project hard into the character I read about so this was really not something for me. Anyway, where Im going with this, is that yes, you can in fact know you wont like slash before you try reading it and no, it shouldnt be considered homophobic. Another thing, even though Daphne is pretty much a non-existent character, there is still more of a chance Harry would end up with her than someone he's pretty much hard wired to hate like Draco.
