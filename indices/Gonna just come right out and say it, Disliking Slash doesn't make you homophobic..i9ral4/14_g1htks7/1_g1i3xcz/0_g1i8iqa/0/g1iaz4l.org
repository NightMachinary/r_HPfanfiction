So many points you made here are kinda hard to follow for my sobering mind so I hope I can actually answer them all. First of all I dont really read stories with female MCs. Not all MCs I read will act like I do, in fact, most of them wont but it only really matters to me when huge things like gender and sexuality are involved. Why is that? No idea I just dont like them. Also, I think I should reiterate something. Ive been using the word disgusting very liberately and should probably change it to uncomfortable. It used to disgust me but the number of disturbing things Ive seen on the internet pushed it out of this category. For your "the gays are different than me" point. Does having 3 gay friends count to disprove that? Not sure. Also Im pretty sure my favourite cousin is gay yet it doesnt really faze me, does that count for something? I really couldnt care less for what turns you on I just dont like reading about 2 male characters, people that could be the equivalent of me and my friends. It makes me uncomfortable/disgusted/repulsed call it what you want.
