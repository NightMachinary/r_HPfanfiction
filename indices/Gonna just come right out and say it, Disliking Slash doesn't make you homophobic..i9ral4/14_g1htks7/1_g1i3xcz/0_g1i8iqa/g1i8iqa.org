Do you not think your disgust at reading a gay relationship in the background could be homophobic? You say you project onto charaters and that why you don't like it, but do you not like it when Harry acts unlike you? Ginny? Molly Weasley? Must every MC act like you at every turn? When a MC of the opposite sex to you is in a heterosexual relationship do you feel disgusted? Because you can't relate to them?

If you feel disgusted at two same sex charaters having a background relationship, you have to think why that is. You say you have nothing against the "gays" but you use a term that makes us sound other, different, something you can't understand.

Say you find a fic that is perfect for you. You read it, two charaters are perfectly suited for one another and they end up together and it compliments the story being told. If that romance was slash, are you saying it would disgust you?

If you're disgusted by two consenting people finding love with eachother, you need to wonder if the prejudice in the world you've been brought up in, where 72 countries see it has breaking the law, has shaped you.
