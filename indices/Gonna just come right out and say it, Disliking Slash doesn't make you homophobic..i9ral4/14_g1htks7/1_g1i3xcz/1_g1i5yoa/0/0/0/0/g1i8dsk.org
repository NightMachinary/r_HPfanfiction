  I dislike works of fiction featuring gay people, I hardly think thats something scorn worthy.

Why is it something scorn worthy though? What if they're really well written characters in fiction that are gay, they just happen to be gay, just like a person in fiction happens to be straight, is there really anything wrong with that?
