Really just want to pick up on this. The level of hatred and vitriol that can form between two gay guys who are both in the closet and afraid of coming out should not be underestimated. They don't know how to deal with the emotions they're feeling about the other guy, and in the end they go to the human default of anger. And that compounds itself because they're both feeling and acting like that, and don't know how to deal with it, so it gets worse and worse.

They're at each others throats, but still find each other attractive and the anger turns into hatred because it has no other outlet.

I'm not saying thats a canon representation of Draco and Harry. But...its a real world phenomenon and you could very, very easily take the canon relationship and put it in that frame.
