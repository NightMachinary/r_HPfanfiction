I'm probably reading too much into it, but at 14, a girl kissing your cheek to say goodbye certainly meant something, especially to to the girl who went out on a limb and did so.

I subscribe to the theory that hermione was holding a bit of a candle turned torch for harry and he was far too dense/emotionally stunted to see it, ever since he saved her life, and sat by her side while she was petrified

Although that's a bit of headcanon mixing with canon, cause I definitely don't see JK thinking that through.
