I mean sure, but I doubt theirs is a good example. Draco was going to place Harry under the torture curse. Harry did slash open Draco with a dark curse. Draco attempted to cause Harry to faint in a quiditch game when the last time nearly killed him (dressing as a dementor). Harry and co drugged and impersonated Dracos best friends to interrogate him because they suspected him of being a bigoted murderer. Draco stomps Harrys faces repeatedly on the train in 6th year.

Until book 7, when Draco doesn't reveal Harry to the psycopath torturering murderer living in his home that there is even an inkling of good feeling there.
