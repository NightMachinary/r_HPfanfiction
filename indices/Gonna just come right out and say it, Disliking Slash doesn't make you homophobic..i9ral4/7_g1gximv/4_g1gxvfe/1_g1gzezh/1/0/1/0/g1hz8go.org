He was 12. What 12 year old do you know that doesn't end up parroting what their parents have told him from before they could talk. What 12 year old really understands the concept of death if they've never actually faced it. His parents told him he was a lesser human because someone they hated beat him in exams. Would you really have behaved that differently if under the same pressure in the same circumstances.
