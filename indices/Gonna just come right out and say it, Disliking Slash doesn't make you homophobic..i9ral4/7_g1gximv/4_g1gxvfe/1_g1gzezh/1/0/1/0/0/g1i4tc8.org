Did he change through ? As a 16 years old, would he look bach at this time and say, "man that was fucked up !" ?

As a 21 years old, would he look back at his time under Voldemort and regret the ideology, wanting it to have had a leader that treated the canon fodder bettern or would he just straight up say what he believed in was bullshit ?

As a matter of fact, he married a pureblood. One he didn't interact with much in his school years.

From Year 1 through 7, he still believed in pureblood superiority. From the beginning to the end.

Also, his parents never said that. They said that they were disappointed that their son was beaten by a lesser being - not that their son WAS the lesser being. A Malfoy is a pureblood, and so is better than all the filthy mudbloods. To be beaten by one is to cast dishonor on the family.

And, unlike many, I understand how the world works. Under the same pressure, in the same circumstances ? I'd have been the exact same asshole, the exact same bigotted fuck.

When he said "mudbloods you'll be next", he looked at a quarter of the school STRAIGHT IN THEIR EYES, and told them "you're all gonna end up like this cat, petrified for eternity, or worse - you will be dead where you stand. And that's the only way I'd have it". He never expressed shame. Never showed mercy. Because Mudbloods are less than a speck of dirt under a Malfoy's costly, beautifully crafted aristocratic boots.
