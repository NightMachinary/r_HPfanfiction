Sadly being stuck in the closet, and being raised in a homophobic culture can result in that sort of deeply internalised homophobia where you hate yourself, and you hate other gays, and most of all you hate anyone who reminds you that you are gay. Thankfully less common nowadays, as baby gays have the internet to give them some moderation of their culture. But it used to be very, very common.
