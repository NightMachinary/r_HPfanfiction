Snarry is awful because he's a grown man and basically is the reason his parents are killed, but at least Time Travel can fix those issues, though he's still a cunt so I don't get why Harry would be with him

Drarry is awful because the two would fucking kill each other.

Narcissa/Harry and Bellatrix/Harry has the same issues that Snarry does, but Time Travel fixes that as well.

I am willing to excuse Snarry when time travel to the past is involved, but not when Snape is a grown ass man lusting after 14-15 year old harry
