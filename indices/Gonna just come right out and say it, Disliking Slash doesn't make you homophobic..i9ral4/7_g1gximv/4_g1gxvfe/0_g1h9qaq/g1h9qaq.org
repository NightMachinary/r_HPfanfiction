Most Harry/Bellatrix use time travel and the “we met when she was young and before she became a murderous Nazi” to make Bellatrix more palpable a character

Most Draco/Harry or Draco/Hermione basically alters Draco to make him more palpable a character as well

Canon Draco is disgusting. Fanon Draco has enough traits to be called Draco while removing all the bad ones

Yes, it's OOC, but consider that Dark!Harry fics or Slytherin!Harry or super!Harry fics are so popular, a bit of OOC is not that bad

People talk about slash being OOC but don't give the same level of scrutiny to harem fics or other Harry centric fics. I mean I literally saw a request on this sub for a fic where he is basically Tom Riddle 2.0. Nobody points out that it's OOC
