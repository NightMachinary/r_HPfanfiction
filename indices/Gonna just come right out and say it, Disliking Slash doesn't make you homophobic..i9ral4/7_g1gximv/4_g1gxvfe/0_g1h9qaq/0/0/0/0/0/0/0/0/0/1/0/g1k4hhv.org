Look, when you kill someone, you take away their future. Whether they're old or young makes no difference. You take away their relationships, their dreams, their aspirations, and everything else that makes them who they are.

Everyone knows from the time they are young that killing is wrong, barring psychopaths and sociopaths.

Draco was old enough to know better. It's not about being a hero, it's about not doing the one thing that virtually everyone agrees is the worst crime you can commit on someone else. He had options. He chose not to take them.

If you take someone else's life, you forfeit yours. You may never, every raise a hand to harm someone else. You may become the next Martin Luther King Jr. It does not outweigh that single, cold-blooded murder.

He had nine months to come up with an alternative. He had nine months to figure something out other than killing a man in cold blood. He, at least from what the books tell us, never even tried to find another way to do things.

He could have forced his mother out of the country. Hell, stun her and hide her away. Put her in his trunk and ask the head of the wizarding equivalent of the head of the UN, his headmaster, to find them refuge somewhere else. Dumbledore could have put them under the fidelius with himself as secret keeper.

If someone tried to force me to kill someone else and was threatening my family, I'd do my absolute damndest to find a way. He didn't even try.

Now, if it had been a heat of the moment thing, or in self-defense, I could grow to forgive. He wasn't protecting himself, and he didn't have the excuse of having snapped due to immense emotional pressure/trauma. He wasn't some kid just messing about who caused an accident. He killed a man because he didn't want to look for other options.

He deliberately let terrorist war criminals into a building full of other children, many of whom said terrorists would want to kill by virtue of who their parents were. I don't remember them mentioning how many children died, but I dont believe it would have been 0. I don't care how much I love my parents, I wouldn't murder children for them, and they'd be utterly ashamed, disgusted, and disappointed in my actions had I done so.

So, attempted murder 1, accomplice to murder 1, aiding and abetting the deaths of children because of an immutable aspect those children posessed(hate crime), torture(a war crime), accomplice to who knows what other crimes, perpetrator of who knows what other crimes, and possibly more.

No, Draco was a shitty human being, like every other death eater, and his crimes don't warrant leniency. At the very, very least, he deserved life in Azkaban.

Edit: Oh yeah, almost forgot. He murdered Katie Bell, so add on murder 1 to his list of crimes.
