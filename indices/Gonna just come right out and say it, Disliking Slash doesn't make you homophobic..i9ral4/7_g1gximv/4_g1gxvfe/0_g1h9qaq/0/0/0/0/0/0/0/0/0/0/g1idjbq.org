Could he really have though? Is there any indication that Dumbledore could actually have helped him? The magical community was at the beginning of a war, his entire family/ friend/ acquaintance group and any connections he has is on one side of said war. He was again, 16. What would he do? Run away? To where ?

Without his parents actively wanting to leave Voldemort (which they clearly didn't ) I really don't see how he realistically had an option other than join the war and be a pawn on the other side.
