I agree. That's why I mainly read Drarry fics where Draco's personality is already different before he became a bully (ie first year divergents and OOC-ness)

Fics where Drarry happens after canon events requires a very long redeeming and an apologetic Draco for me to enjoy.

There's a lot of fics that takes place post-epilogue and most are careful to show a more apologetic and less shitty Draco
