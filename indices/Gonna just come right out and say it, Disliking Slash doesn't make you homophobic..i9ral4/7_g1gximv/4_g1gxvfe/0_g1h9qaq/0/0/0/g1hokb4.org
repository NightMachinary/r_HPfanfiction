Drarry always bothered me because of Hermione.

Hermione is Harry's most faithful and steadfast friend, the only one who never left his side except for when HE pushed her away. She is his most trusted confidant, and he'd be dead so many times over without her help.

MOST Drarry fics I've seen start around fifth or sixth year. After Draco has cursed Hermione, literally and figuratively. Insulted her. Belittled her. Told her she was scum beneath his boot in all but words. Hinted that he would be thrilled if she were murdered.

How in the hell is that realistic? I can suspend my disbelief pretty far. But for someone to ignore all the terrible things someone has done to their best friend and literal lifesaver just because Draco's a pretty boy? Draco as a character has absolutely no redeeming traits. It can't be his personality Harry is attracted to.

It's not that it is OOC. It is that nobody wants to read about someone basically telling their best friend, "I dont care what he's done to you in the past, I want to snog/shag/date this boy. Fuck your suffering at his hands. Having sex with him/spending time with him is more important to me than the relationship we have."

The absolute worst ones are where Hermione even continues being friends with Harry after he gets with Draco. They turn Hermione into a masochist so desperate for human companionship that she'll endure the presence of her tormentor just so she won't lose her friend who already chose the tormentor over her.

It's sickening to read. It's not the sex, it's not the kissing or romance, it's the sheer, unmitigated betrayal inherent to the plot.
