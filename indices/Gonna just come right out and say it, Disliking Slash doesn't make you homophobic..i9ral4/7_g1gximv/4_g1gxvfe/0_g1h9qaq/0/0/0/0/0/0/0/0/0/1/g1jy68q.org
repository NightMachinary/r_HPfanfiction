His parents, who loved him very much (at least his mother) and who, while being responsible for all the shit and bigotry, were also the source of many of the good things in his life, would have never gone with Dumbledore. Malfoy knew that so there was no real way out for him without endangering the only people that actually loved him.

Not gonna lie, at 16 and in that situation, I would have killed about anybody if it meant saving my family. I'd never have the strength to leave them and I'd reckon a lot of teenagers aren't emotionally independent to make the right choice there. Not every one is a brave and righteous hero (at 16!) and denying those who aren't any chance for redemption is a flawed outlook on humanity.

Clearly Draco is a shitty character who has a lot to answer for and his way to redemption is very fucking long - but to say he has forfeited any chance for redemption because he was indoctrinated and blackmailed and didn't have the guts to defy his murderous surroundings? Come on.
