Draco/Harry has never bothered me when done right, ie non canon Draco, such as done in The Sacrifices Arc by Lighting on the Wave. ([[http://ffstories.net/lightning/]]) I also have no problem with Harry/Hermione, Harry/Daphne or Harry/same age male character. Mainly because those are all of a similar age to Harry. Which is why I don't go for Harry/Tonks, Harry/Fleur or Harry/Any adult age person.
