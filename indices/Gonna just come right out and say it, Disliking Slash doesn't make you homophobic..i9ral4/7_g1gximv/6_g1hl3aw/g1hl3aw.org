The thing is,

most Bellatrix/Harry are "one of them ends up going back in time", so it's ok

most Narcissa/Harry are Harems, so at this point it's not a huge deal because lmao harems are a bit more concerning than age difference

but most drarry either are toxic or require one character to be changed to hell and back

and most snarry takes place in the present day where Snape is still simping for a girl who died indirectly because of him, and is the boy's mother. Which means, at least an 18 years difference.
