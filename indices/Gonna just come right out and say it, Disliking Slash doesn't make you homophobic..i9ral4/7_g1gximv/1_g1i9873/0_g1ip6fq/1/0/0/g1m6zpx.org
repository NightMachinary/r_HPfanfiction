ye, and especially luna is portrayed in such a fetishized way. calling herself "a future fucktoy" and worse, the author writing the other girls reacting to luna, "blushing" about it, etc. (vomiting emoji)

i know some fans of the series postulate that luna is a time-traveller, but, you're still writing a 12y old saying those things. and you're having the other girls react to it. just really icky.
