  Okay, I'm going to make a statement about Harry's behaviour in regards to the girls since it is a contentious issue, but I only want to say these things once. This statement can be referred to any time someone brings this up in future.

  Firstly, let's clear up some outright erroneous assertions.

  Statement: Harry engages in grooming.

  This statement is categorically not true. Grooming is, “the befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child, and sometimes the family, to lower the child's inhibitions with the objective of sexual abuse” (definition randomly grabbed from wikipedia). While Harry certainly does do the first part (the befriending and establishing an emotional connection), he is not doing it with the intention of committing sexual abuse. And that is very important.

  What Harry is doing would more accurately fall under two other categories.

  The first is ‘Wife Husbandry.' That is, training, educating (and, yes, manipulating), the girls to be inclined to marry him later on in life, and to meet his ideal of what a wife might be.

  This is still totally morally unacceptable by the standards of our society, but we'll get to that in a moment.

  The second is Child Soldier Training, more so in the case of some of the girls (Ginny, Luna, Alex), than others, but even Hermione and Daphne are receiving basic combat training. This is, arguably, far more horrific than the first category, but people tend to have morality blindness in adventure stories because, Rahh! Action! Now that we have accurately assessed what Harry is in fact doing with the girls (and what he is not) let's move to the second statement.

  Statement/question: Your character's actions are immoral and disgusting. How do you justify it? I don't. Nor do I need to. The characters in the story justify what they do to themselves and others, but I, the author, do not justify their actions. They are characters in a story. They are a. not real. and b. not me. If by the question you mean, “How do I justify writing this story?” my answer to that is, “because I enjoy it, and because many people find it entertaining,” in the same way that many people find BDSM enjoyable and entertaining, despite the morally questionable nature of the actions within the lifestyle, when taken out of context.

  Like BDSM, this story is a fantasy (a power fantasy, in this case). In BDSM the behaviours are morally acceptable because all people engaging in the experience consent. By reading the story, you also consent, and I do not need to obtain consent from the characters in the story because they don't exist. I made them up. Enjoying this story does not make you immoral. Engaging in these behaviours in the real world makes you immoral.
