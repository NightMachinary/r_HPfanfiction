oof not on ffnet (as in ways to find fics). And off the top of my head I can't think of much slash on there other than

there's a lot of good slash on ao3 and with the tagging system it can be a lot easier.

and you know I'm scrolling through my bookmarks and there is often ust for at least a little, but I just had a thought. it might be because a lot of queer people (and just general poly people of every orientation) reeeeeally dislike the love triangle trope, which JK used and is found in a lot of het stories, so perhaps there is a grain of truth about it being used a lot in slash.

Writers need to create some tension if it's not just jump straighg in bed, but I tend not to like when it's dramatically drawn out for fifty one chapters either lmao'

also, at least in the world of sapphic love...we're pretty useless at asking one another out for various valid and also sometimes stupid reasons.

ok so is one that I read recently that is pretty cute. Sorry it does have sex in it, so if you're not into sex scenes I can keep trawling for another that doesn't. It is femslash with background but still very present slash

This one I read just yesterday and it is v cute with no sex

Sorry they're both ao3 though. It's just far easier for me to search on and my memory isn't working rn
