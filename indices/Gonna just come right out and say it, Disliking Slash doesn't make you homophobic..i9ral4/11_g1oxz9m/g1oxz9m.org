Gay people have been existing in a world where the only romance stories available are straight for 200 years. Turns out, you can still appreciate them if you just open your mind? Like, sure, there are cases where they comb through media looking for gay interactions (fair enough, imo), but on the whole, many are generally able to appreciate it.

The only reason to dismiss slash *out of hand* is actually homophobia.
