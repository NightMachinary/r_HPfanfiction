The problem with neutrality is they never leave us alone. Personally I think the obligatory love interest is the weakest part of most webfiction I read and I've slowly grown to hate anyone trying to cram that down my throat. It's not homophobic to hate some fujo's fucked up fetishization of a gay relationship and I'm getting real tired of pretending otherwise.
