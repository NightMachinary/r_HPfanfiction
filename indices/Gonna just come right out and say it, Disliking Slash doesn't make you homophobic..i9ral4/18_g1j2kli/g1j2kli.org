Wait.... so the argument is that anyone who doesn't like Drarry fics is homophobic? Because that's dumb. I dislike Drarry stuff because I don't think the pairing makes any sense at all. I'd read Drabini (Is that what we're calling Draco/Zabini? Just made it up.) or maybe Harry/Ron and I love me some Neville slash and pretty much any femslash so I agree with OP, we like what we like. Sure there are homophobes out there but I wouldn't say that's the first reason one would back away from a slash fic.

Btw, I also think Haphne is weird... I think Hinny is just too perfect. <3

Edit to add also let's maybe not ever assume homophobia in people unless they actually speak/act/support homophobic things.
