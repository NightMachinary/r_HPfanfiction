I agree. Sometimes I place myself in the characters position as I read so at those times I don't prefer Slash. Other times I don't mind it. Just depends on my mood and the story. Also homophobia is something I see a lot in the real world so when I read I prefer slash stories where there isn't the whole struggle, because fanfic is a form of escapism and I prefer happier moments usually. I mean sometimes it's nice to enjoy a well written dramatic fic but other times I want some fluffy relaxation too.
