I'm happy to explain what I mean. Straight women often express disgust towards sapphic women while simultaneously shipping two men, because, frankly, they are turned on by the latter but not the former. They're self deluded homophobes who think watching gay p*rn makes them allies. (By the way, these men are usually white or at least very pale, skinny, almost always cis, and one of them is usually 'feminine' while the other is 'masculine.')
