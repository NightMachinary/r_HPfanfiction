My thoughts on slash: this is one of the worst fandoms for popular slash pairings because of how uncomfortable they are to read. With the exception of Wolfstar, the popular slash ships all involve Death Eaters. Similarly problematic are a lot of Hermione's ships. The good thing for me though is that outside of those DE slash ships, the stuff is pretty good. The characters tend to remain mostly themselves without dissolving into mushy gay caricatures, a problem I've found with a lot of BNHA fics. Harry/Ron and Harry/Neville are excellent ships.
