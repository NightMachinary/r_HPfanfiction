I don't know anything about Mafalda, but if she was supposed to take Rita's role, wouldn't it make sense to make her older?

And if one of her parents was Molly's second cousin, that would make her Ron's third cousin. I don't think many people even know who their third cousins are. And Ron's family is already huge, and he's not desperate for more family like Harry. So Ron has no real reason to think much about a third cousin. At most, it might be a mild curiosity. And if purebloods families are as interbred as they are sometimes portrayed, Ron probably has several other second or third cousins at Hogwarts.

So basically, it makes sense that Ron wouldn't have mentioned her, even if she was in his year. If she was also in Gryffindor, then it would be more likely to have come up at some point. But if she was in a different house and/or year, I could see Ron easily never thinking about it.
