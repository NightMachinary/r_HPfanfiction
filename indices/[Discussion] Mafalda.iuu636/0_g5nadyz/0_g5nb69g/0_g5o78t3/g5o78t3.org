If Molly knew about her and she was in Ron's year, then Molly might have mentioned her and told Ron to look out for her or something. If she was older than Ron, she probably would have told Percy instead, and Ron could easily forget or never hear about her. If she was younger than Ron, Ginny would be more likely to hear about her, unless she started when Ron was a prefect, but then she wouldn't be there in GoF.

Molly certainly could find out about Mafalda within the month, especially if she spends time gossiping with her extended family. But I don't think we see her interacting casually with other adults (other than Arthur) enough to get much of a sense of her personality when not in "mothering mode." So she could be quite gossipy, but we can't say for sure.

But Mafalda would almost certainly have first cousins or other closer magical relatives than the Weasleys. So she and her family probably wouldn't tell Molly directly.

There definitely were some Weasley cousins at the wedding. But there are no references, from Ron or anyone else, of other Weasleys at Hogwarts. That means that either Ron doesn't pay attention to cousins at all, or they weren't at Hogwarts during the books. The latter option is probably more likely (if Arthur's siblings only had a few kids, they'd probably be around Bill and Charlie's ages, especially if Arthur was one of thr younger kids), but either is possible.

It has also occurred to me that if Mafalda had existed, Harry/Mafalda would probably be a fairly popular ship, and Harry/Daphne might be a bit less common.
