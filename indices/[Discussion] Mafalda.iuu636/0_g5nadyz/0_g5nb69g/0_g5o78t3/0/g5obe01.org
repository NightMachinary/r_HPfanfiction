True about Harfalda.

Weasley cousins are weird case. We do know that they are all male, for Ginny is the first girl in seven generations. We also get from Malfoy in first year the "all red, more kids you can afford... You must be a Weasley" comment, which points to Arthur's brothers having many children as well.

IMO... JKR just tried to simplify things. It seems unlikely there weren't Weasley cousins at Harry's time at Hogwarts, even if most of them were older than Ron.
