She was supposed to take the Rita role of feeding info to the trio and the plot through eavesdropping on Death Eater conversations or something. She was supposed to be a Slytherin.

I do imagine that Ron wouldn't think too much of a third cousin, but if Molly said something then Ron's line in the first book would have been "Mom has a second cousin who is an accountant, I think he has a daughter starting Hogwarts this year too."

So more like the question is... Can Molly find out her second cousin has a magical daughter in the month between she getting the letter and Sep 1st? Not sure how gossipy are the Prewetts

Actually, we don't know much about Weasleys or Prewetts aside from the usual characters, and Bill's wedding was supposed to be stuffed with cousins.
