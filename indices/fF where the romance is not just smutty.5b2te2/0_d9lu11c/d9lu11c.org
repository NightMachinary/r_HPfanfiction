I have some Snarry recs that fit your request.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1823242][A Nick in Time]] and the sequel [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1823704][Growing Pains]] is a series where Snape and Harry are deaged to 7 year olds and become best friends. When they are restored to adults they start a relationship. Both are complete even though listed as a WIP.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/67770][Stilllife]] is canon-compliant Snarry that, if it wasn't so sad, would make some good head canon for a Snarry shipper. Snape, more or less, mentors and then befriends Harry while he is stuck as a painting in the limbo between life and death. They become friends and in a very unlikely way, fall in love.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/610909][With Eyes Wide Open]] is a well done marriage contract Snarry.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/101383][Courtship Rituals]] is a pretty funny and cute Snarry. Due to some false intelligence, Snape is ordered by Voldermort to formally court, and try to marry Harry. Because the Order cannot afford to have Snape lose favor with Voldermort, Harry is forced to go along with it.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/670548][The Boy Who Died a Lot]] is cool fic that takes Snape saving Harry all the time to the next level. The basic premise is that during Harry's first year, he dies during the detention in the forbidden forest with Draco. Because dumbledore knows the prophecy, and knows Harry can't die (yet...) he gives Snape a time turner and puts him in charge of saving Harry. There's a Final Destination twist where fate keeps trying to kill Harry (I think he dies 20 times from Rons broken wand in second year for example) and Snape just keeps saving him. It has cool time travel and interesting time loop things with multiple snapes. It's also canon-compliant (EWE) which is rare for most hogwarts era slash - especially Snarry.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/714361][Cambiare Podentes]] and the sequel are Harry/Snape fics where there is a prophecy that in order to kill voldermort, harry must bind to snape in an ancient spell as his permanent slave. I was really really expecting not to like this fic - not least because I think it is creepy in most stories, totally OOC and also not at all well explained. This story is totally different. First of all, it is a 600K-ish word series and so the characters and their motivations are fully explained. Second, snape and harry are both in character - especially snape.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8315797/1/Gray-Skye-Mourning][Grey Skye Mourning]] is a Harry time travel fic where he goes back in time to save Snape right after the battle at hogwarts. He meets his parents and dumbledore in the past and they all know he is from the future, but they do not ALL know who he is. He falls in love with Snape in the past and has to try to save him in the future from dying in the shrieking shack. He cannot try to save his parents or anyone else who died though because everything that has happened will still happen, even when he is in the past. Great read!
