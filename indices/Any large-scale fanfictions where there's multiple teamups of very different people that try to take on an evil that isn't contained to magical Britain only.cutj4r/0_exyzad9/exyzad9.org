Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach) has Voldemort as international threat with muggles and wizards around the world trying to fight him, and the dark wizards Rasputin and Koschei come back too and cause mayhem.

Without Secrecy, Voldemort develops some interesting strategies to take over entire muggle nations like North Korea as well as terrorist groups like Al Qaeda. He also figures out how to make somewhat inefficient magic nukes, but who cares about efficiency when you can just duplicate your enriched uranium with magic.

The situation gets quite close to global nuclear war, and then there's a whole lot of other issues people have to deal with like that company that's making time traveling DeLoreans or the various muggle supremacy groups or that pharma company that somehow got a Philosopher's Stone or that old shoe that somehow appeared in the Mir space station.
