ok so there was one that I read on AO3 but bailed out because it was too dark and depressing for me, and I can't remember what it was called. the same author wrote quite a good WBWL series called Sarcasm and Slytherin, I can't think of the name of the actual story or the author but I just went hunting and it looks like the author cut them loose. if someone can remember with those clues you might be able to find it? I don't know, sorry

Actually you might enjoy the series in the meantime. The first one is ao3(12608820)
