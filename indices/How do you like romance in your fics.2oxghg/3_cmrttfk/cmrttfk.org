I have come to despise romance stories written about teenage kids. If you go back to canon, note how the romance scenes were by far the worst of the series (Won-won and Lav, cringe-worthy Harry/Cho, Monster in the ChestÂ®, etc.). Fanfiction writers seldom do better, often adopting the "oh noes, she doesn't like me, so let me cut myself" angst or "golly, we're Soul Bonded and are soooo happy!" in lieu of any sort of development. Most anything realistic for kids of that age is superficial and boring.

If I do read a romance story, I prefer it to be about adults who bring maturity and perspective to how they view the world, their place in it, their relationships with others, and their responsibilities toward others. A post-Hogwarts Harry/X, where X is some non-central canon character (e.g., Tracey Davis or Su Li) or OC would be my preference. I also don't much dig infidelity. Torrid Harry/Hermione affairs when both are married to Weasleys turn me off very quickly. (To me, these are the least readable of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/636397/lorien829][lorien829]]'s stories.)
