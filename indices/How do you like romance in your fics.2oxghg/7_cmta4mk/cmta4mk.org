Get the drama portion of the pairings out of the way ASAP. After that I don't mind if the story has a lot of smut or romance, but I prefer if the actual plot still goes somewhere. Voldemort getting hit by a bus while Harry and Hermione are occupying broom closets isn't worthy of writing except as a comedy piece.
