I seldom see it, but I'd love more /in media res/ romantic relationships on main characters in fanfics. A story labeled "romance" should be about the romance, so treat it the same way you would the action scenes in a summer blockbuster movie.

No good action movie starts out with a thirty-minute, in-depth discussion about why they're about to get into some really awesome action over /here/ and not this /other/ action that /some people/ might think they might get into, but is totally not right for this action protagonist.
