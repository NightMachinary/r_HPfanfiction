I think both ways can work, but it takes a much more talented writer to make an already established romance compelling. If there's a buildup, there's inherent tension. If they start out apart, and gravitate towards each other, it's fluid and dynamic. An already established romance can be this as well, but more often than not it's static. And even it's not static, the problems you see introduced tend to require one or both of the characters to pick up the Idiot Ball. I was a lot less interested in Jim and Pam's relationship on /The Office/ once they got together, in other words.
