A lot of good romance movies and books start with two people teetering on the edge of breaking up, and that almost never happens in popular fanfics. If a story wants to be* original, it should try to break out of the "end with a kiss" trope where the story is over once the couple gets together. Or, dog help us, the also-popular "babies ever after".
