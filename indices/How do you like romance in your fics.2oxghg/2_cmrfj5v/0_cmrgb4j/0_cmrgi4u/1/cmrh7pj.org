I'll agree with you on that point, for sure. "Babies ever after" I don't think I've ever seen done well. Might just be a taste thing, but it's usually so sweet it gives you a toothache.

And yeah, ending right as the couple gets together isn't great either.

Personally, I like to see the whole width and breadth of the thing. If it's important to the story that they're together, then it's important /how/ they got together, and I want to read about it.
