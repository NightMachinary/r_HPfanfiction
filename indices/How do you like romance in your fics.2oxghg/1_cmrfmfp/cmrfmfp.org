Mainly I want the romance not to interfere with any character's ability to form their own goals and act independently. Good examples:

- The Problem with Purity has Hermione/Snape. Despite her relationship, Hermione still manages to cure lycanthropy, become an animagus, and ace her NEWTs.
- A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy has Hermione/Draco. Draco wants to keep custody of his son. Hermione wants funding for her school. They solve each other's problems and discover the true meaning of Christmas.

Bad examples make it mostly immaterial which woman ends up with Harry. It's no more than flavor, and maybe setup for Harry to be a hero -- for instance, if Harry ends up with Daphne Greengrass, he'll likely defend the family from Death Eaters trying to recruit her father. If his girlfriend is from any Dark family, there's a good chance he'll have to kill her sexually abusive father.

Terrible examples have Harry forming a harem whose members are differentiated mainly through hair color.
