Oh god, yes. The worst offender of this in my mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] which had an interesting premise, decent writing, and a story that was shaping up to be pretty cool... and it was all thrown away so that two people could fuck each other's brains out and hasn't been updated since.
