I am not a fan of romance and very rarely read a story that focuses heavily on romance. But when romance is in a story I prefer:

- natural progression to relationship. I don't want to be told that Hermione and Snape are together. I will not be able to accept this if I do not see them getting there in a way that makes sense.

- no character bashing / die for our ship. I don't mind if you ship Harry/Hermione or Harry/Draco or whatever, but there is no reason to bash or kill the characters who you feel threatening for your ship. You can handle the situation more intelligently than that.

- Other interesting things happen, too, life goes on. I like to get the feeling that not everything in the world suddently revolves around the couple.
