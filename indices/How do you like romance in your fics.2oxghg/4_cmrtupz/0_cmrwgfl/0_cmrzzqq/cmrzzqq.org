Aside from the humor of answering the question as if it were a martini, what I meant was that romance of the gushy, oversweet variety isn't very interesting for the observer, in fiction or in life. If you're going to include romance, make it funny, or poignant or plot-relevant.

If it's a key factor in whether the hero is betrayed at a critical moment by a spurned lover, I might be happy that I understood why the hero hooked up in the first place and why they broke up, leading to this moment of spitefulness. Even so, I doubt it'd matter what was in the favorite meal or how the hero danced when they were in courting mode.
