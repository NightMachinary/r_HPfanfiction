I did want to make an AU and world build around America a bit. The beginning is a bit unorthodox and I understand the Azkaban raid seemed a bit too “clean,” but several things about the American Aurors will be revealed later on. Specifically, while the British Aurors act more like a police force, the American Aurors are more like a military force. The American Wizarding population is larger and correspondingly, the American Auror forces are much greater in number. Additionally, they have a much larger area to guard and cover. Also, Wizarding America has allies abroad and deploy their Aurors to smaller countries that have difficulties fighting threats . As a result, the American Aurors are much more professional, better trained, and more experienced for foreign operations. They're not perfect, but Azkaban was primarily guarded by Dementors, and in the books, taken easily after the Dementors switch sides. I reasoned that once the Dementors were driven back and out of the fight, then the human guards would be overwhelmed rather swiftly.

I apologize if my writing is bad or choppy. I'm definitely revising as I go and I promise to improve my story every step of the way :)

OCs will be commonplace. There will be a lot of familiar family names, simply because a lot of prominent British Wizarding families branched off into the Americas (like the Blacks). However, there will only be a handful of OCs that are expanded on. The Lees, the Blacks, and several others will play prominent roles in the series. But the MC will be Harry.

I may cross post to AO3 in the future, after I post a few more chapters :)
