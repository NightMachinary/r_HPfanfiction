It's a little jarring to get used to all the OCs. It isn't overwhelmed with too much dialog. I think some of the decisions seem a bit rushed or too neat (like the prison breakout) but I'm presuming the pacing will even out a bit when Harry takes over as the main character.

I do very much like the concept of exploring wizarding America.

Good luck!
