I'm excited for a new chapter of this story, I love the world building in this series. It doesn't hurt i like the Lioness series that is mixed in too.

That said, Does anyone know the full name of the S.O.W. Party?\\
I know that the full name must have been dropped in full somewhere in the Pureblood Pretense, and then only called the acronym ever since. I can't remember nor find the full name to save my life.
