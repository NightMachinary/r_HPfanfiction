Not this, but there was a story (I would love to find myself) of post-war falling apart of Harry/Ginny marriage. The crucial point was that one of their children (Lily?) was a squib and Ginny never managed to treat her as equal and always believed that as in proper pureblood family she should be gently sent away (after all, canonically, there was that cousin accountant). Aside from this, there was not much Weasley bashing. I am not sure whether it ended as Harmony or what.
