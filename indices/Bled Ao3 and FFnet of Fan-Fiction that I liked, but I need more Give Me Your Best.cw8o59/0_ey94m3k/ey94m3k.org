When a Lioness Fights by Kayly Silverstorm

It takes a few chapters to warm up, but the plotline is incredible, the writing style is excellent, and the romance is the best example I've ever read of a real-life, slowly developing, solid-foundation relationship where your partner is your best friend and isn't focused on sex/hormones.
