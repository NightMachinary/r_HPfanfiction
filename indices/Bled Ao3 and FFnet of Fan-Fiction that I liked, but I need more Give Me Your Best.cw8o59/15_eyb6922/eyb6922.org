There are two time-travel WIPs that I completely adore, but since you asked for just one, I'll go with The Second String. It's well-written and it made me cry and I always get so excited when it updates.

(This also reminds me that I should reread one of the fics that got me into HP fic... It's amazing but I've read so much since then that I don't know where it'd fall. But you only asked for one rec, anyway.)
