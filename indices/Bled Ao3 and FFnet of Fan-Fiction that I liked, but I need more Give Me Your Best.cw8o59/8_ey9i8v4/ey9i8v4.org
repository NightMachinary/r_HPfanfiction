Alexandra Quick is one of my favorite series. If you're interested in reading about an entirely original setting (magical US) with original characters (no Harry Potter to be found here) that's still technically in the Harry Potter universe, this is the best there is.

I think my favorite part of these stories is how the author manages to recreate the same "big reveal of the mysterious problem" build-up/tension/resolution like JK Rowling does in canon.
