Linkffn(The Divide by Beedle)

I wouldn't call it my all-time favorite, but it's honestly top 6, and I'm choosing this one because I don't think it's well-known. It's about two inseperable twin girls, Jennifer and Juliet, who are Hugo Weasley's age. Juliet is a witch, Jen is not, and they are desparate to stay together, so they go on a quest to find a way to give Jen magic.

It's really sweet and charming and does some interesting world building. If the characters seem flat, trust me - they don't stay that way. I'm not sure how far into the story we are right now, but it's currently the end of second year, and it's consistently updated. I wholeheartedly recommend it.
