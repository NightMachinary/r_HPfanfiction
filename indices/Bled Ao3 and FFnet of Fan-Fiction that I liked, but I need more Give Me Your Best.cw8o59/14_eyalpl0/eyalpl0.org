[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Series by Shezza]]

An HP/Dresden Files crossover that is among my favorite HP stories of all time. Knowing anything whatsoever about the Dresden Files series is entirely unnecessary, the fic explains stuff in context. I don't remember if it is rated M or T, but it contains no smut, and a vast amount of violence. It has an engaging and well written story that is paced well and all the characters are both interesting and believable.
