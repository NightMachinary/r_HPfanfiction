I'm scared I'm going to recommend something you've already read since I'm new to fics in general but I would recommend "Blindness" by AngelaStarCat, It was a very great idea and well executed although it is a little long winded I didn't really mind it's also trope heavy. A blind Harry Potter MOD is a great idea though!
