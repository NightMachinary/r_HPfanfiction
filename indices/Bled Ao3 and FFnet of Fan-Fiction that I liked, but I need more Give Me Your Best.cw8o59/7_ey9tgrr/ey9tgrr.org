Of a Linear Circle by flamethrower is easily the best founder's era time-travel fic I have ever read that takes time to explore the potential history of the founders. However the main story of the series takes place within canon and is one of a small handful of Snape-centric fics that I can bear to read. The world building of this series is some of the best I've read and it never feels like it is treading on the toes of what canon established.

At 10 individual works and on going it's a great way to spend time.
