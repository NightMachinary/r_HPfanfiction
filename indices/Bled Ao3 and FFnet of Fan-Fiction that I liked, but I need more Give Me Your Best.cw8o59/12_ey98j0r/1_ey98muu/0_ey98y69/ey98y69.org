Well, here is an example of what you can expect from it:

"Alright, you've all seen some of that voodoo that I do up to now, but now you get introduced to one of the more fun aspects of it. I'm going to say to you all now the four words that terrorized me all through primary school," Harry smiled widely, "Wanna feel something weird?"

With the wand he had been concealing behind his back, Harry mass transfigured each squad member into a sealed tin of potted meat. A swish and flick saw the squad rise into the air and file neatly into their improvised atmospheric re-entry vehicle. It stood just under a meter tall, was a forbidding black, and-

It was a trash can. A heavily charmed trashcan, but nonetheless a trashcan.

Harry picked it up and held it under and arm as he made his way through the ship to the airlock, whistling the tune to 'If I Only Had a Brain'. He got a few strange looks as he went through the CIC, but the command crew had all been briefed extensively by former-captain Anderson to just ignore anything they saw Harry doing that did not immediately endanger the structural integrity of the ship. They chose to let it go.
