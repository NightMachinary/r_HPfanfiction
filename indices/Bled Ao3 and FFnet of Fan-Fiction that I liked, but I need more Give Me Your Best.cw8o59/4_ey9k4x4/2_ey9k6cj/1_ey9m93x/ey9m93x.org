It's about a little boy who lost his parents but then he gets a new set of parents who love him as he should have been loved. The writing is wonderfully emotive, and children are very well portrayed as children without it becoming boring. It basically covers Harry's life from when he was left on the doorstep to the end of his first year at Hogwarts. The point of divergence is the Dursleys deciding not to take Harry in, with rapid bad consequences for them but wonderful consequences for Harry.
