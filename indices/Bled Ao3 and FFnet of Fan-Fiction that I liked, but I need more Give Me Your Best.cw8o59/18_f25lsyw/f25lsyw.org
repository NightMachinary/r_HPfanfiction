This one is not a favorite but I was looking for OC fanfics, and it was certaining engaging. This fanfic has a male SI OC that's reincarnated into the HP world as a pureblood and is in Slytherin. It also has a fem-harry and starts during the Triwizard tournament. It is *very* smutty which is why it's rated M. It's still a WIP and honestly, it's more smutty than storyline based till now but it's entertaining nonetheless.
