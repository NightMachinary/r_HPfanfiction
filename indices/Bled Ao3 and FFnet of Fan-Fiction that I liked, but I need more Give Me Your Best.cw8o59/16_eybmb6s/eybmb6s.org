I won't give you my favourite. from your request, it looks like you will most likely. Definitely, have read it already.

So try this linkffn(13250447)

An adult, OP!Harry (think Wind Shear). Is blasted into an AU 5th year universe. Where a bunch of cliches exist. i.e Parents alive, Harry is a girl. The usual. What really sets it apart, is that. He doesn't really care. He just picks up where he left off. Killing bad guys. Taking names. And being a genuinely, morally grey character.

It could use a beta and some touch-ups. Still, I had fun with it. Enjoy!
