You might want to look into using [[http://cross-plus-a.com/bconsole.htm][Balabolka]] and a voice you find somewhere else (I myself use IVONA Brian).

=-c -w "e:\readContent.wav" -s 0 -n brian=

is the command line arguments I use... after this I use Foobar2000 with lame to convert to mp3... which I send over to my (old, nonsmart) phone for playing.

=-c= clipboard (ctrl+c the text you want to have read)\\
=-w <filename>= read into this file\\
=-s 0= read at normal speed (some voices sound "better" sped up/slowed down)\\
=-n <voice>= I got IVONA Brian installed, and it's recognized as =brian=
