You're not weird, you're just not 11 years old - and as such, your tastes and sensibilities have changed from there.

My 11-year-old self would /absolutely/ have had a lunch consisting entirely of sweets. My current self, not so much.

As an aside, railway catering usually isn't great - it's of the "people-fuel" variety.\\
I imagine most children on the train will have a packed lunch made by their parents, which would most likely be preferable to typical railway-catering fare (Honeydukes' best excluded).
