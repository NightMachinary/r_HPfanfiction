Your tastes have changed since you were a small child.

The trolley hardly appears in the books, in book 1 (I remember that) and book 3 (I don't remember that, but the interweb tells me it did), and we only see its interactions with children and as a source of anti-Dementor chocolate. Yer average 13 year old wants sweets. Don't believe me? Just look at what was available in school tuck shops before the current silly fad of attempting to persuade children that lettuce is food. The tuck shop at my school, in the 80s, sold /nothing/ except what I'd now call sugary crap, and at the time that was just what I wanted to spend my money on. If it had sold delicious healthy carrots instead then I would have just taken my money into the local town and bought sugary crap there instead.
