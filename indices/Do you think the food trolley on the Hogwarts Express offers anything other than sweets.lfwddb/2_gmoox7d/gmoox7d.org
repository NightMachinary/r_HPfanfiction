In most long haul journey / boring long stay somewhere (train, plane, and whatever else takes a full day or more to go from A to B, or hospital stay) the catering comes out at set time with the meal options suitable for that time, it's usually every couple of hours to keep people entertained, but will light option to avoid "bloating" ( train ad plane toilets are not comfortable). So the first time we hear about the food trolley, is at the beginning of a long trip, my guess would be "mid morning snack /cuppa tea" (10-11 am), hence the candies. An hour or two later, they would probably come out again with "lunch" (possibly warm and cold options) between 12 and 1pm (but we didn't hear about it because Harry and Ron are too full of candy that first time, and the following years it's too mundane to mention) , then at 3-4pm there might be another "mid afternoon snack /cuppa /more candies", and then nothing 'till they reach Hogwarts when they'll have the welcoming feast (arrival at around 7pm? ).
