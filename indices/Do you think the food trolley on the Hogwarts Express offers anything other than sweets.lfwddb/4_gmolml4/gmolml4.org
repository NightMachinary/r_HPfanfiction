We know they do. Pumpkin pasties are savoury, and would (assuming that a wizarding pasty resembles a normal pasty) be quite substantial.

The sweets are at the front, because a train full of kids who've just been let out of their parents sight and given a bit of autonomy with their pocket money WILL want sweets, but there's at least one canonically present savoury item that would do as an actual meal. I see no reason not to have others as well.

Perhaps sandwiches (toasted or otherwise) or soup. Hot chips. Curry or biryani, given how popular takeaway Indian food is in Britain. Other savoury pastry/pastry adjacent things like a sausage roll or a small shepherd's pie.

The snacks might include fruit. Or...if you can deep fry a mars bar, I bet you could deep fry a chocolate frog.
