I'll agree Isolation is good, but for a believable war (post-Hogwarts) DHr fic I prefer The Fallout by everythursday linkao3(10620276) (note that it's not marked as complete but it actually is)

Edited to add: Here's the actual summary for The Fallout - "Hermione learns about growing up through the redemption of Draco Malfoy."

There's not a whole lot of Dramione's that cover all of the Hogwarts Years, majority of them are set post-OotP, but here's a few that I know of:

A cute little oneshot that goes through the Hogwarts years is Under the Lights by silver.ink13 linkffn(7675327)

A popular Dramione fic is The Green Girl by Colubrina linkffn(11027125) with a Slytherin!Hermione

The Brightest Black by enigmaticrose4 linkffn(11845481) has a Hermione and Harry raised by Sirius

These last two I haven't read but I've heard about them in the DHr community:

Remembering You by pinayflava90 linkffn(6565033)

Children of the Dark series by cleotheo, here's the first one linkffn(11301204), the rest of the years can be found on the author's profile
