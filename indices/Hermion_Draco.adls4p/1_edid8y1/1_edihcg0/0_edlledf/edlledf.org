I would recommend the author lena phoria too you.. very few great D/HR writers.. but imo right up there with bex-chan... Now all of her stuff is post hogwarts and have very adult themes but fantastic...she has several fanfictions up on ffnet A but her best fanfiction "Cruel and beautiful world" was taken down because she converted the story to an actual book but if you search the title and her name you should be able to find a copy... It is easily in my top 5 fanfictions

,(her books based on it was real good too... Right now on amazon first 2 are free for Kindle, and 3rd one is on sell for $5)
