I know it's been mentioned and this happens 7th year, not 1-3, but trust me this is worth it. I don't think it's OOC (well, beyond the eventual non-cannon D/Hr pair) but it hits all the notes you outlined. It's a slow burn, but it's extremely well written. You get both sides of the story which is pretty refreshing considering most D/Hr redemption arc stories don't shed light on Draco's perspective and why he has those beliefs.

So if you can't find something with that plot but set early on, I suggest reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6291747/1/Isolation][Isolation]] by Bex Chan.
