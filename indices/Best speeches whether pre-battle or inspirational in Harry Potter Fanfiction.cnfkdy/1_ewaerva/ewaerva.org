Can I help it if I'm proud of my own work?

Context: in this variation, Harry is taught Occlumency by a better teacher. The unfortunate consequence is that he doesn't find out about Nagini attacking Arthur outside the Department of Mysteries, so he isn't shocked awake in time to inform the Headmaster about it. Arthur isn't found as quickly, and eventually succumbs to the venom and dies. A few days later, the Weasleys host a wake outside the Burrow.

  The gathering grew in size, spreading out to fill the garden, the orchard, the pond and down the lane towards Ottery St. Catchpole.

  Many people who had arrived just past the sunrise were still there by midday, as if they wouldn't leave until told to do so. Harry was sitting with Ron when he asked him about it.

  "It was like this when we lost Uncle Bilius. They come until they feel everyone expected has arrived, then they shuffle off. I s'pose it's meant to show how much someone will be missed."

  "And you're supposed to just... mingle all day?"

  "Some people like to make a speech, but no one has to." Ron nodded towards a makeshift podium where a wizened old warlock was babbling about bendy billiard cues.

  Harry stood up. He had no reason to do it. No one had asked him. Being the center of attention certainly wasn't his favorite thing, but in this case, for this man, he'd discovered a need to speak.

  He strode over to the podium. A minute later, the man noticed Harry waiting and hurriedly ended his reminscence with,"Ah, Arthur, I'll miss you."

  The warlock nodded to Harry while tapping his own throat with his wand, and then walked off. Harry took his position.

  "Sonorous." He felt a swelling in his throat. It didn't obstruct anything but was an odd sensation nonetheless."Uhh... hi. You may not know me but I'm Harry Potter."

  Harry looked up at the crowd and suddenly was caught by waves of pressure that seemed to be coming from them. Every person there was looking at him, and there were a few hundred at least. Emotions were rolling at him in discordant tones and rhythms and it made him dizzy for a moment, until he could center his mind. Once he'd caught his breath, he re-invoked the Harry he wanted to be at that moment, then spoke.

  "I haven't known Arthur Weasley for as long as most of you. In fact, he could only convince me to call him Arthur a few months ago. But I'm absolutely blown away -- I mean, overwhelmed.

  "There are so many people here today. I mean, I knew that Arthur was a nice guy. Very pleasant. Able to put even a really nervous kid like me at ease by asking an odd question about the meaning and function of a rubber duck." Harry chortled, but then took a drink of water to cover for it.

  "That was Arthur to me- the man who couldn't quite understand muggles, even though they fascinated him. It's no surprise that he would make it his job to protect them from jinxes and the like.

  "A nice man, was Arthur. Mind you, the rest of the family is a bit batty... ," he paused to allow some titters to subside, "but Arthur never minded that. I think he liked that about them.

  "Yet that doesn't explain all of you being here."

  Harry paused again to change the tone of his delivery to something more forceful.

  "Nice men die all the time. They die at home or in hospital or when falling victim to something, whether accidental or, uh, malicious. Nice men like that are missed. Their family grieves for them, and friends offer a pat on the back and shot of whisky and the usual, 'Ahh, whatsisname- he was a nice fellow. Cheers.'"

  Harry noticed something in the corner of his eye; the previous speaker was grumping a bit. Harry gave him a nod to apologise for using him as an example.

  "That doesn't explain all of you coming here. I think the difference is that Arthur Weasley was a good man. Good. Loving, kind, patient with his family and with strangers. Good with a quick joke. Willing to offer advice, but wouldn't be offended if you chose to ignore it. Arthur spoke as quietly as needed but firmly when necessary. He represented his ideals in his every action.

  "That's why you're all here. He was a Good man. And I think you're also here for the same reason I am; there's a hole where Arthur was. I... I'm going to miss him. You will, too. Because he won't be there to add his honest opinion any more. His jokes will need to be told by someone else. Someone else will need to disarm the traps and protect the unwary and say nice things to strangers... and calm down frightened young boys with a silly question.

  "That's what I wanted to point out. Missing him isn't enough. We need to carry on with his work. If you came here to find a way to deal with the loss of Arthur Weasley, here it is; be him, every once in a while. Add the intentions of a Good man to your life, for Arthur. I don't know how many of you will do it, but let me say that if just a tenth of you strove to add a good Arthur-like deed every once in a while... well, we might be able to keep up with all the good that Arthur Weasley could have done, that he can't do now that he's gone.

  "As for me, I've already vowed to do my 'Arthur'-best to improve the lives of those around me, starting with his family. Starting with this speech."

  Harry was tempted to stop there. He probably should have, but...

  "There's one thing, though. One un-Arthurish thing that I feel I have to do."

  He felt the tone of the audience change in response- a hint of curiosity. He could feel their attention building towards him. He let it collect for a few seconds.

  "I'm going to track down the creature that did this to Arthur and burn it until it screams," Harry declared, "And I'll keep burning him until he can't scream any more."

  The rage was kept in control. He let the heat simmer away from his face and consciously relaxed his shoulders.

  "Thank you," he said, invoked a silent Quietus, and then left the podium for the next speaker to have their say.

  Of course, he had no idea who came after him as he was enveloped in Weasleys soon after.
