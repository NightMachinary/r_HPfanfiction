Philosophize's 3-part series starting with the short linkffn(11197701) is heartwarming and well-written. It's been a while since I read it, but I do remember the social issues coming up quite substantially in the sequels.

There's also the extremely AU linkffn(11762909). YMMV, as fem!Harry is essentially an OC with entirely different characterization.
