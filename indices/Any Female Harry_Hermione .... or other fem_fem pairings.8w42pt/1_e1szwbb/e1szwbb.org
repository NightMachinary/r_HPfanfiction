I would like to say I have a lot to recommend since I collect femslash fics, but a lot are pretty bad, and it's surprisingly difficult to find fics by the summary using simple "femslash" or "f/f" in my collection. But for now, I'll recommend, Murder Most Horrid, which is Hermione/Bellatrix, Lifetimes of Repetition, which I think is fem!Harry/Gabrielle, and Call Me Moriarty, which is fem!Harry/Hermione. A lot of the fics I know are one-shots or short fics.
