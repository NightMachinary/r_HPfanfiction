This looks really good. The pairings are middling for me but the selling point is the writing, not too much and not too little and you managed to hop quickly through the set up while still being believable. Good luck on balancing all the characters, just the 10 from HP look to be a handful.

Whether there is a big plot or it's just camp life I think this'll be interesting.
