I guess if I read a comment of someone talking about their own fic on Reddit and I end up reading it, I'll comment or pm and let them know what I thought. And I love that there's so many fics to choose from, even though I don't read them all and they aren't all to my taste and I would hate for that to change. I was being genuine when I said all the best, if it didn't come across that way, and wanted to express encouragement even if it's not my cup of tea.
