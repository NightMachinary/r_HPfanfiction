That's totally fine. I'm just curious (and truly not trying to be rude, though I'm worried it might come off that way) - why comment about it at all, but especially vaguely? Typically when something doesn't interest me, I just click off and keep moving. But two people taking the time to say they wouldn't read the fic because of the pairings without mentioning which one(s) bother them surprises me.
