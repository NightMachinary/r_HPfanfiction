It gets rid of a lot, but many people just tag their work as multi and it still shows up. For example if you sort by bookmarks in the MCU while excluding M/M literally the second story is Peter Parker/Wade Wilson and Steve Rogers/Bucky Barnes. These days I mainly just exclude by relationship because it tends to be more precise.
