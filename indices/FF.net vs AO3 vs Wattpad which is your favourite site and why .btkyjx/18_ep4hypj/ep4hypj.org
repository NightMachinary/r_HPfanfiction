ff.net tends to be a much simpler site to use, but the limitations on what can be tagged makes it difficult to sift through things easily. Ao3 has pretty much the exact opposite problem in that anything can be tagged and people sometimes take that as a challenge. There is also much, MUCH more slash stories on there and it is irritatingly difficult to try and filter them out. I have nothing against slash in theory but so many of the stories on Ao3 have the pairing being the singular plot points which does absolutely nothing for me.

Recently I have been moving back and forward between the 2 reading MCU and Into the Spiderverse stories, I honestly couldn't say which site is best overall as it very much depends on what you are looking for.

Oh and comparing Wattpad to the other two sites is a little like entering 3 horses for a race with 2 champions with different strengths and the another with every birth defect and communicable disease possible that somehow lumbers along even though it would have been better for everyone if someone just shot it in the head.
