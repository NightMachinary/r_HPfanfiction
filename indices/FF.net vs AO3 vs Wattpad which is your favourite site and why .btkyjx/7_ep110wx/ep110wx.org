I prefer ao3 for its search functions, especially the clickable tags. Though I do hate the folks that overuse them.\\
FFN has a lot of classics and the stories are usually somewhat restrained compared to ao3, therefore usually a safer idea when I do not know who can read my screen.

I tried wattpad once and was not happy with their search functions at all - totally useless for me for that reason.

Plus, ao3 has a dark mode. Much easier on my eyes.
