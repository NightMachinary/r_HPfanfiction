A third edit would be somewhat ridiculous. Okay, so [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] has a feature to swap text and background colours in the chapters themselves. That is no true darkmode the way ao3 and a ton of other sites (reddit as well, looking at the colours onscreen atm) do it, since other pages are still mainly white. When you are suffering from headaches as often as I do, that's not a good thing. Besides, even with the colour swap the chapter page is still somewhat glaring, while any ao3 page is rather soothing to my eyes.
