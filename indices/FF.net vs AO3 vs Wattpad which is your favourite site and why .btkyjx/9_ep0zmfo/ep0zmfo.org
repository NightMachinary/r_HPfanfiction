From the technical point of view I like AO3 most (it is free source, community-driven, the best search, so I can filter out slash and too much gore), but [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] is just so big and has so many members, that a lot of stories are just there. However, I can never find them there, so I am almost completely in mercy of recommendations. And Wattpad ... well, my daughter reads it (hey, she is 14! and a lot of Czech stories are there), but I read like three stories there (actually, I like [[https://www.wattpad.com/37216658-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter]] and [[https://www.wattpad.com/192985075-dursley%27s-dilemma-sequel-to-dursley%27s-daughter-1][Dursley's Dilemma]] , they are not much dramatic, but nice teen-age high-school style; yes, I like Stalky & Co. and so what?), the fourth I will never mention to anybody. In the end what really matters is the text, and I mostly read ePUBs downloaded via [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare][FanFicFare]], so it really doesn't that much where I got the file from.
