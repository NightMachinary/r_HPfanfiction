I didn't even know Wattpad was a thing.

Personally I use FFN unless I am looking for something specific -- Ao3's filtering system is superior /by far/ to FFN filtering.

If I were to create a fic, I'd post it on both FFN and Ao3. Not sure if I'd bother with wattpad, since I didn't even know it existed.
