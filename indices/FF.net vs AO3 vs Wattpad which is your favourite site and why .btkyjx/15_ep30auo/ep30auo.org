I love ao3 as an author and reader. It's great to be able to search by a tag or if you dont want something like crossovers. But a lot of people end up over tagging which is annoying. But i like fanfiction also because it does have a lot I just wish the searching options were better. And I only use wattpad rarely. Rarely can I find decent stories there. A lot are poorly written and way too short
