It's not just that the userbase is inherently better - AO3 deliberately put policies in place that limit opportunities for harassment. Authors can choose to moderate comments (meaning that any comment has to be approved by them before it's publicly visible), they can delete comments, and they can lock their fics to AO3 members-only. There's no direct messaging option. Harassment is explicitly against AO3's ToS, and they have an Abuse Team to back it up.
