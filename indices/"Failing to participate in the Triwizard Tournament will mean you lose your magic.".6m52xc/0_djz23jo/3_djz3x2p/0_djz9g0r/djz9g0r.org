As much as I like some of White Squirrel's work, I didn't get that far in that particular fic :/ It just didn't hold me, even though I love the core concept. It felt a bit too... I'm not sure how to describe it... you know those TV shows like big brother that show you unedited, 24/7, footage of people doing not much? It kinda felt like that. The event density wasn't high enough for me. Is that just a thing at the beginning or does it get tighter?

As for the animal punishment, I could totally see a frog bowl on the teacher's table in the great hall to hold the victims. If canon were a bit more like traditional wizards and witches, they might even transfigure the students who entered, but weren't chosen --- kinda like Dumbledore's age line --- maybe for only a few days? :)
