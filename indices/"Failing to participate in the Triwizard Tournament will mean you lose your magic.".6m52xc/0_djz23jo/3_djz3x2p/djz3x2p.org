  Would canon Harry compete in the tournament if it was explained that the consequence of not doing so was to have a second scar proclaiming him to be a coward stamped on his noggin?

Have you been reading White Squirrel's The Accidental Animagus? That's exactly the potential penalty that comes with breaking the Triwizard contract, mentioned in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/91/The-Accidental-Animagus][chapter 91]]. That and being bedridden until the Tournament is over.

Also, I like the 'turned into an animal' one. Witches and wizards are famous for turning people into frogs, right? The school is named Hogwarts, so maybe when Harry declares that there's no way he's participating, and walks out of the Great Hall...~oink oink~

...Actually, I was going to conclude the above rant by including a request for 'fics with a sensible binding magical contract in Goblet of Fire', but I couldn't think of a way to segue from the rant I was writing to the request.
