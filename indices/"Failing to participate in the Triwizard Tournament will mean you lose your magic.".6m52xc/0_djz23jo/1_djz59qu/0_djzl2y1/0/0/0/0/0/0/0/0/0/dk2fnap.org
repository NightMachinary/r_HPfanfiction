No, Hermoine's job is to stick to his friend and not keep him in dark and not act like a minion of Headmaster of her school. Nature of contact was dictated by Dumbledore. How much of it was Dumbledores influence? We don't know. We see Harry hearing Hermoine tell him "...our letters were useless. Dumbledroe asked us to...."

What did he ask them? Keep him hooked so he doesn't fall off the deep end but don't tell him anything? Was it so hard to get his memory about Voldemort's resurrection and sent it to Rita? Rita was poisonous but she never wrote anything false. It was always facts, however distorted they were. This kind of scoop could have offed Fudge.

Not to mention everyone freeloading at a convicted killers house all the while Speaker of Parliament doing absolutely nothing to get him off the criminal list.

Voldemort was resurrected by then and technically he had Harry's blood. Blood protection wouldn't stop him. What's stopping Voldemort from following owl carrying 'useless' letter to Harry's house?

Voldemort had followers in ministry and apparently ministry knew his location. It wasn't even a secret. Everyone knew about Lily and her sister. He could have taken that location from ministry?

Friendship is a mutual relationship dear. If your friend isn't helpful to you in any way, and doesn't bring to table anything constructive in any form, you are better off without them. Humans are selfish, they are designed that way. Genes don't take chances. And a pet Hermoine following Headmaster of her school instead of sticking to her friend is stupidly dangerous. She is supposed to be 'smartest witch' of her age. She is supposed to be better.
