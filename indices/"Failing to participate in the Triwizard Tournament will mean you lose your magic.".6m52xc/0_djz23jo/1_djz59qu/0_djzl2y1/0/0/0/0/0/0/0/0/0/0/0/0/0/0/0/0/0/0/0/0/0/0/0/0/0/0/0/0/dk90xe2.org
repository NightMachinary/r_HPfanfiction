1) I have no idea what what you just wrote has to do with anything.

2) Ron and Hermione don't owe Harry anything. Harry's stuck with Voldemort after him, but Hermione and Ron could have left Harry any time and had much easier safer lives. Hermione might have had to flee to Bulgaria, France, or Australia when Voldemort took over. Ron could have just stayed put and been left alone, the pureblood that he was. So, the fact that they stuck by Harry as much as they had is already something Harry --- and fans of Harry --- should be very thankful for.

3) What's a "real place"? Lupin wasn't allowed to teach at Hogwarts, but that's the only instance of actual discrimination that we see. Maybe most werewolves just /liked/ what Fenrir Greyback had to offer, and the rest went into hiding.

I am not sure what "We were talking about how the coincident presence Philospher stone doesn't mean anything in greater picture of greater good." means. Can you clarify?
