  Nope. Most people are genetically wired for empathy and altruism, especially towards those they consider a part of their tribe; the few who aren't are called "sociopaths" and "psychopaths" (or Antisocial Personality Disorder).

Sociopath = Lack of remorse and shame do to lack of emotions.

Psychopaths = a person suffering from chronic mental disorder with abnormal or violent social behavior.

I never said that people are emotionless or violent. People can be selfish by giving their food/money to needy people too. May be it brings them fame, power, followers or simply inner satisfaction.

Someones political ascension might be on shoulders of people he helped shelter or feed. A military commander might give free time to his soldiers because this will replenish and refresh his soldiers for next big mission.

Genes are selfish. They do everything in their power to make it certain that they are survive and are passed on to next generation. People care about their families because they are fine tuned to care about them out of need. This need may be based on comfort, monetary gains or personal pleasure.

Similarly these very same people and their ambitions may be hindrance to others. Someone giving everything in charity may be ruining economy in long term? Or depriving his own family of much needed attention because he was so invested in getting the inner satisfaction and peace from helping the needy people that he didn't care about his own family who weren't part of his activities as they weren't helpful to any of his selfish desires.

I appreciate that role of Dumbledre and accept that as a commander of one side he sometimes do what's best for the greater cause. Every leader does that. Sometimes the greater cause might hurt people that we care about. Dumbledore bashers think that Dumbledore's plan were hurtful to Harry. They don't hate Dumbledore for being manipulative, they hate him for ruining Harry's life.
