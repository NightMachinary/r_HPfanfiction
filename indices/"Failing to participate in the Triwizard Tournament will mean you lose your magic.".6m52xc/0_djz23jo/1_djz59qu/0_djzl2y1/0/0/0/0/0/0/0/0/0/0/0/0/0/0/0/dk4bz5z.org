1) He shouldn't have been. He was target of 5 major direct attacks and stopped (or fought off) directly 4 times against Voldemort. Again his friends should stick by his side, not other side.

2) It's getting repetitive. I don't think we are getting anywhere.

3) When in 5th year she /finally/ did something even her peers were surprised at Hermoine for breaking rules and standing up to teachers.

4) Dude there are countless things on it. I'm sure you have read all the arguments too. But let's start with things that aren't mentioned.

How is it that secret hiding location of Potter's was so easily known to anyone. What was Hagrid doing when Sirius came to pick Harry? According to Book three, and Hagrid's admission, Sirius told he was godfather of Harry and should be given custody of Harry but Hagrid denied saying Dumbledore asked him to bring Harry to him. All the while Dumbledore's other pet was prancing around at 4 Pivet drive /watching/ Harry's relative.

About serious: I'm sure Dumbledore has no idea of Sirius's loyalty as he had no spies in Voldemort's forces. Such a sad little old man. If only he had an informant in Voldemort's inner circle.

It all seems co-incidence at best and a planned mechanization at worst. It might be either his stupidity or manipulation. I pity him he was this stupid as a stupid person forced to lead a war is a victim cruel fate. I won't blame if he planned it. Leaders in war have to make hard decisions. But that's doesn't mean Harry fans won't call him out on it. Especially if there are people who will try to justify 10 years of child abuse. Living in cupboard under stairs isn't a perfect model of happy childhood.
