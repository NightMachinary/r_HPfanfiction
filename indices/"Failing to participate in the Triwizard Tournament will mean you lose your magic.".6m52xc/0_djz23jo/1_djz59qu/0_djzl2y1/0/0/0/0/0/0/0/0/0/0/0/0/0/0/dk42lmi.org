1. Harry wasn't at the forefront of any efforts at the time, nor should he have been, and he was in the only sanctuary Voldemort and his agents truly couldn't penetrate; and the rest of it is irrelevant to the question of whether he actually had need-to-know about the Order sufficient to risk leaking the information to Voldemort or the Ministry. So, considering that Harry wouldn't have been able to do anything useful with that information, was in the safest place he could be, had repeatedly shown himself to act impulsively, without regard for consequences, and is pathetically easy to manipulate [1], yes, it was a good idea to keep him in the dark.
2. That doesn't answer my question. Do you dispute that it was a good idea on its own merits? Harry seems to instinctively disobey any advice he is given, no matter how justified. That's great for resisting the Imperius, but it's terrible for every other situation. Hermione doesn't have that impulse, and obeys rules when the rules make sense and aren't in the way of what she sees as the greater good. That's actually a pretty healthy way to relate to authority.
3. I'm intrigued. Please, enlighten me about those things. Enlighten me how a girl who set a teacher on fire less than three months into her schooling [2] is anyone's pet.
4. I mean, due to Dumbledore's "manipulations", Harry managed to slay a wizard far more competent then himself and lived to have a successful career and raise a family, all despite having a horcrux of that wizard stuck in his head. I'd say that's the opposite of "ruined".

[1] And by "manipulate", I don't mean the manipulative!Dumbledore fanon. I mean things like Umbridge and Snape being able to provoke him whenever and however they wanted, and Voldemort tricking him into Department of Mysteries.

[2] Harry didn't set his first teacher on fire until more than six months later. :P
