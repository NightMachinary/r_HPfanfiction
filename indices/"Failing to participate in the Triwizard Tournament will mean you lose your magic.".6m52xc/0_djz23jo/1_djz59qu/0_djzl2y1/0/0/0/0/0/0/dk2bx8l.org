Calling it a "theory" gives it more credit than it deserves. Unless you postulate that someone implanted into Harry memories of receiving correspondence from Ron and Hermione that summer (or something similarly far-fetched), the very popular fanon that Ron and Hermione didn't write to Harry during the summer before OotP is simply false.

Back to the point, what you actually wrote was

  She already was teachers pet. Letting headmaster decide if she should contact her friend outside of school or not.
#+end_quote

Now you've softened it a little to saying that Dumbledore "defined" nature of her contact, whatever that means. That's progress. Eventually, we might get to something actually consistent with canon, like "Hermione followed Dumbledore's very sensible advice for maintaining operational security of the Order."

By the way, why is it that The Great Isolation gets treated like a character-defining moment for Hermione but not for Ron? Ron was there too, he followed Dumbledore's suggestions just as fastidiously, yet nobody ever calls /him/ a teacher's pet.
