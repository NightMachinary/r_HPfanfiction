1) And ofc Dumbledore is senile old man with no idea of dark arts. Voldemort fears him only because he fears all the people with white beards. /s

2) Sigh... We won't agree on it no matter what. And people will continue to see Ron and Hermoine as someone who failed their friend.

5) Doesn't change the fact that "dark" creatures chose Voldemort because they had no real place in Dumbledore's Britain.

Anyway! We were talking about how the coincident presence Philospher stone doesn't mean anything in greater picture of greater good.
