Don't conflate Harry's speculation about his father with something that he is narrated as having perceived directly, thought about, and acted on. Again, unless you are postulating that he was hallucinating, given false memories, or something similarly far-fetched, Ron and Hermione did write to him. (And, if you view him as that unreliable, then there is nothing you can say about anything that happened in canon, including the very existence of Hermione and Dumbledore, to say nothing of their characters.)

Me, I'll stick with my assumption that, unless we are given a strong indication that Harry was hallucinating or having a vision, his senses are generally accurate.

Oh, and Hermione's job is to be Harry's "eyes and ears" now? She's a friend, not a minion.
