1. Decisions should be made based on their expected future consequences. It doesn't matter how many times Harry had confronted Voldemort, because Voldemort still couldn't reach him while he's at 4 Privet Drive. So, there was no benefit to keeping Harry in the loop -- except for Harry's personal feelings -- but there was a great deal of risk to owling him sensitive information. Just hypothetically, what do you think would have happened had Ron or Hermione written about Lupin departing for some werewolf enclave, and Voldemort had intercepted the owl or read the information through the horcrux link? (Remember, Dumbledore didn't know about the limitations of the link at the time.) Or, if they had written something about Dumbledore recruiting for the Order, and the letter had fallen into Umbridge's hands?
2. Actually, I think I'm finally coming to understand where you're coming from. Correct me if I am wrong, but when you write "Again his friends should stick by his side, not other side.", you mean that Dumbledore is the "other side" (and Voldemort is yet another side), which makes Harry is the leader of his own side, separate from Dumbledore's. Then, if Dumbledore isn't on Harry's side, then someone (e.g., Ron or Hermione) following his advice in a way that keeps information from their side's leader (i.e., Harry) is a betrayal of their side. In particular, if Hermione takes Dumbledore's advice, that's still picking a side other than Harry's, even if she would -- independently -- conclude that the advice is sound. Am I getting this right?
3. Her peers had no idea what she'd been up to in the first 4 years, so their opinions aren't very valuable. And even then, she only looks like an obedient student next to Harry and Ron, who act like rules, no matter how reasonable, are for other people. Hermione's is actually the one with the healthy attitude towards authority.
4. So you don't actually mean that Dumbledore /ruined/ Harry's life, only gave him a crappy childhood. That's a bit different. Now, the grand conspiracy stuff isn't new. Godric's Hollow was never a secret location, and when the Fidelius was broken, anyone could find it. Unless Snape somehow observed Voldemort's /every/ interaction, they had no way of knowing that Sirius /wasn't/ a Death Eater, if Voldemort practiced any level of operational security, Snape would have never seen Pettigrew. What Dumbledore did know is that the Order had been betrayed and that number and identity of the traitors was unknown, so when Sacrificial Protection fell into his lap, he put Harry in the only place where he couldn't be betrayed by any agent of Voldemort -- with Petunia. An unhappy childhood is better than death by a vengeful Death Eater who'd gotten his hands on Felix Felicis.

And, it seems to me that Harry's fans tend to have an overinflated view of Harry's magical and leadership talents; which leads them want Harry to be Dumbledore's co-equal leader in the fight against Voldemort. When he doesn't actually take that role, they invent all sorts of conspiracy theories about how his potential was crippled by a Manipulative!Dumbledore.
