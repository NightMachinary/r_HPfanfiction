How do you know what Dumbledore knew and when? You tell me to be skeptical of anything he says, yet you speak with a great deal of confidence about things you couldn't possibly know about.

Nobody offered to spare Neville's mom if she'd just let them kill Neville. In fact, Bellatrix, when she tortured the Longbottoms, wanted information about what happened to Voldemort; Neville in his crib was irrelevant. So, no sacrificial protection.

Voldemort and the Death Eaters killed a lot of Hogwarts defenders before Harry's sacrifice -- even though they were attacking a fortress, and they weren't able to kill any after, even though the defenders no longer had the Hogwarts walls to protect them. Do you have a better explanation?

OK. So, my thinking is that while there were other "sides" in the war (like the Ministry), Harry and his friends just didn't represent enough combat or institutional power to be one. At best, they were the Junior Order of the Phoenix, needing adults for resources and if any actual fighting needed to be done. Even within that, there was no "chain of command". Harry doesn't outrank Ron and Hermione. So, Hermione and Ron don't report to Harry any more than he reports to them.

It makes sense if you consider that Dumbledore /doesn't/ actually believe in Greater Good, and he doesn't want to have direct political power: he wants to guide, not govern. That's why he's happy presiding over legislative and judiciary bodies, and running a school, but he never became the Minister of Magic, even though he almost certainly could. This, in turn, stems from his past with Grindelwald and the temptations of power.

So, yes, werewolves faced discrimination after Voldemort's fall. Dumbledore can't change the society's attitudes overnight, and if he tries, any reforms he forcibly imposes are liable to snap back when he dies of old age.
