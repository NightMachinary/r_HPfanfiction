1) I mean he told him that Voldemort's power were transferred. Ofc he didn't tell Harry. He didn't even in DH. He manipulated Snape to do this thing. Anyway since he told Harry about Scar and power transfer, we can guess (after looking at everything in picture) that he knew about Horcrux by that time. How long has he known? He must have tried to figure out how Harry survived AK? I am guessing he knew about Horcrux in Harry since that Halloween night.

2) Harry's friends were inconsequential in bigger picture. In realistic and pragmatic terms they were expendable, replaceable as they weren't vital to any part of story. Yes, they helped Harry in his adventures, but anything they did could have been done by anyone else too.

5) Werewolf (and other "dark" creatures) had no choice! Remember Death Eaters was a minority group. The whole reason they picked arms and violent movement against a majority 'liberal' side was that they had no real political voice. Dumbledore's Phoenix party, admirable may be, but doesn't justify it's existence as ministry was already on their side. Death eaters were fighting against ministry which had The Great "Dark Lord" slayer Dumbledore as it's representative. They were pushed back to the wall by ministry with all the rules against "dark" arts and "dark" creatures.
