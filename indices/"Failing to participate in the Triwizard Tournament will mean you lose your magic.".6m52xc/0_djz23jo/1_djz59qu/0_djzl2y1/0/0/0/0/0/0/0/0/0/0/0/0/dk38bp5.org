The whole thing about selfish genes is off topic, and I am sorry for having continued it.

Back on topic,

1. Do you dispute my claim that keeping Harry in the dark in the summer before OotP was a good idea for operational security reasons? If so, why?
2. Do you dispute my claim that Hermione taking Dumbledore's advice on the subject was a good idea on its own merits? If so, why?
3. Will you stop calling her a "pet" for taking Dumbledore's advice on the subject and lambasting her for not acting like /Harry/'s "pet"? If not, why not?
4. Dumbledore ruining Harry's life is a new one. How, pray tell, did he ruin his life?
