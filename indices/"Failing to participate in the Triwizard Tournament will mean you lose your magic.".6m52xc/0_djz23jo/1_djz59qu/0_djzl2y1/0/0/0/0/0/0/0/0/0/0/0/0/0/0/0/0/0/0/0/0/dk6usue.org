That's exactly right. Sacrificial Protection isn't about hiding a place. Sacrificial Protection is about protecting the person or a group of people. Does it protect communications from being intercepted? Probably not. And, we do know that Dobby could intercept owl post.

Now, Voldemort could and did (in DH) locate 4 Privet Drive, but he couldn't hurt Harry while Harry lived there, until Harry turned 17 or left his home. The Ministry always knew where Harry lived, and nobody at the Ministry killed a parent of Harry's, so they aren't bound by the Sacrificial Protection.

Lily was certainly not the only such mom; but she was probably the only one to be offered to be spared if she let the child be killed. In any case, Harry reproduced the feat in DH. The blood protection activated on its own, and then Dumbledore took it and extended it to 4 Privet Drive -- where Harry's only surviving blood relative lived.

2) I'd still like to know whether I restated your point of view accurately.

4)

My point is that the supposed harm that Dumbledore caused Harry tends to be highly exaggerated.

I apologize in advance how this is going to sound, but I would really like to know: have you read all the canon books, and if so, how long ago? Some of what you write directly contradicts them and sounds like it was taken from Manipulative!Dumbledore fic. For example, in canon werewolves can live freely, even if they aren't allowed near children, and vampires can be guests at a Hogwarts party. Greater Good was a philosophy Dumbledore abandoned more than 50 years before canon events.

As for the claim that Dumbledore didn't do enough, remember that point about the story being in a limited point of view? That means that we only get to know about Dumbledore's work what Harry knew, and Harry didn't know much at all.
