  No, Hermoine's job is to stick to his friend and not keep him in dark and not act like a minion of Headmaster of her school. Nature of contact was dictated by Dumbledore. How much of it was Dumbledores influence? We don't know. We see Harry hearing Hermoine tell him "...our letters were useless. Dumbledroe asked us to...."

This is presuming that keeping Harry in the dark was a kind of betrayal (i.e., failing to stick to him). In actuality, keeping him in the dark, while unpleasant, was the least bad option, for reasons I have given upthread. Information, such as disposition and plans of the Order, was to be communicated on a need-to-know basis. Harry didn't need to know.

There's precedent and postcedent (broom in PoA and parchment jinx in OotP) for Hermione keeping Harry in the dark for his own good, all without any prompting from Dumbledore. You seem to be demanding of Hermione the same blind obedience towards Harry that you seem to imply she has towards Dumbledore. Hermione isn't Harry's appendage any more than she is Dumbledore's.

  What did he ask them? Keep him hooked so he doesn't fall off the deep end but don't tell him anything?
#+end_quote

Now who's using loaded language? "Keep him hooked" in this case just means to stay in touch. As for not telling him anything, again, it's a terrible idea to send sensitive information through an insecure medium like owl post to a person with a mental link of unknown nature to the greatest Legilimens alive. Do you disagree?

  Was it so hard to get his memory about Voldemort's resurrection and sent it to Rita? Rita was poisonous but she never wrote anything false. It was always facts, however distorted they were. This kind of scoop could have offed Fudge.
#+end_quote

False Memory Charm is a thing. Voldemort did it to Harry, Hermione to her parents, Slughorn to himself (albeit not very well), etc..

  Not to mention everyone freeloading at a convicted killers house all the while Speaker of Parliament doing absolutely nothing to get him off the criminal list.

How do you know? For all you know, he tried everything short of casting the Imperius on Fudge.

  Voldemort was resurrected by then and technically he had Harry's blood. Blood protection wouldn't stop him. What's stopping Voldemort from following owl carrying 'useless' letter to Harry's house? Voldemort had followers in ministry and apparently ministry knew his location. It wasn't even a secret. Everyone knew about Lily and her sister. He could have taken that location from ministry?
#+end_quote

Voldemort's ritual didn't work as intended. He could touch Harry, but 4 Privet Drive remained an inviolable sanctuary. Or, at least, both Dumbledore and Voldemort acted like it were the case, and if they both agree on something, it's probably true.

  Friendship is a mutual relationship dear. If your friend isn't helpful to you in any way, and doesn't bring to table anything constructive in any form, you are better off without them.
#+end_quote

So, Hermione should've ditched Harry and Ron after the Troll thing? Because, I don't recall them being particularly helpful to her after that, while being a huge drain on her time and constantly dragging her into dangerous situations. (Not to mention that without Harry and Ron, she wouldn't have been exposed to the Troll in the first place.)

Funnily enough, her ditching them kind of happened in HBP, and we all know how /that/ ended.

  Humans are selfish, they are designed that way. Genes don't take chances.
#+end_quote

Nope. Most people are genetically wired for empathy and altruism, especially towards those they consider a part of their tribe; the few who aren't are called "sociopaths" and "psychopaths" (or Antisocial Personality Disorder).

  And a pet Hermoine following Headmaster of her school instead of sticking to her friend is stupidly dangerous. She is supposed to be 'smartest witch' of her age. She is supposed to be better.
#+end_quote

You know, Dumbledore wasn't just a school headmaster. He was also the leader of all forces then fighting against Voldemort, the only bulwark against Voldemort's takeover, and an uber-wizard with a century of general life experience and decades of experience fighting Dark uber-wizards, as well as decades' track record of fighting for Muggleborn rights. So, even if we suppose that Hermione couldn't figure out why Dumbledore had asked her what he had, it would have probably been a good idea to obey anyway, because, yes, he almost certainly /does/ know better.

What's more dangerous: withholding information from a friend who can't act on it anyway and would probably do something he'd regret if he tried, or disobeying your side's commander in chief?
