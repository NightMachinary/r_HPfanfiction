1) Dumbledore told Harry after chamber of secrets. We don't know how long he has knows. Probably he checked Harry's scar before dropping him at Petunia's house? But yeah! We can't be sure.

2) Another point we might never agree, I guess.

5) Still better than forcing werewolf to side with Voldemort as they had no other choice.
