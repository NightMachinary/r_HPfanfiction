1) Ah! So you think Voldemort won't follow owl but believe that he will intercept stuff. That's rich. Any way Ministry knew his posiiton. (1) Dementors attacked. (2) They tracked his underage magic use.

Sacrificial protection? I don't how people even swallow that pill. Lily can't be the only mom in war to come between her child and death.

Secondly she decided to hide under fidelus and wasn't expecting to be betrayed. Why would she set a blood protection at Petunia's house that would need Harry's stay at Petunia's house?

4) I used troubled because I felt like some people get triggered by 'ruined'. I got the vibe that you were getting defensive about it. Anyway we discussed how coincidentally everything fell on Halloween night. Let's talk about coincident about Stone, Wraith and Harry's first year at school.

5) Ah! He had all the major positions in Magic world except minister who was easy to handle. He had Elder Wand and that cloak when series started. Later he hunted resurrection stone. His only contribution in 1st and 2nd war against Voldemort mention in canon is him retrieving that stone. I wonder why? Of cousrse he took ministry after Dumbledore's death. It was a power gap, that Dumbledore had tightly under his thumb. Before you try to say things like he did it for Greater Good of Britain let's realize that 'dark creatures' like Werewolves (and others) were still outlawed under his ministry. An innocent, and I'm sure he isn't the only one (he is just the one that Harry noted and we got to see), suffered for his incompetence at best and manipulation for Greater Good at worst.

I will call it PIS. Villains being villain and doing dumb stuff, or performing substandard, to suite a plot.

P.S: It's hard for me to write in-depth passages in English. It's neither primary nor secondary language. I learned it in educational setup my country so I'm limited in using resources. I feel like sometimes I fail to properly convey my real message and end up saying stuff that does't add anything of value. Forgive my shortcomings.
