The thing about HP, the series, narrative is we get to see things from HP, the characters, perspective. We don't experience stuff as it is, but as how Harry Potter saw, heard or felt something. Everything is colored with his opinion.

His opinions on things and events are filtered by his world view which was developed in an abusive household where he was living in a cupboard. It's not a normal upbringing.

The biggest twist he ever got was Snape's memory. Harry Potter's views on Snape were bare to all. Harry loathed Snape, and wanted him dead for many things, including murder of Dumbledore. But after seeing Snape's memory Harry's view changed so much so that he named is son after that man.

That memory was a shocker to Harry Potter but many fans saw it coming miles away. Despite seeing events from Harry's PoV some fans knew that things behind the scenes weren't going as Harry thought they were.

Similarly other events in Canon can be interpreted in ways other than how Harry Potter interpreted them.

--------------

Nobody calls him a teacher's pet because he wasn't that perceptive any way. He didn't have insight on things and was slow on uptake. And Harry, or viewers, didn't expect him to keep an eye on stuff and be eyes and ears of someone who did more against voldemort than all the Order combined in both wars.

He was a happy-go-lucky jealous guy struggling to make his place in a big family who became friends with the most famous wizard of his generation because he couldn't find a compartment with an empty seat in whole train till he reached Harry's one.
