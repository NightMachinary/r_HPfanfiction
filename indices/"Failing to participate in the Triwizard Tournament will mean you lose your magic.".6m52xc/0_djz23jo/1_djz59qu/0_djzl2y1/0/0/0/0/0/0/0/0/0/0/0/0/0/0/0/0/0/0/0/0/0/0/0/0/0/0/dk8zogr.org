1) He transfered powers, not power; but anyway, that's a far cry from confirming that Harry is a horcrux; and in any case, Dumbledore orchestrated possibly the only possible sequence of events that had Voldemort die permanently while Harry lived.

2) That still doesn't explain why Harry is his own "side"; and it still doesn't explain why he "outranks" his friends, in that information should flow to him and orders from him.

5) There was no Phoenix party. There was Order of the Phoenix, a paramilitary organization started by Dumbledore to oppose the Death Eaters. And the rest of the stuff is fanon: there are no rules against practicing Dark Arts that we know of, except for a few select spells; but Hogwarts doesn't teach them. And, similarly, wizadring society is shown as making slow but steady social progress: more and more laws are passed against abusing Muggles, they have their first Muggleborn Prime Minister, and the Wolfsbane Potion is developed, so give a decade or two, werewolves would probably be accepted as well. On the other hand, all Voldemort could promised werewolves is being able to infect Muggles and Muggleborns with impunity.
