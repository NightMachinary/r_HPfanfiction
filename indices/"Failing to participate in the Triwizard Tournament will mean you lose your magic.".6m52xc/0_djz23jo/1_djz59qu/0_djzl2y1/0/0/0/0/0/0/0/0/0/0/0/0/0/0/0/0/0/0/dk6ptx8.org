1. Good point about not being certain about the link -- though Dumbledore probably suspected -- but sending confidential stuff over owl was still a terrible idea for reasons I had outlined. Your hypothesis that Voldemort could have attacked Harry at 4 Privet Drive just by following an owl is inconsistent with actions of everyone involved, good and bad. If you really believe that he could have done that, can you explain 1) Why did Dumbledore, who certainly did want Harry alive at least at that point, leave him there? 2) Why didn't Voldemort attack him there for two and a half summers' worth, including after Dumbledore died, but attacked the moment Harry left 4 Privet drive without intention to return? The only answer I can see is that Sacrificial Protection, enhanced by Dumbledore's own magic, held until Harry would have turned 17 or left Petunia's home forever. And, the Elder Wand is just a really good wand with a weird loyalty system; Grindelwald had it when Dumbledore beat him, for example.

2. So I did get the underlying philosophy right, basically? My post wasn't meant to judge that position, but as an attempt to pass an "Ideological Turing Test" -- to restate your position in my own words in a way that you would agree with.

3. "Peers" was your word, not mine; if you had written that Harry was surprised or that her friends were surprised, I would have replied accordingly. In any case, so what if Harry thought it was unusual? Harry isn't actually that great a judge of character; and given his general attitude, of course he would confuse general politeness with blind obedience.

4. Nobody denies that Dumbledore could have done better -- though whether he could have done better given his knowledge, resources, and other responsibilities is a different question -- but notice that you've gone from "ruined" to merely "troubled".

5. Dumbledore abandoned Greater Good when Ariana died. If Dumbledore were after the greater good, he would have stuck with Grindelwald and they would have happily taken over the world together. His supposed obsession with Hallows is also largely fanon. That was Grindelwald. As for what he did against Voldemort, again, Harry didn't have need-to-know; but, do notice that Voldemort took the Ministry a month after his death.

   Harry training DA was conceived and organized by Hermione, betrayed by someone brought into the group via Harry (who brought Cho who brought Marietta), with the damage limited by Hermione's parchment jinx (which kept Marietta from giving details until she could be Obliviated). Then, Harry led everyone into Voldemort's trap, and once there, they only survived because the terrain favored running away and because Death Eaters were using kid gloves. (Notice how only Hermione was targeted with a lethal Dark curse; Harry and the pureblooded kids were targeted with Stunners and similar.) Even so, most of his friends were hurt and his godfather killed. That's not a success. That's a disaster, slightly mitigated by Voldemort's return being revealed to the Ministry -- which was definitely not something Harry had planned for. So, yes: it definitely counts for something. That something is that Harry may be good at keeping his head under fire and at some tactical leadership, but he should be kept as far away from planning and strategic decisions as possible.
