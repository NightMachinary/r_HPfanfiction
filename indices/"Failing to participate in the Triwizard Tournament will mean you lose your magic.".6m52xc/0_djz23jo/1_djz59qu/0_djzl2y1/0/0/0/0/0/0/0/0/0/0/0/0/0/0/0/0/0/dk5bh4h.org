1) Mixing some fan theories and half baked apologetic arguments with poorly constructed logics are we? Canon established that nobody knew about his connection, not until he notified people about snake thing in DoM. Voldemort could have followed owl regardless. Information in letters wouldn't have mattered. Major players on both sides believed in Prophecy and killing off Harry would have done the deed anyway. Speaks volume when a wizard with elder wand orchestrate events so that a kid have to face darkest lord.

2) On the great chessboards of war every piece has its value. And sometimes more than two players play the game. If my friend was pawn in someone else's game then that friend isn't beneficial or trustworthy. People will continue to see this ordeal as underhanded manipulation.

3) Her peers had no idea and yet what we read as canon is actually opinion of Harry Potter instead of what's actually happened. So if we are reading opinion of others heard by Harry Potter than perhaps they have some merit. If this fiction was 3rd person omniscient and have said that she wasn't a pet but so and so tend to think her to be one then may be I would have accepted.

4) Dude don't expect me to post everything. I am sure Dumbledore bashers have written countless blogs on why they consider Harry's life was troubled by deliberate or mistaken choices of Headmaster.

5) Fans tend to have different opinions. Some believe Dumbledore was a good leader, others think he forsake far too many on road to greater good. Some people think that training and later successfully leading rag tag school children and thwarting DoM adventure counts as something, others might consider it....? Dumbledore doesn't seem to have done anything that actively stopped any of Voldemort's plan, except ring? Which coincidentally coincides with his life long fascination (obsession) with deathly hallows.
