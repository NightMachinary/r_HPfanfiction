1) We don't know what happened that night except that Voldemort killed his parents and then he tried to kill Harry. What stopped that curse? We can only theorize but can't say for certain. Canon only tells us what Dumbledore told Harry. And I don't really want to take his words as truths. His was commander of one side and when defeat of other side is linked to death of your trump card then you try to steer your trump card toward certain goals. Dumbledore knew about soul anchor in Harry's body.

Anyway back to how that love part. Neville's mom was in same position. I guess he must have some kind of protection too if love, sacrifice and choice is the key?

Harry's sacrifice (or love) didn't do shit for anybody. AK hits souls and drives it out of body. Voldemort's AK hit Harry and drove 1 soul out of Harry's body. If it was same thing as Lily's then everyone in castle should have survived since Harry willingly sacrificed his life for people in castle.

2) There are never only two sides in war. Yes to that extent I think you paraphrased my ideology better.

5) My point about “dark” creature came from last war. All the “dark” creatures supported “dark” lord. They were marginalized in supposedly good era.

Greater Good terms tend to incite knee jerk reaction. Dumbledore was a political tycoon with vast influence. And he did it for betterment of Britain.
