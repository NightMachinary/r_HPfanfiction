Not this fanon again! Both Ron and Hermione wrote to Harry in the summer after GoF, and he wrote back. What they they did do on Dumbledore's request was to avoid writing about current events and The Order. That is, to refrain from sending potentially sensitive information about the Order and what they knew through an easily intercepted---by Voldemort's or Umbridge's people---medium to a person with a mental link of unknown nature to the greatest Legilimens alive.

It frustrated Harry to no end, but really, it's common sense.
