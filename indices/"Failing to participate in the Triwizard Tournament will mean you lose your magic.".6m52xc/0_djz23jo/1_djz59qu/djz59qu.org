I like the idea that it would inflict a terrible irony on someone.

A reclusive misogynist would turn into a Veela.

Voldemort would gain crippling empathy.

Harry would become a house elf.

Luna would become a rationalist and have great intelligence but never be happy again.

Snape would fall in love with random muggle women and then murder them in his sleep and dream about his dead loved ones every night.

Remus would become a wolf who turns into a raving lunatic of a wizard during the full moon.
