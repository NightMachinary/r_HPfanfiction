One of the points of fanfiction is to explore and interpret the events of canon. Losing your magic has come to be a quick and simple explanation for what 'Binding Magical Contract' means, because the consequences for competing in the tournament are so large (possible death) and authors feel there needs to be a commensurately high consequence for backing out --- otherwise, canon Harry could have just done so.

We only see one other example of binding magical contract in canon (Hermione's DA contract) and the consequence of that was to have 'sneak' scarred into the person's forehead. I agree it would be interesting to see some other consequences for the GoF explored. Would canon Harry compete in the tournament if it was explained that the consequence of not doing so was to have a second scar proclaiming him to be a coward stamped on his noggin?

Ranting about a specific trope is all well and good, but let's get some creative alternatives going.

1. Transfigured into an animal (sentient) for the duration of the tournament.
2. Blindness
3. Cursed to never finish fourth year until commitment is honoured (defence position style curse or possibly time travel shenanigans.)
4. (Bonus --- because this is fanfic) Gender swapped.
