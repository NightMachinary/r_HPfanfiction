- Why bother using the Goblet at all??? Just hold tryouts in case a student ends up not being able to compete. What the hell is the point of the Goblet anyway??

- If the Goblet can strip away the magic from someone who didn't even put their name in, why aren't they using it as a weapon to strip the magic from their enemies? Just dig up old school assignment or other paper with Tom Riddle's or Bellatrix's signature, throw it in the Goblet, and then boom! No more magic for your enemies.
