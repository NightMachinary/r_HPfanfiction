  If the Goblet can strip away the magic from someone who didn't even put their name in, why aren't they using it as a weapon to strip the magic from their enemies? Just dig up old school assignment or other paper with Tom Riddle's or Bellatrix's signature, throw it in the Goblet, and then boom! No more magic for your enemies.

It's such a small leap in logic too... it really makes me mad that no-one even thinks of that idea. Here you have a device that has been proven to be able to make people do things against their will and is able to punish them in some esoteric way if they refuse yet nobody considers to use this as a weapon against their very real enemies? Hello? Voldemort is resurrected right in the same story... It's like [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b6/b3/da/b6b3da22e80a1adfcb360bfdb28141cd.jpg][connect the dots for toddlers]] and everyone going "Duuuh, I have no idea what to do here"

Someone really needs to write a story about how there's some kind of degenerative mental disease that has infected Wizarding society. It would explain why Muggleborns are reasonable when they join and then after they are infected start becoming gradually more retarded. Hermione and Harry show late stage symptoms of the disease when they decide to go on a camping trip and wear a Horcrux around their necks in Book 7.
