linkffn(Forging the Sword) lampshades the ridiculousness of losing your magic so easily, and invents legal consequences instead. (See Chapter 15.)

  "The Triwizard Tournament may have started as just a friendly competition between the schools of magic... until the fourteenth century. That's when a scandal involving Beauxbatons' champion -- who was from Lorraine -- and Durmstrang's champion, from neighboring Burgundy, triggered a minor border war between the two duchies."

  ...

  "But there's no binding between you and the Goblet; that'd be impossible since you didn't enter the Tournament yourself. By definition -- by the very fundamentals of contract law, magical or not -- you cannot have a contract unless both parties agree to it. An enslavement, maybe, but not a contract. But there is a binding treaty - and make no mistake, treaty is just another word for contract - between the governments of the schools' champions. That treaty requires them to ensure their citizen will follow the rules."

  "Wait," Harry said, incredulous. "You mean the British Ministry is going to make me compete? What happens if I say no?"

  "If you defy all their persuasive efforts," she said, looking oddly solemn, "they will do the only thing they can to fulfill the contract. Since they must ensure that their citizens compete, if you refuse to compete, then they will exile you, and strip away your identity as a magical British citizen."
