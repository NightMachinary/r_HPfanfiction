Theoretically, couldn't Harry have just shown up to each task and then sat around doing nothing? For example, he could have waited on the shore of the lake until he ran out of time.

In the books Harry wanted to win, but that's not true for many fanfictions. What's stopping Harry from just twiddling his thumbs on the sidelines until he loses? The contract might force him to participate, but it can't force him to actually try to win.
