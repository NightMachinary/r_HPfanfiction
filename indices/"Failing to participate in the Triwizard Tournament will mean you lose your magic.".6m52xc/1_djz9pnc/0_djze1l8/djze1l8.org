  Theoretically, couldn't Harry have just shown up to each task and then sat around doing nothing? For example, he could have waited on the shore of the lake until he ran out of time.

Depends on the meaning of participation. It's perfectly possible (and indeed very common) for contracts to oblige someone to use "reasonable endeavors" or "best endeavors" to do something.

I'm not sure if the binding magical contract in question is written down somewhere or if it's something more esoteric. But either way there is presumably something which determines the meaning of participation, whether that be the Goblet itself or some document which outlines the rules of the tournament as agreed by the respective Ministries.
