#+begin_quote
  [COMPLETE] Harry has been entered in the Triwizard Tournament, but during the shouting match with Ron he realises that he doesn't actually have to risk his life and look like a fool in front of everyone - he really only needs to show up for each task and make a token effort. Single-point-of-departure fic, departing early in book 4. Some text borrowed from J.K. Rowling.
