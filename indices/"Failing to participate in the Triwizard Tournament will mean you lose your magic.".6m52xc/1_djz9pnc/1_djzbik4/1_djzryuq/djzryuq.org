    - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/][/Harry Potter: Unchampion/]] (25,236 WL; Complete) --- In other stories Harry's decision of non-competition suddenly ends up being beneficial for him in various ways. Here it's mostly what it is, him saving himself the troubles and risks attached to TWT.

    - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/][/Muggle-Raised Champion/]] (106,020 WL; WiP) --- technically well-written story and interesting to read, but also has wishful thinking elements. Harry decides to waste minimal effort on each task, but somehow the odds end up on his side each time and he ends up winning without even planning to.
