  That's what always pops into my head along with the 'dark artifact' thing, anyway.

For what it's worth, there's a small plot arc like that in [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][/Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council/]] (Buffy × HP × Addams Family crossover).

IIRC, Wednesday Addams explains that their family stand for individualism and personal freedoms first and foremost, and for that reason they've been known to hunt and destroy “free will”-negating artefacts for centuries.

She describes Goblet of Fire as one of the meanest of them yet, and says that they've been previously unable to do anything about it because it's usually being very well hidden or guarded by the wizards.
