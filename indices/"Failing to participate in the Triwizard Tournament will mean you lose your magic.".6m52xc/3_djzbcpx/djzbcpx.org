  "One, being forced to do X activities, on pain of permanent life-altering meta-physical injury, without any other way out of it, stinks to me of slavery, textbook definition.

Crouh Sr: 'What are you going to do, sue the goblet?'

Also, even if it doesn't strip you from magic, it still forces you to compete. Even the Canon Goblet enforces slavery.

  And, given that the Goblet of Fire is forcing this kind of slavery on innocent young schoolchildren, I have to ask, why isn't it considered a dark artifact and why hasn't it been destroyed yet

Seriously? Are we talking about the same ministry of magic?

#+begin_quote
  If you can have a contract suck away someone's magic, that actually gives my Muggle-Born Registration Committee some legitimacy, doesn't it? Because you have proven use of methods that can drain magic out of a witch or wizard, the idea of transferring that same magic to a muggle or muggle-born stops sounding like a complete fabrication.

This is legitimate, yes.

There are a lot of reasons the Goblet stripping you from magic doesn't work well. That it enforces slavery which is wrong and thus can't happen isn't one of them. Wrong things can happen. In fact, they do it all the time. And the Ministry certainly isn't going to depart from a powerful artifact they control, even if what it does is wrong.

  If you assume having your magic stripped away to be akin to have a similar impact on your life to having your arms cut off or something like that, yes
#+end_quote

Had I magic, I think I would prefer to lose an arm (even my right arm). I think it 's far more crippling to lose your magic.
