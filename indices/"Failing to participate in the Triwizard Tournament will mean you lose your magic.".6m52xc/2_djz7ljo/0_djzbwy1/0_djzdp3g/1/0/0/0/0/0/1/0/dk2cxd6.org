Yes, I think it works.\\
Personally, I see the goblet as a format (a bit like the paper on which you would usually sign a contract) and an enforcer of the contract, as well as a judge which select the champions.\\
I think willingly putting your name in the goblet is the equivalent of willingly signing a more usual contract. Once the selection of the champions has been made, a contract is created, binding the winners, and then the goblet enforces it somehow.\\
In that case, Crouch would have 1. entered Harry and tricking the Goblet into 'thinking' that Harry himself was the one doing it and 2. tricked the Goblet into 'thinking' there was a 4th school in which Harry belonged to.\\
If magic can certify your signature when you sign a contract, it can probably certify a piece of parchment you toss in a goblet, too. It's maybe just not as secure, which would explain why Crouch could circumvent it while magical contracts are usually foolproof.\\
I mean, the weak point has to be the Goblet. Otherwise, it would be a loophole in contract magic itself, which wizards would use all the time.

Under Imperius, though, People wouldn't sign willingly. I don't think it would work. Through a creative use of the memory charm, it might be possible.
