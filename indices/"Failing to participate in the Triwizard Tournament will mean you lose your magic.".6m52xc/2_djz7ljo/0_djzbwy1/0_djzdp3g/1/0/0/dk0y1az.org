But that was said in the context of tricking the goblet into choosing a fourth champion. I was thinking about the possibility of entering someone simply for one of the three schools already participating, so they wouldn't have to be exceptionally good at charms to manage that (though, I wonder if Barty Crouch Jr. could do it, exactly how powerful do you have to be, because we never really knew how powerful he was and he was never made out to be a figure like Dumbledore or Voldemort...). And since the competition is exceedingly dangerous, it is believable that someone could be chosen and killed, even /if/ the goblet has criteria for minimum qualifications or ability (and we have no idea how it chooses, so it might be random for all we know).
