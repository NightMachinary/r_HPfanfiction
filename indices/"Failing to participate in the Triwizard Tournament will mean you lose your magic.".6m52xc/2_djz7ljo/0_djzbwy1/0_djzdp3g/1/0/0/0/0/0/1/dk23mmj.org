Perhaps the goblet of fire itself is an unusual case? I can't imagine that magical contracts are normally formed by tossing a piece of parchment with a name written on it into a goblet. If they are otherwise used... In which case, I don't see how you could enter someone else into a magical contract, except perhaps through imperius as you could force them to sign...
