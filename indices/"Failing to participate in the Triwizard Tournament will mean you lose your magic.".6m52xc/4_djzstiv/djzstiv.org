I have always liked the idea of magical fairness. You know how there are story's and fables where if you help a disguised genie, they are obliged to help you back, or how a witch can demand a first born child in exchange for magical cabbages which save the mothers life. So I could definitely see it so that the higher the reward, the harder it is to break the contract. And by harder, I mean that if you break it something happens. Maybe Harry could not use that concept of magical fairness the next time. Maybe when he needs it most, his luck will abandon him. Or maybe he is labeled oathbreaker, and would be incapable of swearing on his magic, which would actually be quite terrible. But, since he didn't enter it purposefully, and doesn't really have much to gain, but everything to lose, he could probably break it off with minimal consequences. In my mind anyway.
