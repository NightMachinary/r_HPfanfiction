I feel like I'm constantly recommending [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1316097/Pinky-Brown][Pinky Brown]], but a lot of her fics are very focused on day-to-day interactions with the trio. There are a few fics with Ginny in them that kind of do the whole teens being teens thing, though that's not for everyone. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4054307/1/Stupid-Bloody-Ink-Bottle][Stupid Bloody Ink Bottle]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133294/1/The-Monster-in-Her-Chest][The Monster in Her Chest]] are pretty good.
