I immediately thought of The Merging and Steps Towards the End when I saw the topic. Both do the "magical boarding school" thing pretty well. A few others that capture at least some of that:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff][Harry the Hufflepuff]] does the comedic version of this.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8730465/1/C-est-La-Vie][C'est La Vie]] has elements of this, with the added wrinkle of time travel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4201201/11/Rustlings-in-the-Dark][Rustlings in the Dark]] has elements of this, with the added wrinkle of a murder mystery.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6896279/1/We-ll-All-Fall-After-The-Yule-Ball][We'll All Fall After the Yule Ball]] is kind of a long one-shot version of this, with an emphasis on the "dating" part and not so much with the "learning magic" part. As I recall it gets a bit odd towards the end.

[[http://shoebox.lomara.org//][The Shoebox Project]] is a Marauders-era version of this.
