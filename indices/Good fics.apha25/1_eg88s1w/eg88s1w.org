Harry/Daphne is one of my favourite pairings. Have you read the fics by this author? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8431550/Dorothea-Greengrass]] There's also this community of fics [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Completed-Harry-and-Daphne-Fanfiction/126530/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/]] with completed works in this pairing.

Linkffn(Unatoned) is a personal favourite, but very different from standard Harry/Daphne fics. Linkffn(The Legacy Preservation Act) is an interesting spin on the marriage law/contract trope. Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is a post war fic that's more lighthearted. Linkffn(Days to come) Linkffn(Beltane Child) are also in the post war genre, but those last three aren't really action stories.

More in the fighting the war story with Haphne is linkffn(Honour thy blood).

For Harry/Bellatrix I'd suggest Linkffn(Delenda Est) but you most likely have already read it since it's highly acclaimed.
