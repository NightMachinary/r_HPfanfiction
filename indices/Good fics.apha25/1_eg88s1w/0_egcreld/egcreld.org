  Harry/Daphne is one of my favourite pairings.

you didn't list it, and it's a kinda new... and feels like a good fic, so I thought I could link it; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]] which is from Daphne PoV.

another one which is also Daphne/Harry is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13022013/1/Novocaine][Novocaine]] in which Harry finds out he is loaded (got all death eater money) and needs help investing it all into rebuilding Diagon Alley... Daphne is the lawyer he finds & employs.
