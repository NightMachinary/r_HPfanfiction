linkffn(The Arithmancer) if you're interested in Hermione inventing interesting spells.

linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) is one of my all time favorites, Sirius is very caring for Harry and Tonks working with Remus is interesting.

linkffn(The Green Girl) is another fic I really appreciated. Good plot twists and a interesting dark side.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina) has the most awesome Regulus Black I've even seen.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path)

linkffn(The Very Best by BrilliantLady)

linkffn(Raptor by sakurademonalchemist)

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist)

linkffn(The many Deaths of Harry Potter)
