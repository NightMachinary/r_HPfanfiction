For sure. And even here there are highly rated fics that I personally didn't enjoy (i.e. Emperor), fics I enjoyed when I read them years ago but didn't enjoy recently/on a second reading/have arguably aged poorly (i.e. Black Comedy), and easily more than a dozen other fics on that list that I tried and didn't enjoy. So I was just making it clear that I wasn't /personally/ endorsing every fic on the list, even though it's a good start.
