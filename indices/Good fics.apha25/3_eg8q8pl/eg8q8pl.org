I love this story. There isn't any parings until later and it's not the point of the story. It's really good in my opinion. Please give it a chance. It's primarily Harry and Tom Riddle learning to be family. It's cannon up to the summer of year 5. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws]]
