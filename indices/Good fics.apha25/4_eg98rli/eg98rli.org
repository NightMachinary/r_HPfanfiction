If you like HP/DG fics, then I have to recommend Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/20/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][13133746]])

It's my current favourite HP fic, it's not terribly action packed but it is extremely well-written and believable, decent length, regular updates and has a definite end-point in sight.
