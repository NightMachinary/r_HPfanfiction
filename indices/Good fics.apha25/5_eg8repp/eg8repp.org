In terms of HP/DG my two current favourites are linkffn(The Mind Arts by Wu Gang) and linkffn(Black Luminary by YakAge), though neither pairing is really /confirmed/, and the latter especially is totally up in the air (however Daphne is my current favourite of the options).

In terms of just general good fics, I've just finished linkffn(Phoenix Corrupted by iamneverwhere), which has a really unique concept and deserves more love. Hopefully it's not totally abandoned, though I'm not sure it fits your criteria anyway.
