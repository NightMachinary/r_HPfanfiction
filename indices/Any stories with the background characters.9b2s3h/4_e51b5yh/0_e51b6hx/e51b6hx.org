  The war was neither as simple or cleanly cut as the history books would make it later on. In fact, it did not end in 1998. Justin fought in one war, the one that went down in the history books. Zacharias Smith fought in the other one, the one which happened after, which ended up buried in files in the Ministry archives. The guilt, the memories and the nightmares from each are not equivalent, they discover one night.

  Slytherin House isn't what it used to be. There are barely enough children to fill a classroom, let alone a House Table, and the Quidditch captain is a muggle-born fourth year. For a new generation starting at Hogwarts as the war drifts into memory, there's far more to learn about the four Houses than they could ever have imagined (prequel to Snake Bites).
