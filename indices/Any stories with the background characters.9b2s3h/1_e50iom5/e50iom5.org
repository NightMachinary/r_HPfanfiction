[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9525716/chapters/21539333][Tell Brave Deeds of War]]: Deathly Hallows from Michael Corner, Terry Boot and Anthony Goldstein's perspective.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11145058/1/][Daphne Greengrass, Side Character]]: Is incomplete, but Daphne Greengrass's story during OoTP, HBP and DH. It's a different take on the character and quite funny.

Would you be interested in OC characters? Also Luna and Ginny's perspective?
