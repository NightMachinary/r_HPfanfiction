[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2233473/1/Latet-Anguis-In-Herba][Latet Anguis in Herba]] is fantastic (sequels Shade to Shade, Falls to Shadow and Beyond this Place). The characters are well developed and it has it's own interesting plot line alongside the series. They're in Slytherin. You also see a lot of Katie Bell and other characters.

(It's oneshots at first to introduce the characters but the sequels are full novels alongside the series)
