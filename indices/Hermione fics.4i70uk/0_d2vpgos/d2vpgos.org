There was a thread that was requesting fics like /Green Girl/ a few days ago: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4i161l/request_fanfiction_from_the_slytherins_point_of/]] .

In terms of what you requested,

- linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) is currently /the/ Slytherin!Hermione fic, IMO.

- linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them by White Squirrel) has Hermione travel back in time to act on her knowledge. It's only 31k words, but that's because a Hermione who pulls that off and doesn't run into fanon obstacles like a GreaterGood!Manipulative!Dumbledore doesn't need 100k words to fix the problems.

- linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss) isn't time travel as such, but Hermione sends a telegram back in time to herself, and acts on the information. Unfortunately, the author has passed away recently, so the fic will almost certainly never be finished.

- linkffn(The Brightest Witch in the Darkest House by Belial666) and sequel are not about Hermione as such, but an OC who is supposed to be a more ruthless version of her. (Yes, Hermione is plenty ruthless in canon, but the author had bought into the AuthorityWosrhiper!Hermione fanon, so he or she decided to use an OC instead.)
