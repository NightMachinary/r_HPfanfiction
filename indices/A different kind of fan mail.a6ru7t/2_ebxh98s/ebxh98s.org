What the fuck? So many logical holes and unrealistic bullshit going on here it's ridiculous. Why would Harry let some random ass older girl take his stuff from him and make it into a slideshow? The guy who stood up to Malfoy in an /instant/ when he tried to take his Nimbus and Neville's Remembral? Why would Harry sit and let that random girl "teach him sex ed" instead of telling her to fuck off and being uncomfortable and embarrassed over it? Not to mention pissed off at her arrogant presumptions and way crossing boundary lines. Why would Harry even /need/ lessons like that? Didn't he go to school before Hogwarts? Why would any older student actually decide to randomly teach some kid sex ed? Who would even actually do that? Seriously?

Jesus fucking hell, and a /practical lesson/? What, you want some random student to just up and decide, "Hey, I'm going to teach this teenage boy about sex, /by having sex with him/! Because clearly I have no reason to exist except to service a guy! I'm all about sex and nurturing by example." That's total bullshit, and you're a fucking idiot Hellstrike. Not to mention from all your posts you seem /real/ obsessed with "portraying" preteen and teen sex in all your stories...
