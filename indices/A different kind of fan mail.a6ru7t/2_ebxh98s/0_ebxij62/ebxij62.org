I agree with your complaints but this is clearly meant to be a not-very-serious, borderline-crackfic kind of thing, so the implausibilities and OOC behavior are kind of excusable in this context. I'm not much for sex comedies myself, but in general, so long as it's deliberate, stretching disbelief so in the interest of a good laugh is fine by me.

Rowling wouldn't portray that in the books, but (especially in this looser, cracky context) it is /not/ hard to believe that a slightly older student might be up for making love to Harry, never mind if he's a few years younger than her. Harry's handsome and famous. And men don't have a monopoly on being lecherous, y'know. If you can believe that a teenage /boy/ might "take advantage" of a /girl/ in this situation, then you shouldn't find it so strange that this might happen with the genders of the participants switched out, also --- especially in a setting like the Wizarding World where sexism is mostly not a thing.

And considering that Hellstrike emphasizes that the 'practical lesson' is entirely optional and that if it there he doesn't want it to turn the story into just a piece of erotica at the expense of the humor... I don't think your accusations there at the end are warranted.
