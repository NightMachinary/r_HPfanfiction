I think canon Trio is as chill as they can get, considering their circumstances.

I really would like to see how "chill" you can be, when:

- You grow up in an abusive household because of your 'protection'
- You have a sadistic genocidal maniac with superpowers coming after you
- You have to fight a 10 foot tall monster when you are still 11
- You realize sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums are actually part of the government and among society's elite
- You have to fight a 60 foot long super monster when you are still 12
- You realize that the government is totally malicious and incompetent, and will use soul sucking demons to 'protect' the only school in the country
- You find out that the government is engaged in systematic torture and injustice
- You have to fight 100s of above mentioned soul sucking demons when you are still 13

Things will get even worse from here, and I think canon Trio deserves a lot more credits.

If you want "chill" characters, you can't have totally incompetent plot device adult good guys so kids have to do everything. One good example is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raiders]], linkffn(13052802). In this AU, a BAMF Petunia raised Harry in a loving and exciting environment. Harry made friends with Weasleys early on and is strongly influenced by Bill. He can be considered really "chill". Later, Petunia, Sirius, Bill, Fleur, and Dumbledore have done most of the heavy lifting vs Voldemort, while the Trio helps along with their own adventures.
