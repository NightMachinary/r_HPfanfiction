"Here Harry, try this brilliant thing we knicked from Professor Snape's stores," Ron whispered, waving Harry closer. He reached out and offered Harry a grotesque looking mushroom with a red candy shell-like coating.

"What's this rubbish? I thought we were going to be brewing Polyjuice," he said, trying not to sound too annoyed. Ron had tried, after all.

"Nah, mate. This is even better. It'll make you /feel/ like a different person."

Well, that couldn't be all that bad, then. Harry sat down beside Ron and accepted the strange mushroom.

He looked over at Hermione and frowned. She was curled up in the corner, muttering furiously to herself. That was somewhat worrying. Exams weren't until next month, so he wasn't sure what she was worked up about. "What's gotten into Hermione? Does she feel like someone awful?"

"Oh, she's seen the nargles, is all," Luna said, walking by with an airy smile. Harry noticed that she had a necklace of smaller mushrooms around her neck. "Though I'm afraid she's still denying them. They don't like that. Not at /all/."

Harry shivered, but then he looked at Ron again. Ron looked relaxed. Perhaps the best way to go about it was to accept the nargles, and not try and fight them as Hermione had. That sounded reasonable.

Before he could change his mind, Harry took a large bite out of the mushroom. He would be calm, collected, and he wouldn't let this thing beat him, as it had beaten Hermione. He would be stronger than that.

He would be... /Chill/.
