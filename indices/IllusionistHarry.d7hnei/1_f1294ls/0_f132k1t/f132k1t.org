The only thing that comes to mind is that Hermione mentions on the train that she has tried a few spells herself. That could of course just mean on the train. But it is sometimes used in fanfiction to explain why Harry does not get in trouble when the authors need him to learn some magic before Hogwarts.

I like it because it adds another purpose to the boat ride, besides the nice first impression of Hogwarts.
