Could check out mine:

HP and the Continuity Crisis on AO3

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28259916/chapters/69252006]])

I wouldn't say I make Hannah all about being queer, but there's obviously references to it, especially as the first half is basically her coming out. Latest chapter for a example I don't think referenced her being trans/queer at all.
