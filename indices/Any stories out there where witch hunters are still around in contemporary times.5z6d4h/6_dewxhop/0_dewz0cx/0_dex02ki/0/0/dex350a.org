Okay, so to clear your misconceptions up:

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2001) is a small book written by JK Rowling. It's contents are small lexicon about magical creatures and how they behave, written by the fictional character "Newt Scamander" - the revenue from this went to charity.

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) is a movie, with the screenplay written by JK Rowling. The movie is about the adventures of Newt Scamander in 1920's New York. It features a group called the "Second Salemers", which consists of some Muggles who are deeply covinced that Magic is real and bad, and see it as their life-mission to convince the general public that witchcraft is real and to basically 'catch' witches and wizards.

You can also buy "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them - The Original Screenplay" by JK Rowling.

The revenue from the latter went into Rowling's (and Warner Brothers) pockets.
