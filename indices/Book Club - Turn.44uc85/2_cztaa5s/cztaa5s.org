MAN OK, I was so excited when I saw this was the next fic because it is seriously one of my favourites.

The author's prose is beautiful; they manage to paint with their words. The emotion and age felt by Harry and the supporting cast comes across as so real mainly because it isn't spelt out, but rather snatches of daily weariness and moments that any reader can relate to and think: "Ah, these are the things I feel when I have a build-up of sadness/anger/restlessness/anxiety".

I don't really want to say much more, rather than that this is one of the few slash fics I have ever read and it actually seemed plausible - also, the portrayal of Ginny here is /fantastic/.
