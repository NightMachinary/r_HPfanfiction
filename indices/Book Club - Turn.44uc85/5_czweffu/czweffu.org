So I really liked Turn, but it bothered me so much at first. Like, I was mentally uncomfortable with the very idea, the concept bothers me. I've had really elaborate "entire lifetime" dreams where you wake up completely shattered. So it took a while for me to just settle into the story and enjoy the ride.

Then when it went back into the 'real' world, that was hard too. And I think it depicted that pretty well, Harry forgetting what was from which timeline, like his knee, trying to reconcile the two worlds.
