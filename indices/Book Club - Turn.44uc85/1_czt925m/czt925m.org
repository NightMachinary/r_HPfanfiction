I really like this one. The idea behind the fic is original, and well executed. It does get a bit predictable [[/spoiler][you know right away when Harry gets back he will give up his job as Auror, and that he and Draco will get together]], but it proves how well it is written that I didn't find this troublesome at all. I did find the whole Anthony Goldstein-thing a bit unnecessary thought, I wouldn't have missed it if it was left out. But in general, great fic, you should read it.

I really really loved the artwork (or at least, descriptions of artwork) in this! I never thought much about glass blowing, but this fic managed to get me obsessed pretty quickly. So yeah, watching hour-long glassblowing demonstrations on Youtube was a side-effect for me, but not one I mind (Corning Museum of Glass livestreams anybody?).
