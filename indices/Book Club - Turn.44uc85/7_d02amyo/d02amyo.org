I positively love this fic. I read it when I want to feel my feels. Probably I've re-read 3-4 times. Sara's Girl writes beautiful, thoughtful prose.

I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts about the [[/spoiler][calmness of Harry and Ginny's divorce. The divorces in my family have been brutal. Does Sara's Girl write with rosy-tinted glasses on this aspect, or do some couples genuinely dissolve ~20 years of marriage with little fanfare?]] I ask mainly out of curiosity, not of a position of criticism/critique. The way it was written just flies in the face of my personal experiences, so it's something I've wondered as I read/reread this fic.
