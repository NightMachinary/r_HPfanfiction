"Do you ever wonder if things would have been different... if you'd done something else?" - Harry Potter, Chapter 1 of Turn

How many of us have had this thought or one similar? If you haven't, you may be too young to have had that one major regret in life or you've already experienced that regret but not enough time has passed for you to realize its significance.

How many people are trudging through life because there's comfort in routine, even though that routine has put them in a rut? Even if you've never experienced a bit of what it is like to be complacent with the status quo in your real life, you will here through Harry.

Author Sara's Girl does a great job of showing us Harry's life. We're not just reading about Harry, we BECOME Harry. We feel his regret, his guilt, his ennui, his hope, and his eventual optimism. The writing is witty, heartwarming and humorous; the characters are fresh and yes, while the plot leans towards the predictable, it is still very satisfying.

The author's message is clear - do not be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. Do not be afraid to make changes - you just might be surprised at what you learn about yourself along the way. Do not settle for 'what if?' Go out and take a risk. Take the unknown road now.
