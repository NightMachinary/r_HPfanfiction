I was never a huge fan of slash, especially Harry and Draco, but this is one I've reread a few times. I'm a huge fan of the premise, and the writing style and good use of grammar are a definite plus as well. I especially like [[/spoiler][when Harry goes back to his actual timeline and has to deal with telling Ginny and the kids]]. I would definitely say that this story should be read, even by people that aren't big fans of slash.
