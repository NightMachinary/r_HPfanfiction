Obligatory Dobby/Sorting Hat but seriously, Lucius and Remus. It was in a fic where Harry goes dark and Remus and the twins follow him. Had some other pairings but that's the weirdest out of the two I remember. The other was drarry.

(Side note: unsure if this was the same fic but- Snape x Voldemort. Seriously.)

Edit: Okay so I just remembered that there was a Harry/Dementor fic out there. It was a smut fic, one-shot, and I'm 90% sure it was part of a kinktober series or something like that. I've read it twice, for whatever reason, and it was decently well-written. I think it was on ffn, but it might be on Ao3, it's been a long time since I've even thought about it.
