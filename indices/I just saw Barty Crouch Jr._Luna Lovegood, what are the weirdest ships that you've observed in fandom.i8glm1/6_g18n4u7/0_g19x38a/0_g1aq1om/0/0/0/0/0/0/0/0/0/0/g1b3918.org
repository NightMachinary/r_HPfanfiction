Thanks for the info, I'll try to find it and I promise I'll give you the link if I do. It simply just caught my attention, no matter how weird it is. Prolly one of a kind fic... It just seems so weird and that's exactly the part that lures you in so much. It's just tempting and very different from everything else.

If I can't find it, then it's deleted I guess. Pretty sad, but life is life...
