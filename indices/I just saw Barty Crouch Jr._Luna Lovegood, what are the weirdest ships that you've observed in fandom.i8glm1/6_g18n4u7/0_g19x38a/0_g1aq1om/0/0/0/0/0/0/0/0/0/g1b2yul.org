Okay I'm sad to say this... But I think it was deleted.

I can't find it anywhere, and sometimes my bookmarks have disappeared if the page has been deleted.

Feel free to search on your own, though. And please give me the link if you should find it.

For a little more information, I believe the title was one word. There were parts from the dementor's perspective, in which Harry was reffered to ambiguously. It's sorta bestiality, the dementor is doing what it's doing to feed off of Harry's emotions, so it can make another dementor. There was some special room in azkaban where this all happens. That's all I remember.
