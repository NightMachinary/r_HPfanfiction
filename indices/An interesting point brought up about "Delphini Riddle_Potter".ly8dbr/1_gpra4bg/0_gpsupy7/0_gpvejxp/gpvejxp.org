I don't really think using lethal curses is "Dark", I always find that weird in fanfics. Yes, police officers capturing criminals should use Disarming and Stunning curses. Terrorists who are basically enemy soldiers? You don't fight back with stun guns and batons, you shoot them.

As for me, I just think there's a difference between being forgiving and being so forgiving you're a doormat.
