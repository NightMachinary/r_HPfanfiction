LullabyKnell has a fun, relatively short gen fic that ran with this question.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15295467/chapters/35484819#workskin][In a Manner of Speaking]]: The year is 1999 and a litte girl has been found with no past and nowhere to go. Someone is about to get the surprise of a lifetime. Again. (A Post-DH, Pre-Cursed Child Crack Fic.)
