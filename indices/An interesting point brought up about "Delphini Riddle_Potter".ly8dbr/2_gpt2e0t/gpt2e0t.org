It's a bit more complicated than that, I think.

There has always been a bit of an odd relationship between magic and blood/genes and the soul in Harry Potter -- JKR says magic is given via a gene, which explains squibs and muggleborns, but we've also seen magic that's both hereditary yet also linked to one's soul.

Parseltongue, for example, is hereditary aka genetics, but we also know that the soul is involved somehow because of Harry being able to speak it due to the fragment of Voldemort's soul in his scar.

When Voldemort attained a new body, he could still speak parseltongue, meaning that it's linked to the soul and from his maternal ancestry (genes).

A metamorphmagus like Tonks? It popped up in her (genetics) and she passed it down to her son, Teddy.

IIRC there was a relationship between the soul and a patronus (involving something deep rooted in the psyche/soul) and an animgus form, IIRC. Having the ability to become an animagus may only be possible for some people (James and Sirius were from pureblood backgrounds, but we don't know about Peter).

Amusingly enough, the fanon take on blood purity that (primarily) antagonists proscribe to may have some basis in truth, if certain traits, like metamorphmagi, come from primarily pureblood families because of genetic pooling, and they noticed that keeping children between families had these traits popping up more often.

So, why marry someone outside this group that'd limit the chances of something useful popping up?

Anyway:

Biologically, Voldemort's new body came from his father (bone), which isn't that squicky, Harry's blood, and Pettigrew's flesh: that means that, in his last body, Harry, Wormtail, and Tom Riddle Sr. were Voldemort's fathers.

The soul occupying the body, however, was Voldemort himself, so she is /his/ daughter.

So, you have a guy with three fathers banging Bellatrix, which resulted in Delphini.

That means technically Harry is her /grandfather/, at least by flesh/blood. Well, one of them, at any rate.

Man, that makes for a confusing family tree -- especially if he adopts her while she's young and still has his family with Ginny (not to mention Teddy being her second cousin).
