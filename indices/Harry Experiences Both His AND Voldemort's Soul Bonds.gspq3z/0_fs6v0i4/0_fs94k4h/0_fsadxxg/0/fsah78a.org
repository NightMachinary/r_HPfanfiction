Sorry about that!

Also, just to assure you I didn't mean it as a smut-setup. More from the thought that if the bond made it so that people felt they had to improve the lives/existences of the bonded, then it might be really interesting, to watch Harry trying to shift Bella's whackjob obsessions ti something productive, or Hermione trying to explain a better way of doing things to Voldy. Maybe Bella finds herself trying to give Harry a better life than he'd have had with the Dursleys (by threatning to kill anyone who harms him) or Voldy influenced to try and teach Hermione knowledge he thinks might improve her life. Could be crack, or not.

I'm actually not a pairings fan.

Anyways, again, sorry for the cringe! I'll leave it alone, now.
