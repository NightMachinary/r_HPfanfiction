1-) wizards could have wards that prevent aerial bombardment or other things from harming their properity.

2-) we do not know if there is any form of connection between wizards and muggles (aside from informing goverment officals and muggleborns) let alone trade.

3-) that is an incredibly childish and dangerous outlook. There cannot be eternal frienship or perpetual hate between countries, only shared interests.

I think only reason wizarding community might want to battle the Nazis is because of Grindewald working with them.
