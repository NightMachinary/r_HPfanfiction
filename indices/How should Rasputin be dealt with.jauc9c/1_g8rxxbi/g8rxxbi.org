The approach I took in Victoria Potter:

  The pages of the diary began to blow, as if caught in a gust of wind, before coming to stop on a blank page. A date appeared in the top corner, written by hand: 12 May 1944. Then lines of ink started sketching themselves out on the page, the first outlines of a scene: a grove of trees, and a circle of figures sitting at the centre of a clearing. As Victoria watched, the image became clearer and more detailed, and then colour was seeping into the frame, showing the group to be gathered in the darkness of night, their forms lit only by a shaft of moonlight which pierced the trees.

  She leaned closer for a better look---and then, with a familiar tilting feeling that upended her stomach, she was tumbling forward into the page, colours swirling all around her as she fell, before she landed on the forest floor with a soft thump.

  She found herself sitting in the circle of figures, as if they had left a place just for her. She was certainly the odd one out of the group: the others in the circle were all boys, and much older than her besides, sixth years at least. They were wearing Slytherin robes of a different, more formal cut to those Victoria was used to seeing, and four of them were looking avidly towards the fifth, who sat slightly apart from the others.

  Victoria blushed as she looked at him. This was Tom Riddle? This was the wizard she'd been speaking to, all these months? He was most definitely not a creepy old man, as Susan had feared. Tom was frightfully handsome, with high cheekbones, pale skin and neatly combed black hair. Though they were sitting, Victoria could tell he was very tall. He was surely the leader of the little group, a fact made evident when he began to speak.

  "Well, now that Avery has seen fit to join us, shall we begin?"

  He spoke with the type of refined accent that reminded her of the royal family, and though his words were harsh, his eyes danced with friendly charm. It was clear he was only teasing.

  "Ah, come off it, Tom," said a boy with a round face and beady eyes. "I was only a few minutes late. Wanted to catch the news---they say Grindelwald defeated Rasputin in a duel today. Doesn't bode well for the Russians, does it?"

  A murmur of interest ran through the boys.

  "Rasputin will be back," Tom said, speaking with such authority that you almost forgot he was a schoolboy far from the Eastern Front. "He is a wizard not so easily done away with, even at the hand of Grindelwald."

  A black boy with expensive robes was shaking his head. "Only you, Tom. If anyone else had said that, I'd have laughed in their face. Go on, then. Tell us the secret."

  Tom smirked. "You of all people should know of my particular interest in these magics. The signs are there, Lestrange, for those who know how to look. Rasputin has died twice now. Unless I am mistaken, Grindelwald will need to defeat him seven more times before his death is final."

  "Nine lives?" another boy said. This one was scrawny, buried within his baggy, oversized robes, but he had piercing, intelligent eyes. "If such magic exists, why have we never used it ourselves?"

  "The cost, Rosier," Tom said. "You gain nine lives, yes. But when your lives are spent, your soul is doomed to eternal torment, no better than if a Dementor had consumed it. It is a feeble attempt at immortality, little more than a postponement of death." He paused and looked up at the moon. "But we did not come here tonight to discuss the intricacies of eternal life. Draw your wands, please."
