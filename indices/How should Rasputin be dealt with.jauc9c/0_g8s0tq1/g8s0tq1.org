Just a personal opinion of mine, I have always found it in really bad taste when people make it out that alot of the horrific things which have happened in history where just muggles being controlled by wizards. The idea that Hitler was just a puppet seems to be to be disrespectful in some way. I think because they were real people who did these terrible terrible things and to diffuse the responsibility and consequences of that seems very wrong too me. People might disagree and thats fine. Just gives me a bad feeling.
