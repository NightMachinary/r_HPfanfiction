Ok, to be honest, I've never really thought of their names /that/ much. I actually like them, as in if there wasn't other people named James, Sirius, Albus, Severus, Lily, and Luna, and Harry and Ginny named their kids what they named them, then their names would be cool. However, since we're talking about meaning and the like, I think that yes, these are horrible names for their children. I myself wouldn't ever want to be named after some dead person I never knew.

I don't know what I would name them if I could. I like everybody else's suggestions.

Also, ever since I read this fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t]] , I've had the head cannon where Ginny is the one who named all of their children. And since that probably isn't true at all, I have another: Harry James Potter is horrible at names, so he decided to use some of the ones he already knows. Bonus is that he gets to "honor the dead".
