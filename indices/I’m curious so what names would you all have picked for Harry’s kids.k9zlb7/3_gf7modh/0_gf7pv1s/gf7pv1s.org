I like those names. I'm asking because I am planning a next gen era fic and plan on changing Harry's kids names. I think I'll change more of the names again but I think I'm happy with Percival Cedric Potter to replace Albus Severus Potter. Percival is a nod to Dumbledore using his middle name and is also kinda a nod to the Weasleys cause well Percy. Cedric because I think Harry would want the name to live on and a way to remember one of the first victims of the second wizarding world. In my AU Fred survives (haven't planned exactly how though) so Harry would be less likely to name a kid after him in that situation but Fredrick would make a good middle name for Harry's kids.
