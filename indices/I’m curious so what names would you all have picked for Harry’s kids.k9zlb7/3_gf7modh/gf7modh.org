I don't love the convention of giving the kids the first names of dead people, I prefer first names that are a nod to whoever they're honoring while still giving the kids their own identity.

Jacob Sirius Potter: Jacob as a form of James, I'm fine with real people being middle names and like Sirius being honored with a middle name

Archie Frederick Potter: Archie means bold/brave, “a” for Albus, “ar” for Arthur, middle name for Fred

Olivia Molly Potter: Olivia as a nature name, nicknamed Livvy which is similar to Lily, and honoring the only mother figure he's had in the middle name.
