I think sirius would be a great first name bc poor sirius was basically erased from history. They never even got his body back and he wasn't ever proven innocent. He also gave Harry his house and elf etc. Sirius may disappear through history as time goes on otherwise. Arthur and Molly are great, especially if none of the weasleys already name one of their kids after them.
