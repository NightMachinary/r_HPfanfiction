A lot of people use Jasmine as fem!Harry's name in fanfiction quite a bit. Probably since it's both the name of a flower and it's similar to the name James. A lot of people tend to stay in the trend of flower names for girls and I'm presonally fond of using classic English names for the boys (not that Evander counts for that, mind). I figured that since a lot of James's ancestors had the name Henry, that I'd use that, and William after Ginny's favourite brother.
