I read one where he named his kid Evander for a nod towards Lily's maiden name.

Other than that, as someone else has mentioned, the middle names should be based on the parents' names for the firstborn of each gender, and then relatives or close friends for the other children.

Like, say, Evander Harry Potter for Harry's firstborn son and Jasmine Ginerva Potter for their firstborn girl. Then, I don't know, William Sirius or Henry James Potter for boys and Iris Luna or Primrose Lily Potter for the girls. Keep that "flower" name tradition from his mum's side of the family alive or something.
