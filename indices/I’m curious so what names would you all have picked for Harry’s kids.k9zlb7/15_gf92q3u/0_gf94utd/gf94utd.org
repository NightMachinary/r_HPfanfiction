I recommended the following:

Evander Harry Potter

Jasmine Ginevra Potter

William Sirius Potter

Henry John Potter

Iris Luna Potter

Primrose Lily Potter

I thought that the firstborns would have their parents' names as their middle names because it seems like that'd be a wizarding tradition. Then have the middle names from family and close friends for the other ones. I used William and Henry after Bill Weasley and Harry's ancestors and then the flower names to keep the "tradition" of flower names for girls. I thought Evander was cute and I heard it used in a fic a while back.
