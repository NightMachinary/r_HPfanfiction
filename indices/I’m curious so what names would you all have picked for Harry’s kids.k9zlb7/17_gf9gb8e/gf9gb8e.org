Of the canon names of Harry and Ginny's children, the only one I really /like/ is Lily Luna - Lily's sacrifice does need to be honored, and I happen to think naming a child after a mutual friend is sweet. Plus, alliteration.

Other than that, I'd almost consider some of the crack names from "101 Names We Could Have Used" ( linkffn(12542863) ) to be outright better than Albus Severus. There's a few of them in there that'd be on-brand for Harry and Ginny to joke about at some point (but obviously not to actually /consider/).

I'd like to think that they'd be more creative than to just pull the names of dead people out of a hat, and also that Ginny would get more say in things (seriously, both James Sirius and Albus Severus show worrying signs of Harry picking all the names).
