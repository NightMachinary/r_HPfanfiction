Yeah I'm definitely messing up the timeline a bit especially since I'm having them start hogwarts around 2020 though I probably won't include the pandemic or any current politics because let's be honest unless it's a specific AU that would really mess up the fic and it's not related to the story. I picked percival as a nod to both Ginnys brother (who in my AU saves Fred from death so he's a bit more important) and Albus and it just sounds cool so I think I'm gonna keep it but I was considering Brian for awhile. I never considered giving Harry more kids but now I might do that since I'm giving other characters more/less kids in different ages from their canon and whatever else I'm changing. I absolutely agree that the names take away from the kids individuality which is the main reason I changed them because I want original characters because that's what they should be and idk wtf Harry was thinking naming siblings after a married couple and the problem with Albus's name is obvious. Using middle names as honorary names does make more sense to me which is why Ive done it. The canon timeline is really confusing to me though part of that may be cause I never finished cursed child so I likely won't be following it at all. Nearly everything after the battle of hogwarts (and some things during the battle/7th book) should be different depending on how I plan it.
