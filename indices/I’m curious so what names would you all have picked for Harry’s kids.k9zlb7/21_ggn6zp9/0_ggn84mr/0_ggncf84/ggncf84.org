That actually sounds really interesting! Let me know when you have the story up. I love unique takes on the Next-Generation.

Neither have I lol. I have no intention of ever finishing it.

But here's what we know of the canon timeline, so you can reference it:

- Late April 1998: Edward 'Teddy' Remus Lupin is born.

  - I personally place his DOB as April 21, 1998 because he and Victoire are the next Harry/Ginny, and Ginny's DOB is 1 year, 11 days after Harry's.

- May 2, 1998: Final Battle.
- May 2, 1999: Victoire Weasley is born to Bill and Fleur Weasley.

  - I place Dominique c. 2002 and Louis c. 2006. They're probably not the same age as Harry's kids because neither of them are mentioned in the Epilogue.

- July 2, 1999: Hermione graduates from Hogwarts.
- June 30, 2000: Ginny graduates from Hogwarts.
- December 26, 2002: Harry and Ginny get married.

  - This one isn't actually canon. It's based on JKR's own wedding anniversary.

- March 22, 2004: James Sirius Potter is born.
- July 27, 2005: Albus Severus Potter is born.

  - I place Rose's birthday as December 3, 2004. This is based on Ron's birthday, March 1. She's mentioned to look like Ron but in female form. I.e., she has a bit of individuality, unlike the Potter kids.
  - I place Scorpius' birthday as June 3, 2005 because he's meant to be Draco's clone.

- January 23, 2007: Lily Luna Potter is born.

  - I place Hugo's birthday as June 17, 2007, nine months after Hermione's.

- George is the only Weasley with children who /isn't/ mentioned in the Epilogue, so Fred and Roxanne were born post-2005.
- Percy /was/ mentioned. At least one of his daughters was born somewhere between 2000 and 2005. Molly and Lucy follow the naming pattern JKR uses for Fred and George, so they might be twins.

  - Obviously not the case in your story, but again, this is for reference.

- Luna and Rolf had children later than the others. If you accept JKR's writings on the Quidditch World Cup 2014 as canon, then Lorcan and Lysander were born after 2007 but before 2014.
- Neville married Hannah Abbott at some point. It's unknown if they have children, but none were mentioned in the Quidditch 2014 article.
