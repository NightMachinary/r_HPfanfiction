Wow thanks for the timeline. I'm changing the kids ages around so most of them are at or close to going to hogwarts (though they probably will be in different years) to have most of them in the same school and because I forgot their canon ages. I'll definitely post about the fic when I publish it though I'm still planning so it'll probably be awhile. I don't have any intention on finishing cursed child either I know the basic story and that's enough for me. Honestly didn't know Scorpius was supposed to be a Draco clone that's kinda interesting always assumed scorpius to be the opposite of Draco for some reason not sure why.
