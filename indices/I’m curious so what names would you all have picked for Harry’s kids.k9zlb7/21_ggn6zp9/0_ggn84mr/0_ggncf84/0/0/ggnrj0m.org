Idk about Scorpius' personality, but the epilogue describes him as resembling 'Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry.' I.e., he likely has pale blond hair, a pointy face, and gray eyes. Canonically we don't know anything about James' appearance; Albus has unknown hair color (usually given black in fanfics, though), a thin face, and green eyes; and Lily has red hair.

That's another pet peeve of mine. I hate clones. Give the kids individual names, personalities, AND appearance.

You can give the kids some combination of:

- Hair: black, red, or brown/auburn as a middle ground
- Eyes: green (Harry), brown (Ginny), hazel (James/middle ground), or blue (we know Ron has blue eyes so it runs in the Weasley family)

  - A handy guide for kids' possible eye colors with green/brown parents:

    - Brown or hazel (50%)
    - Green (37.5%)
    - Blue (12.5%)
    - In a family of 3 children, 1 or 2 of them would have brown/hazel eyes; 1 of them would have green eyes; there's a /very/ small chance any of them would have blue eyes.
    - In a family of 5 children, 2 or 3 of them would have brown/hazel eyes; 1 or 2 of them would have green eyes; 1 of them /might/ have blue eyes.

I recommend against these combinations:

- Black hair/green eyes (Harry)
- Black hair/hazel eyes (James)
- Red hair/green eyes (Lily)
- Red hair/brown eyes (Ginny)
