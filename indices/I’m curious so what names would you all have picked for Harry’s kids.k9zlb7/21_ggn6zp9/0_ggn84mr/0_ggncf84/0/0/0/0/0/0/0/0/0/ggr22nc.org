So far for their kids I have the names Lauren and Lysander but if I give them more kids I might go with Lorcan since it's a canon name or something similar to what I have but I didn't know Lysander was a Greek name that's interesting. I'm definitely trying to avoid having first names be the same as any main/big characters and instead either giving them middle names based on them. I really like Neville/Luna too I think it's a good ship and I'm having them both be teaching at hogwarts during the series so they'll be somewhat important characters which I'm excited to plan for because I love them both. I'm actually thinking of making Luna the assistant headmistress but like everything that could change.
