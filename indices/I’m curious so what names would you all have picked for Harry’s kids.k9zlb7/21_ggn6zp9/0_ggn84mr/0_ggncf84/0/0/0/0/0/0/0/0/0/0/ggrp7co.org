I've honestly never thought of Luna as a teacher, but now that you say it, I could see her being the professor for Care of Magical Creatures. In canon, she married a zoologist and she was good with the thestrels.

As for the names, maybe you could do it like Ron & Rose + Hermione & Hugo. Lysander Frank, Lorcan Pandora, and Nadine Alice. Boys names on girls promotes misogyny (it literally indicates girls can only get ahead if they act like men and suppress their feminine characteristics), but girls names on boys helps defeat sexism. Luna is just the type of person who'd break through that barrier.

(Sorry for the impromptu rant. My cousin just had a baby girl and I'm having to bite my tongue on the name.)

Would Harry be the DADA professor? I always thought he'd be better off teaching. In my headcanon, he retires from the Aurors in 2008, ten years after the war, and becomes a teacher. If you do something like that, be careful of having EVERYONE teaching at Hogwarts.

Side note: I also have Jacob born January 15, 2008. His birth gives Harry extra motivation to retire.
