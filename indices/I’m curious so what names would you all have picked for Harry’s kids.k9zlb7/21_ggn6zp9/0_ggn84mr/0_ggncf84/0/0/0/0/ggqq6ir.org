I think there should be one or two major differences, like Harry was with his dad.

This is my canon-compliant headcanon:

- JSP has brown eyes and a smattering of freckles but otherwise looks a lot like Harry. Light brown isn't far off from hazel, which is why I added the freckles. Also JSP with anything but black hair bothers me.
- ASP has light auburn hair and people genuinely forget he's a Potter, not a Weasley in name until they see his eyes. Once they know to look it for it, he's almost identical to Harry.
- LLP has hazel eyes and dark red hair. The red hair is canon, which makes it difficult to come up with a combination that doesn't resemble Ginny/Lily 1 too much. I've been toying with blue eyes for her, but it doesn't feel right.

Disregarding compliance, I have this headcanon for H/G's children:

- Jacob Sirius Potter: same as JSP.
- Brian Arthur Potter: red hair instead of auburn.
- Ruby Minerva Potter: dark auburn hair and brown eyes.

  - Remus has Teddy and Luna has Lorcan and Lysander, while Hagrid and Minerva have no children of their own. That's why I chose her name.
