Yeah I hate clones too I'm trying to make Harry and Ginnys kids different from their parents. I never get the identical appearance thing it's annoying to me. Yes kids probably look somewhat similar to their parents but they'd obviously be more different. What do you think Harry's kids should have looked like?
