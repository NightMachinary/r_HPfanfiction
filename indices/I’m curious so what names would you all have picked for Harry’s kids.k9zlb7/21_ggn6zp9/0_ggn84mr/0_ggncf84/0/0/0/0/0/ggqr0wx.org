I definitely agree with Albus having auburn hair that was one of the first things I had decided when I started planning cause I didn't like how similar he looked or was usually described to Harry. I like giving dark red hair to Lily Luna I was considering making it black but red fits. Maybe I'll have her dye her part of her hair so she doesn't look too close to Ginny and give her a different style. James Sirius was the one I was having the most trouble with but I think I might give him freckles light brown eyes and black hair or something like that. Another characters appearance I want to change now is scorpius because I don't want to make him look too close to Draco either so I might go black hair instead of blonde or a darker blonde but I'm not sure.
