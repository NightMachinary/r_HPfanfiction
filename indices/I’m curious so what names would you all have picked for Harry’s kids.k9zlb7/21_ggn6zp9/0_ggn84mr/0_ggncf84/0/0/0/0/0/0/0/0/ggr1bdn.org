TBH I love Neville/Luna. I know some people don't because then the Ministry Six would all just be paired up together... but they just felt so right together. They're both underestimated and they didn't have the happiest upbringings. Her mother died in front of her, and his parents barely even recognize him.

Pandora and Lysander are Greek names. Luna is Roman. Maybe other names with those origins? I think they would avoid direct namesakes, so no Frank Longbottom II but Lysander Frank is good. Also 'Girl-Alice, Girl-Pandora,' etc.
