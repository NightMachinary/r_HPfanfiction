You could give Scorpius different eyes, too. We don't know what Astoria Greengrass looks like, but her actress has dark brown hair and hazel eyes.

If you give Neville/Hannah children, both of them have blond hair. We don't know their eye colors but I imagine Neville's as green (like Matthew Lewis) and Hannah's as brown (I think my inspiration for this came from fanart, but her actress has blue eyes).

Rolf Scamander is described as 'swarthy' in the Quidditch 2014 article, so I'd say he has tanner skin and dark hair. I imagine Lorcan and Lysander look a lot like him but have Luna's large silver eyes.
