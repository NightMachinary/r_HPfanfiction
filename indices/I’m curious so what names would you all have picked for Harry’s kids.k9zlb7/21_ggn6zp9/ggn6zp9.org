Okay, this is going to be a looong rant.

I absolutely hate the canon names. The kids have no individually and their personalities are flat and predictable. Plus I imagine there'd be a lot of kids named James, Lily, Albus, Percival, Brian, Wulfric, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Neville in the next generation.

I like all of your ideas, but I'd do Brian instead of Percival. It's more common like Jacob and Ruby. And don't be afraid of giving Harry and Ginny more kids! JKR modeled the Potter kids after her own family but I always thought Harry would want a bigger family, maybe 5 kids.

Another idea is to use normal first names and an honor middle name. I.e., Daniel James, Patrick Sirius, etc.

No one in their right mind would name their child after Snape, except maybe Draco. However, Draco should've been in prison for the first ten years after the war. Scorpius would've been born post-2008, likely ~2012 and about the same age as Lorcan and Lysander Scamander.

Speaking of the timeline, I think the canon one is horrible. Using the birthdays of JKR's kids, JSP is born March 22, 2004 (David); ASP is born July 27, 2005 (Jessica; her father and JKR's ex-husband is a strong basis for Snape's redemption arc); and LLP is born January 23, 2007 (Mackenzie). This means that Ginny played Quidditch from July 2000, when she graduated, to July 2003, when she would have realized she was pregnant with James. That's only three years. The average career for a professional sports player is 8 years. I think Ginny would've played until she was at least 25, so her /first/ kid would've been born in 2007.

Okay, that's my rant of the day.
