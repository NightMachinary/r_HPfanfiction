Well, the kids in the epilogue are shown being so ignorant about Harry's fame that they ask why everyone's staring in their direction and Ron jokes he's famous, so I don't think they would really know stories of Snape. Is "Severus" inherently more funny sounding than "Sirius"? Eh. Victoire and Teddy are much older, so I don't think they would be bullies, and the kids younger than Al probably wouldn't bully him.

I really don't think other students would care even if James Sirius told them Al's middle name either. He kind of sounds like a jerk. I know he makes fun of Al being sorted into Slytherin in the epilogue, and maybe he'd use the middle name as proof Al's going to be a Slytherin, but I see a lot of nextgen fics with James Sirius as a one-dimensional bully and prankster. The exceptions to that rule really stand out. Not trying to dictate how you write your fic, but I like to see all the nextgen kids get unique and well-developed personalities.
