James (or Jacob as I'll probably name him) is definitely gonna be interesting to write. I'm not exactly sure what I'm gonna do with his character but I definitely think he's gonna be a good guy in the end. I've been considering having him start as a bit of a jerk and not really involved then have him eventually turn around if he realizes his siblings are in trouble and slytherins not all bad or something like that.
