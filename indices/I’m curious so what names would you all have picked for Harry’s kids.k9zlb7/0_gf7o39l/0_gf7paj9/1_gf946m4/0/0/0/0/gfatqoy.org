That's cool. One thing that gets overlooked when people complain about the names of Harry's kids is that it wasn't just recycled names, but recycled looks and personalities too. Of course James Sirius is the bully-prankster with black hair, brown eyes, and glasses; Albus Severus is a quieter, lonelier Slytherin with Lily's green eyes; Lily Luna is the only one to get red hair, and, just like Ginny, is jealous she has to wait to go to Hogwarts (or, just like Lily, gets no personality while her brothers inherit the Map and Invisibility Cloak). I wish it was mixed up a little more.
