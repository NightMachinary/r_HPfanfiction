For the middle name I was thinking that James and his family who would know his middle name (at least close family) would have picked on him more for that and James would have probably told other students. Albus I assumed was very obviously supposed to be related to Dumbledore but I could see how it might not be that different for the wizarding world. They do names very differently.
