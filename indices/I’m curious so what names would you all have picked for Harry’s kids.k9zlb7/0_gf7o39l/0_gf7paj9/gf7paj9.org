Yeah I agree about not liking Harry's kids names. I always thought he was either putting the kids under a lot of pressure or in the case of Albus Serverus signing them up for a lot of bullying. After thinking about it more I might change them again before I finish my fic. I wanted to give Harry's kids original first names (or at least ones that weren't really obvious like they are in canon) but I wasn't sure if people would like it.
