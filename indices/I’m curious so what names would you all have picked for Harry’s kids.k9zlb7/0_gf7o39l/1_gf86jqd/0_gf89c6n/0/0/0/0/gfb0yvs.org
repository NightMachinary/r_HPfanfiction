Oh, good point. Though maybe Teddy is short for Theodore? I don't think we know Ted Tonks' full name.

There aren't many medieval kings left, except names that have fallen out of public usage, Richard which I personally dislike, and Alfred which has the same legacy problem (Albus + Fred). But Fredrick was a prince of Wales, so maybe their second son is named Owen after Owain Glyndwr.

Or go back to the Round Table: Daniel, Tristan, Gawain, Constantine.
