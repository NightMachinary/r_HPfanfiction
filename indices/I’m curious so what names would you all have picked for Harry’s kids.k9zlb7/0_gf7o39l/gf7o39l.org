I don't like any of the Potter kid's names in canon. There are times when naming your kid after a dead relative is fine, but in this context it's creepy. Harry spends his entire life in his parents' shadow, and then he passes that on to his kids? Best case scenario, "you're really living up to your grandfather's legacy"? Plus, of the six names their children have, Ginny picked one. Bull.

Quoting myself: I noticed a trend in canon. Every time we know the middle name of a magic-born child, their middle name is the first name of a relative. For the firstborns of a gender, it's the parent of that gender: Harry James, 1st son of James. William Arthur, 1st son of Arthur. Ginevra Molly, 1st daughter of Molly. Draco Lucius, 1st son of Lucius. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian, 1st son of Percival.

For non-firstborns, it's the name of some other relative. Regulus Arcturus, 2nd son, grandson of Arcturus. Percy Ignatius, 3rd son, nephew of Ignatius. Ronald Bilius, 6th son, nephew of Bilius.

The only exception is Tom Marvolo. (Remus J. Lupin has neither a middle name nor a known father's name in the books, only in extended canon.)

So, I take this as magical tradition. I think Ginny would want to stay with the pattern she's known all her life and I think Harry would be thrilled to learn there's a family pattern his name fits into and his kids could fit into.

Therefore, I headcanon their kids as Random-name Harry, Random-name Sirius (or James, Arthur, or Ronald), and Random-name Ginevra. Given the naming trends of the Potters and Weasleys (typical British names, rather than constellations or Roman emperors), I'd say something like:

Stephen Harry Potter

Edward Sirius Potter

Elizabeth Ginevra Potter
