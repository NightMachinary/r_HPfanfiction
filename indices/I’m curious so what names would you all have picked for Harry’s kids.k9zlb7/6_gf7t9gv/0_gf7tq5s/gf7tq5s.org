Yeah I think I'll change James's into something like Jacob because I do agree having first names the same as dead people has a lot of problems but I wanted to keep the having a middle name from a close friend/family/ect. I'll definitely try to add a scene where they explain the names or at least where Ruby jokes about being a small kid named after a giant. I think Percival and Ruby are both fine since they are more inspired by the people than directly named after. I'd also feel mean giving a kid the name rubeus that's like naming a kid Severus.
