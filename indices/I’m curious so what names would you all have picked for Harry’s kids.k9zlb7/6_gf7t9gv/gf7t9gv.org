I always felt reusing the names of the dead as first names is more insulting than anything. A few years on and 'James and Lily Potter' are his children, and his parents don't even have their names to remember them by. Also it is frankly quite a creepy level of almost ancestor worship in using them for all of your children's names.

If you do use Ruby (which is really sweet), then please have a seen when she shows someone Hagrid's picture and explains to some poor person that this tiny girl is named after a ten foot tall perambulating beard.
