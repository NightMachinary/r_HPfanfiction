I think studio c summed the naming up quite well.

"Vernon Dudley Potter, you were named after my emotionally abusive uncle and his idiot son. They ruined my childhood."

"Why would you do that?"

"Daddy has some issues."

In all seriousness, I like Arthur Harry Potter, Regulus Sirius Potter, and Dora Ginevra Potter.
