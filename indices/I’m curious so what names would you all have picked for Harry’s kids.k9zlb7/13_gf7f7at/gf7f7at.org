I am actually planning a rewrite. We know the only issue is the middle guy who we are not to talk about. I pictured Ginny naming that one (as Harry certainly named first, and they broke even with the second)... I am currently going for something like Arthur Lionel. Ginny can add a new name not used by any of her family and Lionel felt like a good fit.
