This tumblr post makes an amazing point! [[https://hunnybunchesofgoats.tumblr.com/post/128855669157/do-you-know-what-its-like-to-be-named-for-the]]

I feel bad for all of the children, being named for flawed people and not able to escape the expectations of your forefathers must be horrible.

James Sirius - named for bullies and reckless idots who let Harry down multiple times. While James and Sirius were both brave and amazing people they had their flaws and cast big shadows as war heroes. Whenver I see James written hes always a carbon copy of the original James and Sirius. Ladies man, loves pranks, a bit arrogant, a bit cruel.

Lily Luna - named for a woman long dead who sacrificed her life for her son. Named after the wife to her brothers namesake which is weird and a bit creepy imo. She seemed to be coded as the og Lily in fics. Fire-y, brash, warm, but scary.

Albus Severus - I feel really bad for him. Named for 2 complex and morally grey men who sacrificed themselves and others for a cause. Coded as neither of them in fic thank the lord. But is it coincidence that the only character named after a slytherin in the one who often goes there? I think not.

The only one im fine with is Luna tbh. Its an honour to be her namesake, shes also coincidentally the only one alive.
