Literally anything that isn't directly tied to a recent historical figure. Harry knows exactly what it feels like for people to pigeonhole someone because they are similar to someone else.

I can see Harry insisting on Sirius or Lily as a middle name at most, but not this whole mess of dead person jenga. Besides, one of the communal-fever-dream-children's name is a combination of the two people who raised him to be a suicidal child soldier. It's like a mediocre contestant in a "worst name" competition, and the judges marked it down because it was trying too hard.
