Honestly and really not that surprised by the James' sirius one or even Lily Luna if his daughter is a redhead... At least in Canon Harry named his kids after his parents which makes perfect sets although for his second son... Albus it seems more reasonable If they stuck with the same trend to name him after Remus or maybe run something like that
