I'd say that my main problem is simply that I write stories slower than I invent them. That's probably not unusual but it seems to cause me issues.

Basically I have a complete vision of what the story will become and as I write it I get part of the enjoyment that (I hope) a reader will be getting. There's a certain amount of spontaneity in how the characters react when I write which means I rarely know exactly how the story is going to progress before I start.

The problem is that I write pretty slowly and I think much faster. I mean, I have a few hours available each day to write this stuff (maybe) but I have many more hours to think about where it's all leading. Put simply a large part of me is completely selfish and once I feel I have plumbed the depths of a story it starts to lose its interest.

Why's that a problem? Because I'll have probably 'plumbed the depths' by around about 1/3rd of the way through. After that it's just will and a desire to finish things that I start and they're not nearly so encouraging as an interesting and new story.
