OMG, you basically described me!! The worse thing is when you really want to work on a scene that is only going to happen four chapters ahead of what you are currently writting. It is frustrating... and I feel like I've often rush things a bit because of this.

I also have another problem; English isn't my native language, and I refuse to post my chapters before they be edited by a beta reader... since my old beta abandoned me, I've been having serious problems to find a new one... this lead me to an almost one year hiatus, even though I have lots of chapters ready. And not posting then lead me to loss the interst in carry on writting it.. :(
