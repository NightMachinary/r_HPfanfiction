I have not abandoned mine per say but the feedback is often an indicator of whether ideas are bad or really bad. It is a draining effort especially if you have original fiction to work on and know that even with all the fan fiction adoration in the world, you can never write for a living or a big legacy with just fan fiction.

That being the case, I get very frustrated with fics abandoned after a few hundred or a thousand words or so, they clog up the pages when it is clear even the author no longer cares about them.
