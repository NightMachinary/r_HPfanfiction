It's so easy to abandon a story you want to keep writing, too. Sometimes if you haven't written in a long time there's a kind of 'anxiety' about starting up again, but the only way to get rid of it is to just write something. Even if it's filler, write it. Then when you get to the actual content again continue writing, and if the filler is really bad you can cut it. If it's okay you might want to keep it in.

Just write something. I like to write just a little bit more than a chapter or scene every time I write, because then when I start again I won't be thinking "Man, I have to start something" but "Oh, I left off here, so this is what happens now".
