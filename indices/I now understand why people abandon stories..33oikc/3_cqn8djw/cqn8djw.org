There is a problem for me with outlining too heavily... if I already know what is going to happen in my story then I lose the motivation to write.

I write half-million-word epics so losing focus sucks. When I let myself think about it it becomes "what the fck did I get myself into this time?"

I hate disappointing my readers, but I also hate losing out on instant gratification from reviews... so I force myself to finish a chapter I'm not really happy with and then stare at the blank page for the next chapter.

New plan to finish my current story is to stop publishing and just write it to the end in one large document. Then my editor/beta and I will go through it and find stopping points for chapters and fix them.

I write much better unhindered by looking too deeply into details and such. I will stick to my plot outline, but the timeline may change around a bit. I like my stories to be organic. I know the direction and the ending, but how I get there is as much a surprise to me as it is to the readers.

I have all these characters living in my head, I put them in a situation and then it is like watching a play or tv show. I just write down what is happening, I don't force anything if I can help it.

...its been 2 months since my last update... I have about 4,000 of this chapters words done but I "aim" for 7k-10k word updates since I only publish once a month... if I were only aiming for 4k I would publish more often and probably be less stressed....

My total wordcount on FFN is currently just over a million words... that blows my mind sometimes.
