I abandonned two stories because I couldn't find the motivation that I needed to keep going. Also, I kept changing my mind about things and I was never satisfied with my writing. Like, I would have the plot outlined, write up the first few chapters, then read back over it a week later and be like "Welp, this is stupid, I should have done this differently."

In the end it was a lot easier to just write Oneshots.
