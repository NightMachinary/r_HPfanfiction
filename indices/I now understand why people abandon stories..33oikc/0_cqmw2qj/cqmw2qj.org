It all comes down to motivation. Why are you writing your story?

Have a good idea you want to turn into a story? Outline it heavily to begin with or you're going to be stuck with difficult plot points quite often. Spend as much time editing the finished product as you do preparing the first draft.

Do you want to become a better writer? Find authors you like and read reviews of their material from literary critics to find out what makes them successful. Learn to love constructive criticism from your harshest detractors. If you haven't met them yet, some can be found [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/forumdisplay.php?f=11][here]].

I wish you luck in your writing!
