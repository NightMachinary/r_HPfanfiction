I can't help but agree with this. My first complete story got that way because I aggressively outlined it when I got the inspiration, which made the writing proper much easier. I'm working on a new set of stories and I've come up with a series of outlining steps: one page for the story, then one page per chapter, then three pages per. Hater, then the first draft (I've yet to actually get to this step). It's really allowing me to set up my Chekov's guns, plot points, and avoid plot holes (as in, 'where did that come from'). It also means I know where my story is going (the fact that I only have three complete stories, with four incomplete, and one abandoned is testament to my fickle muse) before I even start typing. I'll let you know how well it fully works when my current story is done and started posting (another thing I'm doing, writing it all at once and then posting it weekly once complete).
