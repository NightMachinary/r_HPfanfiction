1. sure, do whatever rocks your boat,

2. one of many differences between the Harry Potter universe and almost all other fantasy (and one of the reasons why I claim HP is not a fantasy) is that it is planted in the real world. Yes, JKR is [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Mistakes_in_the_Harry_Potter_books][complete crap with dates]], but I a way prefer stories which introduce more of the real world rather than less ([[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]] has tendency to do it, and it is the only saving grace of otherwise rather awful linkffn(10556030)).
