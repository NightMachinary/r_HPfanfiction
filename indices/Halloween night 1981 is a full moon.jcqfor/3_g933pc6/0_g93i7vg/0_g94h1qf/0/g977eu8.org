Friendly reminder that it doesn't take being much more powerful than someone else to kill that person, just one lucky shot. Voldemort is powerful but he's decidedly not "five against one, the one wins five-nil" skilled.

At best, I think Remus would die because werewolf = biggest threat and then someone will get Voldie with whatever curse they deem necessary because it's still 4 skilled wizards against one, regardless of if the one has Horcruxes.
