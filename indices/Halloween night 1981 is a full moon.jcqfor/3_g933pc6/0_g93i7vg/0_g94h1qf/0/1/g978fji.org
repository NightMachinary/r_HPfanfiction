Yeah, important thing to remember. Horcruxes don't stop you from being killed. They just make being killed impermanent.

Voldemort can be killed by sufficient force, it's why he is leery of Dumbledore. He just won't stay dead.

If it weren't for the Desth Eaters, the Order could off him every decade or so while Harry grows up and figures out how to end him for good.
