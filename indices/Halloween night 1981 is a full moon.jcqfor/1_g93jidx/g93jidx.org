Don't write but love to theorycraft.

I don't think it'll give significant edge to Potter & Co., but having 2 extra combatants is definitely good. Werewolf Lupin might surprise Tom but I'm sure he has spells in his arsenal to get rid of him quickly, especially considering Lupin can't cast spells (that we know of) in wolf form.

Sirius though, will hinder Voldemort quite a bit, even giving James a chance to pick up his wand and join in the fight. I don't think 20 something's will have a chance against Tom no matter how talented, but it can buy them time either to call Dumbledore (Lily sends a patronus) or for Lily to disapparate with Harry (unlikely) or to Join the two and fight 3-on-1 with Tom.

In the last case, most likely all 4 will die (as put by Capt.Sunshine below) and things will proceed pretty much like canon except yr 3, Peter might or might not be exposed as traitor but the DEs will definitely know and he will hide as a rat again. And in yr 5 Tom shows someone else in Harry's vision.

First two cases, I can easily see one or more of the Potter & Co. surviving, Lily having more chances of living, and after that is pretty much fanfiction territory.

-Tom runs away, I mean I can't see him defeating Dumbledore or catch Lily once she disapparates.

-War doesn't end, and the Longbottoms might also live if Tom doesn't go after them.

-Peter is caught.

-Harry grows up as a balanced individual, and doesn't have a martyr complex but still has a saving-people-thing.

-He also embodies marauder spirit, I'm sure even Lily would instill some rebelliousness/prankster tendencies in him.

Edit: I'm also pretty sure the war is lost by the order, it's been made quite clear that the DEs lost only cause Tom vanished, if he's still present, the ministry takeover would complete. There are a number of fics that cover this territory where Potters are in America etc, and one I remember clearly is linkffn(the dark lord never died)
