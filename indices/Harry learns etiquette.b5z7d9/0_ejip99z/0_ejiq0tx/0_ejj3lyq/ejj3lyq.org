I remember reading a story with the sleeves thing where Harry immersed himself in pureblood culture/etiquette; it might be the one you're thinking of. I can't remember its name, but I know that it was on AO3, if that helps at all.

Random details I remember are the Malfoys were anti Voldemort and that Lucius was a double agent all along, that Harry was in Ravenclaw which had a mentorship program where fourth years looked after first years. Harry's mentor was a Japanese kid, and the fic had some very basic untranslated Japanese in it. I'm gonna be honest, I was reading it as a "so bad it's good" kinda thing.
