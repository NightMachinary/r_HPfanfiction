I think we have to assume the Order was carrying out duties of protection throughout the land. What does Tonks do in her spare time? Lupin? Mad-Eye? What does the Order plan, what are their goals? Why couldn't Harry enlist their help when looking for Horcruxes? They operate in secret anyway. We know Kingsley protects the muggle Prime Minister.

The Order of the Phoenix is such a meaty book and yet so much of the content is just interaction that happens at school. That is the way that the books are written, and we see everything from only Harry's perspective. But wouldn't he have wanted to know what was going on? We know he is curious. We know he questions everything. We don't even know what the Ministry is doing.

I think all we can say is that Rowling chose to ignore much of the background and focus on her protagonists. As other commenters said, this does add to the mystery, and all the extra content that came after the books were published serves to uncover bits of the mystery. We just want more content.

While we can ignore not having enough background on the Order, I think the real problem is that they didn't do more to help Harry's mission. His mission was critical to the defeat of Voldemort, which was the very reason the Order existed--- to fight Voldy!
