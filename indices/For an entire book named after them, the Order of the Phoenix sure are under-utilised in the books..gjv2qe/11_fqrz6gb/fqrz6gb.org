A large part can be attributed, I think, to something I realized the other day. YA and teen fiction with very young protagonists only tends to let a kid save the day when the surrounding adult population is either oblivious or incompetent. They can be well-meaning as fuckall, but if the adults actually get proactive, they'll never let the eleven-year-old put themselves in actual danger. If my parents or teachers had found out I got up to a quarter of what Harry did at that age I'd have been grounded for the rest of my life, most likely. Thus, Dursleys, ineffective or incompetent authority figures, and outright malevolent ones as well. If the adults can smart, there's no need for a child to fix the world.
