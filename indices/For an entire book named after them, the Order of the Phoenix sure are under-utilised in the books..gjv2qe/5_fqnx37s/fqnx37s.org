The Order had a casualty rate which would have had any military commander court-martialed, or given a handgun and told to do the honourable thing.

A competent Order would have resolved the plot in 5 minutes, which is why it has to be incompetent. Same goes for the Ministry or the bad guys. They are capable, they win. That is an issue inherent to teenage protagonists, though.

If you wanted to make everyone competent, you need to change the surrounding landscape to make it work. Something more akin to Weimar Germany (close to a failed state, lots of unrest, no stable government, political violence from all sides and interest groups) where you have the good guys struggle with internal matters more (eg corruption in the DMLE stops a lot of good Aurors from doing their work since they are sidelined or the arrest they make do not result in convictions).
