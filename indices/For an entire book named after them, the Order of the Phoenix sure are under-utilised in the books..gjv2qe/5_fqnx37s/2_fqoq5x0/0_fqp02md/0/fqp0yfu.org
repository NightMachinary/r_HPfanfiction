Fair point on Dawlish on the Confundus Charm. I'm still confused at how the Aurors are shown in canon. They're hyped up to be elite dark wizard catchers but rarely do they ever perform. I don't see the point of creating magical special forces when they're not shown to be exceptional. McGonagall said to Harry that they only take the best and that Tonks was the only accepted candidate in years. So why is Kingsley able to fight multiple combatants in DH on a Thestral protecting Hermione and held his own against 2 opponents in the Department of Mysteries before going down against Bellatrix but 4 Aurors without the element of surprise would lose to McGonagall? Or the fact that Dawlish is susceptible to be Confunded over and over. One would think magical SOF would be more consistent.
