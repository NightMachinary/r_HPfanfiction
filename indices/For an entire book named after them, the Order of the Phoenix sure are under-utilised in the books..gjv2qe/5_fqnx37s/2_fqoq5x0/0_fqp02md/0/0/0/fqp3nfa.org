Dawlish was confounded by Dumbledore in HPB when Scrimgeour tasked him with finding out what he was trying to do. No shame in Dumbledore doing that. But he also gets confounded again as Snape said to Yaxley when discussing the Death Eaters plans for Harry in the beginning of DH, where Snape comments that Dawlish is susceptible to the Confundus Charm. Which leads to Dawlish losing an unarmed Dirk Cresswell and taken down by Neville's grandma who failed her Charms OWL.

Really not a good look for magical special forces. Ineffective Aurors is a pet peeve of mine with the series given how Harry was captivated of becoming an Auror because of fake Moody's suggestion and it was an interesting piece of worldbuilding in OOTP.
