No, Dumbledore says he jinxed Dawlish twice. The Confundus is a charm.

Arthur, Kingsley, and Tonks have access to Dawlish. We also know Arthur is good with Charms. It's not a stretch to imagine any of the three pulled him aside then confunded him with his guard down.

And I can't find anything that says Cresswell was unarmed. He says he stunned Dawlish and even remarks he got away because "Dawlish wasn't quite right. Might be Confunded."
