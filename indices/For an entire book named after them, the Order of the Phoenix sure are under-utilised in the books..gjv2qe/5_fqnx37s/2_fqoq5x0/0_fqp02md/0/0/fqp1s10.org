Of who applies and/or accepts an offer.

Kingsley is better than most Aurors, but not as good as Bellatrix. McGonagall is better than most Aurors, including Kingsley. Snape and Bellatrix are probably on equal footing, but I'll give the edge to Snape.

Dawlish was only confunded once to my understanding and it appeared to be a very good one.

The Aurors are good to very good, but there are Death Eaters and Order members who are just as good.
