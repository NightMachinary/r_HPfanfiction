The Aurors aren't much better. You've got competent operatives like Kingsley who's capable of fighting multiple opponents and then Dawlish who let an unarmed Dirk Cresswell escape from him. Hagrid mentioned that the 4 Aurors that stunned McGonagall couldn't have beaten her without the element of surprise.

So what's the point of having magical SOF if some of them are seen as not special? McGonagall says Auror training is super selective and they only take the best, but they sure don't live up to expectations.
