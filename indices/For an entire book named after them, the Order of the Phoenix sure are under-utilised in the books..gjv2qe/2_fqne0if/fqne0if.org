Part of me really want to believe they were getting up to some serious stuff in the background and, in fairness, there's no reason why an intelligent auror can't be depressed or love sick. They are all people, at the end.

On the other hand, I very much believe every sector has people who have somehow come to be respected in their profession, despite very much embodying the tortoise on a post meme. The wizarding world seems to be especially ripe for it, given the predominance of elite blood purists in the highest posts at the ministry.
