Regarding the book title: originally the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledore's Army had their names reversed, as it can be seen [[http://cdn8.openculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/JK-Rowlings-Phoenix-Plot-Outline.jpg][in this early plot sketch by Rowling]]. That way it made sense for the book title to be OotP as it was one of Harry's main preoccupations during the year. I presume she thought it was too cheesy to have Dumbledore name his own army Dumbledore's Army, and of course it was gallant for Harry's army to be called as such so she switched the names, but the title stuck. I know she first revealed the title to a boy who asked her very nicely, and it could have been before she made the decision to switch the names so that's why she got stuck with the title (this is pure speculation, of course).
