Oh, I can enjoy it alright. I just don't understand the constant need for people to point out every little perceived fault. I swear every other guy on here thinks he's some sort of a literary critic or an accomplished author or something. It's just a fun pastime, not a math problem where everything has to be perfect.

Not liking something is perfectly fine. For example, I don't like rap music. However, I don't search out fans of rap music to tell them that the lyrics are "shallow".
