Interesting thought? Sure. Can't say for certain whether it's true or not? Well, unless she comes from an alternate dimension that we have no evidence of, then no, it's not true. Criticizing her for not being historically accurate about a magical world that she created? Additionally, basing that criticism not on her being inconsistent in her world-building (something she could easily be criticized for), but rather on the history of a mythological item that never existed and has been used in various fantasy settings in different ways? Seems asinine to me.
