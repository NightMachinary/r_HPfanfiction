I have long been a proponent that the editor should be in the conversation when people talk about great authors.

I have a theory that the smaller an author is, the more sway the editor has. But when they're a cultural icon and bestseller-they have the clout to brush off editors.

And then you end up with bloated, poorly plotted and paced monstrosities.

See: David Weber. He's basically a fanfic quality author these days. Cut and pasting the same chapter between books, even.
