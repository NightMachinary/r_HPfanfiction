Hi I know I'm late to this thread but I just had to add this since no one else has:

They did it that way to make it seem like Harry died in the tournament, allowing Voldemort's return to stay a secret from everyone but the DEs . This would've given him time to plot without the whole world plotting against him.

I presume that's why the cup was a two way portkey too, so they could just send back his body with no one the wiser about how it happened. Maybe they'd use Nagini to fuck up the body a bit and make it look like an acromantula, or maybe they'd planned to pin it on Krum cursing people in the maze.
