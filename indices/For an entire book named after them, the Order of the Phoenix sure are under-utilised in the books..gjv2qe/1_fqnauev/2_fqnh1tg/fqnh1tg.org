Magic in HP is driven by intention and will so it is perfectly reasonable to suppose that the tournament itself could police the intentions of its participants and so force all participants to make a serious effort to compete.

The portkey thing you mentioned is true (annoying as it is). The magic of transportation is too powerful in HP (it got a little bit away from JK Rowling I think).

Azkaban was escaped by Sirius due to his obscure ability to become a dog. The only reason it was possible was because no one knew so I wouldnt call it plot-conveniant easy for him. Voldemort is Voldemort so his breaking of Azkaban is fine.

The Stone is obviously a strange one. Can only be explained by way of analysing Dumbledores plans but it is weird I'll give you.

I agree overall but I do think people give the sentience of magic too little thought. Magic doesent have to be something that can be escaped by clever lawyering - it can be a mysterious force that isn't necassarily moral or fair to Harry.
