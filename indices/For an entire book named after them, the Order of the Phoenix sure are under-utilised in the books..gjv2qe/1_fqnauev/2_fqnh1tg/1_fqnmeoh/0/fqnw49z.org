I'd say it actually is a pretty obscure ability, because despite there being a registration system, Hermione says there were 7 I think registered animagi within the last century. Sure, we have more examples of unregistered animagi then there are registered, but that still points to the fact that it's a considerably rare ability, especially because of the complex magic involved. It's still a bit odd that the Azkaban guards never took them into account, but I guess they just overlooked it, kinda like the drain grate in the wall of Helm's Deep.
