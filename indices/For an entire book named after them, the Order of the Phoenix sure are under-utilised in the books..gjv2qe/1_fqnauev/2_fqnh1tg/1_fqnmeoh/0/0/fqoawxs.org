As far as Azkaban goes, I'd like to think that the wizarding world just over-relied on the Dementors there to keep everything in check. Why would you need to spend resources on Aurors and other DMLE folk to guard prisoners in a hole in the ground they can't escape from and is surrounded by literal demons who suck out your soul if they catch you? None of them have wands, so whatever paltry magic they can conjure is sapped by the ever-present depression that congregates the area.

Even someone as powerful as Dumbledore would be crippled by such a place without a wand. The animagus form is probably its only flaw as a prison.
