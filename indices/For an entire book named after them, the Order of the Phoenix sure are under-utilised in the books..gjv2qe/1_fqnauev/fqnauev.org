It's just another example of how the world of Harry Potter is very, very shallow in terms of depth. So much of the world's most critical events in a span of nearly a decade is entirely driven by one group of schoolkids.

For example why would you hide a fountain of youth in a school when everyone knows it's in the school? Why is Azkhaban seemingly rather easy to escape from when necessary? Why doesn't Harry just simply not participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament by entering and then just forfeiting every task, or better yet Barty Crouch Jr just go "here Harry, mind sharing a drink" and then portkeying him straight to the graveyard on Day One of the new term?

Nothing in the universe makes sense if you think about it for more than maybe two minutes, hence why people have had to fill in the gaps to the point that canon and fanon have become incredibly hard to separate now.
