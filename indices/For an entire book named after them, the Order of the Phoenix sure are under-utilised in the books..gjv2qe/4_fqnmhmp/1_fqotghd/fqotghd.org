  If I'm being generous to JKR, this might be an example in canon of the irony of Dumbledore spending decades playing chessmaster only to be scuppered by the fact that canon Harry is not a particularly strategic player, or one who will make the moves Dumbledore predicts.

I really love the fact that Newt went to France because of being lovesick, and NOT because of Dumbledore's machinations. I hope that sort of thing continues, as a great retcon of Dumbledore actually being tremendously overrated. Not actually a mover & shaker, just a personally strong wizard who managed to be a pain in the ass and take credit for other people's work.
