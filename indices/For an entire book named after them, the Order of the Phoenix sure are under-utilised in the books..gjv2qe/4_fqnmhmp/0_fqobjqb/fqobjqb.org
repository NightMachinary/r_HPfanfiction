I quite agree. Harry is an interesting protagonist, because he makes a ton of mistakes, because he is highly skeptical of adults and authority in general. He manages to luck out of danger most of the time, but he's also got a stalwart willpower and manages to just brute-force most of his problems. He's proactive in a sense but gets prodded along throughout his journey.
