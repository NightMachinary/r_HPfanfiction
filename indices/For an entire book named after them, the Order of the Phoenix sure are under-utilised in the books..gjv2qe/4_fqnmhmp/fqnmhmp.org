If I'm being generous to JKR, this might be an example in canon of the irony of Dumbledore spending decades playing chessmaster only to be scuppered by the fact that canon Harry is not a particularly strategic player, or one who will make the moves Dumbledore predicts.

Arguably, a lot of the tools Dumbledore set up for Harry to use - the Cloak, the Sword of Gryffindor, arguably Hermione and her Time-Turner, potentially the Marauder's Map - were really quite poorly utilized by Harry until he was nudged into making better use of them, or directly reminded. There's definitely a reading there that Dumbledore sent Harry the Order directly in book 5 with the intention that he would build relationships and friendships, and that he would come to use them as an army of sorts, or as assistance, in later years when things became serious. (perhaps the DA, too)

Unfortunately, /also/ due to Dumbledore's machinations, Harry has grown up neglected and unable to easily trust or rely on others, and so he does not think of playing that way, in a way that by this point is almost second-nature to Dumbledore himself.

It's a reading I like, anyway, and it plays into other moments in the books where Harry commits a fatal error due to recklessness or carelessness.
