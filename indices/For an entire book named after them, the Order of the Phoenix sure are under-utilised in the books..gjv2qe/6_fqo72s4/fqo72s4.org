Guys, not every choice an author doesn't make is a mistake. Yo have to judge the book they wrote , not the book they could have. The book follows Harry's p.o,v exclusively (except for the quidditch match chapter in book one and some horcrux visions/dreams). This is overall a good choice for the series. It does however mean that not everything that is happening can be on screen (and often books are worse off for everything happening on screen.) As Harry is not old enough to join the Order, its activites are instead implied.

Also, can you imagine if Rowling had added more Order to the books? OotP is already over long and under-edited as are the last three books (that's not to say they aren't excellent> Rowling herself has said she wishes she could do a new director's cut of those three books.

Harry Potter is the coming of age story of Harry Potter. As such we get an intimate portrayal of his life, struggles, and triumphs. Anything more in the actual books would dilute that and lead to a lesser experience.

Also, this idea that if world building isn't on the page it is shallow is ridiculous and a result of over written high fantasy books, which seem to be popular right now.

The great thing about fanfiction is that it allows us to explore parts of the world and stories that weren't central to the plot. But, just because something can make a great fanfiction doesn't mean it belongs in the books.
