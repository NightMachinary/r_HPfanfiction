That's one of Rowling's most effective world building tricks. She hints at all this amazing stuff going on in the background without giving us the actual details. The readers have to use our imaginations to fill in the details ourselves.

Similarly, she made the older Weasley brothers, who were offscreen most of the time, the most interesting ones. An Indiana Jones type treasure hunter, a dragon tamer, an amoral politician, the brilliantly witty tricksters... And which siblings did she focus on? The boy who's pretty good at chess for a kid, and a kid whose main distinguishing characteristic is that she's a girl. The books are so addictive because Rowling created a desire to know more about these fascinating characters, and didn't satisfy it.
