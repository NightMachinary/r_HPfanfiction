If UST is there, even if they never end up together in the fic, then yes. Otherwise (especially if they're shipped with others), not really. Consider this: would someone who wants to read a Harmony fic because of the ship read your fic? If, say, they have a very close friendship but Hermione ends up with Ron, then having the fic be labeled as Harmony is going to make those people very annoyed. On the other hand, if they're yet to focus on stuff like romance, and yet clearly be the closest relationship that each other have, then it could lead to Harmony in the future, which could appease those people, even if the fic doesn't go all the way. But I'd personally still not label it as Harmony myself.

(Personally I don't really care much for Harmony, but replace that ship with a ship I do like, and this is basically my opinion on the whole thing. I don't see why Harmony would be any different)
