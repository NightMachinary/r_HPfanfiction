It depends. If they are before the dating age (or just not focusing on dating because of a, ya know, war), and there is no obvious ship hooks for other characters, then it is sometimes called Pre-Harmony. They are super-best friends at the moment, and it probably will get serious after they get older. (Though, not everyone count's pre-harmony as Harmony. And, if it is obvious that they will never get together, then it isn't Harmony.)
