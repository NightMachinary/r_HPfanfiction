Yeah, it was mentioned that he didn't know which of the three people cast the spell that killed her in the end. My above explanation doesn't contradict it. In the heat of battle it could have been literally anyone. It could be an Aberforth spell that missed Grindelwald. It could be an Albus spell that deflected someone's spell to Arianna. It could be a Grindelwald spell that missed Aberforth and Albus.

I would really hold of on calling Credence something that doesn't make sense. It is clearly not done, the mystery is obviously not revealed. It's like saying in Chamber of Secrets how the diary, and the whole Tom Riddle story makes no sense.
