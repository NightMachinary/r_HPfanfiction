I thought she had wild magic and she couldn't control it making dangerous accidental magic. Their father went to azkaban after an incident involving muggles that hurt her because it was incredibly dangerous for her. She needs intensive care and they aren't supposed to use magic near her so it can't set off her own magic. I thought it wasn't a spell that killed her but her magic reacting poorly to the duel itself and the stressful situation. Therefore the blame can be laid at all their feet for her death but nobody remebers who cast the first spell that started it all.
