If you enjoyed Fantastic Beasts Crimes of Grindelwald, don't let others detract from your experience.

There are many reasons that can be explored but the most persuasive one for me is that the blood pact is one of the reasons Arianna got hurt in the first place. Aberforth attacks Grindelwald and Grindelwald attacks right back. Dumbledore can't fight Gellert so is just stuck protecting his brother. Unfortunately, Aberforth isn't very willing to be protected right now and tries harder to kill Grindelwald. Grindelwald can't fight Dumbledore so has to respond to Aberforth's threat with greater force. Situation escalates, Arianna dies.

McGonagall appearing may be a genuine continuity error if you really squint at it but I've given writers much more leeway than that if it makes for a good story. A person close to Dumbledore to be a sounding board and to reveal his thoughts to the audience may very well be needed. We'll never know now though what would have happened if the script didn't have to be rewritten.
