I love this movie. I really do but there is these parts that don't make since( SINCE WHEN DID ALBUS HAS ANOTHER YOUNGER BROTHER?!?) I'm pretty sure grindelwald is lying ( my boy Albus dumbledore is your elder brother but he has abandoned you so why don't you go and kill him?) that would make a lot more since than being a long lost brother that even the books didn't know about, other wise the spells and action ( I love grindelwald speech and blue fire dragons! It was epic)was pretty darn amazing ❤️
