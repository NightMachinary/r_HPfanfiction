It does seem to be a mistake simply due to the amount of continuity errors present in the film (e.g. McGonagal & Aurelius). Though m I won't say it's impossible that the next film won't retcon it or push in some kind of explanation, as it's likely the next film will focus on breaking the Blood Pact.
