How old is McGonagall in the seven Harry Potter books? In which book is it said when she was born? (I have no memory of an indication of a specific age in the books). Maybe it is said in Pottermore? But is Pottermore officially canon?

I take the opportunity to ask some questions:

All the Fantastic Beasts Movies are the canonical prequels of the books (like the Cursed Child is the sequel) or are the prequels of the eight films?

I read about the canon of the films and the canon of the books, but I admit that I didn't follow the "issue".
