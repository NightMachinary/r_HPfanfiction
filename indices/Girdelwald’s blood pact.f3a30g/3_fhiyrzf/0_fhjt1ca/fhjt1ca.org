The only indication of McGonagall's age is in Order of Phoenix when she tells Umbridge that she has been teaching transfiguration for 39 years.

Canonicity has been and will always be very fluid in Harry Potter stuff. Rowling has never let any past details (even in the Harry Potter books) come in the way of a good story. Where other writers might get stuck trying to explain every little decision in Philosopher's stone, she just moves on.

If you must put a name to it, I'd say Fantastic Beasts follows its own canon made from an amalgamation of the book and movie canon. It's similar to what a lot of fanfic writers do with taking the good parts of the movie and leaving the rest. Like Hermione's scar and Slughorn's Goldfish stories are both movie originals.
