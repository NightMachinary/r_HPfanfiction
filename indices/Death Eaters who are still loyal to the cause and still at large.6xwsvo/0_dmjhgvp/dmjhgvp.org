Jugson is only mentioned twice in the series (and in the same paragraph), in DoM.

  Harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard Lucius Malfoy roar: “Leave Nott, leave him, I say, the Dark Lord will not care for Nott's injuries as much as losing that prophecy --- *Jugson*, come back here, we need to organize! We'll split into pairs and search, and don't forget, be gentle with Potter until we've got the prophecy, you can kill the others if necessary --- Bellatrix, Rodolphus, you take the left, Crabbe, Rabastan, go right --- *Jugson*, Dolohov, the door straight ahead --- Macnair and Avery, through here --- Rookwood, over there --- Mulciber, come with me!”

If you want to have someone who is not an obvious choice, I would pick him. You can create a new back story, what drives him, why was he in the shadows most of the time, etc.

If not, go with Mulciber. He was mentioned by Lily in /The Prince's Tale/, you can draw some connections to James, Sirius & co. during their time at Hogwarts.
