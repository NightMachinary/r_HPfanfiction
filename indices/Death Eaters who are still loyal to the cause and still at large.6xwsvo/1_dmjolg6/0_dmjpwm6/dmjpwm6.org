I agree with you, but Rookwood and Dolohov were both defeated during the Battle of Hogwarts.

I did miss Rabastan. I think he might be the right one to use. He was the one whose head kept turning into a baby during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, so readers will at least have a vague notion of who he is without having to rely on the reflected infamy of Bellatrix.
