Mulciber and Avery Jr are mentioned as stereotypical Slytherins in their teens, nothing special. I wouldn't use them. We see Travers in DH. Nott Sr is seen grovelling in GoF. Crabbe and Goyle... yeah. Jugson takes orders from Malfoy in DoM.

If you want a completely blank slate, go with Selwyn. However, I'd recommend using a Death Eater who's been built up a bit.

- Yes, Rabastan and Rudolphus share the same last name as Bellatrix. But they're mentioned in the books as being sadists and dangerous. You could build on that to make them very interesting and sinister villains in their own right. (I think Rabastan could be particularly interesting as the 'second son'.)

- Rookwood is shown to be competent (read his wiki article).

- Dolohov is able and malicious -- he memorably 'slashes' a nonverbal curse at close range.

- You've also missed some older death eaters mentioned in passing. Nott (not necessarily the same as Nott Sr.), Mulciber (ditto) and Rosier went with Riddle when he applied to Hogwarts. Avery Sr. and Lestrange were with Riddle at Hogwarts. These DEs could be older and closer to Riddle, hence privy to more of his secrets.
