Illusion magic is very interesting to me, and I like the idea that it doesn't exist for a very simple reason: It takes more work to force magic to not make stuff. An illusion of a bear is more work than an actual bear.

The only instance of illusion magic I can think of is the potion Albus drank in the sixth book.
