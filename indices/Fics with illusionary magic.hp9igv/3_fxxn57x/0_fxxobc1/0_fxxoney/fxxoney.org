Realistically, it would be easier to do the illusion or influence their brain with a vague suggestion.

But I really like the headcanon idea that magic doesn't really /do that/. That magic is literally more prone to make the bear. Magic is sorta turning your illusory fantasies into reality, so if you want the illusion of a bear, magic fills in the blanks and makes an actual living bear.
