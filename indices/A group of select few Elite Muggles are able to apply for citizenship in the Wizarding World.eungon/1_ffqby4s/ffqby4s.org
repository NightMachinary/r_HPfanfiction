There's already lots of muggles and squibs who know about magic (think family members of wizards like Hermione's parents or the Dursleys) and top government officials who help keep secrecy (the PM and probably some people in major muggle news too) so adding a few top scientists would not be too big of an issue. I plan on including something like this in a fic I'm writing.
