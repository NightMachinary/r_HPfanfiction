"You did WHAT"

"I used my inheritance money, created a company, applied for ICW permission to hire muggles who qualify under the exceptional talents program, got some of the world's best genetics scientists and human cloning experts as well as some potioneers, magical creature breeders and genealogy experts, and in just five years of working mostly in secret we managed to find the genes and magical traces required to make someone magical. Now we got a new IVF procedure that results in 100% guaranteed magical babies! We're going to offer it to muggles who know about magic and squibs. About twelve years from now the number of muggleborns at Hogwarts should start growing exponentially!"
