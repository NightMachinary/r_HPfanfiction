I read these, and was enjoying them. Then the [[/spoiler][special wish jewels came]] and I was thinking, this is weird, but ok. I'll roll with it. I kept going, enjoying most of the story, getting into it. Then [[/spoiler][sirius' wife got obliviated and he turned squibish and got locked as padfoot, and it kind of hinted she was being used as a sex toy and when she finally got her memories back and sirius his magic back she decided she wasn't the same person and left him]]. I kinda rage quit. I don't mind some angst, but that was too much for me. I was on edge already from the whole [[/spoiler][remus is banned from seeing the kids and draco is being poisoned/brainwashed at the notts]] bit, and the other part put me over the edge.

I think I only had one book left. I really liked the premise, the pack, animagus stuff, and the prophecies. It was a great world, but had too much angst.

Ps, did you read it all? If you feel like it, I wouldn't mind being convinced I should finish it - Iirc I only had one book left. Maybe 2? Its been a while.
