My favorite method of finding one is posting a public advertisement. The ad tells readers that if they're interested, they should take one of my already published chapters and send feedback as if it was still going through the revision process.

A good beta will, in some manner, make the end result better than if they had no input. The above process allows the writer to look and see what input the beta has to offer and make the decision on whether it's helpful.

Alternatively (or in addition), look for people who review a lot of chapters with insight that you like and send them a message to see if they're interested.
