I hooked up with my beta back in the Checkmated days. For that site, you submitted your story and it went into a queue for a beta to pick up. I worked with a few different ones there before I found my current one who happened to be local and became a friend IRL. She's really great on grammar (I have a problem with lie/lay/laid), HP canon research and bouncing ideas off on. I also make liberal use of my husband. He's really useful for commenting on story flow and helping me out when I'm stuck. I'm not a mom, so my BFF is my resident teenager resource and I have a teacher friend I reach out to for some teacher Harry stuff.

Fan fiction---it takes a village!
