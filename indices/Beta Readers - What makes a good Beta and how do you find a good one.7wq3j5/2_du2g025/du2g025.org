I stumbled upon mine online. I think a similar sense of humour helps for starters. It's also helpful that he's a Brit, whilst I'm Australian, but most of all, I think our relationship works because we're not afraid to say when we don't particularly like something, but we also respect each other's creative views and, at the end of the day, if we're working on my work, it's my work and my decision, and the same goes for when we work on his stuff. We suggest, rather than tell. Most of the time, the other will go with the suggestions, but we (generally) don't get upset when a suggestion is rejected. And we understand that a suggestion means â€˜This bit could be better. Here's what I suggest, but I just want you to think about improving this bit.' Even changing another section of the story can improve that bit, so yeah.. I should also confirm; we both write our own works and edit each other's.
