I've been really liking this one, Death is Buffy's Next Adventure where Buffy after dieing wakes up in London the same age as Tom Riddle the summer before his 6th year. I normally avoid fics that seen like they will have prominent pairings, which this fic seems like it might from the premise, though it doesn't list romance as a genre so maybe not, but the interactions between Buffy and Tom are pretty funny so far more than anything.

Also pretty clearly a 2019 fic, but I just want to mention that Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting got to the post third floor corridor hospital scene in a chapter this year and it had one of my favorite depictions of Dumbledore I've seen in some time. It does a good job explaining a lot of the weird stuff from the first book and has Dumbledore actually be really helpful towards Harry regarding the Dursleys.
