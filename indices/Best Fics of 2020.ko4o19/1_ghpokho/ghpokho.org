What Souls Are Made Of by Emeralds_and_Lillies

Started last year but has been updating regularly all year. Love it. It's a time travel Tomarry with Ron and Hermione. Great characterisation. It was a tough choice because I've read a lot of great fics this year but this one made it into my #1 spot.

Looking forward to another year of reading way too much fanfiction.
