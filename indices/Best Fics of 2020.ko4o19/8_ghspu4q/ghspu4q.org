The Secret War

by njcov

Lucius tasks Draco with a special mission: "You will seduce the Granger girl. I don't care how you do it, I don't care how long it takes. Tell her you renounce your family, tell her you want no part in the Dark Lord's plan...tell her you need her help. You will make her love you Draco. You will win her trust, and then she will lead us to Potter.”

At the same time, Hermione hatches a plan to get close to Draco and learn of Voldemort's plans to help the Order.
