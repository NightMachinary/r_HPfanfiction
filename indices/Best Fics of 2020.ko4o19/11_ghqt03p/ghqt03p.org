Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos is a wrong boy who lived story. Harry goes to Slytherin. He's a bit more damaged and has an edge to him but it steers clear of the angst for the most part which I liked. I give it a 9/10.

Serpentine Advice - Slytherin takes Harry under his wing and teaches him how to think. As you might expect, it brings out a more ambitious and clever Harry. I quite enjoyed the character interactions although I'm not sure the philosophy mixed in always works. I'd give this one a 7/10.
