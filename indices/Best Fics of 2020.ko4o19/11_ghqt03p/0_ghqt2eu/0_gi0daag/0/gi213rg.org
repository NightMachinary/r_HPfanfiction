I read the first ten chapters and it did not seem like it was going in that direction.

I stopped reading there though, since the main focus of the fic, despite him not even really appearing till the last chapter I read, seemed to be how misguided Dumbledore was and setting him up as a strawman for indy!Harry to overcome which isn't to my taste.

Like if you made a bechdel test but had a conversation fail it if it talked about Dumbledore instead of about men, then most of the conversations in the fic up to the point I read would fail it. If the fic had just not portrayed Dumbledore in the best light, but also not really focused on him them I probably would have kept reading as the premise is quite interesting.
