Steelbadgers two DC crossovers, Kicking Gotham linkffn(13521865) and its sequel Toppling Heroes (just finished today!) linkffn(13694861), both came out this past year, and are amazing. They've both shot up to the top of my favorite crossovers list, and I can't wait for the mentioned third story to begin. Very good depictions of Auror Harry working a case that intersects with the DC world.
