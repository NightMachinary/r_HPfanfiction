  It's 1975 and war is simmering beneath the surface of the Wizarding world...but at Hogwarts, it's magic as usual as the fifth years prepare for their O.W.L.s amidst politics, pranks, and other poor choices. Severus Snape wants to prove his worth.Lily Evans wants a fresh start.James Potter wants Lily Evans, though no one is more surprised by this than him.Sirius Black wants to write himself a new story.Remus Lupin wants to survive the next moon.Peter Pettigrew just wants to keep up. But as tensions bubble over, sides will be chosen, friendships destroyed, families parted, and paths forever altered. The Howling Nights is the first book of The Last Enemy series, which follows the lives of the heroes and villains of the First Wizarding War from 1975-1981. Watch the trailer! (New chapters posted on Mondays and Thursdays)

  By the time the 20th century arrived, Salazar Slytherin had a plan. Truly, he did--or as much of a plan as one could have when the people involved in said plan didn't exist yet.Fate and/or the chaotic nature of the universe and/or the gods fucking with him? They had other ideas.
