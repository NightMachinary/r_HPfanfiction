linkao3(The Last Enemy: The Howling Nights by CH_Darling)

This is a marauder story from 5th year onwards. First book completed this year. It's brilliant! Lily has a lot more initiative and stakes in the war than I'm used to seeing. I have a feeling she might end up dragging james into it. The Prank and the aftermath were horrifying. Just really really good writing

linkao3(Of a Linear Circle - Part IX - The Serpent in the Grass by Flamethrower)

And once again I'm hyping OaCL because I love it! Part VII finished this year and Part IX started and holy shit am I loving IX. We follow Saul all through WW2 and he meets the Potters and sets up the Underground and it's just brilliant and I love it so so much!!!
