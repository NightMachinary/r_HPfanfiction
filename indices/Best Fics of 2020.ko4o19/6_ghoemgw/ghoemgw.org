To start off, I really enjoyed That Glorious Strength, which I only just read a few hours ago. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26333881/chapters/64128553]]) It depicts a separate magical institution that is run by Riddle.

Then there is The Removal of Masks linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24335107/chapters/58675660]]), which starts off with an initiation ceremony for Gryffindor!Riddle's death eaters (it's part 7 of a larger series, but imo it can stand alone).

Looking forward to your recs! :)
