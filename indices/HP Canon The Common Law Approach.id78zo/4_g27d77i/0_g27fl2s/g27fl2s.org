I vote for this. The 7 books hold primacy, where they contradict themselves, I choose what interpretation works for me.

Movies and play = authorised fanfic.

JKR's statements & interviews = twaffle that is occasionally vaguely interesting. The woman claims to not re-read her own writing and frequently contradicts herself /and/ her books and she can't even count. (Black Family Tree. Enough said!)

Anything else = if I like it I might adopt it. Or foster it for a little. It has no authority whatsoever, it's value is in how well it entertains me.
