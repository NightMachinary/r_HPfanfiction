There is no "canon". Even the books aren't internally consistent, and even the most fantic defenders of "canoN" ignore the parts of it they don't like - see "quantifiable magic power".

Really, the best way to handle canon is to treat it like the church canon: A jumbled mess that is best dealt with by picking what you like out of it and discard the rest.
