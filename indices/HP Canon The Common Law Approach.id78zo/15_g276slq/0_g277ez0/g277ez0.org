Well, first of all, inconsistency is not inconsistent with the concept of canon. See for example LOTR where Tolkien revised certain elements multiple times (e.g. the number of balrogs).

You simply need to have a mechanism for dealing with inconsistencies. E.g. take the most recent version, or just exclude the inconsistent parts from the canon. And of course many /apparent/ inconsistencies are not in fact inconsistent - it is possible to find an interpretation, in many cases, which reconciles all canon facts.

As for quantifiable power - keep clinging to your deliberate misreading of the HBP boat quote, maybe someday someone will be fooled!
