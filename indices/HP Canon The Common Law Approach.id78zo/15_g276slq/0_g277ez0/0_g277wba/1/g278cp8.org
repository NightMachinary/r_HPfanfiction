  As far as quantifiable magic power goes - keep clinging to twisted interpretations of the books in order to ignore that yes, you can quantify magic with enough precision to tell if there are one or two adult wizards in a boat. Maybe someday you'll understand maths.

Ah, you've shifted your argument! You used to argue that the boat didn't count the number of wizards but rather measured their power.

Well, this becomes a lot easier, now that you admit that the boat operates by counting the number of adult wizards in it (which is what Dumbledore explicitly states it to do, so I'm glad you have admitted it). It's simply a matter of clarifying our vocab.

When I say "quantifiable magical power" I mean the idea that wizards have different amounts of magic. An enchantment counting "1 wizard, 2 wizards, 3 wizards" does not prove (or even vaguely suggest) quantifiable magical power in this sense.

To the extent that you say that counting a number of wizards means that magical power is quantifiable, I completely agree. But that does not show in any sense that wizards have different amounts of power.

  The "Pick what you like/need" is still the best mechanism.

The best mechanism for the post-truth world of Trump, I guess. It does rather render any discussion impossible, however. A discussion without a standard of correctness is pointless. In which case we might as well delete this subreddit.
