  keep clinging to twisted interpretations of the books in order to ignore that yes, you can quantify magic with enough precision to tell if there are one or two adult wizards in a boat.

I should not intervene into what looks like an old argument between 2 authors, but it's a bad example, If it was only a matter of quantity, any boat that let Dumbledore in (or for that matter, Voldemort) should also let several wizard like Fletcher in at the same time. Ever 16 years old Harry is already stronger than several adults. At best, the magic of an adult may have a different "quality" than that of a child.

Voldemort probably used a "conceptual" magic (like Privet Drive Blood Protection or Dumbledore's Age Line). to enchant the boat so it would only let one "Person" ride it at the same time. For the boat, only one "Adult Wizard" (no matter how powerfull he is) was considered as a person, a muggle, an underage wizard (like Harry) or even an House Elf (Voldemort could bring Kreacher with him despite him being powerfull in his own right) were ignored by the protections.
