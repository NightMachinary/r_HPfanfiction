Dumbledore explicitely stated: "Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the amount of magical power that crossed this lake." Now, people can twist words as much as they want, but that clearly stated that Voldemort had a spell that measured the *amount* of magical power. You don't use the word "amount" if you cannot measure it. (Amount: "a quantity of something, especially the total of a thing or things in number, size, value, or extent.")

And then he goes on to say that as under age and unqualified, Harry's powers wouldn't register next to Dumbledore's.

Honestly, the whole "Oh, you can't measure magical power" is not canon according to the books, unless you start throwing in stuff like "Dumbledore didn't mean it" and "that's actually means it only counts adult wizards, even though he said magical power, it's not powers" and such stuff.

The fact is that Dumbledore explicitly talks about "magical power" in relation to a spell that registered it.
