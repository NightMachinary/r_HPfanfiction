For your analogy to work, you'd have to have someone controlling that only two adults at a time can pass on the bridge. And you'd tell people wanting to cross "only two adults" not "only 250 kg, max" if it were adults you counted.

Twist it how much you want - if Dumbledore wanted to talk about the number of adult wizards he'd do that. He wouldn't mention "amount of magical power" as something to be measured.
