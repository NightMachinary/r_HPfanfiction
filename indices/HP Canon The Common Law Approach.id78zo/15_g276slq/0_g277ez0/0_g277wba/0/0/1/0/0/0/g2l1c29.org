Actually, if we're talking headcanon, as in "that's what I use for my stories", then magic isn't measurable in mine. I consider the idea that magic power can be measured silly. But I wouldn't claim it's not canon - canon has a lot of stupid and silly stuff in it that probably should be ignored for many stories. I merely feel that people should be honest, and stop trying to twist canon until it conforms to their fanon, then claim that's the one true canon.
