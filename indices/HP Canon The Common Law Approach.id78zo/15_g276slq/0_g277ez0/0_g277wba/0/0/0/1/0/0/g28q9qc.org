  But this just doesn't work. The result would absolutely be higher than 1. Dumbledore on his own would surely have more power than a single wizard by the boat's reckoning, because he's one of the most powerful wizards in the world. And on top of Dumbledore, you have Harry, a wizard who we see overcome Voldemort's Imperius curse, who repelled a large number of Dementors, and who beat Voldemort at Priori Incantatem. His magical power, if measured by reference to some kind of "quantity", is surely also at least 1 on this scale.

This. That damn boat isn't a weighing scale for magical power. The closest real-life equivalent I can think of is an x-ray scanner, and anyone below the age of 17 simply doesn't register with it. Dumbledore's usage of "amount" is just a colloquial term for Harry to better understand how it /might/ work.
