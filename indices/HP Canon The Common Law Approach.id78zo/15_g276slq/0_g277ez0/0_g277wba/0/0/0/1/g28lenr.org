I think you're the one who sticks fingers in your ear. If you use the word "amount", it's meant to be quantifiable. Anything else doesn't make sense. If it were the number of adult wizards, and not related to a quantifiable amount of magical power, Dumbledore wouldn't use that wording.

If there was no measurable magical power, Dumbledore wouldn't have mentioned dit - he would have said:

#+begin_quote
  “Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the number of wizards who crossed his lake. I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.”

  “I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and unqualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine.”
#+end_quote

And even in the second sentence, Dumbledore words it so he's talking about Harry's powers registering - not Harry registering as a wizard.

Why would anyone mention magical power if it were not relevant (and measurable, in this case) at all?
