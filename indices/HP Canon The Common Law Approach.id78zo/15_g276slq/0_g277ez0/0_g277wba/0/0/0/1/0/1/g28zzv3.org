My argument rests on the fact that Dumbledore talks about magical power at all - he wouldn't that if it didn't exist. He also directly says that *Harry's powers* wouldn't register. Not that Harry wouldn't count.

And the enchantment can easily work if the amount of magical power cannot be greater than what Voldemort considered the minimum for two adult wizards combined. Which, in turn, depends on what exactly "magical power" is - which wasn't really defined. It does, however, lead to the conclusion that "magical power" isn't the sum of skill, talent, experience etc, but just a limited innate ability or baseline, not nearly as important for actually spellcasting as skill. Kind of the "magic" a wizard or witch has.

If your interpretation were valid, why would Dumbledore even talk about "amount of magical power"? He'd talk about the *number of adult wizards*.

Your interpretation doesn't work with the wording, nor the intent you assume behind it.
