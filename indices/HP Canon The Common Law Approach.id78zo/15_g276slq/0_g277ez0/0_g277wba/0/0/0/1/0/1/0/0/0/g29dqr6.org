  But if magical power exists, then Dumbledore talking about its amount clearly implies it can be quantified to some degree. That's simple logic. If it were not quantifiable, he wouldn't talk about its amount.

Yes, and that degree is "has it" or "doesn't have it", as Dumbledore explicitly explains in the scene. The boat simply determines whether there is more than one adult wizard in it. You're attempting hang far more on the word "amount" than the word implies.

Feel like we are very much going in circles here.
