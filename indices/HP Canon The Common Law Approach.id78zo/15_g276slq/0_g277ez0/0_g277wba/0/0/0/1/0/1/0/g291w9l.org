No one is saying that magical power isn't a real thing. It obviously is. The question is as to the nature of the power difference between wizards: is it a difference of /quantity/ or a difference of /quality/?

Per my "Magic of Harry Potter" doc:

--------------

The question arises: what is the nature of a wizard's power? We know from the above discussion which factors influence it, but what actually is it?

Many people answer this question by proposing that power is a property wizards possess in addition to the factors I have discussed above. My fundamental thesis, however, is that this idea contradicts all of the textual evidence I have already presented. Wizards discuss power, and we see the effects of power, as being influenced by those factors. Power is therefore a property which emerges out of the contributing factors, not something separate to them.

To be clear, I am not saying that magical power does not exist. The thesis is not (as some people argue) “there is no such thing as magical power, only magical skill”. Rather I am saying that a person's power is a complex, multi-polar property determined by a number of factors, rather than a simple point on a linear scale which is fixed at birth.

Nonetheless, a person's magical power has a genuine effect in the world. We see the reality of magical power in numerous places:

  “Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it (GoF Chapter 14)

And:

  There was no benign smile upon Dumbledore's face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. There was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of power radiated from Dumbledore as though he were giving off burning heat. (GoF Chapter 35)

And:

  “Listen to me, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned young Crouch.

  [...]

  “You are blinded,” said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more, “by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius.” (GoF Chapter 36)

  Dumbledore flicked his own wand: the force of the spell that emanated from it was such that Harry, though shielded by his golden guard, felt his hair stand on end as it passed and this time Voldemort was forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it. (OotP Chapter 36)

There can be no doubt, I think, that magical power is a real magical property which has its own presence. It is not just a shorthand way of referring to the complex mix of factors I described above. However, the fact that power is real does not imply anything about what determines that power. On that front, I hope I have demonstrated the many different factors which contribute to power in canon.
