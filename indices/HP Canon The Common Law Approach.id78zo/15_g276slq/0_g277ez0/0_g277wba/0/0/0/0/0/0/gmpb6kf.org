I'd liken it more to, say, a frequency on a spectrometer not making enough of a peak to be visible next to another peak with a much higher amplitude, or a binary star looking like a regular star to the naked eye. Yes, if you were closer, or had more accurate instruments, you /might/ be able to detect the secondary source, but as it stands there's just not enough precision to be able to tell.
