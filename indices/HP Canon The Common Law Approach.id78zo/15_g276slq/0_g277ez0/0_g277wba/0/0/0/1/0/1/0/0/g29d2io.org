But if magical power exists, then Dumbledore talking about its amount clearly implies it can be quantified to some degree. That's simple logic. If it were not quantifiable, he wouldn't talk about its /amount/.

Also, if it were a complex mix of factors, then, as you claimed before, Harry would twing whatever spell is measuring it.

With regards to the quotes, none of them talk about /magical/ power. The force of a spell, the force behind a spell, power - and most seen through the eyes of Harry. Certainly nothing one would describe with "amount".

I don't think you can easily, or at all, measure the complex mix of factors that makes up a wizard or witch's power - skill, experience, intelligence and natural talent, for example. But measuring some magical power, that is mostly the same for an adult and at most twice the average for a uniquely talented individual, but weaker for a child? That's something else.
