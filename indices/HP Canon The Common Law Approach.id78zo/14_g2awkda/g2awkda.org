For a more legal rebuttal, I disagree with the common law approach. JKR is the ultimate authority, yes - but that means everything published by her counts. Assuming she would make a mistake or that a particular passage or text wasn't actually approved by her isn't acceptable in that case - she is the ultimate authority, and as such, has the authority to alter earlier statements.

That means we have two ground rules to consider when interpreting "canon": "newer beats older" and "specific beats general". Which means something stated in book 7, if contradicting something in book 1, takes precedence, and that something stated in general will not take precedence over a more specific statement. Like "magical beings are defined by..." compared to "this specific creature isn't a magical being" (even though it might meet the requirements stated earlier). Which also means that something stated by her later takes precedence even over the books. So, if she says Harry is blond, then that would be canon. (It would be stupid - but JKR is the ultimate authority over HP and not bound to her earlier statements. She can retcon things as she likes.)

Trying to pick and choose what we like from canon remains picking and choosing what we like from canon, whether we dress it up as a legal approach or not as soon as we attempt to limit JKR's authority to define HP
