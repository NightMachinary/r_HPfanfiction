So if JKR declared tomorrow that Harry was blond, that would make it so?

This is a very unusual approach to canon. A canon is traditionally a series of authoritative works - namely, the books of the bible considered to be "official". The concept of canon is inherently tied into the idea of there being a fixed, published set of works, and the idea that statements made by people can be canon in the same way that writings are is unusual.

JKR may well be the Pope of the HP universe, but the Pope cannot declare the Bible wrong.
