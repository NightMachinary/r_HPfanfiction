No, JKR is the creator of HP. She created the entire universe, so she can alter it at will. To use your analogy, she would be god in that example. Authors can and do retcons. Whether the fans accept them is another question - but the fans don't get to declare what's canon and what's not against the author's wishes. They can only declare what's their /headcanon/.

And yes, if JKR said "Harry is blond" then that would make him blond - in canon. I would, of course, ignore that stupidity when writing my stories - but I wouldn't claim it's not canon.
