Fan fiction doesn't just use the source material as a starting point, it uses it as a middle advisor and finale guide. When you're deep into figuring out whether or not your special magic system needs to have a willow wand or banyan tree as its material, you don't want to worry about what ollivander looks like, so you use canon.

You have an intricate love triangle involving your OC, Hermione, and rubeus hagrid. Obviously, your OC will treat hagrids cheating on the triangle for maddame Maxine in this way, but what would Hermione do? Grab a look at how her relationship went with Ron and canon and try to make it fit.

Changing canon is making fanfiction, but change it too much and its not fanfiction anymore, it's just fiction. I would argue that fanfiction doesn't use canon as /just/ a starting point. It requires a continual look and relook at canon to maintain cohesiveness in regards to the original harry potter series. The more you deviate from canon the closer you get to fiction.
