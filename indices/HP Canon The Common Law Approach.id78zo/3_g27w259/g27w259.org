That is a fascinating look into canon and what to call canon sources. Though I will say (trying my best not to be impolite) that I'm not completely sure what the point of it is in fanfiction as fanfiction by its very nature defies canon of the work it's about. Generally I like fanfiction because they all have the same jumping off point but end in radically different worlds and stories shown.
