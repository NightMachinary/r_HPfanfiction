As Taure copy-pasted this topic from DLP, I figure I can do the same:

I'm not sure how well this approach really works.

The problem with it is that 'canon' isn't really a single, unified, non-contradictory unit of knowledge. It is not curated by any authority into a form that allows it to be used as a meaningful measure. It is a collection of semi-random snippets and statements, from a variety of different sources such that even within the books themselves, you might have different levels of reliability thanks to the unreliability of the characters within the story. And that's not even getting into areas where seemingly reliable statements may not match up to reliable observations (McGonagall, I'm looking at you).

I am reminded of how the idea of 'canon' is regarded in Tolkien. There, there's an understanding that the 'canon' (if that's the right word for it) develops over time. One just needs to look at things like Balrogs, or the nature of Orcs to see that while there /are/ some statements from Tolkien on those subjects, his thoughts changed over time, and the stories themselves slowly changed with them. The issue is, that there are still places were 'old' ideas were left in, which seem to be incompatible with the newer ones.

Tolkien nerds don't tend to get hung up about that though. Usually, the issue is simply addressed as an uncertainty, with multiple possible interpretations, each of them having potential support in the form of Tolkien-sourced statements at different points in time.

Basically, if we apply Tolkien-fan logic to Rowling, we'd treat every twitter post, Pottermore entry, spin off and novel as equal. In the cases where they contradict, there's no /need/ to choose between them, or make up convoluted excuses. Rowling's vision for her world/characters changed subtly over time, just like Tolkien's. If you want to write 'canon-compliant' fanfiction, choose the version that works best for the story you want to write, state that you are doing so, and go to town.

Really, the fixation on acting as if the Harry Potter world somehow has some kind of transcendental existence which must be unified and internally consistent, and which is only imperfectly expressed by the works that describe it, is baffling. It is a constructed world, built up over years. It's never going to be wholly consistent, and that's /fine/.
