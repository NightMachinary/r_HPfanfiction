The difference is in the context of the canon. Tolkien's world has its whole history for the most part fleshed out, whereas for Hp we have a thorough understanding of 7 years and then a big question mark for almost everything else. Thus when regarding this like conflicting statements like the original comment was talking about, the context for whatever the conflict is is most likely there with Tolkien, whereas with Hp unless it's something that took place during the book series context is probably missing.
