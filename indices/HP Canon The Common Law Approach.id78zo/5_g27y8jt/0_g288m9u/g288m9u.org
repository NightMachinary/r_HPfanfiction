The difference is that Tolkien's worldbuilding is amazing, and JKR's is shit. The canon of the tolkienverse gives the whole history of Arda, a creation story, and much more. HP canon is wholly focused on 7 years and entirely from the perspective of one character who never explores outside of Hogwarts/Diagon Ally. We don't know the history of the WW or even it's scope.
