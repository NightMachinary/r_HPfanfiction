Cool, but irrelevant. You're no more an arbiter of canon than anyone else here. The only person who gets to decide what canon is is J. K. Rowling herself. Canon is the authoritative statement of what is or isn't true in a fictional world. The only person with the authority to make authoritative statements is the author. For the purposes of writing fanfiction it doesn't matter anyway, since fic authors are able to include or exclude whatever elements they like.

Also, it's pretty clear you decided what would go into each category /and then/ came up with reasons to justify it. Your definition of binding authority is written pretty clearly with the intention of excluding Pottermore and Fantastic Beasts.

Your definition of published does not exist anywhere else in the world. Articles released on the internet are considered "published" under all definitions, legal and otherwise. Even if we accept the "unalterable" argument, there have been changes made in later editions of the original books; they also cannot be considered binding under your definition.

And if the fact that some things in Fantastic Beasts contradict the books disqualifies them, then why aren't most of the books themselves disqualified, given that they contradict each other at times? The existence of contradiction is an extremely dubious ground on which to argue that they're not intended to exist in the same universe as the books. You even say that "later materials override earlier ones"; why would you mention that if not acknowledging that contradictions are going to exist between works? But for you, contradiction creates a problem only for one set of works, not for any of the others.

Overall, this obsession with saying "X isn't canon" is pointless and exists only for emotional reasons. If something people don't like, such as Cursed Child, is canon, then they feel that the canon they're invested in as a fan is devalued. Or, at least, that the canonical works they do like are devalued. We've seen it from the very beginning, with people trying to argue that the epilogue wasn't canon, or even that the last two books weren't canon. It's stupid. The question of whether something is canon is completely unrelated to the extent to which you enjoy it---something a fanfiction community /should/ be able to understand better than anyone. But everyone persists in wanting some external justification for "liking Harry Potter" but not liking particular works that are part of the Harry Potter universe.
