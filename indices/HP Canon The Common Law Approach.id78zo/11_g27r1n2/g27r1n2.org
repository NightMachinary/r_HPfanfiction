That seems rather complex and unecessary. Literal rule-lawyering about what is and isn't canon run contrary to what canon is: canon is the shared knowledge about the HP universe.

If there is a fact most fan of the serie will know about it, then that fact is canon: changing it without warning your readers might annoy them because you're changing something they know about the universe they want to be reading about. Fanfiction is all about writing in a shared universe - so if you change basic thing about it, you need to warn.

Conversely, a source from Pottermore or Twitter that you can hardly expect your readers to even know about is not canon because you cannot assume your readers would know about it and write accordingly. And conversely, you can change that fact easily and without warning, since most would not notice.

So what canon is what most people know about the serie. This include the books, and a few well-known factlets from outside the books, like Dumbledore being gay.

The contraposition to that is that if you need to resort to legalese argument to justify why your chosen factlet is canon, it is not canon.
