The real answer is that the universe is far too unstable and contradictory even in prime materials that it doesn't really matter. From word of author Fantastic Beasts might have the same canon legitimacy as the books but the movies that adapted the books don't (simply because of things that don't make sense like the whole Harry-eye fiasco, no Peeves in Hogwarts etc...)

So it's hard to discern what actually matters/what actually trumps what. Especially when the prime materials also clash in meaning. Take a look at Magic itself, in the original HP books Magic, isn't really a "physical" entity, it is merely the means in which a Wizard performs his craft. It leaves traces as Dumbledore has said, and it applies importance and significance to things like numbers or events.

But Magic itself is not a tangible force that one can see. Hence the whole Magical Core fiasco and all these things people used as a means of measuring Magical "Talent" like it's Star Wars with midochlorians. Yet, Fantastic Beasts state it is not only physical but can manifest.
