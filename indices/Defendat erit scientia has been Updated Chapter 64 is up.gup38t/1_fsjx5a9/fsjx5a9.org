Got a question, is it worth pulling through? I hate fics with no flow, and the 500-1000 word chapters make it impossible for there to be a flow to the writing. But shorter than required chapters have always been a fic-killer for me, I don't understand why some, luckily few, authors do it.

EDIT: Oh nevermind, didn't realize you were the author. So I guess your answer would be "yes it is worth it" :D But maybe you could explain why the insanely short chapters? Surely updating less frequently with longer chapters makes more sense?
