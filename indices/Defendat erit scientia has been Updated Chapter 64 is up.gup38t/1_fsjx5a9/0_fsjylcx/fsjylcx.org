That is just my writing style, the chapter length is fine to me but not everyone like that. Everyone has their own personal preference, if you didn't enjoy the fic , I'm sorry about that but the good thing about the Harry Potter fandom is the massive size of it. There is a story for everyone, I'm sure you can find something that you will enjoy reading . Thanks for taking the time to check out my story, I hope you find a good fic that you enjoy reading soon
