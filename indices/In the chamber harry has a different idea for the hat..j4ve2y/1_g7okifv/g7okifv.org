Okay, obviously you need to go full crack here - the Basilisk is clearly a Hogwarts student if he/she was sorted and must attend classes. Is it a first year or does it attend classes with Harry? Or is it senior Hogwarts faculty? What class does a giant 1000-year-old snake teach, and can it be the Slytherin head?

Wait, of /course/ he/she can't be Slytherin head - it's a Hufflepuff.

Can the basilisk be given detention for attacking other students? Is /that/ why Fawkes is there, and why Dumbledore is metaphorically always around?

Edit: the Basilisk's name is Seekretsss.
