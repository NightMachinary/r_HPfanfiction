Wizard from Earth is similar (I assume, fem!harry is pretty much the only thing I won't read). Abandoned. I don't believe there's any romance at all, but it's been a while since I've read this. linkffn(8337871)

Of a Linear Circle has some time travel to the founders era in part three. You do not need to read the first two parts first, but... there's a sort of mystery involved that you'd miss out on by skipping around. Part three has an off screen sex scene, and all romantic scenes (intimate and otherwise) can be easily skipped in the rest. I'll link both the first and third part. If interested, there's also a couple backstories in this series about the founders over in part five. The entire thing is full of nerdy eleventh century history goodness. linkao3(11284494; 11631114)
