It is similar, yeah. A Long Journey Home is basically that, but with less focus on the past and more focus on Jasmine returning to the modern day and seeming ancient to everyone.

If you enjoyed Wizard from Earth, I'd highly recommend you at least give Long Journey a try, whether you like fem!Harry or not. It really does the "I am older than you can really think about" thing hella well.

No pressure though - each to their own and all that. :)

Of a Linear Circle isn't something I've read, and it looks interesting, so thank you for that rec. Thank you for answering my smut queries too - I always wonder whether people actually read my ever-growing boilerplate disclaimer. :D
