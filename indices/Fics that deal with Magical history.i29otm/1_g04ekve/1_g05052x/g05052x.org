Even if you're not into Fem!Harry, I'd very much recommend you take a look. It's got such exquisite 'I am an ancient thing' vibes to it - like a written version of the Man from the Earth movie. And the History parts are fun too. :)

I honestly don't know, but I think I've read this? The name seems incredibly familiar and I remember a couple things in the first couple of chapters, but I don't remember anything more of it. I guess it's one of those ones that's drifted from my brain - thus, probably time for a reread. :)

Thanks for the rec!
