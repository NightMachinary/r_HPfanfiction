And some dialogue-specific writing features that bug me out.

- Same-y dialogue, identical voices. Without the "said John Doe" dialogue tag, there is no way to distinguish one character from another. Somewhat synonymous with the "Fanon Draco" voice, which I have never seen as frequently as I have in fanfiction. Typical characteristics: smirky and dry sarcasm, constant raising of a single eyebrow (and EVERYONE does that, not just one person), Hollywood-style quippy dialogue with pop-culture references, like Marvel bander or Chandler from "Friends".

- Low-effort dialogue. No attempt to make the character's dialogue match up with their personality, age, time period, or setting.

    "I didn't mean to yeet our sister!" said Albus, wringing his hands in agitation.

    Aberforth lifted an eyebrow. "Cool story, bro."

- This slips into Americanisms in dialogue.

    Fred dropped a stack of brightly-colored boxes into Harry's arms. "We won't charge you a dime."

    Ron held up a pygmy puff. "What about me? I'm your brother!"

    Fred smirked and lifted an eyebrow. "That'll be twenty bucks, thanks."

    Ron scowled and tossed the pygmy puff back into the pile. "I'm telling mom!"

- Accents. Sometimes it's Hagrid, sometimes it's Fleur or Viktor. If you're unlucky, you get a character written with an accent when they never had one in canon (McGonagall, Cho). If you're super-duper-unlucky, you get an author who thinks a unique accent counts as a personality trait.

    "Well, you're back t' th'silk,” she says innocently. “Mayhap th' tykes need a reminder tha' they didn' hallucinate anythin' yesterday.”

    “But Harry tol' me it's th' house o' th' Brothers, not jus' that Ignotus fellow. Stuck w'another house, Sev.”

From Swung By Serafim, when an attempt in being "quirky" resulted in unreadability.
