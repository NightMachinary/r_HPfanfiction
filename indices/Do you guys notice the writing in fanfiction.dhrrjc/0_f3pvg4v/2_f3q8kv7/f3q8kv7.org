  Fred dropped a stack of brightly-colored boxes into Harry's arms. "We won't charge you a dime."

  Ron held up a pygmy puff. "What about me? I'm your brother!"

  Fred smirked and lifted an eyebrow. "That'll be twenty bucks, thanks."

  Ron scowled and tossed the pygmy puff back into the pile. "I'm telling mom!"

Those aren't so much Americanisms as Mugglisms. It wouldn't be any better with "pence" for "dime" and "quid" for "bucks", methinks. In any case they are cases of the author being factually wrong about the world, not anything to do with the writing itself. Americanisms in dialogue do happen and they are annoying if too egregious, but this isn't really an example of that so much as it is of people forgetting that /Harry Potter/ takes place in 1990's England and Scotland in a parallel society that is itself pretty different from what Muggle British society & culture were like in the 1990's, let alone the Muggle American one.
