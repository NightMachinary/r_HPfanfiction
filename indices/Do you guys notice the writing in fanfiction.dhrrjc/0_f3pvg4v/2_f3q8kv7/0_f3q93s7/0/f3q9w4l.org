Well, I mean, yes, there's a difference, and there would again be a difference if a German writer had wizards talk about Euros or something. But what I'm saying is that the mistakes are /functionally/ the same --- the author is using the money of their culture, overlooking that the Wizarding World is a different society --- and while the American variation is an "Americanism" in the sense of being a consequence of the author being American, it's not a matter of language.
