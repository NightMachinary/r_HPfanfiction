To answer your speed edit - the kind of Americanisms in fanfiction that you're talking about, which aren't interchangeable vocabulary words, aren't things that appear often in /dialogue./ Most of them are narrative tropes, not part of writing structure. And Americanisms in tropes is a whole different thread.

Examples would be: Varsity sports teams and players, American holiday traditions, extreme tuition and medical debts, universal gun ownership, the Miranda warning "anything you say will be held against you" when arrested, and aspects of Civil vs. Common Law.
