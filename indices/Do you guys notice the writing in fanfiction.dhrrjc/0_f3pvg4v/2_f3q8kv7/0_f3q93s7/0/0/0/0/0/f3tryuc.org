Well, I'm not British myself - so it makes it hard to say 100%, but I think that not all those costs are covered by the NHS. For instance, I know that in France those sorts of routine checkup/vaccination does cost a little bit... Just very little for an American to look at.

Even if they were covered, I imagine it's just as much the Dursleys not wanting to go out of their way for Harry than anything else
