I will note that not all of that is a huge issue - for instance, "extreme tuition" is quite present in Britain, as from what I can tell boarding schools can /easily/ reach into the thousands of pounds a term - the average seems to be at ~Â£10,000 a term. It's not a stretch from canon that Hogwarts would normally be expensive - I know that JKR has stated since that it's free, but in terms of book canon there's no real indication either way.

Medical debts are also another thing that's not guaranteed to not be there in the WW - after all, part of what makes the Wolfbane Potion so hard to get (in addition to difficulty to brew) is that it's very expensive - and would seemingly be covered by a wizarding NHS, if it existed. We also can deduce that the Ministry doesn't cover all health costs - for instance, IIRC Lucius Malfoy gets his way to the great seats in the World Cup by making a big donation to St. Mungo's. So it's possible that they get donations and support from the ministry to cover all health costs, but it's not at all guaranteed - particularly since the NHS only was established in 1948, not a long time for Wizards.

The other examples work well, though I suppose there is a case to be made to treating universal ownerships of wands in the WW as analogous to universal gun ownership.
