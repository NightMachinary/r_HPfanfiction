Yes, those things do exist, but what do they have to do with "the writing" (which is the subject of this thread)?

Also, for things like holiday traditions, the Miranda warning and law, I don't think the Wizarding World should be very much like Muggle Britain anyway, so I have no strong objections to authors basing themselves on what they know rather than British customs specifically.
