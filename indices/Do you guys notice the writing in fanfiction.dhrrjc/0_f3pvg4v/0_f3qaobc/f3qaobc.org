The dialogue and character voice is such a big one for me. I will generally quit reading if I dislike the way the characters sound especially the adults. I often decide if Snape focused fics are worth reading almost entirely on his first few lines of dialogue and internal thoughts. If Snape talks and thinks like a generic teenager and has zero of his sarcasm and snippy mocking dialogue then I know that I may as well be reading about John Doe OC than a complex morally grey character. Same goes for Dumbledore and other adults as I expect them to sound different and more mature than teenagers.

There is just so much fanfiction out there that I have gotten more and more picky about what I read. Most my decisions on what to read come down to how much I enjoy the writing style, the prose and the dialogue. A good writer can take the most ridiculous stupid plot line and make an amazing story out of it so the plot doesn't even matter too much in the end. An amazing plot and story premise only goes so far if the writing is mediocre and bland.
