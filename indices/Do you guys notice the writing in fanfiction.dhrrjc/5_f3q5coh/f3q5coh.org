Oh god yes. So many times I have seen a really good premise that managed to avoid/subvert tropes only to nope out because the prose sucked. If the story is good enough I'll tough through it (Basilisk-born, while certainly not quite grammatically correct is at least consistent in how it is incorrect, which makes it more manageable. That said, holy shit the worldbuilding) but most of the time when the writing sucks I just close the window. Run-on sentences I can generally deal with, those usually mean there's at least /some/ description to be had. When the sentences are super short I just can't though.
