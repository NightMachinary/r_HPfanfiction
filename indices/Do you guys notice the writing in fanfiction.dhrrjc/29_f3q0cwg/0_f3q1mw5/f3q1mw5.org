*EDIT:* The poster deleted their comment, but it was an accusation of me complaining about bad writing without giving constructive advice to help.

I did, actually. Most of them are self-evident.

- On sentence structure: "The more engrossing fics vary sentence lengths and have a good balance between dialogue, actions, descriptions, and thinking."

- On epithets: Use characters' names.

- On verbal tics: It's a habit, don't fall into it.

- On too many perspectives: In a story about Harry Potter, focus on Harry Potter.

- On tiny chapters: "their format creates pacing issues in the form of a cliffhanger -> resolution -> new cliffhanger cycle." Pace the stories better, by taking more time to write longer, substantial chapters, or plan the pacing so the chapter break happens at a natural scene transition, and thus avoiding unnecessary cliffhangers.
