I absolutely notice the writing in fics I read (and write, for that matter). I hate reading my own work, but I've made a habit of giving each chapter I write a once-over before sending it to my editors, just so I can be sure that I've avoided repetitive phrasing and awkward dialogue.

I will freely admit that I've dropped fics because the writing feels flat and bland.
