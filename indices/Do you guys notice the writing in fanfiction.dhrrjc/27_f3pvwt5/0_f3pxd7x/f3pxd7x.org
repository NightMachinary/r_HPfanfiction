What makes it masturbatory? The content and tropey "Goddess Hermione" content, or the actual writing style?

I just checked a random chapter in a random multi-chap fic, and I can't get over the fact that each chapter is broken up with 10 scene breaks, almost all dialogue, of maybe 20 lines before it swaps to the next scene. It has all the same pacing issues of the fics with 5000 chapters and 100k words.
