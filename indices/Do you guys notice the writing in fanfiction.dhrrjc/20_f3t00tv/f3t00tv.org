Great summary. IMO the writing is the most important thing there can be in a fic - i can at least give a try to some fic when the premise is kind of weird or only tangentially interesting if the writing turns out alright, but if it's off i'm not even gonna bother with something that has a great premise/summary.

I don't think short chapters really are that big of an issue (or maybe i just didn't run into them) - more often than not what i see are chapters that are a tad too long and could use some splitting for easier reading. Or culling in genereal, there's far too many overinflated fics.

I think the only thing that ain't bothering me from what you people mention are Americanisms - but i'm not native, so that might be the reason. Your example, as someone already pointed out, isn't really an americanism - more of a muggleism, which really are out of place, especially in that money-related context.
