I actually feel the opposite in that I prefer discussions of the aforementioned usage of storytelling tropes over discussions about "actual writing." Ultimately, a lot of what OP's "actual writing" refers to is what I'd call just technical details. While, yes, on the whole I prefer fics (and stories in general) that are more polished, I try to judge fics by how they deal with thematic, character, and plot development, which is why looking at how a fic deals with storytelling tropes, even well-worn ones, is extremely useful, since they easily lend themselves as litmus tests for how an author deals with themes, characters, and plots.
