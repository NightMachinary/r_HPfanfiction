Yeah... Generally though I don't notice particular things but there are some fics that sound super interesting and then I read the first few paragraphs and I already know, that I won't be able to finish it because I don't like the writing style. That to be said, I think that mainly in some longer fics the author improves in their writing style as the story goes on.
