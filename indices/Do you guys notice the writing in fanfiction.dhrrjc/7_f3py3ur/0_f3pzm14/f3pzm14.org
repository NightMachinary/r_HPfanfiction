This is why I like to flip to a random middle chapter in a fic and read a paragraph or two before I commit to reading it, especially if it's a long one over 200k words. If the writing looks and sounds more polished than the summary or the first page, then I'll trust that the author has improved over time.

But if the preview shows me writing with hokey dialogue or lurid purple prose descriptions, I'll just drop it there.

I used to read 600k+ word fics hoping that it would get better at some point, but I gave that up long ago.
