I actually think this is ok (the summers), maybe not to that extent but it's not a rehash of canon, it's not another exhausting school year of repetition (wake up, breakfast, class, lunch, class, dinner, common room, bed) you can pack a lot into summers, do exciting new things, stay up til 4am doing stupid shit or sleep until lunchtime. We get to explore the magical world more, the culture ... the summer before Harry's 4th year is a great example of this it's Chapter 12 and page 152 before we actually get to Hogwarts in that book

It can be the best or worst part of a fic especially if you add in a shopping trip.

I love writing the shopping trips but I don't add them to my fics without */heavy/* culling now , and letter writing! I love writing letters between characters but fuck... so boring to read them so I don't add them unless I have to
