I was more just joking about two of my favorite fics (though for vastly different reasons): linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change) and linkao3(A Marauder's Plan)

I think it's a matter of both personal taste and the writing of the author. I enjoy long stories that go into a large amount of detail, but understand people can find it unnecessarily long-winded or taking to long to progress the story. I can also find fics to be the same way, but the long fics I like have more than enough details and progression to keep me reading despite the short timeframe.
