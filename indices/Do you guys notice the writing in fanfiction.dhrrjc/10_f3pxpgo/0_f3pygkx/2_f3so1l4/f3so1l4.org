I'm currently struggling with the dialogue in the otherwise excellent and original "The odds were never in my favor" by Antony444. First there's the Epithet problem OP mentioned--"the bushy-haired Gryffindor said" or "the killing-curse green eyed witch said" (when "she" would often suffice).

Then there are scenes like Ron making a suggestion to Neville, in which we get "'Good initiative,' Neville felicitated." I wish that the author (who is fluent in English but not a native speaker) would put down the thesaurus and/or get a beta.

A more general comment--authors ideally should read their dialogue out loud and then ask, "Does an 11-year old really speak like this?" Because most of the time, the answer is no.
