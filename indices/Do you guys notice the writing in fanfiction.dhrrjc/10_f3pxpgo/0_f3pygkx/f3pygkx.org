There's a weird dichotomy of newbie fanfic writers:

1. Fics that only use "said" and one other dialogue tag. "Sighed" or "drawled" are the most common.

2. Fics that use every other dialogue tag /except/ "said". You get the whole thesaurus thrown at you, with a matching adverb. "Trumpeted uproariously", "thundered heavily", "screamed shrilly," "bellowed vulgarly", and the classic one, "ejaculated loudly".
