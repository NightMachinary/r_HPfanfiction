Yes. I do notice the prose. Part of that is because I do my own writing and am more drawn to the editing part of writing, so it is sometimes hard to take off the 'editing' hat while reading stories that don't engross me. If a story engrosses me, then I will forgive many a writing sin, however.

- Same-y sentence structure.\\
  This is something that I struggle with myself at times. I have certain ways of joining certain clauses together, and ever since a good friend pointed out that to me a few years ago, I've been very conscious of it. It honestly takes me consciously looking at the flow of the prose in my own work in order to improve on this, and I don't always do it well.

- Author verbal tics\\
  I see this all the time and am guilty as sin of it. For example, I have a habit of beginning my sentences with things like, "to be fair" or "well" or something similar. I'm better at this in writing, but some of my tics still leak through. I have a few favorite words for describing things that I have to edit out.\\
  Many authors do this. For example, Timothy Zahn has an unhealthy love of the word 'sardonically.' Rowling likes to modify her quotative verbs with adverbs rather than using another verb as a quotative verb. For example, in OotP in /Dumbledore's Army/ she writes "'Yeah, it was!' said Ron enthusiastically..." rather than saying "'Yeah, it was!' Ron enthused." Taken by itself, either way is acceptable. But sticking to one over the other almost exclusively is a tic. Not to mention Rowling's need to "adverbify" nearly every quotative verb.\\
  On a semi-related note, I have to resist the urge to flip off the author through the screen whenever I hear the word 'dunderhead.' Please, authors, let go of this word!

- Epithets.\\
  Ugh, I am at a constant battle with epithets. I get their use. Really, I do. But I've read so many fics inundated with them that I find it hard to use any of them in my own writing, even where appropriate. Therefore I tend to err on the opposite side of the spectrum, where I almost never use epithets. To avoid excessive use of proper nouns, I have to carefully craft my sentences so that who is being referred to is understood via context.

- Too many rotating perspectives.\\
  I actually don't see this very often. It does get annoying when I do.

- Tiny chapters.\\
  Another thing I very rarely see. More often, I see excessively long chapters.

- Same-y dialogue/identical voices.\\
  This is common and unfortunately won't go away until the author makes a real effort to characterize each person in their head. Voicing a character can take many forms. Regional diction (certain words or phrases unique or semi-unique to the location in which the character grew up), preferred words (one character likes to use the word 'therefore', for example), wittiness (do they pun or are they savvy to the more fun turns of phrase?), optimism/pessimism (do they look for the good or bad in things?), dialogue flow (do they tend to trail their sentences off, or finish sentences in 'eh', or do they only use as many words as necessary?), etc etc etc.

- Accents\\
  I try not to write accents as much as allude to them. I found Fleur's speech to be only tangentially related to how French people sound when they speak English. And unfortunately many fanfic authors have managed to make Fleur's "Phlegmglish" even /worse./ It's far too easy to stereotype here, so I avoid it.
