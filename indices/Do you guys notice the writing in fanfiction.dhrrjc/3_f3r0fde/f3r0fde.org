Blood and bloody ashes if that didn't immediately throw me back to Wheel of Time haha. Though in fairness, I'll say that despite Jordan's constant verbal tics, his prose had a very nice storybook like quality that sold the tone harder than anything else could.

Also yeah I actively don't read most fanfiction because the writing feels stale. I feel like I could get through the worst of plots if the writing was just a biiit better.
