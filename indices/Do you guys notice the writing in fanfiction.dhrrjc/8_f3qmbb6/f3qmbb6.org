Completely agree with everything said. I would also add some i noticed

- repetitiveness - quite often it isn't even some common trope itself I have problem with, but how much some authors are milking it. You can bet if you see 'Mione mentioned once, it will be from there on referred as such by every character including narrator. Another example would be that stupid Weasley twins-speak. I could handle it once (with an eye-roll), but their dialogue is always the same for the rest of the fic

- some authors are really bad at understanding how fast can time pass in different situations. In some you will have explicitly mentioned something happening hour from now, then after 10 lines of dialogue, it is there. On the other hand when some fast-paced, "intense" moment happening, author just randomly throws several minutes into it - like character making some "shocking" revelation and the whole rooms is frozen is astounded into silence for five minutes. Or they will have just casual dialogue in the middle of the fighting. It is not that big of a detail, but always throws me off focus.
