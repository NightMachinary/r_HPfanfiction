  I can't even get to the blandness because his sentence structure just feels off to me.

I just flipped to a random chapter in "Harry Crow", and the blandness effect comes from every sentence of every paragraph having an identical structure with minimal variation. Character name's or pronoun, the action they take, result of the action.

  Bill had fired three hexes at Harry in quick succession, all at different body parts. Harry had deflected the first one at Malfoy again, dodged the second but the third one connected with his thigh. Harry though didn't cry out, merely bowed in acknowledgement to his teacher's skill.

Outside of the dialogue, the rest of the prose is a running commentary on what's happening and what everyone's doing, with very little prose spent on developing character through contemplation and thought, like the Harry written by JKR. The Harry in the books /thinks/ about what's happening around him, not just acting and reacting like Robst's Harry. JKR's Harry gets angsty at times (OotP), but it also makes him feel like a human and not a robot.

  He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the many students hurrying towards lunch. The anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and Hermione's shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction.
