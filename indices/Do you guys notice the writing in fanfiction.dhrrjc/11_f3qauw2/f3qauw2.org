I think another problem is when someone who's first language isn't english and they don't get someone to read over what they're saying and it all just sounds... off. Like 'Harry walks into the house and ask for some potato'. Kind of hard to make an example as English is my first language, but if you're unsure of your english, rather than apologise for it at the start of the chapter maybe get someone to read it over so it sounds right and not... awkward to read.
