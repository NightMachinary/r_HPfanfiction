I definitely notice things I don't like in writing style but I never really stop to think what it is that bugs me. Constant short sentences and run on sentences are the only ones I know straight away that that's what's bugging me. I can overlook bad spelling and grammer pretty easily, my mind kinda corrects it as I'm reading so I don't always notice it unless it's something glaringly obvious to me. But I've definitely given up on something if the style bugs me in some way, usually only shorter or one shot fics, but sometimes longer ones as well, I usually give those a few chapters to improve first if I like the story itself.
