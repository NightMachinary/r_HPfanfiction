I'm definitely more forgiving with fanfiction than professional work. If something is professionally published but has spelling errors etc then there are people not doing their job. It makes the author look bad but chances are it was a simple mistake missed by editors and publishers. Fanfiction on the other hand is more of a hobby. It's done for fun and to improve your own writing. There shouldn't be an expectation for things like spelling and grammar to be perfect in fanfiction in my opinion. Not everyone is going to have someone to check over their work and even if they do the chances of something being missed are still pretty big. If the spelling is so bad you can't understand what's been written then it's a problem, but I haven't come across that often.
