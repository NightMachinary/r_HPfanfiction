I'm the same way. Especially if the grammar + spelling mistakes aren't super frequent. Unless it's something that makes the story completely unreadable (i.e. the author doesn't know what paragraph breaks are, I can't follow a conversation or what a character is doing, etc.) I don't really notice. I also think I'm a lot more forgiving in fanfiction than I would be for professionally published works. Most fanfiction authors are relying completely on like a vaguely competent friend and their own understanding of language for editing, mistakes are inevitable.
