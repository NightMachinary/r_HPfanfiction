I certainly notice the writing - usually not on purpose/deliberately (ie, analyzing it) but in the feel it gives off. Frankly, it's the reason I drop most fics - the writing quality being poor enough to not draw my interest.

Your example of the same-y sentence structure is a good one - I'd also add that a lot of short sentences do the same feel to me.

Dialogue is a tough one, because it's very difficult to write good one I find - but yeah, if the words they use stand out too much, it's kinda ridiculous. American-isms isn't necessarily a problem for me (depends on which ones they are, and how much they have in it) - but other aspects can easily make me shake my head at poor writing.

I personally find it hard to overlook bad writing to enjoy a work - probably more so than any tired trope, honestly.
