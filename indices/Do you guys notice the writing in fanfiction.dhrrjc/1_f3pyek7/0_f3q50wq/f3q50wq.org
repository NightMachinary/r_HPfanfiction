Short sentences and one-sentence paragraphs can work, if they're infrequent. It can be a useful way to add tension and movement in action sequences, as long as the rest of the story has varied sentence/paragraph lengths. It makes the kicker moment hid harder when the sentence is short and abrupt.

Example from the books:

#+begin_quote
  A few more of the portraits had stirred now. Terror of being interrogated made Harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob. It would not turn.

  He was shut in.
#+end_quote

If it was written in one paragraph, with no variation in sentences, you wouldn't get the same effect.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

...And that's the difference between Robst and JKR, lol.

I think dialogue is one of those things that, when it's good, it blends in seamlessly with the characterization and story. You don't really notice it, because you're fully immersed in the story and characters. But when it's bad, it stands out and ruins the story and turns the characters into tropey caricatures. Kind of like a getting into a car or elevator. When it's working well, it's a smooth ride and you forget about it and get where you're going. When it's broken, it ruins your day.
