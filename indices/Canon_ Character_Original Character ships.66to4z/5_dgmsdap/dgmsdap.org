It really does depend how they are handled. Sometimes its interesting and sometimes its extremely dull. That said, I do enjoy reading outside cannon pairings for Harry because its neat to see how the author develops the character hes paired with. Authors writing stories where they are taking blank slates such as Daphne, or Katie, or even semi blank slates like Fleur and developing them into solid characters is a neat thing to read.

Of note is that I also was NEVER a fan of the pairings JK ended up going with. It disappointed me EXTREMELY when Harry ended up with Ginny and Ron with Hermione. I had been rooting for Harry/Hermione, with Luna/Ron and Ginny/Neville as the other possibles. When it didnt happen I actually moved away from the HP world, only coming back upon discovering fan fiction and the ability to have the pairings I wanted, or at least new and interesting pairings to explore.

So OC's or blank slate characters (like Daphne) are always fun to see.
