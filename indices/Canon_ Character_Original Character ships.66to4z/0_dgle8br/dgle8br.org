It truly depends on the writer. Some writers turn them into Mary sues but other have them be fleshed out characters with their own strengths and flaws. And the canon book didn't reveal a lot about most females, so pairing Harry with anyone aside from Luna, Ginny or Hermione usually results in a O.C or a O.C. Stand-in. And even the personality of Ginny is a little underdeveloped and Luna is almost impossible to write for most writers, so they both get turned into an O.C too quite often.
