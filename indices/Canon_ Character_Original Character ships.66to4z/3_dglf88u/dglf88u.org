I'm not into them at all, personally. I've read some great OCs, but there's always something that stops me from liking them. I think it's because when I'm in the mood for fanfiction, I'm really just looking for MORE Harry Potter. I don't want to meet somebody new, I want to hang out with my friends from the books again.
