The main problem ist the fact that they're OCs. Character Development ist hard work, with many pitfalls, that needs some Class-A execution. To build a character you need more than just "I want her/him to be a Slytherin and best friends with Harry, but loved by Draco and everybody else in school" - Mary Sue awfulness, which is, it seems, 99% of all OCs in the HP fandom.

So before we even go into ships, you can just root out 99% of all OCs simply because they're bad characters.

Then you have the question of "Why". Why do you want to pair Harry (or whomever) with an OC? OC here does not mean characters like Daphne, or Susan, as their characters have been defined by fanon. I'm talking about a complete OC, with no mention anywhere in canon, Pottermore or fanon discourse.

Frankly, the answer I often think is accurate is "I want to pair myself with Harry". OCs are /mostly/ self-inserts. Even if they're technically well written, they suck because no one wants to read your romantic daydream. And this is already talking about one fraction in the 1% of not just unreadable bullshittery.

So we have somewhere around 99.5% (perceived) chance of the tag "OC" being a bad sign. There is only a very little chance of some OC being good. Case in point, I can only think of two stories that do OCs as anything but sidecharacter fillers well. "Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived" by The Santi, featuring Calypso Rosier and the "Alexandra Quick" series. Thats it. I would say that I enjoyed the Harry/Calypso pairing a lot, simply because Calypso was a great character, but probability speaks against OCs in general, and pairings with them in particular.
