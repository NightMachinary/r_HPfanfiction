As I write a CC/OC pairing , obvously I'm going to come down in favour; but with the proviso that it's not written in first person from the OC's POV and that the OC is paired with a CC who doesn't have any love interest in canon, or the story is set well after canon events.

I would agree that a lot of OCs are badly written (not mine I hope!), but that's because a lot of fanfics are badly written.

I don't see much difference between an OC and a 'canon' character who in canon is no more than a random name without any description, background or personality.
