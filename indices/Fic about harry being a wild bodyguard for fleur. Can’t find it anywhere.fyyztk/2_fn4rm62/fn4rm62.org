Is it the one where Harry has a “Dark Knight” thing that's like a manifestation of his anger, or the one where Harry is a water elemental and theres chapter or two where he's been hired to defend Fleur and her family. There's a couple other bodyguard fics where he is hired by the Delacours (however it's spelt) but can't remember them.

Edit: did a quick search for The French Connection and there was a reddit post where it was linked and it has in fact been deleted whata shame.
