Stages of Hope is brilliant. One of my favorite fics and IMO the best of this genre: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]

How Like Home is a pretty good WIP: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22810651/chapters/54512623]]

I really enjoyed A Step to the Right, but it's first in a series and I don't know if the author is ever going back to it: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14949759/chapters/34641246]]

There's a great one, unfinished, and I can't remember the name. Death Eaters kidnap and drag Harry to another dimension where his parents are alive and his counterpart is older. He has a sister. The new Sirius hates him and doesn't trust him. Anybody remember this one?
