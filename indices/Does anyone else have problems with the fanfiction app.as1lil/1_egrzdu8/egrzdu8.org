My only current pet peeve with the app is that it labels "Chapter 1" as the page with the summary and reviews, and then you swipe left to go "Chapter 2" which is the real Chapter 1 of the fic

Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app? Or perhaps seeing if there's a difference in the app connectivity between WiFi and cellular data?
