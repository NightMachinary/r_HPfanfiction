Is this [[https://ff.net][ff.net]]'s official app? Because the one I use, Michael Chen Tejada's Fanfiction Reader has been giving me issues with updates for a while, mainly that I have to tell a story to update, back out and delete it while it's updating to get it to do the update properly instead of just syncing the thing and having everything download and set up. I think it's saving the story metadata to include any new chapters that's the issue in the version I've got.
