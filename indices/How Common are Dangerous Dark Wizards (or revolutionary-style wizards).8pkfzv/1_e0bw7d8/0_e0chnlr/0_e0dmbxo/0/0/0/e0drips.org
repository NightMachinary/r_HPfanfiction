In this regard, the Romans actually had A LOT in common with the various Chinese, Egyptian and Byzantine dynasties. In those cases, the new dynasty ruling (either by political or violent means) would typically commission a history to be written about their dynasties rise to power decades or centuries later. It makes sense, after all you want to establish how you deserve the position don't you?

There were several problems with this though. First, often more than one history was written at the time, and typically the one's commissioned by the leadership tend to not only be the /least/ trusted by historians now and in the past (the best historical evidence is usually from outside perspectives). Second, if a new dynasty takes over, you typically want to get rid of the previous histories so you can establish your own right to rule and write your own history.

This is why the only record of the rise of the Tatars under Ghengis Khan, despite it being one of the top ten most important events in the last millenium, is only recorded in one text, The Secret History of the Mongols.

In regard to your point of the magical world, I will give you some speculation. The thing is, even in canon the wizarding world seems to be largely isolated and cutoff, at least compared to the muggle equivalents. That makes sense, magic makes people incredibly self-sufficient. The dark wizards of the past frankly resemble more than anything the various territorial feudal lords and warlords in medieval Europe than anything else. Their objectives seem to have been to make themselves ruler of their small fiefdom or tribe. Why would they care about ruling or becoming king, when every wizard/witch can do pretty much anything they want anyway. They /seem/ to have been focused on increasing their ability to not be taken out by muggle forces (numbers) or other magicals with a bone to pick.

And if you need a better example of what I have described in changing history and controlling information, I invite you to consider "The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts." A book that seems to describe the history of dark magic use, but is obviously written by someone who wants to paint their use as wrong or immoral. *If I used dark magic to take over, this is exactly the book I would commission to be written: so nobody could do the same thing to me.*
