The phrase "history is written by the victors," was actually a rephrasing of Winston Churchill. He more or less stated that "I know history will treat my kindly, because I will be writing it." But Churchill wrote that after World War 1...when he was fired. He wrote that in his memoir's to /defend/ himself.

The message was not that history is written by the victors. The message is history was written by /authors and writers/.

Let me give you an example: Marc Antony. After Octavian defeated Antony's fleet at the Battle of Actium and subsumed full control of the empire, he wanted to completely cement control of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty as rulers of Rome. To that end, he attempted to systematically purge all mention and memory of the existence of Marc Antony. A bit difficult, given the level of impact the man had, but he was fairly successful.

So how do we know about him then? Well, mainly because of Suetonius, writing centuries later on the twelve caesars, mentions how Octavian defeated his opponents, as well as mentions by other authors in history including /Julius Caesar himself/ in his Commentaries on the Gallic Wars (if you haven't read that, I highly recommend it).

Victors don't write history, but they do try to influence or control it. Writers and scholars end up deciding what we call history. Octavian himself had the Aeneid written by Vergil to establish his own semi-divinity and descent from the mythical founders of Rome Romulus and Remus. But he didn't write it himself, that was Vergil, who included numerous comments in the work at the fact this was all made-up for Octavian.
