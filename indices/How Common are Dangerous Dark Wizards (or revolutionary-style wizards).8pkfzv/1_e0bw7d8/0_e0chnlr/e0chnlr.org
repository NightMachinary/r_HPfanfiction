Something about that seems off. The dark arts and dark magic seem to be an inseparable part of the history of the magical world. Part of me wonders if its not so much that revolutionary wizards and witches (dark or not) are not that common and more that most of them *won*.

I am reminded of the famous quote by Napolean Boneparte, that "history is a set of lies we have all agreed to." The key point about Voldemort and Grindelwald is that they lost, while Dumbledore and Harry won. Perhaps its that the dark wizards/witches won and re-spun the way things are, and painted themselves as the morally correct and the best hope for the future.

Within canon, magic seems to be able to re-shape entire ideas and concepts of reality; it would hardly be that surprising if a revolutionary took over or affected a significant political change, then either eliminated their opposition or anyone with disparate opinions.

On a similar note, revolutionaries or terrorist leaders today and in the past have generally been highly educated, literate, and well-versed controlling people, while they are generally followed by the unruly, thuggish, or the "proletariat." Since intellect and knowledge also translates in the magical world to being the most powerful/skilled in a lot of cases, there is the double attraction of followers to the fact that these revolutionaries are also the most powerful. It seems likely that most powerful wizards or witches, unless their is someone who far outclasses them, end up in positions of either authority over others or attempting to gain power through alternate means.

I suppose thats the reason nobody but Voldemort rose to power in the wake of Grindelwald's play for power. Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort so outclass anyone else that nobody would try to change the way things are. Their like magical versions of tactical nukes: if they exist, the world invariably has to follow/obey them /unless/ you have your own to oppose them.
