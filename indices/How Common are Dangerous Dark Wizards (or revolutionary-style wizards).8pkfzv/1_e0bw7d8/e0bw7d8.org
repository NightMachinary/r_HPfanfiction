Not many, from canon. There were powerful Dark Wizards in the past, but they were either more Bellatrix than Voldemort, causing damage on a small scale without a grand agenda (like Emeric the Evil, Herpo the Foul and Salazar Slytherin), or they were content to establish themselves as the uncontested lord of a small domain (like Raczidian and Ekrizdis) without attempting to take over the world at large.
