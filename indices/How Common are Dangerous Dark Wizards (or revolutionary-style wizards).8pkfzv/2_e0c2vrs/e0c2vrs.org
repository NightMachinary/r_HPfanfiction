Given the existence of Aurors on top of Hit Wizards, there are enough Dark wizards to require a dedicated force to oppose them. Most aren't revolutionaries in the way Grindlewald and Voldemort were, but that may simply be because the power gap prevents them from even trying. The only wizards we know are close to that level of power were Bellatrix and Amelia Bones, so it's pretty rare.
