Which is what I was sort of wondering about in this whole post to be honest. If you see my response to [[/u/Achille-Talon][u/Achille-Talon]], I pointed out that it seems likely that dark wizards or revolutionaries rise more frequently than we are made aware of in canon. I will restate my earlier point below:

  On a similar note, revolutionaries or terrorist leaders today and in the past have generally been highly educated, literate, and well-versed controlling people, while they are generally followed by the unruly, thuggish, or the "proletariat." Since intellect and knowledge also translates in the magical world to being the most powerful/skilled in a lot of cases, there is the double attraction of followers to the fact that these revolutionaries are also the most powerful. It seems likely that most powerful wizards or witches, unless their is someone who far outclasses them, end up in positions of either authority over others or attempting to gain power through alternate means.

  I suppose thats the reason nobody but Voldemort rose to power in the wake of Grindelwald's play for power. Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Voldemort so outclass anyone else that nobody would try to change the way things are. Their like magical versions of tactical nukes: if they exist, the world invariably has to follow/obey them /unless/ you have your own to oppose them.

The gist being that the last fifty years before canon are a period of unnatural peace in their world, because these three so overmatched their opposition there was no point in other powerful wizards/witches attempting to gain power and/or influence the world.
