I would say we see 3, maybe 4 very powerful wizards in the 55 years from 1945-2000. Voldemort, Grindelwald, Albus, and Harry.

Albus, Gellert, and Voldemort are all very powerful. Voldemort and Grindelwald certainly fullfill the Dark Lord requirement, Albus we don't know for sure, but considering the incredible amount of power he wields it certainly can be argued he was at the very least a "Lord".

Harry essentially has Britain on its knees at the end of Book 7. He could very easily follow in the footsteps of Dumbledore securing political power for decades to come.

4 very influential wizards in 50 years certainly points to the fact that this is common. To respond to [[/u/Achille-Talon/][u/Achille-Talon/]] we only see a "few" from canon as canon is from the POV is Harry. He is far from a historian.

A key thing to remember: These wizards we see are only ones that affect Britain, not the magic world as a whole.
