Its possible that Grindelwald was the first Dark Wizard to demonstrate the ambition to take over the world, and gain significant traction in said goal, while Voldemort outclassed him in depravity. While Voldemort appeared to keep his ambitions limited to Britain, he also used far more of the twisted side of the Dark Arts (Horcruxes, Inferi, everything *around* the Horcruxes, etc.)

Grindelwald was an ideological revolutionary, Voldemort was a power hungry terrorist, all previous Dark Wizards in history were more like serial killers or warlords.
