Well, it all depends on your definition of "dark wizardry." If it is use of dark magic, then literally everyone who made it through Hogwarts is a dark wizard/witch. This is absurd, so it would be those who use the Dark Arts. So it depends on how common the Dark Arts are. I'd guess that the number of dark witches/wizards we see in canon are probably how many there may be at a given time, but what makes them so different is how they have rallied to Voldemort's banner, as it were.
