I believe that there were quite a few, but that the wizarding world likes to forget about them and tries to downplay their power and impact in their history books.

IIRC voldemort is called the most powerful dark wizard of all time, and he seems to be on par with Dumbledore, so that's quite a lot of power indeed, but I can't help thinking that there must have been dozens of wizards on or above Dumbledore's level over the past millennia, and some of them were probably dark/evil. In terms of political power, Voldemort never expanded outside Great Britain, and even there he used terrorist style attacks and imperiused ministry workers instead of risking open war. Grindelwald's campaign in mainland Europe on the other hand was called a "global wizarding war" and it is probably safe to assume that Grindelwald and his followers heavily influenced WW2. While the number of Grindelwald's followers is unknown, they are regularly called an "army", and dominated Europe for quite some time. Compare that to about 30 death eaters Voldemort brought to the battle of Hogwarts.

I think it would make sense for people to forget about dark wizards that came long before them, and most of them wouldn't have involved Great Britain anyways. Voldemort happened in very recent history, every British non-muggleborn wizard alive either experienced his reign of terror or had parents who did. The extraordinary cruelty of Voldemort and his followers probably helped creating the image of an all-powerful Dark Lord.
