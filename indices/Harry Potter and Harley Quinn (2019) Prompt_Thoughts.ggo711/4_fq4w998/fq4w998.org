Wadiwasi needs more of a... morbid twist to it. Bertie Botts Beans... Yeah! The fandom/wiki page for the spell says it has the force of a bullet. A jellybean would hit pretty hard at those speeds. Imagine the autopsy report... "Victim was shot in the nose, leading directly to the brain. Projectile turned out to be a... jelly bean? Mass spec results confirm a lobster... flavored... jellybean? I will have the test redone to confirm..."

  No 'Master of Death' cop-outs, unless his magically brain-damaged brain believes he does

It would be funny for him to think he's actually the "Master of Death". Picture him using the stone to mess with someone like [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2uCbXUmpZY][Keep Summer Safe]] (Rick and Morty, NSFW: violence). It would require advanced scheming though... Run from Batman, lead him down crime alley and as they pass the "spot", summon Martha and Thomas Wayne.
