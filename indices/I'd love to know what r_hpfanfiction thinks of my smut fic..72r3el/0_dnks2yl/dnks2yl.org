I think you could work on some of the spelling and punctuation. Unbreakable Vowel, for example, should be Unbreakable Vow. Otherwise, the fic wasn't personally to my tastes. It was somewhat cathartic to read at the beginning, but degradation like that has never been something I was really into.

I also think that there should really have a dubcon warning, because though Ginny and Harry are married, there are still some non-consensual elements when she got his, ah, donation.

This section gets a little bit explicit, so I will 'advise caution' to the younger people of the subreddit:

As for the sex scenes... I'll be honest, I'm no expert on writing smut. I prefer to avoid that. Not to mention I don't really like the Harry/Ginny pairing. But please don't ever write 'her flower bloomed in front of him'. I'm not even sure what that's supposed to mean. Euphemisms like that always make me cringe--though it surely isn't as bad as that one fic I read that called a vagina a 'honey pot', and the clitoris 'a love bud'. Maybe there are people who don't mind that. But I personally find it very off-putting. If you mean vagina, just say it. Or pussy, cunt, whatever. So long as it's not something like 'blooming flower', which just reminds me of Cersei saying 'flowering' as an euphemism for menstruation.

Another thing is that I think the sex scenes could be a little more sensual. On this part I may be a little biased because of my dislike for the Harry/Ginny pairing, but the smut felt kind of mechanical to me.

Oh, and, this is not really related to the fic. I was just really uncomfortable with the use of 'faggot'. If it was intended as a derogatory comment towards homosexual individuals, maybe slap a warning in the tags.

P.S. Can we get this thread tagged NSFW?
