Harry was enjoying the view in park near his loving home in Surrey. He suddenly felt dreadful and air turned colder than winter. He looked arpund frantically for the source and saw two dark robed figures approaching him. He knows then and there that his life was forfeit. He cursed his stupid uncle who locked away his wand under the cupboard.

Both dementors held him in his place and pulled their hoods and kissed him on his lips to suck away his soul. But suddenly the dementor pulled away like it got electric shock.

Both dementors were on their knees in front him.

"My Lord Potter-Black-Azkaban-Gryffindore-Slytherin.....and other 500 useless titles. Please forgive us. We don't know it was you, My Lord."

Harry was shocked at the sudden turn of events. He no longer felt fear and despair. It took him few moments to gather himself.

"What do you mean by My Lord?" asked Harry.

"What do you mean by that, My Lord? Don't you know that you're Lord Potter.....-Apple-Microsoft-Instagram?? Your magical guardian should tell you this on your 11th birthday." asked dementor-1 with confusion

"No. No one ever told me. What does this means? Who is my magical guardian?"

"We need to go to gringotts my Lord. They know everything about everything and nothing. They will help you. After all you're Lord Potter-...-Mouse-Keyboard." replied dementor-2 with anger in it's voice that someone deliberately kept this information away from it's young Lord. They were gonna pay for it.

---Scene Break----

A trip to Gringotts later. He was 100 times richer than entire North American economy and owns 2/3rd of the Earth. His magical core was now bigger than black hole.

---Scene Break---

"Harry my boy. It was for GREATER GOOD that you should give away your titles and marry Ginevra." said Dumbledore in his grand fathwrly voice and twinkling eyes.

"That's Lord Potter-....-Lipstick-MakeupKit to you, old geezer." replied Hadrian Potter. Dumbledore was shocked at this. He didn't know that Potters were related to Lemondrop family. He couldn't do anything. He was completely powerless against Lemondrop family.

---War---

Dementors kissed everyone except Daphne Greengrass and Neville Longbottom. All others were traitors.

---The End---
