The Dumbledore bashers will probably tell you that it was because Dumbledore knew all about the Dursleys and wanted to...I don't know, prove a point or something?

But I think it's more likely that it was just an automated system going out of control. Perhaps the system can detect when letters are destroyed so it can send a new one. Owls aren't perfect after all, so sometimes accidents happen. Maybe the designer thought "If the owl didn't make it to the student, it's probably because they have a particularly vicious kneazle. We'd better send two owls this time to make sure one gets through." Then exponential growth happens and the Dursleys are flooded with letters.
