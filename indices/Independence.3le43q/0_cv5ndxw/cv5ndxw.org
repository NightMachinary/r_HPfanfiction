Thank you for establishing this community and for allowing it to grow into its own. I'm sure many of us already visit the [[/r/harrypotter]] pages and we'll welcome anyone interested in seeing what other writers have done with JK Rowling's world.

Hopefully we'll point them towards the better ones, but no promises.
