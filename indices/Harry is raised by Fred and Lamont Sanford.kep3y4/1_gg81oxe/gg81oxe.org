Given it's Britain, [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057785/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1][Albert and Harold Steptoe]] are more likely (they were the inspiration for Sanford and Son). However, as that series is too early, perhaps it would be Harold and his son, instead. I can still hear Harold saying, "Why, you dirty old man!"
