I actually enjoy that trope (and the "Dursleys go to Japan" one for anime crosses). It was more of a "why would you need to take Harry to be raised by US junkmen when there are quite satisfactory British junkmen available" question.

For a while, Norman Lear had a habit of making successful US versions of popular British comedies ("All in the Family" was another one he "borrowed"), but he's not the only one. Related, I find it amusing that the Japanese show that America's Funniest Home Videos was inspired by only lasted about 6 years, while the US show has been on the air for more than 30.
