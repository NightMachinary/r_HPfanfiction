There are two things about within a fanfiction that can make or break a story for me, but anyone can fix easily: spelling and grammar. The author may be weaving the most amazing story, but that won't matter if I don't make it to the second chapter because the author keeps mixing up their theirs and theres, and continually miss spells words making it seem like it was written by a preteen who's failing English.

I also really dislike when HP fanfic authors have the clearly English characters refer to their mothers as "mom" instead of "mum". However, I recently learned that the US editions switched a lot of British colloquial out for US equivalents leading a lot of kids to believe that mom was the correct British term, so I just have to get over myself on that one.
