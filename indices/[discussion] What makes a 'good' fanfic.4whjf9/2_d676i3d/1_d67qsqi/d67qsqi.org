I agree that poor SPaG is very offputting. And I do notice and dislike Americanisms in HP fanfiction - but I don't believe it has any effect on popularity because most of the readers are from the US and don't notice them. I recently looked at a very popular story (thousands of reviews) that in the second or third paragraph referred to the 'Fall' term at Hogwarts.
