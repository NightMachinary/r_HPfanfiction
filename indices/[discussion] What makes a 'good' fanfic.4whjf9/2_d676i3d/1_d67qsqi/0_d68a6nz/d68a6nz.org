You're right that Americanisms don't seem to affect popularity of stories much. Afterall, I watched enough American TV programming as a kid that it takes me a while to notice Fall vs Autumn. But I wasn't talking about popularity (it's very hard to pin down), mearly what makes a 'good' fanfiction in my opinion.

If you have an American character then their use of Americanisms would be natural. Having them use "mum" would be weird. But I think if your fiction is set in a specific country and your characters are from there, then using the local terms in their dialogue and making sure they celebrate the right national holidays is important. I once read a fanfic where Harry and co were celebrating Thanksgiving at Hogwarts like it happened every year. Things like that really annoy me, is all.
