It will be, I'm afraid. People tend to come to fanfic because they want something familiar. When you're more established and have built up a bit of a following, it's then far easier to have an OC led fic. I have a fic that is led by Harry and an OC, but prior to that I wrote a DH from Ginny's point of view fic and various one shots with familiar and we'll loved characters. I think if I had started with my current fic it would have been completely ignored. Maybe knock out a few one shots or short stories to let people see that you're a good writer, and that it will be worth their time to read about an OC.
