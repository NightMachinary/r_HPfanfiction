I'm the same. I actually don't read much fanfic because I'm so picky.

I have written an OC though. And, as you pointed out, I didn't want her to be the only main character so I wrote her to complement Harry. I think a majority of people are coming to Harry Potter fanfiction to read and write about Harry, or at least another major character. A bunch of OCs means you have to take a lot of time to emotionally invest, with no guarantee it will be worth it at the end.
