Yeah, I'm guilty of completely disregarding any story that has an OC as the main character. This is personally for two reasons:

1) I generally read fanfiction to see the characters in that universe take on new and exciting challenges. Not a new character take on that universe.

2) I have seen a lot of OC's that either aren't well fleshed out, are super OP, or some combination of the two. I guess it has just left a bad taste in my mouth.

But I have also seen some OC's that avoid the pitfalls of the second bullet, while simultaneously complementing a main character from the universe. I thoroughly enjoy stories that manage to accomplish this, but they are so few and far between that I don't feel it is worth the effort to wade through all of fics that don't meet my tastes.
