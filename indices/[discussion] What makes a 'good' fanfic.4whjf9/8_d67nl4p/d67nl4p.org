In my opinion, a good fanfic first needs good planning.

One aspect is the speed of events. There are fics, that are so fast-paced, as reader you lose sight of what's happening. Then there are stories, that focus a whole chapter on each day. That's alright if your overall plot is about a short time or it's an important time, but if - let's say - you want to write a story about the seven years in Hogwarts and spend 100 chapters on the first two years, readers might lose interest, especially if not too much is happening and you describe lunch with five paragraphs.

Another thing is the overall plot. As writer, you gotta plan roughly, how many chapters you are planning and vaguely the content. I have read fics, where the author clearly planned the first eight chapters and then the plot takes a sharp turn because he had no plans for the ninth chapter.

If the planning is done well, the quality can't be too bad, assuming you have some talent for writing in general and your plot isn't ridiculous.
