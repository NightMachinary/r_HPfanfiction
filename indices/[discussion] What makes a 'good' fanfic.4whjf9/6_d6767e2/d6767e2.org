As a reader I want something to jump out at me. A time travel story with Colin Creevey is more likely capture my interest than another do over with Harry. A writer need to question "has this been done before." If it has been, do you have the skill and style to overshadow the others? I agree with the people who said a bit of mystery is important, the info dump will cause me to lose interest pretty quickly. I like stories that show me a different side of a character, or answer a question I didn't know I had. For example, the story "The Little ones" describes what happens at Kings Cross during years 7.

The Prefects Portrait touched on magical portraits of course, but also how being muggleborn is culture shock.
