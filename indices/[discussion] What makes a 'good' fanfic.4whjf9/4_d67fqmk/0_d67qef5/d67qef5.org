'Someone somewhere once said that you have to have written....I think it was 300,000 words before you could be considered a good writer'

I'd have thought more than that even.

Well, I use the word 'failed' as there doesn't seem to be another way of putting it without being disingenuous. I started writing my first story just over two years ago and started posting it a few months later. Since then I've been on a steep learning curve and archived about 200k words on ffn across four completed multichapters and some one-shots. I honestly don't think what I've done is altogether shit. It's certainly not great literature and there are a few things I wish I'd done differently, but on the whole I quite like them still. They just aren't what most fanfic readers are looking for.
