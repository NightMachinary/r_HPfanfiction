I think there's been a lot of good advice said so far (especially that good and popular are not one in the same), but I think there is a lot to be said about practice.

You say that you're a failed fanfiction writer. You've only failed if you've given up. I don't know how long you've been writing, but I get the feeling that you might be a newer writer (I apologize if I am wrong in that regard.) Nearly all writers suck and fail early on. I've been writing HP fanfiction for a LONG time and the early fanfics that I wrote were absolute shit. You can't even find them anywhere (at least I hope so). But those early fics of mine were so important to my development as a writer.

I would recommend: 1. Not giving up 2. Keep writing 3. Find a beta/editor (or even a few!) I would also not worry so much about writing something that is popular. Write what interests you.

And don't forget: Practice, practice, practice. (Someone somewhere once said that you have to have written....I think it was 300,000 words before you could be considered a good writer)
