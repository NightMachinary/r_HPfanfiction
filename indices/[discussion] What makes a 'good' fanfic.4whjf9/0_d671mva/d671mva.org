  So does being a good fanfic writer translate into being a good writer of original fiction?

Absolutely not. Being a good fiction author translates well into fanfiction, but not vice versa.

I think fanfiction that is popular (I want to stress that there are objective marks of quality that make good fiction what it is, that /most/ Most Favorited fanfictions do not meet), is fanfiction that hits the nerve of a particular part of the fandom or even its entirety with the right inputs to kickstart their own imagination of things.

I think a lot of readers on FFN look frantically for confirmation of their own fanon. If you can satisfy this need, you get a lot of readers.

I'm sure this isn't even close to all factors, but I feel it is a huge one.
