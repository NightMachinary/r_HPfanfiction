I'm sure there are hundreds of different things people can come up with. But for me, I always appreciate a story that a) doesn't treat me like I'm an idiot and b) doesn't lay everything out right away

So what I mean by that is:

a) Learn the art of subtlety. You don't have to outline every single feeling. Readers can read between the lines. If someone says something in sarcasm, you don't have to add "he said sarcastically". In fact, just get rid of adverbs altogether. For me, they break immersion because they are the opposite of subtle. Basically, just leave more to the imagination.

b) This second point is especially true for AU stories. If there's a divergence in canon, you don't have to spend the entire first chapter outlining all the differences. Give it some time, give the reader some mystery. And only point out differences when it makes sense to in the story. For example, Harry isn't going to meet someone on the train to Hogwarts and share his whole life story to them. Nobody does that. We share things with each other bit by bit. Don't worry about the reader not getting the whole picture right away. That's fine. It even becomes more engaging that way.

The same is true for new characters. This is one of the reasons I think most people don't like OCs. You get their whole back story before you even grow to actually care about them when it should, in fact, be the opposite.

Anyway, these are just two points, but there are so many other things that go into making a good story. Basically though, just remember. Less is more.
