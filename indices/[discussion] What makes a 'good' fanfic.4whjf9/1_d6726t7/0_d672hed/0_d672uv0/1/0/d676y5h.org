This is a good example of a fic that is long enough to carry out its mission. Most fan fiction is written without a story in mind or one that is vaguely outlined. And so the filler parts and poorly executed turns seem just like that, poorly executed filler.

Another good point about categorize is that it's length doesn't make the lack of style grating. If you take a look you'll see that the fix is written in the past tense and is in passive voice, yet it doesn't seem flat because it is full of substance, short and doesn't beat around the bush.

To summarize - if you want to write a better Fanfic, write it only so long as it needs to be, defining all of your good ideas well, and omitting anything that you see as weak or not worthwhile. Have a good story, write it well. Probably not much help but it seems to be the rarest sort of fic.
