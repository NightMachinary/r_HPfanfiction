Oh yes, that's firmly on my favourites already. In fact it was reading that and her other stories that turned me on to fanfiction, while simultaneously making me feel I was wasting my time writing it. There aren't many stories of that calibre though.

And another thing I can say about that is about a year ago I reported a user for plagiarising that story (I never report for anything else). They had changed the character names and listed in in another fandom. It had only gathered a few reviews - less than ten I think - over a few weeks, so it seems it's not enough to be good; time and place (metaphorically speaking) is important too.
