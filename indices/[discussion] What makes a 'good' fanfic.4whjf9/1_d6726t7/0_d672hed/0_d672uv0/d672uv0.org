The thing is, as others have mentioned, there's often a difference between popular fics and good fics (unfortunately). But I can tell you that the truly good fics I've read have mastered this art. And while they may not have 1000 reviews, the reviews they do have are the quality kind. And I think 1 quality review beats 100 'update soon' reviews any day.

If you want a good example of subtlety, I would recommend the one-shot linkffn(Cauterize). Funnily enough, this one actually does have 1000+ reviews.
