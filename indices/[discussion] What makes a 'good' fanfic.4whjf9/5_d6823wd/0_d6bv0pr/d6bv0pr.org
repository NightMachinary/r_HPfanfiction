  The fanfiction should be able to stand on its own feet. So, for example, if you're writing an OotP AU and you introduce occlumency, since it hasn't appeared in the first four books from which your story continues, you should fully introduce the concept as if your reader has never heard of it before.

No thanks. Most people reading FF have I imagine been bored to death by reintroducing the sames concepts. I'd rather have the explication scene suggested rather than narrated.
