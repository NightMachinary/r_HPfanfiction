Factors I consider objective (i.e. universal regardless of taste):

- No errors in spelling, grammar, punctuation and formatting is a minimum requirement for being considered good. (Will forgive one or two typos, no one can catch everything)

- The fanfiction should be able to stand on its own feet. So, for example, if you're writing an OotP AU and you introduce occlumency, since it hasn't appeared in the first four books from which your story continues, you should fully introduce the concept as if your reader has never heard of it before.

- Consistency in character abilities and actions. There's nothing more frustrating than characters making uncharacteristic decisions or temporarily gaining/losing abilities just for the sake of shoehorning a certain plotline.

- Dynamic characters with believable motivations, desires, plans and actions. These characters should exhibit the ability to change and learn. They should not make arbitrarily stupid decisions or assumptions just so that your protagonist can have an easy victory over them.

- Conflict. The protagonist must face some kind of challenge with a real risk (or actuality) or loss.

- Dialogue that is realistic (i.e. with identifiable character voices, featuring elements of real conversation such as interruptions and tangents) without being actually real (real conversation is too unfocused, the story needs conversation to drive the plot/characterisation somewhere substantial).

- One major plot/characterisation point per chapter.

- A plot structure that has a clear beginning, middle and end, that doesn't dawdle or meander.

- Descriptions that know how to leave most of the scene to the reader's imagination to fill in the gaps.

- Progress. Things should not stay the same for a large part of the story. People, or the situation, should be changing.

Non-objective factors:

- Factual canon compliance, where "canon" means book canon.

- Tonal canon compatibility, where canon means the original 7 books.

- Harry-centric with a pro-active Harry whose best traits are emphasised.

- Set at Hogwarts.

- No crack.

- No Muggle wank.
