eh hows that one work out? It seems to be a sidexside crossover... I find those... really weird and not very good.

My crossover categorizing system:\\
Side x Side crossovers: Konoha and Hogwarts are both places that exist. Just hidden from each other and everyone else too. I find it rather... clumsy.\\
Ancient History crossover: One of the worlds came long ago, and their time has long since passed. But someone has rediscovered their historic abilities. These I like. The immortal Naruto or Harry helping/mentoring his counterpart I like too.\\
Imaginary Crossover: The other world never existed, except in the fantasy of an author/mangaka. But chakra/magic can be induced to... mutate... under certain conditions, when a child is young enough. I love these the most.
