  When Harry Potter didn't show up for the Hogwarts sorting, his family was enraged, the twin to the boy who lived was gone from the Dursleys. Years later, they found him, well his students found them! Turns out Harry is now a Ninja and it a Genin Teacher to 6 Genins that he trained personally! :Nem way of Writing: T for Safety HAITUS SORRY
