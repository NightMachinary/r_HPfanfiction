Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): Harry stops going to classes to only receive combat training from special trainers

The Prisoner's Cipher linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): AU after 5th year, Harry trained by Dumbledore outside school, told through memories

Ectomancer (sort of) linkffn(Ectomancer): you have to read this one to find out

Deprived linkffn(Deprived by Crimson Lord): WBWL, ignored by parents, Harry went off to become something like a magical bounty hunter. Tropey but mildly entertaining fic.
