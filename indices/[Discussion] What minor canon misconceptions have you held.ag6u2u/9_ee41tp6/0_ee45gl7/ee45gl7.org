I don't think we see any evidence of Harry cooking breakfast every day, just taking over the bacon when Petunia is busy with Dudleys birthday, which doesn't seem unreasonable for a ten year old to do (ignoring all the other stuff). We also see Petunia preparing grapefruit for breakfast in GOF.

I do agree that the Dursleys abused Harry, but I think OP is correct in saying that fanon often escalates this.
