Your points about the cupboard and misconceptions about it are fair, but the Dursleys were abusing Harry. Their treatment of him fit basically all the characteristics of emotional abuse towards children:

#+begin_quote
  Emotional abuse is the ongoing emotional maltreatment of a child. It's sometimes called psychological abuse and can seriously damage a child's emotional health and development. Emotional abuse can involve deliberately trying to scare or humiliate a child or isolating or ignoring them. Children who are emotionally abused are often suffering another type of abuse or neglect at the same time -- but this isn't always the case. (NSPCC)

This also includes stuff like expectations inappropriate for the age or developmental stage of a child (like a 10 year old being responsible for cooking breakfast every day, and being shamed for making slight mistakes). And ignoring (even partaking in) persistent bullying. And at times they deny Harry food, they literally lock him in his room when he's 12, and they gaslight him through his entire childhood. That's abuse. And it's more than hinted at signs of physical abuse, like Vernon strangling Harry when he's 15, Petunia throwing a frying pan at him, and Dudley and his friends beating him up throughout his childhood with no interference.
