Fun fact - a lot of characters (including Sirius and Remus) were aged up visually in the films in order to keep consistent with their age in relation to Snape, as Alan Rickman was basically the perfect fit for the character but was about 25 years too old for the character - being 55 at the filming of Philosophers Stone when his character was only 31.
