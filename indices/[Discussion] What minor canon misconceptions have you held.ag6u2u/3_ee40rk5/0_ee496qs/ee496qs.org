I grew up in the 90s, and I've gotten plenty of whacks from my parents when I was being a little shit, but they certainly never swung frying pans at me, or locked me in cupboards for weeks, or starved me as punishment. I've also never had dogs set on me as Harry did when he was 7 or so when Marge came to visit. I've always had 3-4 full meals a day, unlike the one bowl of shit Harry got for the summer when he turned 12.

The worst punishment (to a 13 yo me) I'd seen was my neighbour's for screwing up his studies - he was told to sit outside in his verandah and read up on everything he gotten wrong, however long it took. He was to eat only once he'd finished studying. That was the strictest form of punishment I'd seen, ever.

So yeah, don't try and excuse the Dursleys' abuse of Harry by saying that it happened in a different decade - they were vile filth.
