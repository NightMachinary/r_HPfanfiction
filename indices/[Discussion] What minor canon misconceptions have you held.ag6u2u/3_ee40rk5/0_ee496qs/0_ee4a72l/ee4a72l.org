I'm not making an excuse for the Dursleys. I've already answered another comment about this. They abused him yes, but not to the extent Fanon portrays.

I've seen fics where they say Harry was made to always sit on the floor (when in fact there's a scene where he squeezes between Vernon and Dudley in the couch and even eats with them at the table), nearly beaten to death, raped and sometimes even things like he was made to stay in the cupboard without any trips to the bathroom and so he shit himself in his bed. That's too outrageous than what was mentioned in canon.
