I very much think you're underestimating the size of the cupboard.

It's large enough that Vernon can enter- he has to squeeze through the door, but there is no mention of him- a very large man- having to crouch, being unable to stand, or move around in. And this is with Harry and his bed- yes he had an actual bed- also in there.

Basically people think of something the size of a small closest, when really it's a very small room. That's not to say it's acceptable! Maybe if they were otherwise in poverty it'd be a best of a bad situation type thing, but no they have an unused guestroom and Dudley has two rooms.

Really the abuse here I think is more emotional- the size isn't really acceptable but people get by on less, it's the fact that he could have his own real room but they won't let him, that they consider him as being less worthy than Dudley's trash, that's the real abuse.
