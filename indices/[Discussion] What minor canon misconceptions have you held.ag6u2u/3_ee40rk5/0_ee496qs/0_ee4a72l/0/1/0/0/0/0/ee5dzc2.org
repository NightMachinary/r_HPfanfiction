I mean, the solitary confinement room has a bathroom within it. I don't think JKR meant to imply Harry couldn't even leave to go to the bathroom (I believe he does have to ask though, during book 2, so that they can shut him back in his room afterwards.) The deal was they just couldn't catch you milling about or trying to do anything outside your room.

It was considered effective back when I was younger because all the really fun things, like television, phone, majority of the toys, the family computer or gaming console if you had one, snacks, bookcase, etc, were usually located in the living or family room.
