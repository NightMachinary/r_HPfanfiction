If you read between the lines, we can see that what JKR meant was that Harry was grounded. Which meant he had to stay in his cupboard whenever he was at home. He wasn't kept away from school. Now, that would have been bad.

Yes, there are instances when the Dursleys took it too far. But what we see in fanfiction would have traumatized him too badly to grow up to be a hero who finished off Voldemort.
