  But, as I understand it, grounding is supposed to be something like restricted playing or TV or whatever it is kids usually enjoy

Grounding can also include having a child stay in their room for a certain period of time.

  there is a big difference between telling a child he can't watch TV or play games for the next couple of weeks and locking him inside a cupboard for a couple of weeks as punishment - the two things are incomparable.

Exactly. Harry doesn't have friends or isn't allowed to watch TV even on normal days. So it isn't sufficient punishment according to the Dursleys. And like I said earlier, he wasn't locked 24/7. He did leave his room to go to school.

  Canon does a pretty terrible job at portraying his abuse. A child who is subjected to all that Harry is won't be as headstrong or as trusting of anyone as canon Harry is.

I have to disagree. I've seen instances of a mother (my neighbour) throwing a rolling pin at her daughter (my classmate) during some tantrum of hers and bruising her. She was around twelve then. She probably cried for a day, but then they forgot and moved on. They're pretty tight even to this day and she loves her daughter fiercely. This was an incident in a loving family.

Harry's only problem then is that he wasn't loved by his family. While that influences his selfless nature, I have no reason to believe that Harry would lose his core values because of it. This can also be attributed to a phenomenon prevalent today. People think even slight abuse would totally cripple a person's life. While it can be true in some cases, there are people who are much more resilient than that. Since the beginning of the story, Harry's pretty detached from his family. He isn't feeling pathetic or sad that he isn't loved or trying hard to please his aunt and uncle like a normal child would.

Stories aren't about ordinary people, but rather people with extraordinary qualities. Harry's greatest quality is that his loveless home life hasn't in any way affected his ability to love. That's why he's the protagonist. We wouldn't want to read about a weakling now, would we?

  The finishing off Voldemort part - canon does the most gimmicky job of that possible

I'll admit, that was a bit of a bummer. It was cool when I read it at 17 though.
