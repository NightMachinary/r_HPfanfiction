Lol what. Lots of children's books contain death, and gruesome death to boot. Have you ever read /The Rats of Nimh/? /A Wrinkle in Time/? /Number the Stars/? /Watership Down/, /Where the Red Fern Grows/, etc? Any of the children's books out there that have won Caldecott and Newberry medals? There's loads of fantastic children's books that deal with disturbing material amazingly.

Maybe I'm just a lucky child but we had a "library" class when I was in elementary school and my librarian always encouraged me to read the more intense literature. All, again, still considered children's books.

Not to mention old fairy tales usually end in gruesome death, and up until recently a lot of popular children's tales were cautionary and ended in the death of the errant child. Even in Disney films, the Huns get stuck with arrows and drown in an avalanche, the witch in Cinderalla falls off a cliff, Ursula I believe gets stabbed. 101 Dalmatians was about how a woman wanted to /kill puppies to make clothes./

This is literally all off the top of my head. Children's literature is so important and I won't have you devalue it even if it's just a dumb internet argument.

What did /you/ experience as a kid that this is all apparently insane to you?
