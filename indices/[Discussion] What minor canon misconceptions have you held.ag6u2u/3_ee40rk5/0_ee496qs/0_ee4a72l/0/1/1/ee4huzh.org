  we can see that what JKR meant was that Harry was grounded

The whole idea of being grounded is foreign to me - I never had those things, nor was anyone I knew growing up ever grounded. We were usually disciplined on the spot for our trouble-making.

But, as I understand it, grounding is supposed to be something like restricted playing or TV or whatever it is kids usually enjoy - but Harry has no friends to play with, and Harry isn't allowed to watch what he wants on TV since Vernon and Dudley hog it most of the time, so it's no great loss to him.

Also, there is a big difference between telling a child he can't watch TV or play games for the next couple of weeks and locking him inside a cupboard for a couple of weeks as punishment - the two things are incomparable.

  But what we see in fanfiction would have traumatized him too badly to grow up to be a hero who finished off Voldemort.

Canon does a pretty terrible job at portraying his abuse. A child who is subjected to all that Harry is won't be as headstrong or as trusting of anyone as canon Harry is. He also won't stand up for random strangers like Harry does for Neville in the remembrall incident, or going to the bathroom to warn Hermione in the troll incident.

The finishing off Voldemort part - canon does the most gimmicky job of that possible. Voldemort is not killed because of anyone's courage, skill or plans - he's killed because of sheer dumb luck and a lot of Deus Ex Machina plot, because at the end of the day, HP will always remain a more modern fairy tale. A more realistic take would have nearly all the protagonists getting killed at various points in the series.
