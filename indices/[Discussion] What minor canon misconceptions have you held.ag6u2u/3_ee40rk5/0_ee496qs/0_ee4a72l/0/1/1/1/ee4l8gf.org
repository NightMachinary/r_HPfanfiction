Sometimes I really wish you people would just calm the fuck down. Harry Potter started out as a children's book and is often written in a comical and exaggerated way especially in the beginning. Trying to dissemble it in some ways is just a disservice to the book and to yourselves, you might as well start to talk about how unrealistic it is for people to have magic and decide the books are horrible as I know some people who hate unrealistic stories would do. Why would you do that? And with so much passion, too?
