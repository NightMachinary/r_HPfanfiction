  They're pretty tight even to this day and she loves her daughter fiercely. This was an incident in a loving family.

This is the distinction you ought to make here - in the case of your friend's family, it was actually a loving family and the rolling pin thing was a one-off incident. If the rolling pin were a semi-regular occurrence, there wouldn't be much love present, right? In Harry's case, it's the direct opposite. There's no affection anywhere (as a child, Harry is called Freak every once in a while), and we see enough incidents from canon to see that Petunia swinging frying pans might not have been a one-off thing.

  I have no reason to believe that Harry would lose his core values because of it People think even slight abuse would totally cripple a person's life. While it can be true in some cases, there are people who are much more resilient than that

Now you're saying that his inherent qualities are things that can never change, no matter what happens, as though he was born with those qualities and that experience can have no effect on them. I mean, yes, there are people who are inherently good despite of their horrible upbringing, but there are just as many who have been twisted by their struggles in early life. The abuse that Harry undergoes isn't slight either - ten years of being told he's a burden, that his parents were worthless drunks, of the Dursleys' general disdain and contempt towards him - all of that has to leave a mark, but the only way canon does that is to make him incredibly reckless and brash, along with a twisted idea of what affection and love mean.

  Since the beginning of the story, Harry's pretty detached from his family. He isn't feeling pathetic or sad that he isn't loved or trying hard to please his aunt and uncle like a normal child would.
#+end_quote

In the beginning, he dreams of a future where a long lost family member would come and rescue him from his hell, but by the time he's 11, he's let go of that fantasy. This implies a certain amount of detachment, but it vanishes the moment he steps foot on the Hogwarts Express.

  Harry's greatest quality is that his loveless home life hasn't in any way affected his ability to love

I'm going to have to disagree. Canon HP has no idea what love is. He thinks Snape's twisted obsession with Lily was love, he was that deluded. Even after everything Snape and Albus do to him to screw his life over, he values their input enough to walk to his death. After all the lies and deceit of Albus and Severus, he names his second child after two of his greatest tormentors (who he thinks are great men). Sorry, but no - canon HP has an incredibly warped idea of love.
