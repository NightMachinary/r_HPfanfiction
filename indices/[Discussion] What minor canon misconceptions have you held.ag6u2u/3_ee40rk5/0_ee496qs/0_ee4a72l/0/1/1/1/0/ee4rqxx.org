And sometimes, I wish idiots with nothing particular to contribute would butt out of discussions, but sadly, that rarely happens. Since you're probably confused, I'll elaborate - violent character death and torture are generally not a part of any children's books I'm aware of. In the very first book, we see a man being burned alive. The very next book, we have a little girl possessed into unleashing a giant serpent on a school, along with enormous man eating spiders. The next one, we have soul sucking demons.

Not sure which children's book you read had deadly situations as such an integral part of its storyline.

So please, don't give the BS children's book excuse like that somehow rights things.
