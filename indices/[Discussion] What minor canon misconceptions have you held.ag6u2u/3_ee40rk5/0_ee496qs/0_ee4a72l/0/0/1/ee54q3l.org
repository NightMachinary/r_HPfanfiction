Wow. Never had someone go to down to the very date before.

  The 23rd June 1991 was a Sunday. I'm assuming that in the Potter world, Dudley's birthday took place on a Saturday so his birthday trip could proceed as planned

Why? Zoos do open on Sundays, and Saturdays are generally working days (Vernon wouldn't be available).

  I can tell you that primary schools tend to break up around the 23rd of June for summer holidays. Since Harry and Dudley's primary school had obviously not broken up prior to Dudley's birthday it is very likely that they broke up in the coming week, likely not even going the full week, but instead ending on something like a Wednesday

I'll be the first to admit I have no idea regarding the holidays for primary schools in the UK. In my country, our summer holidays used to start in mid to late March and end by late May or early June. Ah, the wonders of the tropics...it's hot all year round, but March-June is the hottest.

Your suggestion that it might only have been a week may be right, but PS does say that his punishment was the longest he'd ever had. And judging by the number of things Dudley breaks, it /feels/ a lot more than a week. But then again, kids do have endless energy, so that could be it.
