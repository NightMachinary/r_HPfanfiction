  Why? Zoos do open on Sundays, and Saturdays are generally working days (Vernon wouldn't be available).

Zoos may open on Sundays /now/ - although again, I cannot get my hands on zoo opening times circa the 1990's to double check - however in 1991 shops were still under the auspices of the 1950 Shops act, which mandated that shops close on Sundays but before the 1994 Trading act which allowed some opening on Sundays.

Saturdays are also not generally a working day here, especially not for a director. Maybe if there was an emergency but not otherwise.
