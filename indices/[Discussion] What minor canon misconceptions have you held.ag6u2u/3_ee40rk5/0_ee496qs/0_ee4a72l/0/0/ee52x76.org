I'm not disputing that what the Dursleys did was wrong, however your timeline is rather off.

Dudley was born on the 23rd June. The 23rd June 1991 was a Sunday. I'm assuming that in the Potter world, Dudley's birthday took place on a Saturday so his birthday trip could proceed as planned.

While I cannot find accurate term dates for primary schools in Surrey circa 1991, I can tell you that primary schools tend to break up around the 23rd of June for summer holidays.

Since Harry and Dudley's primary school had obviously not broken up prior to Dudley's birthday it is very likely that they broke up in the coming week, likely not even going the full week, but instead ending on something like a Wednesday. Those final days of school - especially for a child in Year 6, who had already taken the newly introduced SATs - are likely to be comprised mostly of games and other fun things.

If Harry was indeed confined to his cupboard until the summer holidays started and slightly afterwards then it was a maximum of a week.

I'm not claiming that makes it better, since it obviously doesn't.
