  nearly beaten to death

It doesn't take a lot to beat a child to death - a couple of heavy frying pans to the head will do it easily. They set a fucking dog on him when he's 10 - that's enough to kill a child, easily. He's forced to climb and hide in a tree to get away. They don't call the dog off of him and allow him to get down from the tree until midnight. A ten year old falling from a tree can cause broken bones. That would have been real fun, I'm sure.

  sometimes even things like he was made to stay in the cupboard without any trips to the bathroom and so he shit himself in his bed. That's too outrageous than what was mentioned in canon.

The next passage is from PS.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.

  Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day.

Sure, the locking him inside the cupboard without even bathroom breaks is a bit much, but he is locked inside the cupboard for what looks like weeks in Chapter 3. And of course, we know about the many padlocks and the infamous cat-flap from CoS.

When there is such bad treatment in canon, it isn't a stretch to imagine it getting even worse because of accidental magic in Harry's childhood years that takes the abuse to a whole other level.
