That's right. It's exactly why I like the canon portrayal of the Dursleys much better than fanfiction. It also has something to do with the fact that JK wrote it in the 90s when it was much more common to get a smack now and then from your parents and wasn't considered out of the ordinary. I know I got a lot from my parents for being an annoying little shit ðŸ˜‚.

I like stories that can make me feel like it's happening in the 80s and 90s. It adds more realism and immersion for the reader. (I am in no way condoning corporal punishment however).

For me, it has to be how Harry has a bit of fun in class, like when he and Ron are duelling with fake wands that turn into rubber ducks in McGonagall's class I believe (I may have forgotten the minutiae) or when they come up with that rubbish for their Dream Journal in GoF. Or how Harry and Hermione are jokingly debating about Madam Pince's 'affair with Filch' in HBP. Most Fanfiction makes Harry and Hermione a saint who have no idea how to have a fun conversation.

I may be in the minority, but I love to read about teenagers being teenagers (without being douches). That's why I adored canon in the first place.
