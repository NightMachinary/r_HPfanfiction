Sometimes I just can't not say anything when I see people going over the top about Harry being abused by the Dursleys.

Taking a swing with whatever you have in your hands, especially as a mother figure (I will not dispute that Petunia was a horrible mother figure) while doing kitchen choires, especially with a frying pan because mothers are often portrayed as either preparing to cook, cooking, or doing dishes, is something that is really common and often portrayed in a comical way in movies, tv-series, and cartoons. Often they either miss their target or the target does not develop brain damage because it's a running gag, not supposed to represent heavy physical abuse, as I'm quite sure is the case with Petunia taking a swing at Harry.
