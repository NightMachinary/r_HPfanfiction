Just because it's portrayed in a comical way, it doesn't mean it isn't abuse. Like I said, if she actually landed a "heavy blow" on him with a frying pan, he could have actually /died/.

But even if we ignore the obvious signs of physical abuse, it's undeniable that they emotionally abused him. From allowing Marge to insult him and his parents to treating him as an undesirable burden since he was a kid.
