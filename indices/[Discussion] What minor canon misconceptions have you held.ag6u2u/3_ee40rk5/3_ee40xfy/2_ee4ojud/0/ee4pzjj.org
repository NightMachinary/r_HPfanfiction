  Surely this implies that he never gave him a 'good beating'? I imagine that it was a cuff here or there. Not exactly good parenting, but hardly getting beaten to within an inch of his life, like fanon tries to have it.

Surely the mere fact that they threaten to beat him over something like that shows that they were abusive dickheads? I agree that fanfics sometimes exaggerate the abuse, but I personally wouldn't put it past the Dursleys to be mildly physically abusive.
