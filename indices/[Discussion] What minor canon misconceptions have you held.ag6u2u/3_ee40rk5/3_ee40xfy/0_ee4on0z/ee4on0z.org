Your second quote actually shows that they never actually beaten him though, at least until then.

And the first one happens right after Harry pretends to set the garden (and Dudley) on fire. And Dursleys fear magic terribly and for a good reason. I wouldn't count that as abuse.

The real abuse was mental, Harry should have all sorts of emotional problems. But Harry doesn't show any of them in the books, which you can chuck up to tone of the first few books, but I personally like the the idea of Lily's sacrifice protecting Harry.

It's my head canon, I think Harry just felt loved and approved of by his mother, no matter what Dursleys said or did. Like Dumbledore says that Lily's love left a mark on him forever, in his very skin, etc.
