  That's right. It's exactly why I like the canon portrayal of the Dursleys much better than fanfiction. It also has something to do with the fact that JK wrote it in the 90s when it was much more common to get a smack now and then from your parents and wasn't considered out of the ordinary. I know I got a lot from my parents for being an annoying little shit XD.

Aunt Petunia basically tried to hit Harry with a frying pan in CoS. I would say that would count as physical abuse even by the standards of the 90s.

  Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really done magic, but *he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan*Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished. (Chamber of Secrets)

A "heavy blow" at the head with a frying pan can literally kill you.

Also, Vernon implied that they would try to "beat the magic out of him" in PS.

  "Now you listen here, boy,” he [Uncle Vernon] snarled, “I accept there's something strange about you, *probably nothing a good beating wouldn't have cured*---and as far as all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world's better off without them in my opinion---asked for all they got, getting up mixed up with those wizarding types---just what I always expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end---” (Philosopher's Stone)*
