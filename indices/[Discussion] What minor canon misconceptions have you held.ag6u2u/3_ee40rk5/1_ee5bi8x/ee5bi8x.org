As as I agree with you about teenagers being teenagers, the problem in fanfiction (at least in fics I've read), is that authors seems to think that teenagers are all hopped up on excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol. Sure it happens but it's not common amongst private/boarding school types (at least in my experience).
