Have you read "Call Me"? It is a "what if Harry was actually a teenager in the 90s?" post OOTP story. Drinking, trying weed, sex and 90s pop culture.

It's one flaw is that the father of the love interest acts too rational in two scenes, but that's still better than polishing his shotgun while meeting Harry.
