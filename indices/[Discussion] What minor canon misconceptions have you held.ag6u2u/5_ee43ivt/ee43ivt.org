Frankly I think points 1 and 2 demonstrate JKR's fundamental lack of understanding about the sizes of under stairs cupboards.

Generally speaking there are two types of beds for kids. A UK standard single, measuring 90cmx190cm (3ftx6ft) or a toddler's bed which typically start at 70cmx140cm (2.2ftx4.5ft) but can be closer to 80cmx160cm (2.6ftx5.2ft). More importantly, they can be about 50cm (1.6ft) off the floor if they have space under the bed.

Which means that the under the stairs cupboard has to be a /minimum/ of 70cmx140cm. However, given that under the stairs cupboards tend to have a fairly steep gradient because there are stairs above them, the cupboard has to be longer than 140cm so that the height of the bed fits in.

More importantly, I would imagine that getting a bed of any dimension into the cupboard in the first place would basically involve deconstructing and reconstructing it, in whole or in part. Which is much harder than just putting the kid in a room in the first place.

I think that it was one of those things you just write without thinking. Especially given that the first book is very much a kid's book with traditional elements.

In reality, I think a mattress sans bed-frame would work better. They're not that hard to move, you can just throw them in and they can bend to shape.

But I'm just a pedant.
