The only problem I've ever had with it is... where did the cot COME from? Its stupid, and just me getting stuck on the tiny things, but... I just don't see Petunia or Vernon going out to buy one specifically for Harry and... there's something about the idea that they just had one laying around that cracks me up. I doubt they've ever gone camping. Maybe it's just something left over from the Evans' house after Harry grandparents died. Idk it just seems like an odd thing.

My OTHER theory is that... its Dudley's crib mattress on some sort of little platform possibly made out of the rest of the crib. Vernon's apparently surprisingly good with his hands what with the putting bars on the windows and boarding the house up to block letters and all that maybe he rigged something. And, again with the weird little things but... how often was Dudley using it? Petunia probably insisted he sleep with them for years.
