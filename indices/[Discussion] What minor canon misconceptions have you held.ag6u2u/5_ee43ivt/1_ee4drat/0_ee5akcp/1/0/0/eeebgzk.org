Never said I was fine with Harry living under the stairs... just that I never questioned the logistics of fitting something like a bed in there. And that I never understood their reasoning for giving him one in the first place.

So 15 month old Harry. He's in a house he's never been in before, with people that are, probably even to a baby, extremely clear about the fact that they don't want him around and he can't find the only two people who have always been there. He's lost, confused, and nobody will give him the comfort he's asking for... if they're even paying attention at all. And what do toddlers do when they want you to pay attention?

They cause a scene. They cry and scream and throw all the toys around. My cousin was a climber and would jump up and down on and off of anything she could get to the top of. And yes, he's probably talking a bit and knows how to ask for some things but... at 15 months you're still mostly nonverbal. Do you think Dursley's made any attempts to learn his physical cues?

So they shove Harry into the cupboard to contain him. He's probably got his blanket because he's carrying around the one thing he recognizes, or because they don't want Dudley to touch it. He eventually falls asleep and they leave him there.

On day two it happens again.

By day three its routine. At some point Petunia gives him another blanket because its November.

And maybe he gets a few bruises from sleeping on the floor so they give him a pillow. Maybe they have one of those sleeping mats they use in daycares floating around. As for a complete over all lack of health... they're not exactly feeding him right. Maybe a vitamin D deficiency. But from sleeping on the floor? My sibs and I all had stages where we insisted on it...mine lasted from Christmas to Easter the year Santa built a playhouse in my room because you better believe I slept in that thing until we moved it outside.

As for other people seeing bruises and being worried because he's a toddler... Little kids fall of the couch or down the stairs or while trying to climb the bookcase. They straight up walk into walls and whack themselves in face with a squeaky toy because they think it's funny. And they bruise easy. If I go to the grocery store and see a kid with a bruised forehead I assume he recently discovered the hard way that he's too tall to just walk under the kitchen table. Kids are kids, even when they're little. But if I saw the same kid every day and that bruise never went away? Yeah that's suspicious.

How many people do you think saw little Harry often enough to know that something was up?

So... maybe they give up on Dudley's crib or they find a cot in the shed come spring and they think "might as well."

Or maybe Petunia goes to the store when Harry's like three and come back with a cot because... "Can't have him telling other kids he sleeps on the floor."

Edit because I forgot: as for the being able to explain away the bruises as playing outside... Vernon straight up goes for Harry's neck at least once and Petunia tries to hit him in the face with a frying pan... they don't give a shit.
