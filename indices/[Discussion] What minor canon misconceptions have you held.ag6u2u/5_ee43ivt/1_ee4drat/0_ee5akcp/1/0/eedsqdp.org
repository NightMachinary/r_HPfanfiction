- Dursleys throw young Harry into cupboard to make him shut up
- This becomes a routine
- Young Harry shows very noticeable bruises and poor health from the complete lack of comfortable bedding
- Dursleys resort to using a cot lying around/buy something to avoid nosy neighbors questioning things (while they can get away with bruising showing up on a child once they're old enough to be active outside, it's hard to explain on a toddler)

It's not a long shot if you are otherwise fine with the premise of a Harry living in a cupboard under the st airs.
