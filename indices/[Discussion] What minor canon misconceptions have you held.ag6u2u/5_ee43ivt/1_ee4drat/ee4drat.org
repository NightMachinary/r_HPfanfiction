I think it depends mostly on the stairs themselves, or rather how much of the space underneath is hollow. My mom's house and grandparents house both have "cupboards" that run the entire length of the stairs and then have a "sideroom" of sorts at the low end. However, both are in a split entry house so it's two sets of stairs with a landing - the "sideroom" is under the stairs to the basement, the rest is under the up stairs. I remember thinking it would be an awesome room and was actually kinda jealous the first few times I read the books.

(Now I just think it'd make a great library - grandma's even has shelves because its the pantry - have the books get younger the farther back you go and put a kids reading nest in that corner.)

Of course, I'm aware that Harry's cupboard is not like that. I figure Harry's cupboard is roughly the size of that little room in the back... you know... the one I used as a fort until I was about 9. At 14 I introduced it to my baby cousins and laid down just to see if I still could - not quite but if the shelves weren't there I would have had space to spare.

These days, they store the old camp cot under there. You know, the kind that folds in half and had just enough space underneath to store a few things, the kind of thing that stops being comfortable at around 10. It fits in unfolded. The only real issue is the height but the doorway is halfway down the stairs... if Harry's door is firmly at the tall end I figure Vernon could JUST squeeze himself inside but he isn't going anywhere but back out.

EDIT because I was typing this when I should have been getting ready for work and then really ran out of time:

I'm not saying it would have been comfortable, would have been essentially wall to wall cot with maaaaaybe enough room at the end for idk a milk crate or two to hold his clothes. If he kicks too hard in his sleep, he's hitting the bottom of the stairs and, by 10, he's sleeping curled up because the stairs get in the way. Getting stuff in and out of the potential milk crates probably involves a lot of reaching through the gap between the top of the bed and the bottom of the stairs and hoping for the best.

He's definitely feeling more than a little cramped by the time that the letter comes and the Dursleys probably weren't going to be able to keep him in it much longer.

But it could work. Possibly.
