Wait he isn't?? well that is one misconception shattered.

In the Spinners End scene with Narcissa, Bellatrix and Snape, doesn't Narcissa say something to Snape along the lines as you have to protect/help Draco because your his godfather or something?

I guess i must have misremember it all this time.
