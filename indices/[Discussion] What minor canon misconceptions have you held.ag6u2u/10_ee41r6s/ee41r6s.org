Upon my first few read-throughs I just went with the message Rowling intended to convey, even though I didn't like some of it.

So imagine my surprise when, a few years later, I came across stories from the Ardennes Offensive where German PoWs were executed within days for something I remember Malfoy casually doing in the books, committing acts of War without wearing a proper uniform. A quick Google search later and I found Article 23 of the Hague convention (which revealed even more war crimes).

#+begin_quote
  Art. 23. In addition to the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially forbidden

  (a) To employ poison or poisoned weapons;

  (b) To kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army;

  (f) To make improper use of a flag of truce, of the national flag or of the military insignia and uniform of the enemy, as well as the distinctive badges of the Geneva Convention;

So consider my surprise when reading again the main cast is perfectly fine with a war criminal walking amidst them in the epilogue. And canon is full of similar things, like Dumbledore staying Harry's hero after admitting a conspiracy to commit child abuse

Looking at canon through the eyes of an adult really makes the whole thing feel odd in a bad way. Romilda Vane tries to rape Harry, no consequences. Malfoy's war crimes, attempted murder and grievous bodily harm? No consequences. Snape abusing his power for almost two decades after voluntarily joining the magical Sturmabteilung? He's a hero. The whole muggleborn registration thing? Almost a carbon copy of the NÃ¼rnberg laws and no consequences. Dumbledore and child abuse? No consequences.

Honestly, I've come to greatly dislike HBP and DH in the last few years due to things like this. Because once you notice the disparity between what Rowling intended to convey and what she actually wrote, there is little you can do to enjoy it again.
