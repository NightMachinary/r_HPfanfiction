It's a bit hard to bring Snape to trial after he, well, died. Harry also obviously saw him as a hero in the end (he never saw him during Death Eater revels, only his general unpleasantness in school, and a selection of memories of his childhood chosen by Snape himself, portraying a poor abused kid being hurt by parents and school bullies -- which is easy to symphatize with for one who has experienced the same thing), and Harry, being the hero to Wizarding UK, has a huge influence over how people see things. Personally, while I wouldn't exactly regard him as a /hero/ (he is selfish, petty, cruel at times, a bully, has a nasty vindicative streak...), I feel that, as a spy, bringing him to justice for being a Death Eater alone (rather than based on what he might actually have done as one) isn't right.

I always figured Draco walked free due to Malfoy's monetary influence, similar to how Lucius got away with the Imperius in 1981?
