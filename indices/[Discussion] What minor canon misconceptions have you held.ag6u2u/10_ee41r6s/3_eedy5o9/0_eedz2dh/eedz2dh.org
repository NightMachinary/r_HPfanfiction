To quote Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  A posthumous trial or post-mortem trial is a trial held after the defendant's death. Posthumous trials can be held for a variety of reasons, including the legal declaration that the defendant was the one who committed the crime, to provide justice for society of family members of the victims, or to exonerate a wrongfully convicted person after their death.

Some sort of grand trial would be necessary to establish who did what during the war. Especially the Death Eaters, the Snatchers and the Ministry who supported Voldemort.

  I feel that, as a spy, bringing him to justice for being a Death Eater alone (rather than based on what he might actually have done as one) isn't right.

A good deed does not wash away a bad one. You don't get off murder charges because you saved an old lady from a burning home on your way out. Giving Voldemort the prophecy is conspiracy to commit murder at the very least.
