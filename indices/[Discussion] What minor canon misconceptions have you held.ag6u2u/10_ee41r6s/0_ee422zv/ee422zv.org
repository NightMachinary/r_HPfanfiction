You are not alone with taking issue with the reactions to many events in canon. The absurdity of some things is a major reason we have so many fanfictions about all the shitty things that happened in the wizarding world. The way people like Malfoy and Snape are treated in canon post-war is a major irk for me, sadly this glorification also happens in way too many fics for my liking.

However, I think that a number of the things you mention are influenced heavily by fanfic interpretations. Because in fanfics we often see the facts being interpreted in the worst possible way, while a more mild interpretation is also perfectly possible. For instance the Romilda Vane thing; you jump immediately to sexual assault and rape, but that doesn't automatically follow from canon.
