Once again you take things to the extreme. I'm not saying that her actions should be defended, but you can just as well interpret her actions as a simple (albeit aggressive) attempt to attract the attention of Harry. We are talking about a 15-year old girl whose motivations are largely unmentioned in canon, yet you have inferred attempted rape from the very limited information you have.

The books actually mention that Romilda Vane is using the potion to get Harry to ask her out to Slughorn's party. How exactly do you go from that to rape as the only possibility? Ron also ate a ton of chocolates in one go, giving him a potential overdose and strengthening the reaction. Not saying an overdose happened, but it can very well be the case.

You are looking at canon through fanfiction glasses.

Edit: It is also established in canon that love potions strengthen the longer they are kept. Since the love potion ingested by Ron was kept for several months it also potentially strengthened his reaction a lot.
