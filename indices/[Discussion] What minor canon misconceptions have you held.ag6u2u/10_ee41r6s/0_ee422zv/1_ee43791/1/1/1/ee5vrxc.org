They're worse than roofies because they are literally mind control drugs. I would feel awful if I got raped but less awful than if I were mastered into doing it "willingly."

Even just kissing someone while under mind control is so repulsive to me.

But JKR is not alone. The Sandra Bullock movie "Love Potion No. 9" features a ton of rape by the protagonists no less.
