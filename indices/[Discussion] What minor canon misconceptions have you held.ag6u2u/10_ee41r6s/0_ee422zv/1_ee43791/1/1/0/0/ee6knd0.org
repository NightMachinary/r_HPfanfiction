  anyone forget their girlfriend of a few months for more than a few seconds. Which would turn you into a mindless idiot at the mere mention of their name

See, this is what Amortentia does. Think of Amortentia like Veritaserum as far as potency goes. Just because Amortentia (which is heavily regulated in canon, just like Veritaserum) creates an overpowering sense of lust and infatuation doesn't mean that every minor love potion you get from a joke shop does the same.

I don't know if this is book canon or retcon, but it is said that the potency of LPs goes up in time, and Ron eats the potion laced pastries after they've been sitting in Harry's trunk for 3-4 months. He also eats a lot of pastries and probably suffers an overdose.

Or it could also just be an out and out bad reaction, similar to alcohol. You've got drunks who are quiet, and those who rage at the world, and those who get violent when drunk (including lightweights). Doesn't mean that all alcohol will force a man to violence.
