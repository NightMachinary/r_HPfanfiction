  A girl walking in a revealing outfit which causes guys to take more than a few looks at her - does that count as visual stimulation? Certainly, the targets have no defence against it, since they can't unsee her after they've seen her. What about perfumes? You can't remove the scent after you've felt it once, and any attraction will stay.

  I'd say love potions (minor ones) are a bit higher than makeup or perfumes but nowhere near the level of roofies.

Please show me the perfume or make-up which would make anyone forget their girlfriend of a few months for more than a few seconds. Which would turn you into a mindless idiot at the mere mention of their name. Beat your best friend up over them. Alcohol is a little above the things you mentioned, but love potions have a way stronger effect than what you described. To quote HBP:

  He turned to leave; he had got two steps toward the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked around. Ron's fist was drawn right back; his face was contorted with rage; he was about to strike again.
