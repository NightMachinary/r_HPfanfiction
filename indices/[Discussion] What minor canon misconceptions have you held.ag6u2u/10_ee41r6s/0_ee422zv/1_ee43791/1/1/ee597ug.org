Hellstrike has a tendency to blow things completely out of proportion. Love potions aren't the only thing either - he once said that Marietta Edgecombe deserved to be tried in a court of law for treason. The heinous crime being snitching on the DA in Book 5.

Personally, I think that love potions are a stimulant that induces attraction to the intended target.

But, if we were to consider stimulants to all senses, then shouldn't we be considering those to senses like sight and smell? A girl walking in a revealing outfit which causes guys to take more than a few looks at her - does that count as visual stimulation? Certainly, the targets have no defence against it, since they can't unsee her after they've seen her. What about perfumes? You can't remove the scent after you've felt it once, and any attraction will stay.

I'd say love potions (minor ones) are a bit higher than makeup or perfumes but nowhere near the level of roofies.
