  What does it do? It makes you want to commit sexual acts (be it just kissing) with someone you are not attracted to. It robs you of your free will by doing so. It makes you forget about existing commitments. It makes you very easy to be influenced by a mere mention of the person they are keyed into. And if all it takes to get more potency is to keep it for a few months then it does not change what it is.

What exactly are you basing this on? Canon certainly does not establish that all love potions want to make you commit sexual acts. They cause an infatuation or an obsession. We only see the effects of a love potion a couple times. Once with Merope Gaunt and with Romilda Vane. Merope Gaunt's use of the potion and the effect is had certainly comes close to your interpretation of it (although it was only speculated that she used the potion by Dumbledore). The other use is Romilda Vane on Ron (target was Harry), whose reaction was obviously very strong but can be explained by the circumstances (possible overdose and strengthened due to expiration).

If this is your definition of a rape drug than simple alcohol is also a rape drug since it can very easily lower your inhibitions and make you do things that you don't want to do. However, giving someone a glass of alcohol can hardly be qualified as drugging them with the intention of sexual abuse...
