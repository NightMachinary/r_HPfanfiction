How you equate Love Potions as a date rape drug is beyond me. The love potions in question where sold by Fred and George as a common product in their store. If dosing someone with love potion is equal to using a date rape drug then I'd say they would not be allowed to be sold and Fred and George would surely have the moral integrity to not sell those to anyone either. There are also many different versions of love potions as stated in canon, I very much doubt that a date rape drug love potion is among the things offered by the Weasly store.

The only canonical evidence you really have shown is Ron's extreme reaction which can be explained by the overdose he received by eating too many and the way they strengthened by lying around for months (both canon occurrences). Beyond that, there is nothing that agrees with your points. You are reading canon with fanfic glasses on, while this post is clearly about the misconceptions people have about canon because of fanfiction.
