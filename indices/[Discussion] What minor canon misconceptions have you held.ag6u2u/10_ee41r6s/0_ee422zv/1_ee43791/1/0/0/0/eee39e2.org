I would say that attempting to drug someone to make them more pliable to your desires is way about petty shoplifting.

I'm not a prosecutor, but if I was, I'd argue attempted rape. At the very least, I would expel her for drugging, and attempting to drug, a fellow student.

I will also flat out say that if Romilda was a boy, people would come down on her like a fucking hammer.
