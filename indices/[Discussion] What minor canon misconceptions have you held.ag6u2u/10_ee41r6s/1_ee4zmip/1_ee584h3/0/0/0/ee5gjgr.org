I'm not sure how to make it any clearer. None of that is relevant to wizards. Our laws aren't some god-ordained rules. They're an abstract set of ideas our societies have agreed to follow and that's it. Wizards aren't obligated to follow them. And they don't. Saying they must is like saying an older sibling has to follow the rules their younger sibling lays down.

It's implied in canon that wizards have countries (Transylvania, Assyria) that don't even exist in the muggle world anymore. They don't give a shit for muggle laws or borders or whatever. If they can have their own countries that don't exist in the muggle world, go around Obliviating muggles, and even manipulate the minds of Presidents (Ch 1, HBP), then why in the world would the Conventions matter to them?

TL;DR: Do wizards live on muggle land or do muggles live on wizard land?
