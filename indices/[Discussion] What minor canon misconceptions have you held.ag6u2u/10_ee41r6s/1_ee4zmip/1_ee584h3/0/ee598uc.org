You completely missed the point. The Conventions are muggle things. They're irrelevant to wizards. We don't need the Conventions to tell us whether or not someone did something morally wrong, and wizards need it even less, seeing as they function under different laws.

Use morality to argue your case, not laws that don't even apply to the people we're talking about. It'd be like if I used the age of consent in America to criticize an adult fucking a 14 year old in the Philippines. It's stupid. I'm going to criticize the person for fucking a kid, not because they didn't follow the laws of a society they don't belong to.
