For a while, I thought that Hermione saved Katie Bell after she was cursed by Draco's necklace in HBP, by administering a counter-curse, or some other form of help. In fact, it might have been contamination from a fanfic: Hermione and Ron, pulled her down from where she was floating due to the curse, while Harry ran to get help.
