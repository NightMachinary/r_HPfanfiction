Back when I first read PS in 1999, I thought the wizarding world was called "Mimblewimble" based on this passage:

  But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents' world.”

  “What world?”

  Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.

  “DURSLEY!” he boomed.

  Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.”
