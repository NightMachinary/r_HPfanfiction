  I had also forgotten that the Dark Mark on Death Eaters' arms was a well-kept secret. When Harry tells Sirius that he saw Snape show Karkaroff "something on his arm" at the Yule Ball, Sirius is baffled and says, "Well, I've no idea what that's about."

Actually, this could be more because of Sirius' imprisonment. Fudge was well aware of the Dark Mark - he snaps at Snape when the latter reveals the full darkened mark to him after Voldemort's resurrection, and tells him to cover it up.
