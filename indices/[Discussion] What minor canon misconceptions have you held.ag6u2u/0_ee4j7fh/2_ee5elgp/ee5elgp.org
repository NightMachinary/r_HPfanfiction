  I had also forgotten that the Dark Mark on Death Eaters' arms was a well-kept secret. When Harry tells Sirius that he saw Snape show Karkaroff "something on his arm" at the Yule Ball, Sirius is baffled and says, "Well, I've no idea what that's about."

Most fanfic probably changes that because it makes no sense for the Dark Mark to not be common knowledge amongst aurors and members of the OotP after so many Death Eaters were captured, tried, and imprisoned at the end of the war. Sirius not knowing is like a cop not knowing about the existence of a notorious prison gang tattoo (such as Aryan Brotherhood).
