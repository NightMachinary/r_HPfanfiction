Sirius is perhaps the only person it does make sense for, though: if the existence of the mark was only revealed during the trials post-War, he would have already been imprisoned. If no one thought to tell him about it after his release (why would they? After all, everyone knew after the trials), he might never have heard about it.

That would make for a great one shot where someone tells Sirius about the Mark and he blows up (rightfully) over the fact that no one thought to check his arm.
