Because of the movies, I had completely forgotten that it was Phineas Nigellus Black who delivers the "Dumbledore's got style" line right after Dumbledore escapes being arrested by Fudge and Kingsley in OoTP. I also forgot that it was Tonks, and not Luna, who finds Harry petrified on the Hogwarts Express and then fixes his nose in HBP.

I had also forgotten that the Dark Mark on Death Eaters' arms was a well-kept secret. When Harry tells Sirius that he saw Snape show Karkaroff "something on his arm" at the Yule Ball, Sirius is baffled and says, "Well, I've no idea what that's about."
