This is actually so super helpful for me right now. I'm writing something set right at the beginning of Goblet of Fire, and I needed something shady to happen, to be observed, and wanted it to be Karkaroff freaking out about his arm. But I, too had the misconception about the Dark Mark, and didn't think it was a big enough deal to be the thing I needed to have happen! So, you rock.
