  In any case, what little pieces of canon have you found you'd forgotten or found renewed enjoyment out of?

That Unforgivable curses can't be blocked. Snape does so handily in his duel with Harry in HBP (along with blocking other curses).

In old-school MtG, like first or second gen, there were blue Interrupts that basically acted "faster than instantly" to disrupt opponents' actions. Snape was like that in canon. Harry didn't even finish his incantations before his spells were Noped.

Snape, one of two canon characters who could fly unaided, was a badass.
