Ooh I like that a lot. A whole lot actually. I bet the fallout of that tournament was a PR nightmare. What was supposed to be a renewal of friendship ended with a dead competitor and claims that a Dark Lord had returned. No wonder Fudge covered it up. Also how suspicious would it look that the person who defeated Grindelwald was now saying another Dark wizard was back right at the point tensions were loosening? Might look like Dumbledore was trying to push for more power. No wonder he lost his titles.
