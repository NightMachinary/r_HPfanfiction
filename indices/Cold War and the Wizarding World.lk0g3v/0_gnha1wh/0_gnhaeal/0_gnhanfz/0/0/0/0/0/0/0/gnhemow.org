Sold on this. Someone had a really neat fanfic that was essentially letters between Albus and Grindlewald and a few were of Grindlewald talking about how an “upstart dark lord” was talking to him. This idea of yours would really fit well into canon and give some good behind the scenes stuff. I really like it and it could show how the magic and Muggle words are intertwined
