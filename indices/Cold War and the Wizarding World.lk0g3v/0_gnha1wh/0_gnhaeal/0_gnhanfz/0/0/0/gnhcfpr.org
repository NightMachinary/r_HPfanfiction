And what if, like you said, during the Cold War Voldemort starts getting followers and poses as a sort of defector to the Wizarding equivalent of the USSR to get recruits? Maybe Karkaroff started as a high ranking member of the Warsaw Pact wizard nations who was acclimating a young Tom Riddle to the Eastern Bloc but wound up being controlled by him? I kind of want this to be a thing.
