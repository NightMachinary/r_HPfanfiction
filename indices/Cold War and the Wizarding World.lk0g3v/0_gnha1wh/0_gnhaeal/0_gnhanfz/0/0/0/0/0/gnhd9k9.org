That's a pretty good idea. I could also see maybe that Tom might...and I stress might...ask some questions to Dumbledore about Grindlewald which would add to the suspicions Dumbledore had of him. I still like the idea of Karkaroff thinking he is in control of this you g kid but really Tom is the one in charge. This is a really fun Avenue of discussion. Also, of Karkaroff was a high ranking Grindlewald supporter would he know about him a d Dumbledore? If so would Tom be privy to that information? Probably not but a neat thought
