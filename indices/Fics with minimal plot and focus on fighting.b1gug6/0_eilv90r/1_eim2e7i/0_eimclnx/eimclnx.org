I personally loved it. One of my favorites.

Hermione becoming rather ruthless during year 6 seems a bit out of character but that's mainly because year 5 is covered in the first chapter without too much detailed character development.

The Obliviators employing Seers to arrive on time to cover things up is a nice detail.

The Daphne subplot is interesting.

I love the battle scenes. So much going on at once without it becoming too convoluted to follow.

After the battle of Diagon Alley it becomes a bit more focused on politics, but there's still plenty of action with the Rookwood hunt.
