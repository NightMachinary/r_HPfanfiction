Hey, so I am thinking of writing from this, but to do it properly, I have a few questions.

1. Is it also the night in the alternate timeline?
2. Would they switch at a certain time, say, once it reaches 7 pm, Harry is in the alternate universe or is it when they fall asleep?
3. what do you imagine possible to happen if it is night? General havoc?

I really like the idea, and plan on writing on the prompt regardless, but want to know some things from it.
