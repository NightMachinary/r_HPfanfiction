I try to explain as well. I usually never recommend more than 2-3 fics, only because I don't think I've read quite as many as some other people have. Really haven't gotten too creative with my fanfic choices, so my recommendations for any given topic are never more than a few options. But I appreciate the hardcores in here who have huge amounts of fics they've read.
