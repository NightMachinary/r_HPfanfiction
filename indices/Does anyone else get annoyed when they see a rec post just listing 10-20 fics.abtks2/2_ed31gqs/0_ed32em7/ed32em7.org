That makes sense. I understand it's a personal preference. I just look at that big list and I get depressed thinking how long it'll take to go through it to find the one fic that'll do it for me.

Still, like I said, I know I should appreciate the effort someone put in. Personally, however, I always try to add a line or two to my own recommendations, explaining why I think it's a good fit. I feel that makes the rec more valuable, although that could just be bias.
