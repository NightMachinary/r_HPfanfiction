Another thing I find annoying is when they list a bunch of fics, and provide decent explanations, but leave out the title/author. For instance, "linqffn(155134919) has [very interesting premise]", but it's in a list of ten other fics, so you have to check the IDs to see which fic they actually meant, and then - knowing my luck - it has a summary ending with 'H/Hr, bash!Ron, manipulative!Dumbles"
