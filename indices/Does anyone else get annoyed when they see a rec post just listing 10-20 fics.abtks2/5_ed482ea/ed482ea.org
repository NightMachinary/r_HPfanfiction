I don't get especially /annoyed/, but I don't pay them much attention either. As you say, it's story overload.

It makes much more sense to give someone your single best recommendation, maybe 2-3 if you only have partial matches for their request. If they really want to read 20 fics, then they'll doubtless be back once they've finished reading what you gave them, and if their tastes matched yours, they'll have that much more incentive to listen to what you recommend next.
