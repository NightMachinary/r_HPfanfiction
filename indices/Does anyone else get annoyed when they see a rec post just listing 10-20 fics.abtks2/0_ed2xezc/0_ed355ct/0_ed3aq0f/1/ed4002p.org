Idk some of the best ones I have read have been incomplete, and I feel like a lot of times the resolutions, even to otherwise good fanfics, aren't very satisfying (looking at you, Cadmean Victory).

I'd rather read 12 GREAT chapters, even if it remains unresolved, than 30 chapters that just slowly peter out to an unsatisfying conclusion.
