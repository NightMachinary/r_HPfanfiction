Some abandoned stories still have one or multiple complete arcs and can be seen as "finished" if you see the last chapter as an open ending or ignore one or two of the later chapters to get the same effect.

For example, "A different introduction" was supposed to be a first year story (at least) but was abandoned at September 1st. It is one of the better "Harry gets introduced to magic" stories around and has an adorable friendship between Luna and Harry. It is abandoned but still feels complete if you are content with it being a pre-Hogwarts story.
