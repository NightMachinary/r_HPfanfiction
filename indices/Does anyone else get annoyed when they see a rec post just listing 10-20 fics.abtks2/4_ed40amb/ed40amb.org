I don't make a bunch of recommendations (because if I did it would pretty much be me just parroting Taure's and Newcomb's Favorites Lists) but when I do I try to leave a description of why I like the fic and why I think it's worthy of a recommend.

I get where you're coming from; it's somewhat annoying to just get a list of 20 fics with no real context. A lot of times people's summaries are bad anyway, so that's not much help.
