The format you get doesn't really matter as there is plenty of online converters

I prefer FB2 - this one handles all of that. Same site has converters for all other major formats.

FanfictionDownloader as AbareKiller mentioned is also a very good way to save all the stories from FF.net and some other sites with single click
