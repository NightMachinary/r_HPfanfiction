I highly doubt Lucius would just randomly murder a muggle if he came across one.

Sure he joined a band of fanatical extremists who believe in pureblood supremacy and regularly went out to bait some muggles. But that is more a situation of being empowered as a group.

It is the equivalent of a night out with the boys. You do stupid shit because the rest of your bros are doing stupid shit. And not to mention that powerful Dark Lord that is backing you.
