I don't think they're asking 'who would you rather eat dinner with?" but more whose behavior towards Muggles would be more insulting.

Lucius Malfoy is bad, hands down. But, well, there's bad people already, isn't there? So, logically speaking, if you were to run into him, you'd think him to be just another crazy murderer.\\
But then there's Arthur who is, by all accounts a generally pleasant human being, but he just happens to think that Muggles are these fascinating little creatures who come up with the most ludicrous things.\\
Speaking as myself, I would be so much more insulted by Arthur than I would as Lucius.
