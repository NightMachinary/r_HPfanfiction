I somewhat agree and disagree, depending on the situation. If you take them at their actual views, Lucius is uncomparably worse considering he actually wants to kill you. In a more common situation, Lucius is just another racist that will glare at you when you walk by, while Arthur feels like a bit like a virtue signaller who's trying too hard to cover the fact he's a bit racist. Like the guy works in a pretty serious government position, he's clearly not stupid. He could easily just remember what he's told, and not mispronounce the same words for years despite being told about them. To me, it feels like he's trying to show he's progressive, but is held back by his actual biases. Like the dudes on twitter posting pictures of black people reading on a train with that "OH MY GOD IT CAN READ" vibe. As in on a normal day, without Voldemort being in power, Lucius would walk past you, while Arthur is way more likely to do something offensive.

On the other hand, Rowling's characters are written for an eleven year old audience and all require you to suspend disbelief, and realistically Arthur isn't meant to be biased at all, he just has poorly written scenes intended for humor/to point out the disconnection between the worlds.
