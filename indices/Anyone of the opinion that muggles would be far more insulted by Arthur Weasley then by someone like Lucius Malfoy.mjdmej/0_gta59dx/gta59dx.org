Yes and no. I'm going to take this from the perspective of being an ethnic minority.

People like Arthur Weasley are irritating because they're trying to be nice but they're hurtful. You usually have to keep explaining to them why you don't like something they do.

People like Lucius Malfoy are easier to deal with because direct hate is easy to see and respond to. But, people who hate are dangerous. You never know when they're going to decide to act on their hate and it's never just calling you names in public.

At the end of the day, I'd rather deal with the Arthur Weasleys' of the world because their hearts are in the right place and you can teach them to do better.
