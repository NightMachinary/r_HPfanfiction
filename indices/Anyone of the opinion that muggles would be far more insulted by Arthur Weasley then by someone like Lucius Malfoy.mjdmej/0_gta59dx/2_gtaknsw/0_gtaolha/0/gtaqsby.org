... Do you think the 19th century missionaries in Africa were /intentionally condescending/, rather than genuinely convinced they were doing the right thing and trying to help?

What I'm getting at: The mindset behind that sort of action is such a fundamental thing, so deeply ingrained and a product of its time, that I don't see it changing just like that. Times changes, and /then/ mindsets change. But not during one person's lifetime.

And the "times" here is the static and utterly unchanging wizarding world, and its products are sentiments ranging from Arthur goggling at zoo-Muggles to Malfoy doing a spot of Muggle-Hunting, but in any case an unshaken belief that having magic means being superior. Also in Arthur. /Especially/ in Arthur. (Because he sees the difference every day in his job -- which is rescuing Muggles from magic.)

Ultimately, I don't disagree with your original take: That Malfoy is the more dangerous one (I mean, that's also pretty obvious) and that it's more pleasant to deal with the likes of Arthur, because you can tell him to stfu without you getting cursed. But I disagree that Arthur (and most wizards, for that matter) have a mindset that can be changed.
