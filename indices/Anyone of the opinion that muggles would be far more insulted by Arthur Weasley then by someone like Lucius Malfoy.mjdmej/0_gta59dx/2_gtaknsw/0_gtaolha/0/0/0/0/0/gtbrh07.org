No, I'm arguing two different things, because /everyone/ is. Jesus this thread is full-on on confused.

Insulting, for me, has two components: The mindset and the action. Now /I think/, in the end, what I'm dealing with is the action part, so it's enough to look at that. As long as Lucius Malfoy does not try to kill me (which he doesn't, at least until DH), Lucius sneers and insults me, and Arthur bounces around and insults me. Both need to stfu. One isn't less irritating than the other.

However, apparently, most of the thread disagrees and I'm getting downvoted to reddit hell, lol. So I engaged the "I must consider the mindset argument" and pointed out that in this regard, Malfoy and Arthur are equal, because both operate from a standpoint of Muggles being lesser beings. I don't see how this is controversial either -- both because I consider it a Canon fact (it's simply the standard attitude of 90% of the wizarding world, they can be forgiven for it), /and/ because it's /my/ response to their attitude. I'm not asking anyone to share it.

And as soon as I do /that/, the thread shifts entirely and argues that "Malfoy is worse". Which is like ... totally not the question? OP asks which is more *insulting*. Insulting =/= dangerous =/= morally wrong. Insulting simply is a mostly subjective response to a situation, is totally not what you feel "when someone tries to kill you" (that's "afraid"), and I don't get what the noise is all about.
