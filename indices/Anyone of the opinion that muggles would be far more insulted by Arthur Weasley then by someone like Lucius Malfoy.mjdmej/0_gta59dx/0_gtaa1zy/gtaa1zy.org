Agreed.

I'm taking it from the position of someone with a disability, which is probably not that different to how Arthur sees Muggles anyway. To a wizard whose magical ability is involved in everything he does, lacking magic *would* be a significant disability.

Arthur's kind in his ignorance. He'd get things wrong, and cause some hurt because of it, but he'd attempt (possibly fail, but attempt) to do better if someone pointed out what he'd done.

Lucius wouldn't even try.
