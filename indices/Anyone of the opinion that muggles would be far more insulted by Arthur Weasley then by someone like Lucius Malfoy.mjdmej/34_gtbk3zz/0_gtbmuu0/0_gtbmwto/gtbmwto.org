Oh? Please teach me?

Edit, because first of all my idea of freedom of speech is contradictory to begin with. So person A says their personal opinion, B arrives and maybe agrees or maybe not, who knows. Both have the right to say their opinion (without insulting of course because manners). Is this correct? Under that understanding, trying to prove your point /is/ an act of freedom of speech... so the problem that I'm referring isn't related to that at all, mmmm. But if not, to what then? To try to prove that B is right and A wrong? Seems like an ego issue, and probably feeling personally attacked by A's opinion, but I feel like I'm stretching that a little to much.
