Ooooh ok, so is a political thing? And does it only have the political definition? I mean, like those words with different meanings according to the context and subject.

I feel like I have to mention that English is not my mother language and in mine, “freedom of speech” is not only a political concept, but more like a natural right that /can/ be discussed in politics, but it doesn't limit to that.
