I feel Arthur views muggles the way some people view the Amish than seeing them as â€˜quaint little creatures'.

Malfoy and his ilk likely see muggles as beneath even house elves and goblins since they have no magic at all.

Having someone wonder how I manage without magic is far less insulting than having someone think I shouldn't exist as anything other than a plaything (at best).
