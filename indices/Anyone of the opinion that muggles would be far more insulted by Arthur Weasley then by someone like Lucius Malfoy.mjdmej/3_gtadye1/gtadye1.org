I've seen many people here pointing out the obvious, but to give a more accurate example of how Arthur and Lucius interact with Muggles:

​

/“The company you keep, Weasley...and I thought your family could sink no lower --”/

/There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, “Get him, Dad!” from Fred or George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, “No, Arthur, no!”; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; “Gentlemen, please --- please!” cried the assistant, and then, louder than all ---/

​

And Lucius says that while the Grangers family is right in front of him along with the Weasleys. Lucius also scoffs at the Weasley family's poverty just because he is very wealthy.

On the other hand, Arthur said:

"/But you're/ [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Non-magic_people][/Muggles/]]/! We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!/"

This may seem strange out of context, but the Granger family (except for Hermione) doesn't spend much time in the wizarding world and so they may even feel comfortable in someone trying to talk about things they understand.

Considering the origin of the Malfoy family, they should also know that, which makes the relationship with the Weasleys very ironic.
