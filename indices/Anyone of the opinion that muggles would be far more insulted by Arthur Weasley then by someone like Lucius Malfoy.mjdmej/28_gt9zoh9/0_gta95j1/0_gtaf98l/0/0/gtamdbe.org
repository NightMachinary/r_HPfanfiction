As far as I can follow, the original prompt was asking if anyone else held that personal opinion.

And I'm saying as an openly gay woman, that Arthur would insult me more than Lucius.\\
I deal with mini-Lucius...es? I still don't get that. I deal with them all the time, unfortunately. As for full-on Lucius...es. Whatever. I know of their existence, and I've seen the effects of their existence. Stared it in the face.\\
It's nothing new to me. They don't insult me anymore. I've grown immune to it.

But if someone were to waltz in and look at us, look at me, like some fascinating creature under a microscope, and keep getting things wrong. Well, I'd be insulted.\\
I'm not saying anything against Arthur as a character, but simply my feelings as a human being.

As I stated in my other comment, I'm not interested in getting into a debate. Simply laying down my feelings and contributing.
