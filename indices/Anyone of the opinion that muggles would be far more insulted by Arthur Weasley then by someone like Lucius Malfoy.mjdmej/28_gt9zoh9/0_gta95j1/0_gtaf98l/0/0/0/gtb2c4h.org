  But if someone were to waltz in and look at us, look at me, like some fascinating creature under a microscope, and keep getting things wrong.

I think "keep gettings things wrong" is a mischaracterization of Author's character, though.

Arthur is mostly self-taught on muggle culture. He's learning things in a vacuum, almost entirely incapable of reaching out to someone who knows the answers to his questions.

He asks Harry because Harry grew up with Muggles, even though Harry is /not/ a muggle. I think this is an important distinction because it shows that Arthur isn't looking at the individual as if they're a curiosity, but rather their culture itself. He doesn't care /where/ he gets the answers, just that he does. Which I'm not sure how anyone could view as unhealthy.

To directly compare your situation to Arthur's isn't exactly fair because yours is a situation on sexuality, in which case asking questions is inherently very personal. Asking how a rubby ducky works is very obviously not something most people would be offended by.
