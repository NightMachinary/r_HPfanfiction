You've missed my point entirely.

I KNOW hundreds of Luciuses have existed and continue to exist. That's why I want nothing to do with them - because I, speaking as the person with a disability that I am, get to be put on the chopping block very early and very deliberately by men who believe things like he does.

Yes, to the entire extent.

Ever heard the phrase "life unworthy of life?" Were you paying attention to some of the debate through the pandemic, about who was worth saving and who was not?

I would take Arthur's honest ignorance over Lucius' deliberate and conscious devaluing any day of the week. Arthur's ignorance still has room to grow into something better.
