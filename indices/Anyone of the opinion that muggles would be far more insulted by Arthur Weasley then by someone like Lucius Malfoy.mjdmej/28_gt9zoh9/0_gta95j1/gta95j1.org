People ALREADY treat me like Arthur treats Muggles. Very obvious, visible disability.

I've got nothing to lose by hanging out with someone who's ignorant, but also kind enough to care/attempt (and possibly fail, but attempt) to do better if I tell him I don't like what he's doing.

Plenty of real people wouldn't, and don't, respond as well as Arthur would.
