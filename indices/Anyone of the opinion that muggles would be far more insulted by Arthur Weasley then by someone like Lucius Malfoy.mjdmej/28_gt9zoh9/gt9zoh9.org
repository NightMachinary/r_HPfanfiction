I...weirdly agree with this.Like, if Lucius came in and called me a 'Muggle' with all this hate and shit and then tried to murder me, I'd just think him to be some other crazy murder walking around the world murdering people.But if Arthur - who, don't misunderstand me, I love to death as a character - came in and gawked at me like we were at a zoo and I was behind the glass...honestly, that'd be so much more insulting.
