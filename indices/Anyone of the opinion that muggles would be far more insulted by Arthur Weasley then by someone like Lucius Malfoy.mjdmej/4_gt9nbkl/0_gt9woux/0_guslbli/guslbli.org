I'm not sure if sadistic is the right word, but you're right.

And it's not like Arthur treats muggle as some sort of circus curiosity. He'S curious and fascinated sure, but whenever he meats them he treats them with kindness and openly asks questions. That might be annoying to some, but he's well-meaning. Which we can't say for Lucius.

As long as Lucius stayed in his little magical corner not interacting with muggles, that might be something most muggles wouldn't care much about, but after getting together with his master to start a war against them... I think as a muggle I'd prefer interacting with Arthur despite technically liking Lucius more as a fictional character ^^
