I would 1000% be more pissed off by Arthur than by a Malfoy. I don't mind douchebags, but ignorant, /arrogant,/ condescension like that would /infuriate/ me. And make no mistake, Arthur may not /mean/ to be arrogant, but he is nonetheless. He views other living, breathing, /thinking/ humans as amusing, clever little children. We're a /hobby/ to him. He doesn't even bother to hide that he just thinks of us as an amusing sideshow, and he never once puts any genuine effort into learning about the people he claims to be so fascinated by. I would /hate/ Malfoy more, because he's a racist and a monster. But I would be more /offended/ by Arthur.
