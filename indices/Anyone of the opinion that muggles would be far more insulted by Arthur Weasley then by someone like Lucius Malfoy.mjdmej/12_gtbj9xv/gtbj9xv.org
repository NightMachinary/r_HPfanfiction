I guess I got a different copy of the books, because I can't recall any instance where Arthur was anything but curious and fascinated by Muggles and muggle things, and not in a gross, patronizing "they're so exotic!" kind of way. I have no idea what version of Arthur people are talking about in this thread.

He is more like someone who has learned a foreign language, speaks it very badly, but is very excited to practice with native speakers and makes every attempt to have an actual conversation, sometimes mixes up words and tenses, but always keeps trying.
