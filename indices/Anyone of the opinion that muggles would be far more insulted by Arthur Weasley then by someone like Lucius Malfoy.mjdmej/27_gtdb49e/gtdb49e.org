One has to take into account Arthur's job-Misuse of Muggle Artifacts. It's a quaint name for dealing with horrible cursed objects intended to maim or kill unsuspecting muggles, for the most part. He may build nifty flying cars, but others have far more nefarious uses in mind. He may be fascinated by technology for his part, but the things he has likely seen done to muggles in the first place has done little to jade his otherwise good heart.

I think he sees muggles as the “noble savage” stereotype more than anything else. It's still super racist, but he could be educated about it and change his view.
