I think if you knew exactly what each man felt, then Arthur would insulting or frustrating, while Lucius would be feared or hated.

That said, Lucius would be considered the bigger problem as he wants to kill or subjugate muggles.

But I think it's a bit silly to rank them based on insultedness. Enemies aren't insulting: they are dangerous.

Arthur is a normal civilian; Lucius is a deadly enemy.
