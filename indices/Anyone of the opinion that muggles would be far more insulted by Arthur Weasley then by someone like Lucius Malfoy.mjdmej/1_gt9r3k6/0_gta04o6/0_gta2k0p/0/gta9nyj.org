Nah, that's "dangerous". There is a difference. Do you feel insulted when someone is trying to kill you? I'd argue that'd be a quite weird reaction.

In terms of what is /insulting/, both are perfectly equal, because that is a question of the mindset, and the mindset of both is belittling. Arthur isn't better, resp. Malfoy isn't worse. The sole difference is what they conclude from that mindset: Malfoy goes all Nietzsche and super-Darwin, proclaiming the rule of the strong, and Arthur wants to study you like a lab rat.

I'd hate either. It's really a good thing the worlds are separate; there's too much of a difference between Muggles and wizards.
