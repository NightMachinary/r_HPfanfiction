Ah, but so many people do that already.\\
My point is simply, to me, it'd be so much more insulting for someone to be fascinated by me and treat me like a research project or whatever, than someone being a bigoted asshole who wants to murder me.\\
I get enough of those last ones.

Also, an end note, I don't want to argue this. It's my personal view regarding what I know about myself, that leads me to say that Arthur would be more insulting - love him as I do.\\
I really don't give a fuck what you think - you aren't me and you never will be.\\
So, no trying to convince me of something I will quite obviously never understand as it doesn't make any sense to me.
