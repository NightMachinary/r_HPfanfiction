Honestly Arthur is fascinated by our technology but doesn't understand it, just like my grandparents. I'm not insulted by my grandparents getting excited and asking me stupid questions about phones and smart TV's so why would I be insulted by Arthur asking me stupid questions about electricity? I'd be much more insulted by the man that doesn't respect me as a human being. Like the Weasleys still have a bit of the ingrained superiority all wizards typically seem to have that can come across offensive but they atleast make an effort to understand muggles. If everyone in the world tried to understand those different than them, the world would be a better place.
