I'm actually very sure I'm one of the few people in this thread who's /not/ missing the point, given that the question was "your subjective opinion of who is more insulting". But that aside, yes, that is an attempt to separate them (but you're missing a fact, see below), however, it's also not what the post I responded to argued. The post was "evil human being vs ignorant kind person", and I pointed out -- as you do -- that /both/ are ignorant.

Now, as for your last paragraph, and why your angle doesn't truly work either: Due to his job, which he holds for over a decade, Arthur regularly is dealing with the Muggle world. He is far more involved with the Muggle world than nearly all other wizards, in fact (naturally, since that was the whole reason he took that job in the first place). And after all this exposure, he's still as ignorant as everyone else, and generally of the opinion that Muggles are deficient because they lack magic.

How is that /not/ his fault?
