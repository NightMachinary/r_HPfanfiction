I think fundamentally you've misunderstood the point.

Lucius Malfoy, canonically, has no interest in learning about muggles or changing his beliefs. His ignorance is as much of a choice as possible.

Arthur Weasley's ignorance is due to the separation between worlds and, despite such a barrier, is attempting to improve his knowledge of them and their culture.

I'm genuinly confused on how anyone can view that as Arthur's fault, or even condescending. He doesn't know, and is trying to learn. Isn't that how everyone starts out?
