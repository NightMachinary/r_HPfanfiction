What definition is that? It's an explanation, not an excuse. "I didn't know" wasn't a legitimate rebuttal to "you are wrong" since ever. You are still wrong, you just told everyone why you were, now.

Also, the original point I was making, funnily enough, is how Lucius Malfoy is not the most ignorant person on the planet, if we must talk about ignorance. He lives in his Manor and doesn't meet Muggles ever. He has no clue about anything. Possibly he buys into the (Canon) crackpot theory of how Muggles descend from mushrooms.

It's simply the wrong category if you want to evaluate what makes Malfoy and Arthur different.
