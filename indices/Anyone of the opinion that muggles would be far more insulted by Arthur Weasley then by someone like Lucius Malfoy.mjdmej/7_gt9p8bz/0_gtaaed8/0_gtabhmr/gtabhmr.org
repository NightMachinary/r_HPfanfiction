They're different because of how they would respond /if their ignorance was challenged/.

Arthur would be thrilled to learn he was wrong about/had misunderstood something, and he'd change his behaviour in response to what he'd learned. He's kind, and if he learned his behaviour was actually insulting Muggles he'd try (possibly fail, but try) to do better.

Lucius wouldn't. If his ignorance was challenged, if someone pointed out how wrong he had things, he'd double down.
