Yeah, this is really a personal thing, I suppose. I simply don't place much value on /kindness/. Does that buy me anything? Does it make it better, if you're insulted, but the person is kind? To me, it doesn't. It's a bit like two henchmen, and one is brutal and cold, and the other's heart breaks, but both hang all people all the same. In the end, I have to deal with actions, not intentions.

To that end, keep in mind that from everything we know, at least pre-DH, Malfoy does not go on Muggle-hunting sprees, and Arthur works as closely with Muggles as is possible for at least a decade, and /still/ has no clue. He had every opportunity to learn and change.

Really, when we're talking about attitudes, I'll take Kingsley's professionalism. He presumably did a good job blending in as the PM's aide in HBP and kept his thoughts, if he had any, to himself.
