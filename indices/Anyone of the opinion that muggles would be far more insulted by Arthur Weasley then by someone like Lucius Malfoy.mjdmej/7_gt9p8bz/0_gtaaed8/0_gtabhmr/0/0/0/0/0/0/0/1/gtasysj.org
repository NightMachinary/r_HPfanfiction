Given that Wizarding Healers can literally regrow bones in a night--even if the bones themselves are vanished--and can reattach limbs and repair horrible burns in a matter of hours, I would say Ron's discomfort for Muggle medicine is extremely justified.

And that's not considering the history of Muggle medicine, which is nothing short of horrifying.
