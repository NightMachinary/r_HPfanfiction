Oh, I'm not disagreeing. And wizards factually /are/ superior to Muggles (if one measures this by having and lacking magic, anyway).

It's just that when talking about what is /insulting/, those facts don't really matter, because "insulting" is subjective, and, in this case, rooted in the implied "we're superior to you" all three of those statements possess, no matter how justified they are.
