  He remains ignorant of Muggle life on the macro scale

/While working with them every day!/

C'mon man. What's with the ridiculous slack everyone's cutting here? Malfoy, at least, has probably never met a Muggle in his life. /That/ is what I would call ignorant. Arthur should know better, and, as everyone keeps pointing out (though I don't see the relevance), "is the better person", which directly implies he must be held to a higher standard than Lucius "MagicalNazi" Malfoy, whose assholery is just par for the course.

Arthur's mindset, after working in a job that requires him to deal with Muggles for years:

#+begin_quote
  “Fascinating!” he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. “Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.”
#+end_quote

Malfoy's mindset, living in his Manor far removed from any Muggle:

#+begin_quote
  “The company you keep, Weasley... and I thought your family could sink no lower---”
#+end_quote

And by the way, Ron's opinion:

#+begin_quote
  "Doctors?" said Ron, looking startled. "Those Muggle nutters that cut people up?"
#+end_quote

The "lack of magic" and "we are superior" is the fundamental mindset speaking out of /all/ of these, and neither Arthur, nor Malfoy, nor Ron has, before, during or after (19 years later) the series, lost that mindset.

And that is the point.
