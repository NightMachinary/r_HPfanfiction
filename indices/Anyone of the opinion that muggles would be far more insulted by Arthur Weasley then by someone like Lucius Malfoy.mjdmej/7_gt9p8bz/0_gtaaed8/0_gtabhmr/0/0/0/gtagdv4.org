How much can a person change? People are what they are. What you are proposing is a revolution for Arthur, rather than an evolution. The origin of Arthur's reaction is the same as the origin of Malfoy's reaction: Both fundamentally consider Muggles lesser beings.

/That/ is what's insulting. I think this distinction is what OP was getting at, and what a lot of people are missing: Inasfar as he acts on it, no one argues Malfoy killing a Muggle is better than Arthur asking inane questions. But that's also not the point, because that isn't what one gets offended about. The (or my, in that first response) point is that if you really must consider intentions, Arthur isn't any better than Malfoy. Both share a world view, and world views have the habit of being very inflexible.

Which, again, as evidenced by the fact that Arthur regularly deals with Muggles, and still (or perhaps, because of that) considers Muggles the way he does.
