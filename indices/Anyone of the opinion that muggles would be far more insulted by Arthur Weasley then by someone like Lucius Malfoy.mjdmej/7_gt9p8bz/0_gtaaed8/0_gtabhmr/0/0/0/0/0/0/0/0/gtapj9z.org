He doesn't work with Muggles. Or around Muggles. At all, ever. His job in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts office relies on Muggles never having any idea he's doing it, so direct contact would be minimised.

Arthur's job as depicted is dealing with *wizards who are Mugglebaiting*, not with Muggles. He's never shown in text handling the Muggle-adjacent end of the exchange.

As for Lucius, he makes that statement while the people he's making it about are *right there*. It's a deliberate and conscious choice to make them feel terrible. He's also been pinged on Muggle-baiting charges.

Awkward and inappropriate behaviour like Arthur's is a definite problem, but it's better than deliberately cruel behaviour like Lucius.
