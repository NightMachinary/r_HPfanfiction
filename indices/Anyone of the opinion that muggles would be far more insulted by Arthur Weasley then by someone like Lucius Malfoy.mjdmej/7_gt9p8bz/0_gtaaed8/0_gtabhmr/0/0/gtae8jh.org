We do have to deal with actions rather than intentions. You're right there.

The point I'm making is that Arthur's kindness means that *his actions would change*. If he learned that he'd inadvertently done something unkind or insulting, his future behaviour would reflect that. It wouldn't undo what harm he had already done, but his future actions would be better. He wants to understand more, he wants to do better.

Lucius' actions, if called out, would not change. He would never want to do any better.
