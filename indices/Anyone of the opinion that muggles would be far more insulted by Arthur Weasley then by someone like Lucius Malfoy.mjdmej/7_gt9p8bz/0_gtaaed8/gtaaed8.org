Wat. If Arthur is "ignorant", then how is Malfoy not "ignorant" as well? I don't think your pair of opposites works.

Anyway, ignorance is not -- is /never/ -- an excuse. The well-meaning fool is not the better option over the ill-intentioned scholar. Both are terrible. Personally, in fact, I prefer the latter over the former because I can't suffer fools, but I guess YMMV.
