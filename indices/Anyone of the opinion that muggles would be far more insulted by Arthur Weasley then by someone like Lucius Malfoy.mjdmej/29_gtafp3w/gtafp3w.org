I think the whole weasley family is given far more credit than they deserve when it comes to muggles, from the accountant squib cousin who "no one ever talks about" , to molly's comments about muggles in Kings cross and her dislike of any muggle things Arthur brings back home, to Arthur treating Hermione's parents as aliens when he met them, I mean for fudge sake, I can't imagine learning about muggles would be that hare just take a stroll around muggle London and you'd learn a lot of useful things.

To sum up, the Weasleys didn't hate muggles or anything, they just considered them weird humans and never made an effort to know about the muggle world. I don't want to talk about Bill and Charlie it wouldn't be fair to them.
