Hah, that's right! I completely forgot about the second cousin accountant.

  I can't imagine learning about muggles would be that hare just take a stroll around muggle London and you'd learn a lot of useful things.

This is literally what Arthur is doing for a job -- walking around Muggle London, that is. Not so much the learning. I don't see how the conclusion can be anything but that Arthur simply doesn't consider Muggles equals, in much the same way as Lucius doesn't.

Which, to be fair, Muggles just /aren't/ -- they lack magic. But when the question is what is insulting (as opposed to dangerous or morally wrong, which most people seem to be mixing up here), then only the mindset matters, no matter how justified, and both end up looking equally poor.
