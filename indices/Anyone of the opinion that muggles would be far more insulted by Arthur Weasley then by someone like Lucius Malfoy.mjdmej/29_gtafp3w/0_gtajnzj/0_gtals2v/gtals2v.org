Honestly I think the whole wizarding world is at fault, I understand having their own shops, schools etc.. But the wizards staying away from muggles is so weird in my opinion, they can totally blend in ans keep their secrets at the same time. I don't know if I was a wizard and there was a whole wide world out there I would like to live in it..
