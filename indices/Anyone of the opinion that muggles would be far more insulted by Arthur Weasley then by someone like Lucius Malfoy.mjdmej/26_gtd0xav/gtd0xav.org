My headcanon is that Arthur KNOWS about all the muggle things he PRETENDS to be ignorant of. This allows him to work within a Ministry filled with bigots; they humor a ‘dim-witted' pureblood they feel obligated to put up with, while deflecting any notions that the ‘simple' muggles might be dangerous.
