I'd take Arthur.

I already get the patronizing bullshit from plenty of people in real life because of my very visible disability, so Arthur doing it because I couldn't do magic wouldn't be new. It would be annoying, just like the real life version is annoying, but not new.

Besides, if I TOLD him it was annoying, Arthur's a kind enough man that he'd at least try to stop.

Lucius wouldn't give a shit, and that makes him worse.
