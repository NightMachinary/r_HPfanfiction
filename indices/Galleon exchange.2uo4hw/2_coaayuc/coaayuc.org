Given that the wizarding and muggle economy seem to be almost completely separated, being able to exchange money at all doesn't really make sense. There needs to be trade between them for the money of one to be worth anything to the other.

What would wizards even want to buy from muggles? They have magical farms, can probably enchant tools to craft most non-magical items, and are seemingly uninterested in more technologically advanced stuff or electricity.

I also imagine it'd be quite easy and hard to detect to somehow get muggle money through magical means for criminals (just confound someone into giving you all their savings, or duplicate and exchange it with non-duplicated money, or divine the future of financial markets), which is another reason why allowing free exchange would be a bad idea.

Instead, I prefer to think that the exchange witnessed in CoS is actually a social program by the Ministry for Muggle-Borns with a strict limit on how much money can be 'exchanged'. The extremely low exchange rate would then be more of a fee than anything else; it could be a relic of the time the Wizarding World went into hiding, when wizards were actually part of the normal economy, never to be adjusted for inflation.
