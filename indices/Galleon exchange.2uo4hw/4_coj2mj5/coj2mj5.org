While world building I try to equate that a first wand for children is heavily subsidized (single ingredient costs 10 galleons) and comes out to be ('15) $250, a non trivial expense that the weasels would avoid if possible. Non subsidised that would be $1000, And the cost of an unreleased racing broom would be the equivalent of a small car $20,000.

From there we work backwards to '91 $ then the wand is $148/$575, Broom is $11,506.

So galleon = $21 ('91) and $36('15)

Harry's broom cost 547 galleons, and his triwizard winnings ($22.4k) allowed the twins to jumpstart their business instead of being mail-order.

Adults blowing out wands makes ollivanders is a sustainable business but snapping your wand is no more annoying then dropping your iphone, and Harry's broom is bullshit expensive.
