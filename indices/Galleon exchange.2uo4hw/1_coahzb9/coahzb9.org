In my worldbuilding I tied the exchange rate to the value of gold. [[http://imgur.com/8rEeFKi][I even made a calculator.]] If the exchange rate were actually Â£5 to the galleon, enterprising muggleborns would be selling off galleons and getting rich in the muggle world.

Also, (in my AU) the muggle and magical economies are more closely tied, for example magic can't create food.. a lot of it is imported from the muggle world. I also increased the size of the magical population, so even if there were magical farmers it would be hard to hide enough farmland worked by witches and wizards to feed the whole magical population.
