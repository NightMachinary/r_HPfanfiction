£5 to the Galleon comes from a [[http://web.archive.org/web/20091023035038/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/0301-comicrelief-staff.htm][webchat]] with JK Rowling although exchange rates obviously vary as she mentioned in the article and numbers throughout the series have been far from her strength.

It's also important to note that the biggest impact will be cost of living and wages rather than exchange rates. It's all very well and good saying that's only £35 and not a lot for an important tool in your life but how much is Mr Weasley (and all the other magical folk) earning? £35 an hour, day, month, year?

It's like if you go on holiday abroad, your £200 spending money will go a lot further in say India than Norway. I think it's probably also important to note that just because they live in Britain and that Hogsmeade is the only purely magical village, magical folk as a whole don't seem to have a lot of interactions with muggles and the muggle way of life so chances are there isn't a lot of currency conversion going on beyond the muggleborns.
