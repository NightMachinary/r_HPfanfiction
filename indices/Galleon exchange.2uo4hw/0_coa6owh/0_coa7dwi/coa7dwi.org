Some interesting numbers: The Weasleys won 700 galleons from the Daily Prophet draw. That was enough to take them all to Egypt, buy Ron a wand, and who knows what else with the remains. Harry won 1000 galleons in the Tournament and that funded opening WWW and all that entails. It certainly seems like galleons pack a punch.
