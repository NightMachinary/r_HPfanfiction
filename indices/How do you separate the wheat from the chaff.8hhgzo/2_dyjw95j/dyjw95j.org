Sorting by favorites can be ok if you're willing to work through the long list. There's usually still good stuff in the middle. But there's no way around manual work: Usually I click on stories that sound interesting and just *look* at the text. I can recognize shit writing without reading a single word. If it looks okay I'll usually jump to a chapter somewhere in the middle and just read 2-3 paragraphs. Very few fics survive that step. Those that do get put on a list and I'll just start reading from the beginning. But unless I'm /super/ interested in the premise of the fic it might get dropped quickly.
