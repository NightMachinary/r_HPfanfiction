First, figure out what you like and what you don't, then avoid the genres you don't. No sense reading crackfic if you just facepalm the whole way through, right?

Figure out what you're okay with in terms of completion. I tend to avoid abandoned fics. Drives me mad when I'm 3/4 through and it just stops. Is there a particular thing you have to have in the fic (e.g, horcruxes)? Only read fics written after the book that contains them came out. This is why I usually dont touch anything written before 2007. Finally, make TV Tropes your friend. Learn the tropes and watch for the ones you like.

In the end, the only way I know is reading. When you find a winner, you may not know it for a while. But when you've found a stinker, a few chapters is usually all you need.
