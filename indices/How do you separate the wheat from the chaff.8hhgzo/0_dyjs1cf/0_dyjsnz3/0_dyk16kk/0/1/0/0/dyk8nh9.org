I agree with that. The best part is arc one. Two breaks my SoD. I get a kind of perverse pleasure from arc 3 because Bellatrix is reasonable and Hermione is absolutely ready to nuke the relationship over a sudden shiny that she has no reason to choose over the entire rest of her life. I love fics that don't use "perfect Saint Hermione, who has never and could never possibly fail" from the movies, so that part agreed with me for only that reason.
