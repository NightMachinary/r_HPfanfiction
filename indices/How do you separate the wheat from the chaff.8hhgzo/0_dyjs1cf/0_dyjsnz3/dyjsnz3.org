  First, figure out what you like and what you don't, then avoid the genres you don't.

This is really a problem for me since quite a few of the ships I would be interested (for example a not insane Bellatrix/Hermione) tend to be angsty as hell and I hate angst (which is a trouble if you want to read femslash in general). Due to the stories available, I have to choose a "necessary evil" and therefore don't particularly enjoy them, even if I think that the premise has a lot of potential if executed differently. Harry/Ginny has the same problem for me, interesting premise, but lacklustre execution (IMO).
