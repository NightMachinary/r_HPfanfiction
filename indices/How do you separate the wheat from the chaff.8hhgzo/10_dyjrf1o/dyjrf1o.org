  How do you separate the wheat from the chaff?
#+end_quote

Well, first you need to thresh it. Then you winnow.

I couldn't resist.

Anyways, at this point I just look at fics sorted by update, and if the summary seems interesting or it is by an author I have read before whose work I didn't hate, I'd take a look. I used to look at the Favorites of my favorite authors, but I'm now pretty familiar with all of their favorites that I'd care to read.

Frankly, there's not a ton of wheat, just lots and lots of chaff.
