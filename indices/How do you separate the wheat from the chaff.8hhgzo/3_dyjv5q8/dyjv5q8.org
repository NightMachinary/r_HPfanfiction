You'll not likely solve this algorithmically, so to the heuristics we go!

If I want to find something quick and short, I just pop in the pairing I want and sort by favorites since shorter stories on FF tend to have higher favorites than follows. Flip that if I want to dig into something meatier.

Quality and personaly enjoyment can usually be determined within a few chapters (or in the case of long chapters, around halfway through). I'm somewhat generous and will wait it out /a little/ if the premise hooks me. But soon enough, I expect the writing quality and story logic to carry the day. If the author uses too much narrative where dramatics would work better, it diminishes the readability. Same for if they use dramatics inappropriately, because the story ends up much longer than necessary.

I look for stories where I feel the author quickly establishes the sort of pacing that keeps me interested. I tried to get into "Prince of the Dark Kingdom" recently and I dropped it in the first couple of chapters because, while the writing quality was pretty nice, something about the pacing didn't work for me. I'll probably give it another chance someday soon. Another example is the top Lockhart fic. "Amalgum". Pretty much only the first chapter (which I think was adopted from another author) was good, it quickly devolved into a tropey, repetitive mess.

I hold it against stories which rely on several HP fanon tropes. They're used the same ways so often that I start with the assumption that they will be used poorly and expect a stories I that I see use them to convince me otherwise very quickly.

That's my general approach.
