You can narrow your search with choosing characters/ships/genres you like. But the only way to know for sure is to actually read it, no automated sorting will guess exactly what you consider good or bad. I don't see a problem, really. The fun is in checking out different things, struggling to pinpoint the right one at first try is kind of pointless and unrealistic. It's not like you can't stop reading if you don't like something.
