On Ao3 I like to stick to fics that have at least 1:10 kudos/hit ratio after noticing my favorites would have that in common pretty often. I'd figured if hits meant the story was good at drawing people into it, and kudos meant they'd enjoyed it enough to stay, then paying attention to both of them instead of one of the other could be a good way to sort fics by without wasting too much time. Its definitely at the expense of a lot of hidden gems, but its been reliable so far!

I've only ever done it on top of specifying whatever pairing, characters, or timeline I'm in the mood for though. I'm lazy as hell, but twice as picky. I hope this helps, though.
