Well, I do not really have a great method, but I identified a pacing that's too fast and not difficult enough as my main problem with many fics that are otherwise considered good and therefore tend to read the first chapter and a few lines of a chapter some chapters later, if it feels too fast, I stop.

Often I also read a few comments before, thought out and complex comments are usually found under similar fics.

Bad grammar etc. are usually obvious after a few lines, easy to avoid.
