I mostly just read within my favorite genre, which is dark!Harry fics, or gray!Harry, or Slytherin!Harry. Within this realm, I look for red flags in pairing and descriptions and opening chapters. If it's got Harry paired with multiple girls, chances are it's power fantasy trash. If Harry's name is changed, there'd better be a damn good reason in chapter one, or I will dismiss it as Lord Kitchen Sink trash. And this is just me, but if there's a Harry/Voldemort or Tom pairing, I will be much more patient with giving it a chance. If I get sucked in after the first chapter, I will read it to the end even if it starts to suck halfway through or the pacing is horrible. I've found so few excellent fics like this that I can't afford to be super picky when I'm looking for a new one. I've read most of the well-known ones.
