what do you mean "how Luna died" ?

It makes me think of a fic though. I don't remember which one but it was maybe with an old Harry and he had to kill Luna (or was it Hermione) because she became a bit crazy. I think she was working in the DoM and they had an argument in front of the kids and Luna did something that hurt one of them (killed him even?) and Harry had to kill (maybe wandlessly) her to stop her and never got over it completely (duh)
