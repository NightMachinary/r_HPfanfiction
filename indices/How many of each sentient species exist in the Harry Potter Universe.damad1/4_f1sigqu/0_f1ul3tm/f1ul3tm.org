Was suprised the Harry Potter wiki gave this number. Apparently there used to be hundreds of tribes but they got hunted to near extinction in between wizarding wars because they sided with Voldemort in the first one. Then being secluded to a remote mountainous area somewhere in Northern Europe, they felt cramped and started killing eachother. According to the wiki though, a bunch fought during the second wizarding war so some died that way. Then it's unknown if the survivors went back into hiding or were executed by the Ministry. So actually less than 80, probably by a lot. Maybe even only Gwamp (Hagrid's ½ brother who faught for the Light) and then the two ½ giants we know of in the story, Hagrid and Madame Maxime.
