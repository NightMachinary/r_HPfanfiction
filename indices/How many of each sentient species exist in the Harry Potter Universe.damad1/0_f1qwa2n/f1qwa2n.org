There's over 100 house elves at Hogwarts and that's the most in any dwelling in Britain. Meanwhile Grimmuald Place only had one. It seems like Barty Crouch and the Malfoy's only had one as well. Not sure if that's accurate but only one is mentioned. If we're keeping with JKs estimate of there being 3,000 wizards in Britain (which I personally think is lowballing it) and the average household is about 2.5 and let's say only 20% of households have an elf... That's 240 + the ?110? at Hogwarts is at least 350 house elves in Britain.
