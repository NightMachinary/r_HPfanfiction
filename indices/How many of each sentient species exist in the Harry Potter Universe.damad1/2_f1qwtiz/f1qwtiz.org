There has to be enough goblins to run the main branch of Gringotts in Diagon Alley plus the branch in Hogsmead, along with any other branches that might exist in the other wizarding villages around Britain. They're also miners, blacksmiths, and mint their own coins. So I'd say the goblin population in Britain alone is somewhere in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands.
