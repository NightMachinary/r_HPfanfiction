Super interesting points! It's hard to find info because most of the info puts wizards at the centre. There is this quote from the FBaWTF book that describes "beings" as /"any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws."/ The way it's worded could imply that magical creatures are separate the actual magical community?

But we do know that some werewolves have created their own communities since they are shunned so much from society- I feel like we can kind of assume that this is the same with Goblins, they only interact with wizards for business, and we don't exactly see them wandering around the rest of magical britain (other than HPDH). Also with centaurs- we know there is a kind of community in the Forbidden Forest.

I feel like specific numbers gets complicated when you have to take into account wizards who are also veela, half giant, werewolves and even obscurials. And we don't know how other wizarding governments around the country regard creatures, maybe they have more respect and place in everyday society? It's kind of reminding me of the different between Satyres and Fauns in the Heroes of Olympus book series.
