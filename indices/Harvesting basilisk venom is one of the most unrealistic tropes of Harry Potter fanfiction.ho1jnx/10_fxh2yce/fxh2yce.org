Another question came to mind as I was looking at this post. A medium size rattlesnake (Eastern Diamondback) is 3-6 feet (split the difference 4.5 feet). A large rattlesnake is considered 6-8 feet (split 7 feet).

A medium rattlesnake delivers 12 milligrams of venom. A Large rattlesnake delivers 20 milligrams of venom. That's a 2/3rds increase in the amount of venom delivered for a 2.5 foot increase in size. The Basilisk was 60 feet in size. If we extrapolate from the rattlesnake that should result in 1,526,511 milligrams of venom per bite (or converted to milliliters) 1526.511 milliliters eg 1 1/2 liters of venom.

Now in canon we know the fang goes into Harry's arm but it doesn't come out. Which means any venom should go into his arm. We know that a snake can control whether it will use any venom (dry strike if none) but that's doubtful that happened here as the Basilisk was in a fight and had lost it's eyes, and was trying to kill Harry at the time.

So the question is why didn't Harry's arm get flooded with venom? Yes, I understand plot hole/story reasons but without the snake actually squeezing it's venom sacs to inject venom there would not be any venom in the fangs (basic hypodermic needle) to kill the diary Horcrux. I doubt a snake of that size has the muscle control to only allow a few drops out. Besides which a few drops wouldn't make it to the end of the fang.

So at a minimum there should have been a half liter of venom in Harry from a bite that used only 1/3 of the normal venom. Which should have resulted in venom pouring out of Harry's arm.

You can also extrapolate venom sac volume where you will get roughly 48 liters (which tracks nicely with many fics that "harvest" the Basilisk).
