I would hardly say quickly. Harry got bitten, climbed down the face of Salazar, walked to Ginny, listened to Tom monologue for a bit, spent a good half minute stabbing the diary, watched as Tom died and Ginny woke up, and then Fawkes cried on him. I'd say that would take a good 3 to 5 minutes, at the very least. If the venom was as corrosive as Rowling said, then Harry would be dead by then. Also, when talking about the magic system set up by Rowling, I think you have to take it with a grain of salt.
