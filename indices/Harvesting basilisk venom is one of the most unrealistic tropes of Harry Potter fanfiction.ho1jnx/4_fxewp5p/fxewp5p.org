Without going to fanon, we know canonically there are materials available in setting that can resist it. Goblin steel for one, given Godric's sword. We have no indication in canon that it's reactive with glass or stone, either.

You're treating it as corrosive, when it's simply described as magically poisonous enough to do irreparable damage to horcruxes. It didn't dissolve Harry on contact after all, and he was bitten directly. It was just going to kill him by poisoning had Fawkes not stepped in.
