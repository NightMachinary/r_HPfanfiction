I think you're making a baseless argument by assuming that corrosive means it will destroy everything. If that was true then the venom would eat right through the basilisk itself wouldn't it?

You're also confusing venom with an acid, which it isn't. You can make a good argument that the basilisk venom destroys horcruxes because it's such a powerful venom that it destroys the very soul of an object and therefore destroys the horcrux.

But let's just assume it's corrosive like an acid. Acids are generally stored in glass/plastic containers, even very strong ones. Fluoroantimonic acid is probably the strongest acid that is known currently. It will eat through almost anything, so we have to store it in containers lined with Teflon. But we can still store it in those containers.

I personally hate the harvesting the basilisk trope as a plot point. I find it to be a very lazy way of getting Harry lots of money/magical artifacts/other things he might need for the authors plot. But it makes sense. Also just because the author doesn't describe every nuance of how it's harvested and what type of glass it's being stored in doesn't mean it's being harvested into some regular glass vial. It's a magical world, whose to say the glass isn't enchanted or something and the author just didn't feel like describing a scene where Harry goes to a shop to buy a bunch of basilisk venom resistant glass vials.
