destructiveness is not all encompassing. destructive substances are destructive to some materials and barely react at all with other materials. real life acids are stored in glass flasks.

basilisk venom destroying horcrux is a magical property, it doesn't tell us anything about how it would react with a glass or metal container. even if it was too volatile to be stored in glass or metal, it comes from inside the basilisk, so a container made from basilisk skin, bones or flesh, or if all else fails the venom sack itself should be able to contain it.
