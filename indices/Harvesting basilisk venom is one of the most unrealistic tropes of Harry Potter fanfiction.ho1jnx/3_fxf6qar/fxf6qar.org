You're making a baseless assertion. I get that you like your idea, but it doesn't mean you're right. Just because it can destroy a horcrux doesn't mean it can destroy a glass vial, and it doesn't mean it won't react to this "air container". After all cesium (one of the most reactive elements) ignites when exposed to the air, but does just fine in glass (under vacuum), so why don't you think basilisk venom wouldn't be the same?
