One i would think that if you harvested the venom sacs themselves you could store the venom safely. As far as how corrosive the venom is it still may be safely stored in Pyrex/glass vials as even the most corrosive acid can be stored in similar items. Also do we know if Basilisk venom is not actually two binary agents that are mixed when they reach the fangs? IIRC IRL there are snakes that have two types of venom they inject. So why not have the "king of snakes" have something similar.

As far as I recall every item in canon that the venom came into contact with was a material that an acid could corrode (metal, flesh, paper). Also, instead of the Sword of Gryffindor being destroyed by the Basilisk venom it incorporated it into itself. Thereby suggesting that there may be a method/material to contain/store it.

So while your initial point is a good discussion topic I think the conclusion you reached is flawed.

Edit: not sure if anyone else mentioned it but Harry's arm (flesh, bones, blood vessels etc) wasn't dissolving from the basilisk venom (if it was as corrosive as you suggest) rather he was dying due to the poison aspects.
