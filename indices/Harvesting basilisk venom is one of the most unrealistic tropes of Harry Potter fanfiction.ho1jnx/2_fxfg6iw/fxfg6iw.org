I like the idea that the basilisk venom destroys magic AND is extremely corrosive and poisonous to a living being, but it would act normally, as a Muggle potent acid, which can be stored, on normal, no-magic things. The basilisk venom destroys the magic held in the Horcrux, while the item destroying part comes in from its natural corosivenes... After all, after magic is destroyed, some founder Items are no more than a cup of gold, a locket and a diadem of silver.
