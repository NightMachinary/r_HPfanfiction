People can knock [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5200789/1/The-Life-and-Times][The Life and Times by Jewels5]] all they like but its really good!! The writing is lovely, there's a lot of drama. I liked the characters. I love the real enemies to ... less than enemies builds. I got mad a Carlotta and Shelly. And Remus wears a fedora and I cried when things happened!

It was good! So many emotions! Good time, 10/10
