  They are able to literally grow bones back from nothing but can't fix Harry's eyesight so he doesn't need glasses.

For all we know, healing magic might rely on the body's own view on how it should be 'whole', and given that Harry's poor eyesight might be an inherited trait (iirc James needed glasses from a young age, too), and thus to some degree determined by his very own DNA, any healing magic would act as if his poor eyesight is how it should be. I even had a crackfic idea that involved Harry practically bankrupting himself through repeated LASIK eye surgeries being performed on him that get undone any time he winds up in the Hospital Wing.
