1) eyes are very complex... Bones are easy, eyes are spooky... Maybe it's just difficult.

2) I mean, I know absolutely nothing of middle eastern culture, clothing or currency (for example). If wizards wanted to know they could learn fairly easily but if they're not coming into contact with it then why should they know?

3) same argument for music. I don't know any rap.

4) With the last thing, I like the idea that it's just an unspoken law to keep the Sorting Hat a secret from first years. Like Santa.

Though realistically, all the first years knew about the sorting hat apart from Muggleborns (and Harry) and Ron who grew up with older brothers who of course would take the piss out of him at every opportunity because God knows I do that with my younger brothers.
