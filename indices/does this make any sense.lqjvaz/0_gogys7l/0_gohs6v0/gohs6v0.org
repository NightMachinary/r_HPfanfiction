I'm pretty sure it was at least implied that none of the first years knew about the Hat. I think that readers think about the Hat a lot more than most characters do, mostly because of the Sword of Gryffindor. As far as pretty much every character is concerned, the Hat is just some thing that comes out once a year to do some sorting. No one talks about it because it's not that interesting to begin with, so keeping it a secret from incoming first years isn't exactly hard to do. Though I am surprised that it apparently isn't mentioned in /Hogwarts: A History/.
