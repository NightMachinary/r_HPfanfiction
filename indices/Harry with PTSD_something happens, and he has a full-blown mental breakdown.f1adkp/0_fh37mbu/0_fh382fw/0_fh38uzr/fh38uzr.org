I would argue that there's a lot of James and Lily bashing. Ron and Ginny, spoilers obviously, are affected by the war very differently than Harry and are looking for different things in their life. They go after those things and when alt-harry's lies are all exposed they do the right thing and drop him. They absolutely get bashed but I wouldn't call it as badly as James and Lily.
