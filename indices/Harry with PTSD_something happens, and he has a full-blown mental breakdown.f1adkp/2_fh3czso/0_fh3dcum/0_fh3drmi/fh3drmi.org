Hmm, well what I do when I run of a specific trope, like let's say time travel. I always add a tag to the trope, like if i'm searching Draco time travel, then I'd add Gryffindor Draco Malfoy and do on.

Perhaps with your PTSD fics you can add a relationship, certain bashing's, and the suicidal thoughts tag, and warnings such as graphic depictions of violence.
