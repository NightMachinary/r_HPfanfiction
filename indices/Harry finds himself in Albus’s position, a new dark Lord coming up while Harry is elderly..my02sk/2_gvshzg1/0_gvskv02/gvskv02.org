Wizards and witches are supposed to live twice as long as muggles. The films seemed to have got everyone's ages wrong, as they had Snape, a man in his late 30's played by a man in his 60's.

So Harry being 60 would be equivalent of someone in their 30's.

Unless wizards aged at the same rate as muggles, and therefore spend 80 years immobile. Which I think both Dumbledore and Marchbanks proved otherwise.
