I don't remember the dates, but I reckon Dumbledore was in his 60s when he defeated Grindelwald. So, I thought it would be fun to have a Harry in his 60s who wants a peaceful life but is still sprightly enough to wage war against another dark lord.

Of course if Neville had bashed his son in the head with a few boxing plants when the boy started practicing necromancy, it all could have been avoided. Damnit, Neville!
