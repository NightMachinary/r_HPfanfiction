According to [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/dumbledore-family/albus-dumbledore/][hp-lexicon.org]] Dumbledore was born in August of 1881. So if he defeated Grindlewald in 1945 like [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Duel_between_Albus_Dumbledore_and_Gellert_Grindelwald][Harry Potter Wiki]] says then he would have been like 63 or 64 depending on the time of year , if I've done my math correctly.
