Harry had ignored the Prophet's news reports. Even with Skeeter long gone, the paper's propensity for sensationalism hadn't lessened a bit, something that irked Hermione to no end. He'd also laughed when the reports of the new dark lord hunting down old pureblood families had come. It was propaganda, he told himself. The ministry wasn't happy and was trying to shore people against the poor boy for his more explosive (slightly!) Ideas on old war criminals.

It was only when Luna sent a tropical bird with a letter asking if Harry was up for a challenge of a new dark lord and whether he's give Quibbler an exclusive that his eyebrows shot up. That day, Harry re-read all the articles about Lord Frank Longbottom, the upcoming dark lord, and here he was looking forward to a quiet 60th birthday with Ginny and the kids.
