Harry sat frowning over the newspaper. Another person had disappeared. A half-breed, just like the last three cases. Harry knew it was no longer his job to look for active cases. Younger Aurors had this job. There was a reason he retired. He was no longer the man who had defeated Voldemort. No longer the man who broke all records when it came to catching dark wizards. He was still Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, but there he didn't need the quick reaction time of a young man. He was still a powerful wizard ... some claimed him to be the most powerful wizard of their age. But he was painfully aware that he could no longer keep up with a younger, dark wizard.

So by the time the first wizards and witches came along - Aurors he'd trained himself, former students who'd attended his occasional guest appearances at Hogwarts - asking for his help, he was torn. He was 116 years old - nearly a year older than Dumbledore had been the day he arranged his death.

He felt every single year when Diagon Alley was attacked for the first time. Two of his great-grandchildren had been there ... no, not just there, they were the target of the attack. With their Veela blood they had inherited from Victoire and their werewolf-blood, they were considered half-breeds of the worst kind. Teddy's son was beside himself, demanding that Harry has to do something. The dark wizard was too powerful for the Aurors, Harry was the only one who could do something against him.

So it came about that Harry found himself on the Hogwarts grounds. The headmistress, a woman young enough to be his granddaughter, let him into her office.

"Harry, you aged well," the portrait said.

"Hello Professor," Harry greeted his old mentor.

"Headmistress Jones said you wanted to see me."

Harry nodded, then buried his face in his hands.

"A new dark wizard rises. He is powerful, maybe even more powerful than Voldemort was. And we know nothing about him. Professor ... they all expect me to save them again. He fears me. I know that he is fears me. He leaves Godric's Hollow alone. But I'm too old. I know I wouldn't stand a chance against him if I had to fight him face-to-face. What shall I do?"

"You already know the answer. Are you here for advice or to calm your conscience?"

Harry sighed, smiling sadly. "Maybe a little of both."

That evening, a group of about thirty wizards and witches gathered at his and Ginny's home in Godric's Hollow. Some of those present had fought by his side almost a hundred years ago. Neville and Hermione. Ron was no longer by her side, he had died peacefully in his bed nearly a decade ago. Maybe he was the one who got lucky. Ginny, of course was there as well.

But most of them were young. Some with fresh faces, barely older than Harry had been when he defeated Voldemort. Talented former students handpicked by Neville. It was them who would win this war. Harry doubted that he would see it's end.

"Welcome," said Harry. Ginny squeezed his shoulder. "At the first meeting of the new Order of the Phoenix."
