It's almost the mirror image of this, but in one-shot [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27669059/chapters/67709576][The Dark Lord Option]], Harry pulls a prank at the Careers Meeting that has him assumed to be the next Dark Lord. After graduating, he uses that position to keep the Ministry from corruption (He's /the/ Dark Lord, only he should be dealing with bribes and miscarriages of justice) and slaps down would-be Dark Lords (he's /the/ Dark Lord).

When he has a close call due to getting past his prime, he pulls a Dread Pirate Roberts to make Dark Lord Potter seem immortal.
