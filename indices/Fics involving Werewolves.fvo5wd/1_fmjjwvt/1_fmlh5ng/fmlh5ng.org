It's an interesting concept, certainly. I've never read a fic quite like it (particularly the philosophical discussion in the first chapter) and after reading said first chapter I kinda want to read more of it just to find out what the heck happens next. So, yeah. Thanks for the rec, and thanks for writing it. :)
