[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3639659/1/A-Bad-Week-at-the-Wizengamot][A bad week at the wizengamot]] always amuses me, same as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a wish]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/][Where in the world is Harry Potter ?]] .

All are amusing in my opinion (not as some purely crack / parody) but the plot is decent - good :)
