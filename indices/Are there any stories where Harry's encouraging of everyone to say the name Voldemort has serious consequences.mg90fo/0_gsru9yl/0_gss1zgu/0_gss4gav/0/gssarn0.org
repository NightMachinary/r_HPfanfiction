I wasn't even thinking about the taboo, more about how basically only Harry and Dumbledore are the only people not to refer to Voldemort as You-Know-Who, or He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named; then combining that with the whole "fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself" line from Book 2, which I felt was rather condacending on Hermione's part given that she didn't grow up in the magical world, and therefore had no first-hand experience on just why being deathly afraid of Voldemort is completely sensible. And more than a little ironic, given that she herself picks up the nomenclature later on.
