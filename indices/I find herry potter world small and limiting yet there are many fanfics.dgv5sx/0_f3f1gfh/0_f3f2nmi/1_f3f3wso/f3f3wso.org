Well i think that if you ignore the 60% of the fan-fics that are just the author trying to put his actions in the one of the main characters for X reason.

The thing about FF is that it takes a bases of the story that you know, and mould it into something different but still relatable.

An example can be the Alexandra Quick series; that even though it has almost nothing to do with the HP series as a whole only mentioning its events a couple times, it still includes that magical feeling that some people might be attracted to.

However in most cases the fanfics are basically the same story but just in a different light.
