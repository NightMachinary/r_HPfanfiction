You can kill the main character, though. That's the nice thing about fanfiction. You could write a “what if Harry had really died in the Forbidden Forest” and explore that. All the horcruxes were gone, would the others have won without Harry or would they have lost? Another nice thing is that you can explore relationships and events without having to come up with a whole book of background story.
