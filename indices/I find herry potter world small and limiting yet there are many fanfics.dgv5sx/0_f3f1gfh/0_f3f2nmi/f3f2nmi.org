I understand it just that when you write a new novel you write many characters and new creatures and even create as many faction as you want but in fanfic your are sort of limited and can't even kill a main character let say for example naruto. In most feamos naruto fanfic you see that they are limited what the original writer wrote like villages and clans or the same power structure and most enemies are only those you knew, nothing new
