I've never run out of fanfic to write about and I stick to the very narrow path of canon compliancy. There are just so many characters and untold stories to explore.

Then, of course, you can get onto AU and canon divergence. It's not my personal cup of tea but the imagination and creativity and breadth of writing possible is extraordinary, and there are just endless possibilities.
