HP world is adoptable. We can add any type of creature real or mythical or imaginary. Can create spell/potions to do any work. If you are interested in politics just make wizengamot, a chamber of lords. You've quidditch for sports fanatics We are not limited by canon characterisation as except main trio, none of the characters are focused much.

And we have a single villain and followers, so it is easy to write plotline around how to defeat them so it is hard to make your story mess.

Harry Potter character is very likeable. Almost everyone can see themselves in his place. He has the potential to become very powerful wizard magically/politically/finacially. You can pair him with any character of your choice. Lots of girls with different background. Want bad girl pair Harry with pansy or a slytherin with no background you have Daphne/Tracey/Astoria, or a blood traitor Ginny, government girl like Susan or muggleborn/best friend like Hermione, or sports girl you have chaser trio, Indians? Patil twins, Asian? Cho, Su Li, MILF? Narcissa, Hot older girl? Tonks,Fleur...

It is easier to introduce Harry in other fandom crossovers. He can fit into other superhero crossovers seamlessly.
