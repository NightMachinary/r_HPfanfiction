I really wish there was a good fic that had the Marauders (and Lilly and Snape) reading the books, I've found a few but it seems none ever get too far, it'd be so cool in my opinion seeing how the characters react to future events, especially Snape and his future as it's easily the most interesting out of all those characters that remained alive and were in the books
