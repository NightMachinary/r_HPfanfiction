I like [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977403][Dramatic Reading]], it is very well written, but there is only one and half year of the Harry's schooling.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1779118][Hogwarts reads the books by spirithorse16]] has more years covered, but it is not that well written. It is just text of JKR books slightly commented, not the real stuff as the other one.
