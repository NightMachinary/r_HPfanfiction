This is a bit of a tangent, but there is a point on the serious-crack scale where tropes I don't like become enjoyable.

On the too cracky side, there is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9655837/1/Harry-Potter-Becomes-A-Communist]]). It was pretty funny for a couple of chapters, but I lost interest.

For comparison, I typically hate harems, because I can't see that kind of relationship working between actual humans. Dragons? Sure. Multiple women going out with a single man and being 100% ok with it? Not happening. Still, I found linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13491812/1/Twins]]) very entertaining.
