I recall this fic, but cannot for the life of me remember it.

As for age gaps, in my view it's more about life experience than actual age, which is why Tonks and Harry doesn't bother me as much. There are times when a smaller age gap would bother me more than a larger one, depending on details. Tonks is immature for her age to a degree, and after all the shit Harry's done, he's mature for his age in some ways.

It'd definitely require some work, but I can see it. It's definitely questionable in real life, however, due to a lot of reasons.
