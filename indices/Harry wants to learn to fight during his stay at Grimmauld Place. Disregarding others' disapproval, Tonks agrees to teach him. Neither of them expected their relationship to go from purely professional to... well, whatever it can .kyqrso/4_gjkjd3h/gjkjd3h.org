Coming back to the original point, there's a fanfic that I can't remember the name of, but it has Tonks actually working for the DoM and she decides that she wants to help Harry so she trains him through the DoM. Has anyone else heard of this fic? (I'm not entering the age gap argument as my parents have a 18yr age gap)
