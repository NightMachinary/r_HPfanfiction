Rule 34 buddy.

But yeah, it would probably fit better a sibling/best-friends/partners-in-crime relationship where they are close, confiding with each other about their problems, offering mutual support when needed and even causing some mischief together, like Tonks infiltrating Hogwarts to take Harry for a night out in town to cheer him up about Umbridge and he giving her council about her relationship with Remus, maybe they even brainstorm the best ways of teaching the DA.
