The gap isn't as important as both being consenting adults. Fleur/Bill and Lupin/Tonks were adults more than capable of making their own decisions about what to do with their bodies and who they wanted to spend their lives with.

Harry in this situation would be a 15yo child so him having a crush on her would be normal, she being interested in him, having a relationship or whatever would not be ok, even if the age gap is the same or smaller then others.
