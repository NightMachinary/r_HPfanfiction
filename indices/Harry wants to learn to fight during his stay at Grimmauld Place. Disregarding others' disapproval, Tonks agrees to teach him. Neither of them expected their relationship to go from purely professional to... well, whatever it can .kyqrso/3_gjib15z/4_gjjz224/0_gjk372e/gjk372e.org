Fleur was 20 and Bill was 26 when they started dating. If you'd like to follow the half your age plus seven rule, that still works out. Even if you don't care about that rule age gaps are less of an issue as people get older.

Lupin was 35 and Tonks was 23 when Tonks was pining after him. It doesn't pass the rule and even without that, there are more than a few people that are uncomfortable with the Remus/Tonks relationship. Even though the age gap is a little uncomfortable for Remus and Tonks, they are both consenting adults. Harry is a child in OotP and that's significantly more relevant than age gaps. Any 23 year old that can look at a 15 year old and say yes, I'd get romantically involved with this person right now has issues.
