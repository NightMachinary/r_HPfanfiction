You have to go by the world in-story. In a song of ice and fire Daenarys is married off at 13 and while her case in particular is forced in that world in-story marriage and all it implies is ok at that age. In the real world 17/18 to 24 is still squicky and would definitely have overtones of the older person taking advantage of the younger. But in-story its not only fine but its somehow feasible the advantage taking is reversed. In that world love potions that can make someone ignore their SO to pursue someone they've never talked to (Ron/Lavander/Romilda) are not only legal but can be bought at you local prank shop. Krum(above age) is never even questioned about Hermione(under aged) when that heated love triangle story got printed in the national paper. So we already have examples of huge age difference being ok and rape (implied attempted regular and implied possible statutory) being completely ignored and/or ok in this world I dont see how combining the two would be too much in this fucked up world.

also so i dont completely ignore this point of yours, Remus was much more concerned about his woe is me, I'm a monster who could never have a relationship shtick. the other characters (who weren't annoyingly fatalistic people who were looking for any excuse to avoid possibly being happy and hoped one stuck) didnt care, not even super judgey Molly.
