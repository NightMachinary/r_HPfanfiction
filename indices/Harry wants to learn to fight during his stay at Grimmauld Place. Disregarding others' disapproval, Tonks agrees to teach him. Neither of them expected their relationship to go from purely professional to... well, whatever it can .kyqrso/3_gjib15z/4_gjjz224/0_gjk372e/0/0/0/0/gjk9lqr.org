"You have to go by the world in-story."

Funnily enough I don't actually have to do that. This request exists in the real world, this conversation exists in the real world, the author of Harry Potter exists in the real world, and the authors of fanfiction exist in the real world. So I feel like using real world standards to say that relationships between adults and children are not appropriate is the right way to go.

Hermione and Krum were 15 and 18, not really a major concern even in the real world and protected by Romeo and Juliet laws in most states even.

Regardless of them, or Remus!Tonks, or Bill!Fleur, or love potions or anything else, my point stands. Nothing in universe says relationships between adults and children are appropriate. You are the one saying that. You are the one arguing that it would be accepted with no evidence to support that claim other than love potions are messed up but accepted, so this other messed up thing should be accepted too. That's a false equivalence.
