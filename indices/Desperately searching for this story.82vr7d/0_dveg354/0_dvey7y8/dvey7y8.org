Wow! Thank you so much for trying! Just clicking the old Portkey account was an amazing flashback to my teens! So close and still so far! :(

I found an author who wrote a sequel to that story and I reached out to him, he didn't saved it either... it's really the most bizarre thing! No one has it! First it took me a long time to even find the name of the author, and when I finally found the story, it seemed as it never existed!

Thanks so much for trying! I truly appreciate it! You have no idea! This was a story that stuck with me... and every couple of years I would return and read it. Clicking the name and not be able to read it... soul crushing! :'(

And it has to be a sign that I must persevere and have hope! I just heard the Harry Potter theme song out of the blue! (Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them started on my tv!) :) You truly are the best!
