I've been trying to locate this story to no avail here for the last hour or so. I did figure out its original URL as it appeared back in its heyday on portkey, however not even archive.org seemed to have it saved. Interestingly, I do seem to be able to access her other works. The problem might be that since this was an nc17 fic, it had an extra page for warnings of adult content, and the actual fic was not saved...? Maybe? I don't know. It appears as if the story was deleted off the site sometime by 2006 december (two years after its upload)... ?

The original URL directly to the fic was: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/3418]]

I'm so sorry I really wanted to help find it. I'll leave these links here in case someone much smarter than my humble self can actually make this dream come true! :(
