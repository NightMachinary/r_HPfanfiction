Michaelsuave goes for a 'one level up every chapter' approach in his rpg story. It works well for a lot of people (including myself), but its quite understandable why seeing the same long stat text again and again when Harry levels up gets annoying to you.

My story goes a bit slower than his. The level ups(and thus showing the stats) happen in chapters 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 18 and 30.

Notice how the chapters between the level ups keep growing? That's because of a level up system that doubles the experience requirement at every level up. 400 for Lv2. then 800, then 1600, then 3200 and so on. Currently, at chapter 31, the experience requirement for next level is 819200.

That's pretty much the method I use to reduce the repetition of stats to minimal amounts. Its also helpful in making sure that the character stays OP, but doesn't really go to God levels.

Do you think that as a reader something like that would work for you in a story?
