Howl For Me by KittenShift17 is pretty good, and that's coming from someone who usually hates Dramione. I stopped reading it the first time because I found another story that piqued my interest, but I'm reading it again and am finding it quiet enjoyable.

The Trouble With Marriage Laws by Freya Ishtar is also pretty good from what I've read of it. She reposted it after deleting it, but I didn't read it before that so I'm enjoying the weekly updates she's promised. It is a triad fic though, with Harry being the third in the relationship, so be warned if you refuse to read him with Hermione.
