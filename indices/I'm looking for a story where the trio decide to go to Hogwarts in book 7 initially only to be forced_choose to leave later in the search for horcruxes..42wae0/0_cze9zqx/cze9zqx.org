  I prefer if it's relatively canon compliant.

Uh. How would that work? They ran away from Death Eaters at the wedding then...just got on the train a month after learning about the locket? Hogwarts was run by *Death Eaters* that year. The entire government was.

They /knew this/ September 1st, as they hid in a house being watched /by Death Eaters/:

  “What's happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He are Hermione had been pouring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their scattered parchment. A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a headline that read:

  SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER

  “No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly. Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying story out loud.

  "/Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor."/

Snape was Headmaster and Harry knew he was looking for them...so...what? They think hiding at Hogwarts will somehow work better than raiding the Ministry for a known Horcrux?

Maybe if they miss the paper that morning and instead stupidly head to the train station...

  Harry stumbled off the train, glasses broken and askew, nose still bleeding. No one had tried to stop the Slytherin prefects from ambushing them the moment the trio got onto the Hogwarts Express. Even hiding under invisibility spells (they couldn't all use his cloak), they had set off some noisy alarm and spell fire had come immediately after. Long hours and several brutal beatings later the trio was shoved out onto the Hogsmeade Station platform and straight into the darkly looming presence of the newly appointed Headmaster Snape.

  "Mr. Potter," the Headmaster said, his voice cold. "Arrogant as always, I see. What did you expect to find here...if not your undoing?" Snape turned to a grinning Malfoy. "Throw him in the dungeons along with the blood traitor and the mud-blood. I will alert.../him/."

No, no. That wouldn't work. I think any straight-forward seventh year at Hogwarts would be strictly AU.
