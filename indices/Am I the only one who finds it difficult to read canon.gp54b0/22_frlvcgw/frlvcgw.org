No. Even the best fanfiction doesn't come close to canon. Let's start with the story you say is better than canon, the "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][game changing]]" fic for you.

In Evitative, the first half of the chapter is merely a recap of canon. Why do I need this? If I'm reading fanfic, do I need a reminder of the source material?

Harry is whinier than he is in canon OotP, which is saying something.

He finds a book which talks about Shadow Walking which to use you need to declare yourself to the Dark. New magic isn't necessarily a bad thing, but something called Shadow Walking is a definite red flag.

Even the author acknowledges that Harry should be wary about reading books on Dark Arts, but he isn't. This is the same Harry whose mind jumped to "dark magic" when Hermione asked him what he would think if he suddenly saw a doppelganger of himself walking around.

Every time something intelligent manages to come to the forefront, "something" makes him hesitate to do the smart thing.

Then Sirius tells him the story about James and how he got mad at him for teaching him Dark Arts. Harry feels guilty because James got mad at him for something "so small" which is just terrible writing. Just a couple of hours prior Harry could think of no worse magic than dark magic, yet suddenly it's not even a big deal.

And it just continues from there. Dark Arts isn't really bad, it's just misunderstood. Except we know that's false, as both the Cruciatus and Killing Curse need a certain mindset which is decidedly *not good*. So the author fixes it by calling those types of mind altering spells Black Arts, thereby creating a whole different type of magic system in order to push their bias about light/dark magic. And /of course/ these dark art books have the solution to healing curse scars, which light magic can't do. Because, of course, healers in the wizarding world would skip over an entire branch of magic that could help so many people because of whatever prejudices exist. What heals dark curses best? Dark magic! What do light magic users not use? Dark magic! Too bad for all those afflicted, I guess.

Harry isn't wary at all about these dark magic books. He jumps into them with enthusiasm. Decidedly not something Harry would do, being taught the last 4 years that dark magic was not something to be trifled with. It's not something anybody would do. There would need to be gradual acceptance, not just a switch turned on to make dark magic all of a sudden acceptable to him.

Then Harry gets to Hogwarts and is placed into Slytherin and all of a sudden everyone is nice to him... because Snape tells them to be. Snape, the man who enjoys making children cry because his feelings were hurt when Lily rejected him. The man who detested Harry from the moment he laid eyes on him.

This fic is bad, and that's without getting into the terrible pairing. I'm almost positive it's going to turn into a fic that glorifies the dark, bashes the light, makes Ron into the worst person alive, Malfoy into the best person alive, and Snape into a misunderstood saint. It's not original. It's full of excruciatingly bad tropes. The writing style is average at best, and doesn't hold a candle to Rowling's. The author's bias was immediately obvious from the very start. Events happen not in any sort of normal fashion, they just happen because the author wants them to happen.

You know what would have been good? Conflict when Harry goes into Slytherin House. No Snape telling them to treat him well, but conflict between Harry and a group of teens who have been at each other's throats for more than 4 years. That would have been somewhat interesting to read. But that doesn't exactly fit into the author's bias does it? Ron has to be bad, the Slytherins have to be friendly, and Malfoy has to tone down on being a massive dick in order to play Harry's love interest from here on out.

This is far from the best fic out there, and the best fic out there is far from an edited, cleaned up, published work from JKR. It's a bit weird that you're so aware of all the flaws canon supposedly has, but hype this fic up as something legendary when it's not even mediocre.
