I realised after reading so many fanfictions I much prefer a darker, more morally ambiguous harry that truly seeks to become powerful. When I read canon, or honestly any fic where mercy and the power of friendship is prominent I feel like punching something. Thats not really a reflection of the Canon stories, but a main theme of the stories is to completely forgive people because they stopped supporting the bad guy, which I always felt is a horrible lesson to teach children
