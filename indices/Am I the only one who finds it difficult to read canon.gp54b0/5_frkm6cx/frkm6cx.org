Depends when you first read it & if you have nostalgia. I love canon. I also love fanfics. They aren't warring in my mind, nor do I take any one fic /as/ the definitive story. All of life could have gone in multitudes of other directions depending on circumstance and choices. I love how fanfic can explore in real-time those implications and offshoots.
