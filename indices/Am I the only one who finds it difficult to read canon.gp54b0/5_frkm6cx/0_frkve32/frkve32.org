I agree with this statement. I did not read the series until 2010 after my mother died (guilt). Wr were both readers and would read and discuss books together.

My mom was very into the series and had followed it since release. She kept trying to get me to read it then, but I was in high school/ university and didn't want to read about children. Once I started seeing the movies with my mom on opening night, I did not have enough interest at the time to start reading them.

In the summer of 2010, I sat down and read the series nonstop. I discovered fanfiction because I wanted answers to how Lupin & Tonks got together. I started reading others and down the rabbit hole I went.

I have read some very high quality fanfiction. I came name three authors whose HP fanfiction I read who now are published. There are some fanfics that I have reread more than cannon.
