I love canon. While I also like fics there is just so much... edgy teenager stuff. And rape-y stuff. After that canon is like a breath of fresh air. It's so much more innocent and nicer. Now don't get me wrong I don't mind sex and/ or violence. But they should be used sparingly and be integrated as much as possible with the plot. Lots of fanfics have sex and violence every other chapter and it just gets old. It loses its shock value. This is why George losing an ear or Molly shouting "Not my daughter, you bitch" has a greater impact in canon than Hermione and Draco getting it on for the third time in two chapters in a fanfic- for example.

Not to mention reading canon brings back childhood memories and the feeling of holding a book is altogether a different one to just staring in a screen. Reading fanfiction brings back memories of... being depressed and trying to fill the void with pointless pastimes.

Also canon was created (or at least published) over the span of 10 years and has gone through professional editing. It's more polished than any fic. And I'm sorry, but as much as I like fanfics they are usually a pastime for people who go to school and/ or work and simply cannot focus on writing all the time.
