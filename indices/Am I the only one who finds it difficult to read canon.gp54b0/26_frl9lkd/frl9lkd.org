Not at all. Canon might have plotholes, but it is /way/ better at getting me emotionally invested than any fanfic I've ever read. Sure, fanfics might make more sense on paper...but often that's all they have. They don't really give me a reason to care about the characters beyond "You cared about them in canon, so you should care about what happens in this story."

I don't really get emotionally attached to the characters or plot at all. The stories don't suck me in. They are good for what they are, but they literally only work by standing on the shoulders of canon - they /need/ you to care about the characters and world before starting to read them because the fics themselves rarely devote the time to make you do so.
