I've never read a single fic that matches up to canon. It's easy to say some fanfics are deeper than canon, but they're already built off canon in the first place. So praising them as better than JKR isn't fair, as they didn't create a million word original series.

Take away what's JKR's in the first place and what do most of these admittedly great fanfics have left? Probably not much. You can't dig a 5 ft hole inside a 10 ft hole and say you dug a 15 ft hole. Similarly, you can't give a built house a new paint and claim credit for building a great house.

It's very easy to take a work that's already been scrutinized by the millions, give your little "fixes," and then pretend it's better than the original. Well, sure, but only because you didn't even do most of the work.
