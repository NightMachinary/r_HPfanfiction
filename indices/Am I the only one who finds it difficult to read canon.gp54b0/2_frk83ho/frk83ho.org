I find it somewhat annoying, but it is the source material that originated all the fandom I love and also I remember how good the story seemed the first time.

The thing that actually makes it annoying is the contrary to many of my favorite fanfics the cannon focus on the characters interactions almost exclusively, so there is not much on world budding and the whole magical system is used more as something to advance the plot rather than an element of it (It isn't something bad per se, but even though it happens in the magical world it kind of takes some of the magic out of it when you are reading again, you know).

Plus when you re-read any book, even more when it's seven, you will remember the consequences of the characters actions and know beforehand more of the possible resources they could use to solve their problems, so you will naturally point it as plot-holes, the fact that with the fandom we read the plot-holes seen by hundreds or even thousands of other readers and their solutions to it makes us look at what actually happened at cannon and think it silly, kind of like when we remember some story from our childhoods and think about how dumb we used to be, even though at the time everything seemed logical and our actions justified.
