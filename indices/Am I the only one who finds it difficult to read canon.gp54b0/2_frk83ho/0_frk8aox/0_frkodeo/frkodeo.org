Yeah, things that don't make sense about canon: why couldn't Harry's obviously unedited memories of Pettigrew in PoA, or of Voldemort's resurrection in GoF, or of the Dementor attack in OotP be used? Why can't he make a Magical Oath that he's telling the truth, or use Veritaserum?

Why didn't the Twins ever notice Peter Pettigrew hanging around Percy or especially /Ron/ on the Marauders' Map? And if they did see his name at either point, why didn't they ever ask "Blimey, who's this Peter fellow you're such great friends with? It's a bit strange to be sharing a kip in bed at your age, innit?"

Et cetera, et al, you get the picture. So many things are introduced that would have made earlier plot contrivances actually surmountable rather than simply unwinnable, but having Harry succeed wouldn't have made it easy for him to sacrifice himself our whatever, yeah? The fact that Dumbledore is the one who shares most of the new plot hole excavators is what makes it so easy to look at him as a manipulative dastard.
