Never liked any fics with any of those tropes except the trials for death eaters after the war. I wouldn't want adults taking care of Harry all the time and shielding him from danger. His dangerous adventures are the reason I read the books. Too much babysitting by adults destroys the scrappy teenager vs larger than life villain dynamic.
