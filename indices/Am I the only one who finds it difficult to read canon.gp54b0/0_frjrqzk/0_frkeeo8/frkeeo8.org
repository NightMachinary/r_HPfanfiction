For me, it was not so much a single fic as the accumulation of a bunch of issues which fanfics address. In canon, nothing is done about the Death Eaters after the war. In canon, there is no consequence from the Dursley abuse. In canon, the only relationship with no issue is Cho/Cedric because Rowling is not good at writing them and quite a few suffered from plot demands. On a similar note, in canon all "good" adults are useless at best and dangerously stupid at worst because the plot demands them to be. And canon is Dumbledore wank despite his action.
