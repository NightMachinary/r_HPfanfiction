Draco committed enough war crimes to warrant execution by allied standards (for perfidy), nevermind his repeated attacks on civilians, his use of unforgivables and so on. After Bellatrix, he is the Death Eater who commits the worst crimes we see. To see him free shows that the justice system failed completely.
