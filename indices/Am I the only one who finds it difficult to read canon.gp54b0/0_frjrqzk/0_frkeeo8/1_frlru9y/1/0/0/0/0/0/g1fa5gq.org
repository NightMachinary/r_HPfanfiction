except thats not fucking true you lying prick use of child soldiers have a very clearly defined status as a war crime for the recruiters.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_and_reintegration_of_child_soldiers]]

the paris principles covers the reintegration of child soldiers and to have them not be regarded as the perpetrators of war crimes.

this big attempt to circumvent that would go as follows as pasted directly out of the wiki.

In the wake of the Sierra Leone Civil War, the UN mandated the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) to try former combatants aged 15 and older for breaches of humanitarian law, including war crimes. However, the Paris Principles state that children who participate in armed conflict should be regarded first as victims, even if they may also be perpetrators:

... [those] who are accused of crimes under international law allegedly committed while they were associated with armed forces or armed groups should be considered primarily as victims of offenses against international law; not only as perpetrators. They must be treated by international law in a framework of restorative justice and social rehabilitation, consistent with international law which offers children special protection through numerous agreements and principles.[81]

This principle was reflected in the Court's statute, which did not rule out prosecution but emphasised the need to rehabilitate and reintegrate former child soldiers. David Crane, the first Chief Prosecutor of the Sierra Leone tribunal, interpreted the statute in favour of prosecuting those who had recruited children, rather than the children themselves, no matter how heinous the crimes they had committed.[80]

jesus dude, their kids man. im sorry draco wasn't beaten to death for your amusement, his life and the lives of his parents being threatened would have given him pretty clear mitigating factors as well in just a normal court.
