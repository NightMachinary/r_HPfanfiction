The first ten or so treaties on the laws of warfare had no provisions for child soldiers because it was pretty common for teenagers to flock to the colours without coercion and they were held responsible just like an adult, not that they committed many crimes in the first place. And Malfoy was not ordered to commit most of his war crimes (assassination of a leader outside of a battlefield being the only one I can think of), he came up with those plans on his own.

Funnily enough you mention pressing child soldiers, that's what Malfoy did to Katie Bell.

Edit: Mitigating factors only apply if the threatened offence is worse than the committed. It is therefore not a valid defence for charges of attempted murder since there isn't something worse than death when it comes to threats. That kind of ruling is pretty common with gang related violence.
