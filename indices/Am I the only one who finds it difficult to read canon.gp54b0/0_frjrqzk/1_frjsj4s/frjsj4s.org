THE game changing fic for me is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1637290][evitative]] and the authors making it a 3 part series, she's writing the second currently. Harry is resorted into Slytherin but it doesn't follow the classic tropes or cliches of slytherin!harry. It's an AU of OotP and I know it's going to be hard to read that when I get there (I'm on GoF currently).
