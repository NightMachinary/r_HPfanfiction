Read this recently, and I can respect that it's competently written and /radically/ better than 99% of Slytherin Harry stories out there. But I didn't like it and don't care to read any follow-ups.

I just couldn't get over my disbelief that the 5th year Slytherins would so sharply and immediately turn around and be inclusive and respectful of Harry (not using the word "mudblood" in his presence, e.g.). 15 year old kids just aren't that thoughtful and respectful.

That and it almost immediately turns into "Harry Potter but Harry gets this extra super-awesome power!!!" where the power in question is Dark Magic.

Don't get me wrong - it's good, and by the standards of fanfic it's great. But it never clicked with me.
