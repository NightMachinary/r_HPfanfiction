THANK YOU!

This has been my major problem with evitative!

Slytherins become even more mary sue than Gryffindor. Even in Gryffindor you have annoying and sometimes mean characters (Lavender, Comrick, etc), but suddenly in evitative, Slytherins are kind and friendly and misunderstood. All they needed was some love and understanding to change them. It's frankly weak writing.

You have the potential for a ton of conflict, and it is just ruined.

Secondly, Sirius as a dark wizard makes no sense as canon. It would have been better and more in character for Sirius to have rejected Dark magic (as he did in canon) and be against Harry's fascination with it. However, as a loving God father, he finds a good mentor for Harry (Andromeda) when he really wants to become one.

The author took the easy way out instead of developing good conflictual issues. She is even more black and white with the Slytherins than Rowling is with the Gryffindors.
