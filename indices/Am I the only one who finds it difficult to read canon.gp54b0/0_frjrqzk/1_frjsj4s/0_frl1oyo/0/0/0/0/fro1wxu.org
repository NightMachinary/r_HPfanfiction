Agreed, and even worse is the fact that I could /totally/ see the likes of Narcissa and Andromeda being *thrilled* at a "Dark Harry" and then there's finally conflict between Draco/Lucius and Narcissa.

She'd spent all this time coddling her little baby boy, but suddenly her son is failing when it comes to something so much more important that some upstart sociopath Dark Lord - he's neglecting The Dark and choosing the "Dark" Lord just because Potter turns out to be a Dark Wizard.

Where's the year-long tension between Draco and Harry, with Draco getting pushed further and further into self-recrimination and self-doubt until he finally snaps and has to make a choice - Father and Voldemort vs. Mother and Dark Magic (oh and by the way, if he chooses the latter, he'll have to be mature enough to surrender his hatred of Potter).

Where's the low-key "keep it in Slytherin" bullying that Potter has to endure from Nott and Parkinson (or maybe some 6th/7th years), because when Harry tries to talk about it with Ron and Hermione, Ron just acts like it's Harry's fault for being resorted into Slytherin and Hermione just wants to tell a teacher, and when Harry /finally/ talks to Snape about it, Snape laughs at him and asks him if he's too much of a baby to handle his own problems?

I mean fuck it, if we're going to go with "Harry Potter Except Harry has This Super Power" then where's the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome][Crowning Moment of Awesome]] where Harry busts out some fucking /terrifying/ Dark Magic to finally put Nott and Parkinson in their place, and establish himself as the indisputed co-leader of 5th year Slytherin with Draco.

I'm not a huge fan of slash, and I thought the slow-burn Draco/Harry romance was done reasonably well, but the author could've made it SO much better by contextualizing a bunch of other conflicts within that romance. Eventually Draco chooses Mother/The Dark over Father/Voldemort /because/ The Dark includes Harry rather than in spite of it. Eventually Slytherin could come to accept and follow Harry precisely because Harry is a Dark Wizard.

I mean just to take one tiny example - quidditch. Where's the tension between Marcus "I FUCKING WANNA WIN QUIDDITCH AT ANY COST FUCK YOU PUREBLOOD FUCKS I'D PLAY WITH A MERLIN-BE-DAMNED HOUSE ELF IF IT GETS THE W" Flint and the rest of the bigoted team? No, Harry just slides right into the Seeker position (there's not even jealousy from Draco b/c he'd rather be a chaser!!!) and all of Slytherin immediately loves him for winning the match! Where's the beaten-down Harry who has to deal with scorn from his old Gryffindor friends /and/ his new Slytherin teammates because neither one is actually happy with him, and how does he react to or resolve that tension?

Ultimately, Evitative is one of the most disappointing fics I've read because the author does SO MUCH right - they have a mastery of the mechanics of written English and have a ton of fantastic ideas about where to take a Slytherin!Harry story but seem unwilling to commit to building a story that properly builds and resolves the tension that any good narrative needs.
