Not knowing what the Q stood for is being disrespectful? I did ask what it meant, even if i could have been a bit nicer.... so ill do that when i ask this follow up question.. When did queer become it's own category? Growing up for me that was a derogatory term for a homosexual. If it doesn't mean homosexual what is it? And if it does isn't it covered already in the LGBT group?

I'm actually getting fed up with the "tolerance or else" attitude people take on this matter. As if your opinion is more valid than mine just because you don't agree with mine. How does me not liking slash stories harm anyone? One less reader/view count? I wasn't the original person you were arguing with, but I felt the need to stand up for their rights to have an opinion. I don't bash, i don't hate, I argue with fellow Christians who try to use their religious beliefs to condemn LGBT people. Is being straight a crime now? Does being turned off by homosexual acts make me evil?
