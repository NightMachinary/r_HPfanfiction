I'm pansexual, but I don't always want to read straight couples. Nor do I always want to read gay couples. I think it's healthy to show a more equal balance of each, regardless of any given author's sexual preference or any reader's sexuality.

I think you're a little biased in saying that the characters are "clearly straight". The obsession Harry has for Draco, and again I'm reinforcing that I don't really like the Drarry ship but I can see where they come from, can very easily be framed in the light of a misinterpreted crush. And if you can ship Hermione x Harry, then Ron x Harry isn't a stretch if you take gender out of the equation.

Being straight and not wanting to read anything other than straight couples /always/ is precisely what it means to be intolerant, even if you don't really realise it. If you can't even deal with it as a side thing, or as a minor romance/soft fluff (I can understand not wanting to read porn, lol), then you're projecting a bias against non-straight relationships onto what you read. I'd rather read Ron x Harry than see a single 'nother Snape x Hermione fanfic, personally.

Also: remarks like "what the hell is the Q?" don't really show you in a good light..? From my perspective, it feels derisive and like you didn't care enough to look it up. For the sake of education: LGBTQ = Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, Queer. Queer's the umbrella term that encompasses everyone else, yeah? All the people who don't want to choose a specific label, who aren't mentioned directly, etc. Could do the longer acronym that goes to LGBTQIA+, which is Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, Queer, Intersex, Asexual.

And I didn't insult the previous poster before; I did, however, go through their post history afterwards and noted that they have an absolutely abhorrent history of racist attacks and general asshattery. So, you know, homophobia is on trend for them.
