  I think you're a little biased in saying that the characters are "clearly straight". The obsession Harry has for Draco, and again I'm reinforcing that I don't really like the Drarry ship but I can see where they come from, can very easily be framed in the light of a misinterpreted crush. And if you can ship Hermione x Harry, then Ron x Harry isn't a stretch if you take gender out of the equation.

Being biased in what i enjoy isn't a crime so long as i'm not censoring what others can enjoy. Everyone has their own bias. Yes, Harry's obssesion can be stretched to interest, and if people want to read that more power to them. I didn't specify anyone, but i guess since this is a sub for hp fanfic I wont hold assuming i meant Harry against me.

  Being straight and not wanting to read anything other than straight couples always is precisely what it means to be intolerant, even if you don't really realise it. If you can't even deal with it as a side thing, or as a minor romance/soft fluff (I can understand not wanting to read porn, lol), then you're projecting a bias against non-straight relationships onto what you read.

I think you took what i said wrong..probably because you were looking for "intolerance". I was talking about the erotic stuff. I have read stories labeled as slash. Even if it was the main pairing. And as hypocritical as it is femslash/lesbianism/bisexual females doesn't bother me at all. I find that beautiful(and not just in the erotic sense). Surprise slash(20 chapters in a guy who has been straight and had no homosexual thoughts is suddenly madly in love and making out with another guy type stuff.... if their was no romance before this i'm ok with it) usually makes me drop a story, but that's because i don't like being mislead.

  I'd rather read Ron x Harry than see a single 'nother Snape x Hermione fanfic, personally.

Amen to that.

  Also: remarks like "what the hell is the Q?" don't really show you in a good light..? From my perspective, it feels derisive and like you didn't care enough to look it up. For the sake of education: LGBTQ = Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, Queer. Queer's the umbrella term that encompasses everyone else, yeah? All the people who don't want to choose a specific label, who aren't mentioned directly, etc. Could do the longer acronym that goes to LGBTQIA+, which is Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, Queer, Intersex, Asexual.

Yeah i admitted in my other reply that was not the best way to word that. And thank you for explaining. I don't get out much and last I payed attention it was just LGBT(which before you make any more assumptions, my niece fits the T and while i will always call her my niece, i do love her to bits and she knows it.). I knew what all of them but the Q stood for.

And to be honest, that IS mostly because I don't care. What you do with your life only effects me when you make it. If you want to live your life in an "alternate" lifestyle(who came up with that term anyway?) then more power to you. Just don't try to force it on me.

  And I didn't insult the previous poster before; I did, however, go through their post history afterwards and noted that they have an absolutely abhorrent history of racist attacks and general asshattery. So, you know, homophobia is on trend for them.

Well.. that's understandable i guess. I just see a lot of "I don't agree with your opinions and thus you are an intolerant "insert insult here"" comments thrown around lately. Especially on this subject. Live your life. Let me live mine.
