Please- do yourself a favour and look up the definition of homophobia. Literally speaking, it means fear of same things (homo meaning same). You have a dislike and a prejudice for the LGBTQ community and I find it stunning that you would attempt to deny that with such a shallow excuse.

I hope you can eventually come to accept us as deserving of relationships. Drarry isn't a ship I enjoy, but I wouldn't dare put down a good piece of fic because SHOCK HORROR THE BOYS HAVE FEELINGS.
