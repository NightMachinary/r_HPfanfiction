you don't have to read gay ff, like that's fine, you don't have to enjoy it - a lot of queer people don't either, but you were blatantly disrespectful towards the lgbt (Q meaning queer if you want to educate yourself), and that is the issue. I deal with homophobia every day - this isn't just being over sensitive to people on the internet. Sure have your opinion, but you need to realise how harmful it can be, and when people are like â€˜i'm entitled to my opinion' yeah you are, you're just going to have to deal with the consequence for said opinion.
