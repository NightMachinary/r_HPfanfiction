  Please- do yourself a favour and look up the definition of homophobia. Literally speaking, it means fear of same things (homo meaning same). You have a dislike and a prejudice for the LGBTQ community and I find it stunning that you would attempt to deny that with such a shallow excuse.

  I hope you can eventually come to accept us as deserving of relationships. Drarry isn't a ship I enjoy, but I wouldn't dare put down a good piece of fic because SHOCK HORROR THE BOYS HAVE FEELINGS.

And here ladies and gentlemen, is the voice of tolerance speaking.

Having a differing opinion does not give you and excuse to start name calling and disrespecting someone.

Just because I am straight and don't really want to read about/watch gay couples enjoying themselves does not mean i dislike or am prejudiced against the LGBT(what the hell is the Q?) community. It means I'm straight and don't find reading about/watching that enjoyable.

Also, i understand your community feels under-represented in literature/media but that doesn't mean people who don't want to read about clearly straight characters being made gay are bad/homophobic/evil people.

I'm entitled to my opinion just as you are. MY feelings on the matter are just as relevant as yours. If I can accept this as fact why can't you?
