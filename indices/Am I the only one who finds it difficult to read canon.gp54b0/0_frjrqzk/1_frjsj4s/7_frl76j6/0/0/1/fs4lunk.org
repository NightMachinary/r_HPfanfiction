Sarcasm and Slytherin & souls touch, and the future changes were both orphaned but there is a user on AO3 claiming to be sunmoonandstars. They're continuing year 2 of souls touch (hopefully Sarcasm and Slytherin too!). I have no idea if they are actually sunmoonandstars but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24096307/chapters/58001593?view_adult=true][right under their noses]] looks really good and i love it!!
