LOL, I can say this applies to other fandoms as well. I have the darnedest time watching many MCU films anymore, partly because I've read so many fics that were so much better, and partly because I'm finishing a massive fix-it series and sometimes I honestly have to stop and look stuff up to see if it's canon or if I wrote it. :D
