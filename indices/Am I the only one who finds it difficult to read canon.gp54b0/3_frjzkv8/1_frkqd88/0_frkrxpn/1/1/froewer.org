your criticism is fair, and if her refreshers were similar to the “previously on” example you used it wouldn't bother me. My issue is that on book five she reiterates things which have already been reiterated in books 1-4. I understand the joining books mid-series, which isn't something I addressed and is completely fair. The only issue with that is that people starting on book 3, for example, aren't the majority, though it's still fair criticism.
