Read the Drizzt Do'Urden......whatever the fancy word for 13-book series is called. Salvatore (the author) doesn't feel the need to constantly explain what a drow or dwarf or elf is; he doesn't reiterate what Crenshinibon is; and he certainly doesn't reiterate at length who each character is because there's the assumption that you have a working memory that lasts more than a week.
