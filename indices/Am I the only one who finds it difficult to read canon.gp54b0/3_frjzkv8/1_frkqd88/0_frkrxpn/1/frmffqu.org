That's pretty normal for most series books. (And other media honestly, think of “previously on”) most people are not gonna reread the entire series when a new book comes out or if they're picking up their favorite book or the next book after quite a while of not being involved. The Hunger Games, almost all of Rick Riordan's books, and most other YA series before and after HP do this. HP was not a guaranteed success and I know that I have started more than one series in the middle as I didn't have access to the first one right off the bat. Sorry for the rant, your criticism just rubbed me the wrong way a bit.
