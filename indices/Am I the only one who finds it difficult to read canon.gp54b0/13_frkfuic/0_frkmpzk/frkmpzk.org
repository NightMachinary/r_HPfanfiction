What I especially like is that, unlike some other slytherin!Harry politics!Hogwarts fics, DPSW doesn't get bogged down by exposition and politics.

Its strength imo is the character interactions in such a scenario. My favorite scenes are just Harry interacting with his allies and adversaries and them interacting with each other. Everything else, while well written, comes second.
