Well... The thing is, that fanfictions are generally based on canon, right? That's the basis for it all. Since fanfictions expand on it so much, it's almost like you're narrowing your perceptions of the whole thing by going back and reading canon. It's like something I saw somewhere, Harry is the least observant person you'll ever meet. Since it's mainly from his point of view, there are so many parts of the wizarding world you'll never get to see in canon. In fanfiction however, creators are free to dream up more or less whatever they want. That's what makes it so great. Because of that, canon is just so /bland/. The world-building in some fics is absolutely insane. The fic that really did that for me was /Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches/. The pairings there are slightly icky but really not the focus at all. This fic expands so much on magical concepts and pureblood politics that it's impossible for me to ever look at canon the same way again. It's crazy, almost all of my headcanon comes from that fic.

Edit: I've gone back and reread some canon, and I was genuinely impressed by how /in depth/ it was. Maybe it's been too long since I've read an actual book, but I was really impressed. I learned a whole bunch of new things that I'm sure I glazed over the first time. Sure, fanon can be great and really fun, but looking again, I don't think I've seen anything better than canon. Sure, Harry's not that observant in canon, but he still gets told a /lot/ of stuff by other characters. For example, there was this massive paragraph focusing on how the Ministry organized the Quidditch World Cup. I don't know if it's just me, but I found that fascinating.
