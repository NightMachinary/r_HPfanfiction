I love re-reading canon. Yes, of course there are tons of unexplored or underrepresented issues, but then you can't put everything in the books. And there are fanfictions which are great in their own right. There are even points where I disagree with canon, and which usually ignore in favour of my headcanon. But I really like Rowling's style. Re-reading the books is like coming home.
