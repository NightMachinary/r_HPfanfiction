Same, I can't find it in myself to read canon after reading so much fanfiction.

Not sure it might be because of how overexposed I already am to the well concept at least, or how the 7 years of Harry Potter went as the basis of all the fanfics I've read. Such that it does get boring if it's just that.

Might change in the futurre though!
