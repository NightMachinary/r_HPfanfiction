Well I have read quite a few and canon has become a distorted version. I love bits of canon but oh the fanons are incredibly amazing. Got in it with The Merging. Now that is a good story and the writer has used all the tools to keep the magic alive.

Love and support to all who have made this story even more beautiful and engaging even after so many years.
