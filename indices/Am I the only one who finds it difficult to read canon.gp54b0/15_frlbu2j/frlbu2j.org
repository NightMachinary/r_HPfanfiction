There are a lot of fics that are better than canon in important ways but no one has come close to that feeling of warmth and love I somehow get from canon.

I agree that canon has no good romance, the total idiocy of the war is unbelievable, the worldbuilding is shallow, etc but the people somehow feel so real and sympathetic that I love reading about them.
