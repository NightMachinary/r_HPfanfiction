I actually was only interested in Harry Potter because A. A lot of Fanfiction. B. A friend was head over heels for it.

I decided to try to read the whole series first, but books don't fascinate me as much as Fan fiction anymore. I only got through The First book before I turned to Fan fiction. Even then I only read up to the Chamber of Secrets.

I doubt that I can ever read Harry Potter without pointing out flaws (In my Mind) or plotholes or just be angry at something. Canon just feels so wrong. Harry is a Gryfinndor. Not a Hufflepuff, a RAVENCLAW, or a Slytherin (though I want him to be.) Gryfinndor is always going to feel wrong to me, because that is not what I know him as.

Twilight is going to feel wrong to me, because of Fanfiction that has changed my views. And I dont even know if this answers your question sorry. I just can't connect with the story anymore.
