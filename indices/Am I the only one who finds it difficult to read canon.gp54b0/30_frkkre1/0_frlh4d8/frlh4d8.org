The story itself just uses magic and the magical world to further the plot and it's not exactly a main part of the plot itself. I don't think I'm describing exactly what I mean, but close enough. It's specifically built as an emotional and character-centric story and less on the whole magical world itself, as all stories are. It's Fantasy, and only meant for entertainment. When you know what's going to happen, you don't get the same enjoyment from rereading it. Of course, the emotions in the later books are strong and those are pretty fun to reread. The first book sucks to reread imo though.
