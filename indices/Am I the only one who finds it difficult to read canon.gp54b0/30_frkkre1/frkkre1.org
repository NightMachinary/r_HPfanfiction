I totally agree with you. I don't really have any desire to go back and read canon- I think I would get kinda frustrated tbh, haha. The original series is more targeted at kids and it shows. As the series goes on, I do feel that it gets a bit more mature, but the plotlines get less interesting imo.

Additionally, while jk rowling was certainly creative enough to come up with the series, she could've done so much more with it. She's not very good at world-building.
