To be honest I haven't re-read them since the first time (the last 3 I read at launch) and until I have children I don't think I will. I loved OotP so much (it's an important cornerstone in my reading life in so many ways) that going through HBP just made me angrier and angrier. And DH was just an asspull for me that going back to the first ones would just make me sad about how it ended.
