I read book 6 for the first time since I was 11 a few weeks ago and yes, I found it slightly boring. I can reread books countless times, but for some reason whenever I pick up Harry Potter.... it's hard. I think because nothing really actually happens in the books. I mean, they go to class, have a few adventures, but basic philosophies aren't questioned. I can reread Dostoyevsky thousands of times because each time your brain is turned on and you're forced to think. With Harry Potter... well it's, to me, what Martin Scorsese described marvel films: entertainment. And the thing is with pure entertainment is that it's boring when you know what's going to happen. FanFictions often contradict basic plot lines or go out of their way to widen the horizons of the wizarding world, giving more context and depth to magical theory and so on.
