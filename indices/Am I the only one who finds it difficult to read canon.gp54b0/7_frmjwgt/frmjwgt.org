I know people in this subreddit like to hate on canon in favor of fics, but I have never read a fic personally as well written as JK Rowling's series. There have been fics with aspects done better than JK's Harry Potter, like world-building or the magic system, but as a whole, no one has done all of it better, and definitely no one has ever written the characters as well as JK. Her character writing makes me fall in love with the books like nothing else. It's the magic of Harry Potter. Not the castle, not the magic - the characters. That is canon and home to me.
