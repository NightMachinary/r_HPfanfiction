I loved the canon growing up but like all the fics I'm into are like here's a more interesting deviation or here's a better way of presenting something like this. And like there's a ton of meta and analysis fic writers can use as resources. So...i mean kinda makes sense that there are loads of fics better than the books for a fandom this big.
