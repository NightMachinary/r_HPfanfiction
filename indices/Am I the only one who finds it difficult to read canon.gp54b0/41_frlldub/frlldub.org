I haven't read canon for a very long time but I think it unfair to compare reading a single series to its entire fandom. Reading canon is not like reading a fanfic: it is the source of all. But it's still "only" the creation of only one mind. Fandom is created collectively. It is therefore much more rich and diverse. There is also not only one series to read but hundreds at least. Even a single fic is created comparatively to established creation and can therefore explore something else. Something new. But the thing is, canon is the initial step we all take to explore this universe. It creates th√© universe when it was still totally New for everyone. I think rereading canon is like trying to come back to this first step: that's can either mean reviving the initial innocent marvelousness of it or remembering all the new ways of seeing things discovered as Fanfic reader. Either way, I believe it to be an interesting read.
