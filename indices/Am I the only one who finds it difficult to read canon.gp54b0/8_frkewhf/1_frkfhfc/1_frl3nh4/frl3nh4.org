Like others have said, Cursed Child is not a canon book. My definition of the series proper is the 7 books that follow Harry Potter's journey as he comes of age and defeats Voldemort.

And so far, no, I have not come across a fic that can beat out canon. I've been through the favorites of FFN, I've sorted, filtered, and finally scoured through AO3. I've never come across a Harry Potter fanfic that I comes close to canon for me. Everyone's just too busy thinking about how clever they are for finding plot holes, or making their OTP work, or finding reasons to slam characters they hate. Sometimes I'll come across a fic I like. It's intriguing, the characters seem to be within canon range, and the story introduces new elements that fit well within the world; then I get to the end of the chapter and I realize that I'm at the end of what's written and the story hadn't been updated in 2 years..

The original series has just over 1,084,000 words, and it's all wrapped up in a relatively neat, clean cut package. You point out what you feel are flaws, but what about the overwhelming amount of positives for the main series? The sheer amount of intrigue and drama, the feeling of whismicality, the wonder of discovering a magical world, the rich characters with actual depth and realistic development over the course of the series.

People love to point out how broken Quidditch is as a sport, but to me, Harry finally winning the Quidditch Cup with the original Quidditch team is such an emotional high point of the series, and I can't think of a fic that has even attempted to replicate that, much less acknowledge how amazing that moment was. It was just a sportsball game, but it meant everything to that team. They put in so much effort to see it complete, and /finally/, Harry and the team got Oliver Wood his championship.

Nor have I seen a fic manage to match Harry's grief as he rages in Dumbledoe's office after Sirius died. His frustration and anger and hurt. It's a feeling that I know and understand better than when I last read it over 10 years ago.

A lot of fanfics just can't get me emotionally invested into their stories, whereas even after a decade since I last reread any of the original series for the 20th time, just thinking about those scenes invokes exactly how I felt reading the books back then, plus over the years, my own life experience has added even more emotional context to those scenes and other scenes in the book.

The original series is just so emotionally rich. I can't find a fic that matches it.
