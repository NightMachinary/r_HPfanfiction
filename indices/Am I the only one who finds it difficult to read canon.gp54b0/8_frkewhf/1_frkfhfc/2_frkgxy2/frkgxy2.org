Cursed Child notwithstanding, the HP series as a whole is a proper published work while fanfiction is, well, fanfiction. Let's be honest, if someone has the time and skills to write something novel-quality they wouldn't be using said time and skills to write a fucking fanfiction, and even then it wouldn't have the professional proofreading/editing that a book would get. Don't even get me started on the fact that using a pre-established setting for your work is infinitely easier than working from a blank page (for the people complaining about the world-building and shit being unsatisfying). As a whole I'm not surprised that fanfictions are not as good as the books.

Granted I've haven't read as much fanfictions as some here but I've tried the ones recommended by [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] and most of the well-received works on DLP so unless I've missed a looked a looked-over masterpiece I don't know where to 'find some better fics then'.
