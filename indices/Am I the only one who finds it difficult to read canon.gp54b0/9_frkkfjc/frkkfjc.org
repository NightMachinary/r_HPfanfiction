I've been reading fanfiction for a long time, and I have yet to find a fic that I love more than canon. However, I will admit, that since I've read canon so many times over the last ~20 years, that actually sitting down and reading the series can be a bit of a chore. Gets boring when you know everything that's going to happen, and even those occasional moments when you discover something new about the series are getting few and few between.
