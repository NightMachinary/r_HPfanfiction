Yeah, it feels... lacking.

There are stories, like The Prince of Slytherin (by The Sinister Man), which slamdunk the original works into the dirt. Sure, it is easy to write a story, based on an already established story, but what stops Rowling from rewriting her books? :O or maybe allow someone else to do it.

Yeah, that should be done someday. Not an entirely new story, but one where Harry wins because of smarts, hard work, and loyal friends (Hermione is ok, but Ron... well, he needs an improvement). Canon was mostly based on luck, luck, luck, luck, and even more... luck.

I wouldn't mind if there was an actual /'...power he knows no/t' That will definitely allow the chance to 'boost' Harry with something that increases his odds. Something like a /Mage Sight/, for example. Nothing too ridiculous, but believable.

Maybe Dumbles stops showing Harry his porn-collection of young Riddle and trains him instead into a powerful wizard.
