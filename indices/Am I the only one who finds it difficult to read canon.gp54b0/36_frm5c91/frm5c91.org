Short answer for me is no.

The biggest shortfall For me was the execution. I read fast and love to read. This comes with the issue of I read a lot of books. When I read Harry Potter I found very notable things I disliked and, to be honest, I don't think JK Rowling is all that great an author. I did love the idea. To me the concept was amazing and I wanted to see what others did with it. That's why I found fanfiction, because I was disappointed with the canon execution of what I deemed an amazing setting.

A much more extreme example would be my relationship with SAO. It's easily the worst thing I've ever watched but the concept was so good I needed to look for similar things and found Log Horizon. To this day one of my favourite shows.
