You're not the only one. There are a bunch of little things that make me just sigh and shake my head sometimes. Most recently I was reading PoA and when Harry wants to tell Ron and Hermione about Sirius Black on the train, Ron immediately tells Ginny to go away.

I mean, it makes sense he would do that, and it's not out of character, but a big part of me wishes he would have just asked Harry if it was alright for Ginny to stay. Mostly because I'm a hardcore Hinny shipper, and if Ginny were in the compartment Harry would have remembered about the chamber happening instead of being solely distracted by the new murderer on the horizon.
