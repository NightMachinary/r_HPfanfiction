linkffn(Big Trouble in Old England by meteoricshipyards). Crossover with "Big Trouble in Little China," and great fun.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Alternate Tournament by twistyguru). Harry is entered as a student of the "Poppins Institute." Also fun, but hints at slash, for those who want to avoid it completely.

linkffn(Mistaken Identity by BajaB). Not NSFW, but kind of a dodgy situation.

linkffn(Agent O by Rorschach's Blot). Fun with terrorists.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion by Driftwood1965). Funny, but I found it overly sophomoric in parts. YMMV.
