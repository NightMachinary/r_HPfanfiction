Mina Harker is the wife of Jonathan Harker, the protagonist (mostly) of the book Dracula. Dracula turns her into a vampire, sort of. In the original book, being vampirized is like an illness that gradually makes you waste away, but you don't become a vampire unless you actually die from it, which takes a fairly long time. Her husband and friends kill Dracula (and his brides) before she dies from it, freeing her from the curse.
