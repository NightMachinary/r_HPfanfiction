There are multiple Minas across various works, anime, manga, games, table top rpgs. All go back to Wilhelmina Murray, Jonathan Harker's fianc√©e in Bram Stoker's novel. Dracula bites her which causes her to have visions, leading the "hunting party". Now that I think about it, maybe that was an inspiration for Harry's mental connection to Voldemort.
