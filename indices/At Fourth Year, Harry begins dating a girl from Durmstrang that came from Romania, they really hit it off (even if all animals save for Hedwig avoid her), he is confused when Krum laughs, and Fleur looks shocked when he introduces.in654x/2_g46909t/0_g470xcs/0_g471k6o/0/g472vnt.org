and 9/10 are Harry/Male normally from twilight. Not saying that's a bad thing but man it's impossible to find Harry/Female Vampire that is long, interesting, and not pwp. I can think of 3 off the top of my head and they are Harry/Hermione Harry/Rosalie(abandoned but decent) and Harry/OFC that is the slowest read. Need more of this type of Fic for sure.
