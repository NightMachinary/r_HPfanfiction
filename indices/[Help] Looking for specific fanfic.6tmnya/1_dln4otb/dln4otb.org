No idea to the second one, but the first one sounds sort of similar to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10781599/1/Androgynous-Lover][Androgynous Lover]]? It's a long call here. But it has a ring Horocrux Tom gaining human form claiming to be Tom Riddle's kid, and there's a scene where Ring vs Diary vs Voldemort spirit.

I'm scratching my head if there's another one similar to your specifications though. Will post if I recall more.
