For the HP/LV one, I'd go over to [[/r/HPslashfic]] if no one here knows what it is. There are a number of fans of that pairing there. They tend to be fans of the horror aspect of the pairing and not so much the stories that make the dark good and light bad. So if the story is more like the former than the latter, you should have some luck.
