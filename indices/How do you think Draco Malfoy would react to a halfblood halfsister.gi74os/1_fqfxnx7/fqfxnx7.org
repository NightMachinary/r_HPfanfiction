Firstly, if we're talking about Draco /before/ the start of the SWW, he wouldn't believe it. He'd be in complete denial. The only way he would /actually/ believe it is if he receives DNA proof, most likely. Also, who'd be the father/the mother of the half-blood half sister? If the half sister is /younger/, that would mean that one of his parents would be guilty of infidelity in their marriage. It wouldn't really make sense for the sister to be younger unless either Lucius or Narcissa were unhappy in their marriage. I could imagine someone writing a fic about this and making Narcissa and Snape having some sort of affair (since you're suggesting that Draco's half sister be half-blood), but I don't really think Narcissa would be unfaithful.

Maybe I can write a fanfic exploring this. Who knows? This is just my opinion on the situation.
