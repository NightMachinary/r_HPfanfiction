He wouldn't believe DNA evidence, because of it's Muggle origin. You'd have to bring in the inheritance test trope.

Looking at it from a historical standpoint (since Wizarding Society seems to be a few hundred years behind Muggle society in manners and customs), there is a precedent for acknowledging illegitimate children. But since Draco's pureblood snob parents are unlikely to acknowledge a halfblood by-blow, that wouldn't have happened. Therefore, the "proper" thing for Draco to do in that case is to utterly refuse to acknowledge the relationship, to the point of ignoring the person altogether.

For one thing, an acknowledged sibling might be entitled to part of his inheritance.

ETA: OMG, I can't believe I said it's instead of its. *Hangs head in shame.*
