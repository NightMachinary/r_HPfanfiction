i guess it depends on when? if its like they were raised together then I assume he'd be nice-ish to her even if the parents favored him. If she shows up when hes in school that might be kinda world altering for him if he holds his parents in high regards still. He might be in denial be dickish to her to keep her away. If its post hogwarts i think the concept would bother him less. It would be awkward I think. I doubt he'd want to get very close to her just because they were related. He might though be interested in being friends if they shared common interests
