I'm on chapter one; Harry is talking to Draco. And...the conversation is a little too [[/r/iamverysmart]]. In combination with the "I know everything about Hogwarts speach? It's not my cup of tea.

Edit: The time travel aspect is barely mentioned. Outside hinting at Harry knowing things, it isn't mentioned at all. Not when he sees Ginny at the platform, and I'm not saying he should start making a harem. But look at Ginny and think of his wife and child? Something other than sarcasm and jokes?

I'm on chapter 3 and I've already started skimming.

Edit: And I'm out. Halfway through chapter 5. This isn't a Harry goes back in time story. This is a rewrite where Harry has better one liners. And I get that the only real tag for the story is humour. But this is just lazy writing.

Edit: I lied. Read a little more and

  In the weeks before Black's escape, he was known to mutter in his sleep about "that greasy git" and "gotta go back to Majorca." Who exactly is this "greasy git" and is Black actually heading to Spain? Only time will tell.

Edit: Soooo....I skipped 5 chapters. And chapter 10 something signigicantly actually diverted from canon! It was not even a bad twist. I thought maybe it would be a little more plot heavy for the next chapter, but it's right back to Harry, now with the addition of Sirius, making fun of people in this timeline with knowledge from the future.

Edit: Skipped 10 chapters. And Luna is in the chapter. Not canon Luna. Fanon Luna, who is the worst thing anyone has ever written. Ever.

The positive thing about this story? It doesn't drag out the plot. They are already in book 2 plot.

Edit: Skipped to chapter 25, and I'm out for real. The reason is 100% this

  "I believe so," Luna answered him, eyeing Ginny and Lockhart carefully. "But Norbert isn't." She bent down to pick up the Crumple-Horned Snorkack creature Harry had gotten her for Christmas and showed the stiff little pig-like creature to him.

Edit: I lied.Again.

Skip to chapter 39, and read it like an AU year 4 where Harry makes more funny one liners, and Sirius got an official pardon. It's actually a kind of funny, absurd story from that point.
