Hmm. I've read it before, a while ago. From what I recall, it was reasonably funny, if you like absurd humour. Not my favourite do-over fic, but a respectable writing effort.

The Lockhart angle is interesting, too, treating his canon persona as an actual joke, one that Lockhart doesn't take seriously either.

Actually it's the title that makes me uncomfortable. Either talk about God, or don't, I reckon. Saying "God" and then talking about something completely different just isn't sensible.
