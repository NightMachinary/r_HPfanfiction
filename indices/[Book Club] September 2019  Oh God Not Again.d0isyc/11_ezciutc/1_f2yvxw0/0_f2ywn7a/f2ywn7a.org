  Very rarely does someone say "omg" and actually mean to refer to God. The title is pretty obviously using it this way.

  My mom hated when I said "oh my god" and claimed I was "taking the Lords name in vain"

"Vain" means "empty, pointless". So, using "OMG" or similar phrases without intending to refer to God is exactly what "taking God's name in vain" actually means. Your mom was right :).

As a general thing, I'm in favor of saying what I mean and meaning what I say. In specific, I think using God's name without intending to address Him is disrespectful, akin to a prank call.
