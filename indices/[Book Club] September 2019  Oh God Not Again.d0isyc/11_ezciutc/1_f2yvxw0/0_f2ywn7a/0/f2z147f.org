The commandment was less about profanity and was actually about /swearing an oath/ in his name, a /shvu'ah./ It was about following through with what you swore you would do. You should not promise something in his name if you will not fulfill it.

There are other interpretations- I was once told by a pastor that he thought it's more about not committing acts in his name that are not Holy. (Really, what he was saying, is you should not call yourself a Christian, then turn around and do something unholy or against his will, while claiming his name.) Basically, I'm not saying your interpretation is wrong, just that there are other ways of looking at it!

Looking at "omg" more linguistically, I wouldn't call saying "omg" a performative speech act but more an idiom at this point, at least for me. Saying "omg" isn't actually a "vain" act, since the phrase /has meaning/ in that it means emphasized surprise or a general expression of disbelief, frustration, excitement, or anger. Like most idioms, that meaning is no longer truly connected to the words separately. Maybe that's just where the phrase is headed and not where it's at yet, though.

Honestly, language is fascinating. The way words change meaning through history, the way things change in interpretation, in both denotation and connotation... I could talk about it for hours. But this is probably not the place to do that so I'll stop now haha. You really made me take a minute to evaluate my own speech and beliefs and I'm thankful for that!
