Well, "oh god" in general is a common phrase where I'm from. It's the same meaning as saying "oh my god." Very rarely does someone say "omg" and actually mean to refer to God. The title is pretty obviously using it this way.

My mom hated when I said "oh my god" and claimed I was "taking the Lords name in vain" lol. Is that why it made you uncomfortable, or is it not a common thing where you're from?
