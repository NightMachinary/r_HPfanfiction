I remember reading this years ago and liking much of it, but some of the bad writing drove me crazy and almost made it unreadable. I remember leaving (what I thought was) some constructive critique in a review and the author flaming me for it (IIRC, she responded to every critique with “it's a PARODY” and then when I suggested a parody didn't have to have certain flaws, she insisted I didn't know what a parody was).
