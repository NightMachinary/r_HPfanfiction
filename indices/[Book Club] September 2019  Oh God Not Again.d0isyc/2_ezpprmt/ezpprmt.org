This is one of Sarah1281's weakest stories in my opinion. It's fun on a first read-through, but while rereading it I was mentally checking out until about Year 4.

Pretty much everyone is way OOC, and Snape's characterization is very annoying throughout, as it's obvious the author is or at least used to be a Snape fangirl. Luna's characterization is particularly egregious. The story would have been far better if Luna was just as clueless as everyone else, but was still an oddball.
