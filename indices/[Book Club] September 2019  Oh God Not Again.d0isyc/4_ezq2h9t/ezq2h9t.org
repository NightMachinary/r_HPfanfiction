I feel the read was ultimately pointless, the thing is this Harry didn't have any reason to go back so is meaningless from a "Main Character Perspective" since he doesn't have anything to learn nor did he have any new conflict to solve, and sice the deviations towards other character arcs are so short and kinda "meh", it is also meaningless from a plot perspective. The only thing that is mildly interesting is how he sees his mother actions, I'm pretty sure I've yet to see that perspective
