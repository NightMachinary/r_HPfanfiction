You know, fanfiction itself is already looked down upon enough as being the creation of moody preteen and teenage girls (an assumption that I and probably others find offensively dismissive). I don't think it helps at all if we use that insult against other writers/readers/fics. Some slash writers are tween girls toying with sexuality, but others are just people who like toying with an (and unfairly taboo) aspect of what makes a character who they are: their sexuality. Maybe the writers are gay themselves, or maybe they just like reading slash, or maybe they are just in it for the smut. It doesn't particularly matter; it's just another taste in fics, one that you can dislike, but one that you houldn't dismiss as "pointless"--couldn't that word be applied to all fanfiction then? I'm not trying to accuse you directly, and I'm sorry if this came across as rude. I just think that respecting other types of fics (even if you don't like them) is really important and refraining from calling them the work of dumb tween girls is even more important.
