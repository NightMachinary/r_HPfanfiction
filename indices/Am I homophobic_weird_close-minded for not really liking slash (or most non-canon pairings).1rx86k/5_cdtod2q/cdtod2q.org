Nope, it's down to personal preference. I won't read any male/male-centric stuff at all, but don't mind female/female, male/female/male relationships...

Quite honestly, it's probably because I've not actually seen any male canon characters in HP and gone 'yep, they would be good together'. Apart from book 4-5 Remus and Sirius, but that's more of a bromance thing than a 'let's play hide-the-wand' relationship.

And Harry/Draco? Urgh. Draco/any other main character makes me want to hurl. I tried writing him as nice a couple of times. The best I could do was gift him with 'magnificent asshole' status and even then he went so far OOC that it boggled the mind.

I don't like Malfoy as a character. His personality is too bloody narrow to do anything with. If he were actually evil, then you could do something with him. But he's just an oblivious kid who has no idea what his shenanigans do to him and those around him.

Him in a relationship before the end of book seven? Good luck making that a credible possibility. Him in a relationship with Harry? Fuck no. Neither of them could handle it.
