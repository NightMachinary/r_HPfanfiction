True,

I am perfectly willing to admit my hypocrisy over multi pairings(see above), most McDumbledore fic were written long before JKR said anything about him being "a little gay"; and I am also willing to admit that every slash fic I've tried to read was a tweenwriter fic, very badly done, and I'm just not interested enough to look for good ones (and probably not interested enough to read them even if they are recommended).

There are definitely thousands more crapfic that are het or gen, but that is as much due to total percentages as anything. There are lots of crappy writers and even more crappy stories.

I think the problem is the current trend on sites like FFN, if you look for any new fiction in HP, you will find a ratio of about 3-to-1 or worse, of slash to het/gen. It seems like every other post is Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape or Harry/Tom.

Honestly, I think Harry/Tom might be the only one I could enjoy due to the dichotomy. It is possible that most of those fic are actually Friendship fic and not slashfic, but if that is the case someone needs to get the word out to those authors that they need to put that in the description.
