Thank you, I freely admit my hypocrisy.

I am actually somewhat bi-curious, though that really only applies to having a third in the bedroom and not any real enjoyment I would get from having one on one male/male sexual encounter. I am not in any way attracted to men, so you are correct in that I hold zero interest in scenes depicting male on male intimacy. I have no problem with homosexual acts, have participated in a few, and yet I have no taste for reading it...

My views on women are expressly stated as being hypocritical and self delusional, but I like my delusions. I freely admit I understand lesbians, mostly because I like women so I understand why women would prefer another female to a man, especially if they are being promiscuous.
