A point about your objection to slash being that it goes against canon sexuality. I personally find it so much less believable that canon-Harry would /ever/ have a polyamorous relationship than a homosexual one. Harry beyond all else wants a family, in the very traditional sense, and he is highly loyal. He is also not hyper-sexual or overly aware of sexual and romantic possibilities in the people he meets. Compare his reaction to Fleur against Ron's, for example. He is a sexual person, but it's not that important to him -- he values trust, loyalty, and intimacy much more. I think all those translate pretty strongly to him desiring a monogamous relationship.

Your comments about female sexuality were addressed below, so I won't get into that too much. Just try to understand that your generalizations about women are not very accurate in my experience.

I am in no way trying to get your to change your mind about your own personal preferences, or trying to get you to try something you have no interest in. I just hope that you can be a bit more open minded and a bit less derisive in your opinions. The conclusions you have drawn are largely anecdotal and based off of your own personal experience, and that is not necessarily accurate. I have personally read far more high-quality, well-written slash than I have het, and I read both pretty equally. I like Harry/Ginny more than I like Harry/Draco, but I have read more high quality Harry/Draco than I have Harry/Ginny, and this is not necessarily by choice. I'll go looking for a good Harry/Ginny but get frustrated and turn to slash, because it will be easier for me to find something good. I also have read more slash that felt like it was written by adults than het, which is often very juvenile in my mind. These are my own experiences, which I could easily draw generalized conclusions from like you have done with your own experiences, but the fact that both of us have highly contradictory experiences means that neither of our conclusions would be entirely accurate.

To be bluntly honest, I think that you have some innate distaste for reading in-depth or detailed descriptions of male homosexuality, and this personal preference is coloring your opinion of the quality of writing of slash fics. There is absolutely nothing wrong with not enjoying reading about two men having sex, if that is not what you like. I don't like most harem Harry fics because I am deeply monogamous in my orientation, and on some level it bothers me to read otherwise. But I don't let that color my opinion of the ability of authors of fics with polyamorous relationships. Try not to let your personal taste color your judgments either. Doesn't mean you need to read it. Just don't assume all slash is poor quality and juvenile, because I assure you, it is not. And I have read many more slash fics than you have, I can guarantee it.
