I admitted my views on women as "all bicurious" were hypocritical, and I'll admit again that they are purely self delusional. I have nothing but annecdotal evidence to back up the claim. But I like my delusions.

I do not in any way enforce my view on women, I am just as accepting of homosexual relations in either sex, but while I tolerate male/male intimacy (and have in fact participated in it) I appreciate female/female intimacy, because I like women.

I also reject the epilogue, so we agree. And as for Jack Harkness I did call him "Trysexual" as in he'll try anything. Pansexual works as well I suppose. I've never been bothered by any scene with him and someone of the same sex because it is how his character is portrayed. I suppose changing the portrayal of a character does feel like betrayal to me, which would be why I reject seeing gay Harry as he is very straight in my mind.

We all project ourselves onto the characters we love. So my Harry would always be straight and possibly slightly bi-curious, but never Love another male the way he would a female. That is my call to make.

I am not demonizing anyone for their tastes in fiction, only the stories which I have read where Harry ends up being homosexual. In the stories I have read it is always out of nowhere (much like Harry/Ginny in canon sixth year, which I also hate, but at least that was set up in book 1)

Thank you for your concern and taking the time to reply though, you did make great points.
