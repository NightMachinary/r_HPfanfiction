I know it's been a couple of days which in reddit terms is practically ancient history, but I kept thinking about it and decided I couldn't not comment on a few of your things.

  all females are a little bi-curious [...] women are soft and loving and emotional

That's pure patriarchal bullshit. Society has told you only women can be soft and loving and emotional, so you (general) say that if a man is then he must be queer and you (personal) are sexualising the women you see being affectionate with each other. Both of these things are misogynistic. Stop it.

The idea that Harry and Draco can't be homosexual because they married and had kids is also bullshit. It's not actually that uncommon for people to not realise they're attracted to the same sex until well into adulthood, or to deny they're having such feelings or pretend they're straight because of societal/family pressure to conform. If you want to be realisitc, this is actually a thoroughly plausible issue for both Harry and Draco. Given everything we know about the Dursleys, it would be highly likely that they're homophobic and despite Harry's awareness that the Dursleys aren't people to emulate, those kind of attitudes can have lasting effects on childre; it's completely believable that he might have internalised homophobia and doesn't accept his sexuality until well into adulthood. Draco, meanwhile, is a pureblood and given their fondness for advancing wizarding families, it wouldn't be a surprise if purebloods were against homosexuality because it doesn't produce children, so he too could go most of his life pretending he's straight just because his parents spent his whole childhood telling him that if he's a good Malfoy he'll marry a witch and produce more pureblooded babies.

The idea that canon relationships are the only basis for characters sexuality is crap. The books give us seven years of their lives, and not only is that a comparatively short length of time, it's also their teenage years which is a time period at which sexuality can be explored and questioned and never quite understood. Canon is not the be all and end all, especially for those of us who reject the epilogue (and not every one does that because they don't like the pairings).

As for Jack Harkness, he's pansexual. That is, he's attracted to everyone no matter their gender. (And no, that's not the same as bisexual.)
