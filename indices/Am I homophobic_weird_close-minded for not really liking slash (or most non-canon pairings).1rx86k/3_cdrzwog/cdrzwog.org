The term "homophobic" is greatly overused. Including in ways that don't make any sense.

If you don't like the taste of broccoli, you'll probably avoid eating it. Does that make you broccoli-phobic? Are you somehow prejudicially insulting people who do like broccoli? Should you feel ashamed, or fear that people will think less of you because you don't give broccoli equal access to your taste buds?

The clear answer is no, to all of the above.
