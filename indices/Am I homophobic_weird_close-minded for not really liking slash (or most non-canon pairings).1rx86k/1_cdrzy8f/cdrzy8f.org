Sexuality is personal, and not liking what turns other people on is both normal and perfectly fine. No reason to be upset about that. I like slash, I like het, but I dislike threesomes/the ubiquitous "Harem Harry". Do I disparage those who do? Of course not. Fanfiction is by its very nature supposed to be a place where people can find enjoyment and acceptance, so read whatever you want and like whatever you like. Don't worry so much. Just don't judge or put down those who like things you don't like.
