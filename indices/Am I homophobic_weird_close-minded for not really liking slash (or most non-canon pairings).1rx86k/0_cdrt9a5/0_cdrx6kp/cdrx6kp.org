Just adding my two cents here from a different perspective, seeing as I completely agree with the previous comment.

I like many (as in *many*), het stories but those with excessive imagery or long\frequent lemons are just unappealing and irritating to me.

For example harry potter and the sword of gryffindor is supposed to be hilarious and I started reading it at least 4 times. I could never get past the frequent and obvious (though tame) references to /ahem/ female anatomy even in the first chapter. So I didn't read it. As long as I don't harp on the author and the people who enjoy it, there is nothing wrong with not enjoying it myself, and the same goes for you the other way around. Although as a girl you probably don't enjoy graphic and longwinded descriptions of sexy females either...

Anyway, being a connoisseur of many varieties of slash (and a good bit of non-slash) as well as a raging homosexual I can tell you I am not I'm the slightest offended that is not your cup of tea. Just don't annoy others for liking what they like and everyone can happily sit in bed with their laptops and read whatever they enjoy ;)
