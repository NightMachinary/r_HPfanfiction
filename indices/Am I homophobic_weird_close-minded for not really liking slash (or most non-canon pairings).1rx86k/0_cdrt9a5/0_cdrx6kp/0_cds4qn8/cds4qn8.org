Not to threadjack, but how do you feel about adding slash filters to fanfic archive websites, and how do you feel about "Surprise Slash" where they do not give you any indication that this is going to be say...Harry/Draco?

I haven't met many homosexual, harry potter fanfic readers. And it seems that most who write do not write as slash. Slash always seems to be written by tween and teen fangirls who have no idea what they are talking about beyond "omg what if harry and draco did it!"
