I agree and I'm sorry for generalizing. I stated to another who said basically the same thing that yes; I haven't tried to read many slash fic, and the ones I did read were badly written. I don't have enough interest to keep looking for good ones, and probably not enough interest to read anything recommended.

It at least /seems/ at the moment, that on FFN the relationship of new fics is about 3-to-1 in favor of slash, and none of it good. But total "good" fic is probably a 10:1 or worse ratio anyway so that isn't saying much.

Thank you for your point of view though, as I said, I don't talk to or know many "queer" ff readers or authors. Or at least, any that I do "know" I've only ever read or discussed het from/with them.
