Queer redditor chipping in to say that I read and write slash fic; I'm cool with slash filters as long as there's a het filter as well; and I object to the entire notion of surprise slash unless you agree to surprise het as well. I am cool with pretty much anyone hooking up with anyone as long as the fic lends itself to it. Whether or not your fic is romance-centric, if you throw a main pairing at me (I'll give a pass to background couples) then I expect the characters involved to have built up a relationship that lends itself to them being together.

And I couldn't find a way to say this without being blunt: you need to lose the belief that most slash is written by tweens. It's not. At least, there are no more bad slash fics written by tweens than there are bad het fics written by tweens. The only difference is you've clearly gone looking for the good het fics but never bothered with the good slash fics. That's fine, you can read what you want, but it does mean you shouldn't make generalisations on it.
