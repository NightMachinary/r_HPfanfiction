Like what you like. Don't bother with what you've tried and found distasteful. You aren't homophobic unless you see a need to /suppress/ the work because they describe what you're not into.

Most people project themselves onto the main character(s) while reading, and you may not enjoy the mindset being portrayed. Either that or you may see yourself as being in the same room as the characters, and if they're doing something you would feel embarrassed to witness, your discomfort is understandable. So long as you understand that your choice is just as valid for you as someone else's is for them, you're being fair-minded.

At least in my philosophy.
