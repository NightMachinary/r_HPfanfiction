as a bi guy, i see a lot of my awkward youth in neville....i never see ANY fic writers explore the "bi side" which makes me a sad sad teddy bear

I'd love a fic where Harry ends up openly dating both genders, but unless you have experience with the fears of the hatred from both the straight and gay communities, it would be really hard to write............crap, i may have found my muse >..<
