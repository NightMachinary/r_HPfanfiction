As a bisexual male, I find it really hard to read most slash because it's both poorly written and the usual pairings are just super weird (Snape/Harry or Lucius/Harry are two of my biggest headscratchers) BUT it can be done well.

Harry/Draco can be okay if tricky to make seem natural. That's what a lot of writers don't seem to grasp though. Most slash is just an excuse for the writer to imagine Dan Radcliffe and any number of the other male cast members getting freaky. Realistically, Harry would end up falling for a Neville or one of the other Weasleys. (I LOVE Harry/Charlie stories....but that's just me)

On the other side of the coin, I am not a fan of harem stories because I'm very monogamous (yes, I'm a married, monogamous, openly bisexual male) and most just end up being excuses for smut in the same way bad slash can get.

Like what you like, don't read too far into it. Some people don't like lemon in their tea, doesn't mean they'll march against the rights of those who do. In the end fanfic is just that, stories made by fans for other fans to enjoy. So that's just what i recommend ya do!
