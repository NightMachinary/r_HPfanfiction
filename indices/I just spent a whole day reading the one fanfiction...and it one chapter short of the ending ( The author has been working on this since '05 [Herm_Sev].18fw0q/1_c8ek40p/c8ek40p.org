I really, really feel for you! Unfinished fics used to not bother me at all. But I found one I loved and loved to bits that the author never updated again, though she left lots of responses to comments that she wasn't abandoning and was going to finish. It's been five years and I still check that fic from time to time because I JUST CAN'T LET GO!

But, yeah, I don't start any unfinished fic anymore because I can't stand the heartbreak. I am following only one WIP series I started reading in '05 but has been going since 2004.
