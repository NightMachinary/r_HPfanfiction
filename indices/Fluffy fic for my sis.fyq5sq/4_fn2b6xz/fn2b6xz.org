Definition of Romance by Elizabeth Culmer. Harry / Hermione completed oneshot. linkffn(2302425) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2302425/1/]]

Picnic Panic by LeQuin. Harry / Hermione completes story. There's Ron bashing, which I'm usually not a fan of, but the story was enjoyable regardless. linkffn(12265183) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12265183/1/Picnic-Panic]]
