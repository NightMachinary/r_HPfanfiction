These are Slashfic Soulmate au fics. Fluffy and very well written and not too long either. I'd rec you to check out this whole series. One is Harry/Draco the other one is a Deanmus fic and this one is an Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint story. I linked the Oliver Wood/Marcus Flint because I really like it and it's not a pairing with one of the Canon MCs Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5025334]])
