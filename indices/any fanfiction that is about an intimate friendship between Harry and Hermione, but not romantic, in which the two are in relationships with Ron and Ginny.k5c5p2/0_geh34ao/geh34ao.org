Through the Years: Harry and Hermione - linkffn(13292130) has exactly what you want. They are missing moments between Harry and Hermione, and everything is completely platonic.

(Here's the link just in case: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13292130/1/]])

Edit: I just realized I was thinking of a different fic. Here it is - linkffn(7026850). And the link, again just in case: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7026850/1/]])
