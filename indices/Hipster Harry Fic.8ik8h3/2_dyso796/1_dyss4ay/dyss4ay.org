I love that character archetype. Far better than wangslord edgerazors or supposed smooth talkers or pretentious bastards or whatever is popular these days. I like people that I would actually like, thus, this being an arcytype of person that I generally like, I would like a story about someone fitting it.

Basically, I know a lot of people like that and thus wish to read about people like that. Mister Freud probably has something to say on the matter... or jung...
