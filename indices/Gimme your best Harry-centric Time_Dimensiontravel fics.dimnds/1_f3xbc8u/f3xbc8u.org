[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/245967/LoveHP][LoveHP]] linkffn(2705927) Very good but also very dark, not for the faint hearted and absolutely more than earns its "M" rating.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][A Stranger in an Unholy Land]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/606422/serpant-sorcerer][serpant-sorcerer]] linkffn(1962685) Also very good and not as dark as Imprisoned Realm. It is complete and a great stand alone, there is an incomplete sequel as well.

EDIT: I also once read a story where Harry was transported to a world where his parents were alive. It was a Drarry fic, other-Harry had been a real jerk, and James was married to Regulus not Lily who had left and wasn't very involved. For the life of me I can't remember the name but I think it was AO3.

EDIT 2: I found it!!! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6854605][The Devil's White Knight]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/orphan_account/pseuds/orphan_account][orphan_account]] linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6854605/chapters/15646567]])
