One of my favorite time travel ff is a parody linkao3 (oh God not again!)

Another I like is Ron centric linkao3(sense of the soul) That one isn't complete.

Another fun time travel one is linkao3(wind shear) This one is a bit dif in that Harry doesn't travel back to his own past.

My absolute favorite dimension travel fic in linkffn(a black comedy by nonjon) It's hilarious and I love it so much. Another parody. He has another parody I like called linkffn(dimension hopping for beginners)

One that has both- also dark/grey!Harry is linkao3(stand against the moon) and it has a sequel. That author has some others that you might want to look at as well.

And then there is the one that I can't remember the name but is really good. Harry gets pulled into another world to defeat Voldemort but I think the order is kind of corrupt and Snape helps him? I'll try to find it.
