There are a few that I can think of though half of them are time travel fics. I believe some of them have slight Ron bashing but I don't think it goes over the top. Sorry about that, but these are the only fics that I could find and remember.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2777448/1/What-is-Right-Year-One][What is Right: Year One]] and it's incomplete sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4645151/1/What-is-Right-Year-Two][What is Right: Year Two]] are two time travel fics where Harry befriends Draco and has PTSD. (I don't think this matches what you want though I full-heartedly believe that you should at least check out the first fic.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][Travel Secrets]][[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622538/1/Travel-Secrets-First][: First]] and it's following works [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9666829/1/Travel-Secrets-Second][Travel Secrets: Second]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10139565/1/Travel-Secrets-Third][Travel Secrets: Third]]. Another set of time travel fics where Harry ends up travelling back in time to redo his life for the better. It touches heavily in Slytherin/Pureblood politics in the third fic, though the first two mention politics frequently.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8671198/chapters/19877506][Pathetic, Ordinary, Liars]] is a really good AU where the Golden Trio are all sorted into Slytherin, though I'm unaware if a sequel has been planned.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736][souls touch, and the future changes]] is a really cool fic that draws parallels to Tom Riddle and Harry after the Dursleys put him in an orphanage. It touches on bigotry against Muggles and Muggleborn, if I remember correctly, though Harry has a rightful dislike of Muggles in this. It does touch on the other Slytherin's views, however, by switching point of views (not first person). [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24096307/chapters/58001593][right under their noses]] is it's recently started and incomplete sequel.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]] is where Harry is resorted into Slytherin after being expelled from Hogwarts after the Dementor mess before fifth year. It touches a lot on light vs dark magic and religion, and bigotry.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1646416][The Silent Ally]] is an in-progress series where Harry befriends a snake as a child, which leads to things changing drastically.
