I haven't read this but, when it's been 3+ years since a series update, I assume it's not going to be continued. You could subscribe to the series if you are super interested. Re the pairing - it seems like Harry whump. IOW, more about torturing Harry. And maybe part 3 is an AU.

If you really want to know, post a comment and maybe the author will respond. Last update was 2018 (another HP story).
