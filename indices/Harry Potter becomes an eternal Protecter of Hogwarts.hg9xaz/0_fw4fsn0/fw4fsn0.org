"What's wrong?" a voice startled Aylin Scamander from her tears, she looked up to see a boy, around 17 or so, crouching down to eye level with her with a frown marring his handsome features.

"N...nothing.." she mumbled drying her eyes with a sleeved arm.

The young man tilted his head, his green eyes filled with curiosity, but also doubt "Well now that's not true, if it was nothing you would be back in your common room, not out here, crying your eyes out."

The first year let out a shuddering sigh and studied him once more, he reminded her of Uncle Sirius, though his hair was much shorter than his and his eyes a bright green instead of brown, she decided to trust him. "Some other first years...they took my great gramama's necklace..."

the moment she said that she could have sworn the warmth that filled the room fled as the young mans eyes hardened, but it returned moments later when his frown turned into a smile.

"Well now, that was very rude of them, but lucky for you I happen to know a spell that can bring it back to you." his words filled her with hope, she didn't know any magic that could do that, but he was a seventh year so he must know plenty of magic and her face brightened at the idea.

the young man smile got bigger as he reached behind her ear and spoke the words "mumbly dumbly doo!" and then yanked, a tinkling sound reached her ear and before she could point out that what he had said was just gibberish and not a real spell, her great grandmothers bottlecap necklace was in his hands, dangling before her eyes.

her eyes widened at the sight and her tears threatened to return, she was so caught up in her happiness at having her belongings returned to her that she didn't catch the melancholy look the young man was giving both her and the necklace.

the look dissapeared though as the young man slide the necklace over her head and returning it to her with a smile, "head on back to your common room little one," He helped her up before turning to leave, not before stopping to tell her one more thing "As long as you are here at Hogwarts, you will never lose anything, or have anything stolen from you, I swear it." with that the young man walked down the hall, leaving a smiling and mystified young girl behind. One with light blond hair and grey eyes, much like someone he had known long ago.
