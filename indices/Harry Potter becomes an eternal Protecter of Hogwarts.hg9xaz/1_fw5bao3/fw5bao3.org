It is well known that a new Dark Lord would pop up once every generation. Most times they were rather silly Dark Lords, all things considered. Some wanted more money, others more restrictions on magic, one was quite famously insane, wanting his own harem of loyal witches for some reason or another.

But not all Dark Lords are so humorous. You may have heard of the three generations of terror. First came Grindelwald; The-Terror-Of-The-East, then Voldemort; He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and then Asagede; The-Black-Monster.

You may have also heard of another wizard from this time. Harry Potter; The-Hogwarts-Hero. Known for defeating Voldemort three times; once as an infant, again as a child, a third time as a teen, and then later defeating Asagede as an adult.

But this is not all Harry Potter is famous for. In certain circles one may hear of Harry Potter; The-Immortal-Protector. This moniker stems from the uncertainty surrounding the entirety of his life. Harry Potter is well known for surviving the killing curse multiple times, as well as reportedly being killed in multiple other ways during his life, including decapitation, immolation, and disintegration. After living an unusually long one hundred and eighty-seven years, Harry Potter gave all of his possessions to his children, and then supposedly died peacefully in his sleep the next night. But as many believers will point out, no body was ever reported to be seen afterwards, and a few years later Harry Potter was sighted once more, as a teenager inside the hallowed halls of Hogwarts. Here Harry Potter has been known to protect particularly vulnerable students from bullying, and to rescue abused children from their homes. No low level Dark Lords have appeared for the past nine generations. Only one high level one, who was prophesied to be defeated shortly after her arrival.

It should also be noted that those whose parents taught them of the Deathly Hallows and their history will point out that after the Death Stick was taken by Dumbledore from Grindelwald, it is unknown what happened to it. Some claim that Harry Potter acquired the wand from Dumbledore, the stone from Voldemort (whose moniker means â€˜flight of death', perhaps based on the fleeing ghosts), and the cloak from his own deceased father, and now serves as master over Death. The veracity of the last statement is a matter of debate, since if his father had possession of the cloak, why was it not used to hide from Voldemort?
