The nice thing about headcanon is that it doesn't have to align perfectly with canon. The books do mention the floo network specifically, but it doesn't matter if you don't want it to, it works perfectly fine as a developing system.

You could have an eternally burning emerald flame in the Great Hall of Hogwarts to which all instances of floo travel are brought. As the magic was refined further, enchantments could be placed on various fireplaces to create alternate exit points and assign them names by which they were accessed. They are now managed by the ministry.

Or you could have early floo being a more unstructured and dangerous magic, users spinning through a realm of fire and ash searching through the glimpses they get out of various fires for a safe place to exit. Later enchantments give the realm of fire more structure in the form of a network in order to make it more direct and usable. The network falling into the hands of the ministry to manage.

I personally will always be partial to the fanon that the floo network was invented by St. Nick and that the proto-ministry coopted the network from him some time Statute of Secrecy was enacted in order to close connections to muggle homes and stop his violations. Though this interpretation is certainly up there too.
