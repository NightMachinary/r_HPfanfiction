I think there's a bit of a plot hole to the story of witches using freezing charms on the fire when they were getting burned. Likely, their hands would be tied, so I wonder how they would be able to get their wand, especially since the executioners would have searched for it before the burning. Also, if they had their wand at the burning, they would have had the wand in prison before execution, and could have just broken out.
