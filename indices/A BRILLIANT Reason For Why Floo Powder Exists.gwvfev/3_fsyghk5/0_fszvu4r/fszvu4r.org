Yeah, and what if you were a kid? Too young to know the charm or even have a wand?

And if you somehow miraculously smuggled your wand with you, you could accidentally drop it into the flames.

And if you actually managed to cast the spell, all that would do would save you from the flames. The mob would then untie you, take away your wand and then try drowning or hanging next.

That fic was very attentive to detail. Everything I just said is from it, and the scene where they explain the creation of floo isn't ranty or anything like a lot of authors do when they find a plot hole in canon. It's very well done in my opinion.
