I think it's only really been established that you can only /exit/ fireplaces that are on the Flu Network. If a travel fire was always lit, it would be the only place anyone went. Or maybe the flu network is an automated travel system, and an early iteration of flu powder was self-guided rather than speech activated, and you had to bring yourself out of an existing fire. It could still be cannon compliant. And if it isn't, it's an AU where demons exist, it's still a neat idea.
