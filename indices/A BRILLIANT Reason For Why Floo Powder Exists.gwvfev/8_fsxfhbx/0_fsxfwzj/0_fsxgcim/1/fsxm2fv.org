This would also be the earliest iteration of it, to be used in the most desperate circumstance.honestly once it became popular the would have added measures to be safer and most people if they had fire as a mode of travel would put it in a fireplace Instead of in a firepit on their livingroom floor. Fire places are just easier when inside a house.

Eventually they could have added measure to link only certain fireplaces together, for regulation, safety, or even speed, but most likely this was not the original design because who thinks "let's jump in a fire for transport" especially when their are people who could teleport. Portkeys are a logical evolution to apperation but not floo travel. It makes more sense that it was a risky last ditch effort.
