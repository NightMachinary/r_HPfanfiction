Yeah, I honestly love that headcannon. I find the canonical explanation to be weird and suspicious - it seems like the kind of thing you'd teach using the "lying to children" methodology of education (you know, the one that starts off with, like, first grade history is all "and the pilgrims and native Americans lived in harmony together" and then slowly adds in the genocide later). After all, there does seem to be a concerted effort to portray muggles as stupid and incompetent and I'm pretty sure muggles would notice someone wasn't burning and proceed to other suppression methods if the canonical explanation was actually correct.
