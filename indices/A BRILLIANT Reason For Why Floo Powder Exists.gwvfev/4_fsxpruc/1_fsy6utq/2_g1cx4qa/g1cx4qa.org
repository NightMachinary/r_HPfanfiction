Purebloods internationally making it seem far less of a horrible tragedy than it was.

After all can't have muggles being able to harm a superior pureblood now can we?

So it is dramatically downplayed in history book and instead stuff like Wendelin the Weird is made popular.

Suddenly it was less an escape from genocide and more a leaving the muggle world behind.

More ivory tower enlightened peoples looking down on the common man.

Less the frantic escape from slaughter it likely was.
