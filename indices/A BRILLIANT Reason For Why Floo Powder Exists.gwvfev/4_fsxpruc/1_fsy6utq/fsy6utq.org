  Simply put, Beedle tells us witch hunts were mostly dangerous for children as they didn't have wands. PoA tells us adults used a flame freezing charm and allowed themselves to be tickled by flames.

I think the idea that people who were able to overpower witches and wizards for long enough to tie them to a pyre would leave them with wands is insane. Probably a few got away with having wands on them, or some madlads/ladies got off on tricking the crazy muggles, but if magicals weren't actually dying in large numbers at the hands of muggles, I don't see why they would've hidden at all.

The above headcanon would probably apply for children too. Also, wand magic appears to depend far too much on individual ability to be a consistent life saving measure in the middle of a genocide, so the idea that all adult witches and wizards just magicked their way out of pyres seems kind of ridiculous.
