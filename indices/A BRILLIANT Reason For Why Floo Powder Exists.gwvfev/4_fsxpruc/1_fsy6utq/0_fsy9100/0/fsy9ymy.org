  What makes you think wands were a well-known thing amongst muggles?
#+end_quote

Because magicals lived openly among muggles prior to the statute of secrecy. Why wouldn't they?

We are muggles and we know about wands. Wands and staves have been a part of witchcraft related lore in several cultures since forever. For this argument to be valid, this history would've had to have happened in an alternate universe where nobody had ever heard of wands.

  Because of the children.
#+end_quote

If the threat were only to children, they would've hidden as many as they could and gone to war. Instead, they hid all magic, including magical locations and magical creatures and magical history and probably magical natural phenomena.

  And PoA explicitly tells us they rarely caught an actual magical person.

And HP canon of course is a bastion of logic.
