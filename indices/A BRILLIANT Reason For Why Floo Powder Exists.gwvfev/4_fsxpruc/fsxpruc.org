No one's going to stop you from adopting it as a headcanon, but it does strongly contradict canon, both the excerpt in PoA and additions in Tales of Beedle the Bard and Pottermore.

Simply put, Beedle tells us witch hunts were mostly dangerous for children as they didn't have wands. PoA tells us adults used a flame freezing charm and allowed themselves to be tickled by flames. And Pottermore has the powder invented before witch hunts.
