- A much more down-to-Earth explanation is in linkao3(The Friar's Calling by Chthonia), which is BTW the brilliant piece of writing, and one very few (unfortunately) really good historic HP fanfictions. Highly recommended!
- Also, the Czech group around the server [[http://budec.net]], which writes about the Czech magical school located and hidden from Muggles at [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bude%C4%8D_(Kladno_District][Budeč]]) (real, historical, and very magical place), considered [[http://budec.net/node/375][the idea]] that there are five elements, where some wizards are able to travell in cooperation with each. Some of them are impractical (travelling through /earth/ is really slow, /æther/ is too difficult), so what remains is travelling through /air/ (Apparition); travelling through /fire/ (most commonly used as Floo network; but there are other less frequently used networks like connection through everlasting lights in churches, used only by religious wizards in some countries); and most commonly used on the European continent (where it is not common to have fireplace in most households) is travel by /water/: transfer between springs, wells, some of them located even inside of the house.
