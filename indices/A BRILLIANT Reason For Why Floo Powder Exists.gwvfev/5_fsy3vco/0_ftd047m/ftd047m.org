Loved the five elements concept! I'm working on my local Wizarding Government (Argentinian Council of Magic) and I developed a network like the floo but based on Water, since fireplaces are uncommon in Mediterranean Europe and Latin America, but wells are quite common instead. Because of that, each Wizarding house holds an internal Atrium with a central well (based on the Roman /Domus/), this design was also quite common in the colonial latinamerica.
