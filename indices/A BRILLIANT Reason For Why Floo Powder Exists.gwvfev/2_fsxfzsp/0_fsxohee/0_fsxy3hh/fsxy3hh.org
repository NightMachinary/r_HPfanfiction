I imagine a lot of wizarding "invention" was along these lines.

Apparition, for example, would have been chaotic and deadly once first discovered. You're missing /parts/ while figuring it out! Parts are necessary!

I imagine Floo works more like a method of transition rather than a method of travel. The Floo Network puts those destinations on a map so you can form a network. Floo travel is a transition from corporeal to flame-based existence that allows the witch or wizard to be somewhere else quickly.

As others have pointed out, it's kind of like a DNS. The Internet is just packets of information going from computer to computer, but once you have a network of addresses, you can link them all together and form a communications network.
