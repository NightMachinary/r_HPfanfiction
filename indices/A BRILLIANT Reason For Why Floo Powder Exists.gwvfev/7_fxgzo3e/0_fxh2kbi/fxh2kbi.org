Funny you mention that, because a large portion of people -- including me -- skimmed over the title and read it as "Hermione Granger, Dermatologist" at first. So many people made this mistake that the author actually made a fic where Hermione becomes a dermatologist. But I don't thing /anyone/ read demolitionist.

Looks like Hermione has a large career market going for her lol
