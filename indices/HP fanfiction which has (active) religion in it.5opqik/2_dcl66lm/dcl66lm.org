I feel like linkffn(6780275), Muggledad's "The Last Casualties" has aspects of religion in it, although it got too long and convoluted for me to continue reading, so I have no idea if it keeps it up.

At one point, in the apocalyptic post-Voldemort-has-taken-over Britain, Harry is injured and Hermione's freaking out, wondering if he'll die or not, and ends up at a nearby Catholic church and is heavily involved in prayer and blessings. There is some issue of her being raised Catholic + witch from her parents' side, too.
