- Where do wizards get food?

They grow it.

The Weaselys have an orchard and raise chickens, and even pigs in the films. Presumably, they have a garden for root vegetables as well, as Harry and Ron have had to peel sprouts as a chore.

- Where do they get furniture from?

Presumably, their furniture is hand-carved, so there are artisans who provide it.

- Are there hairdressers?

There is at the very least lines of hair-care products. Sleekeazy's potion, which Hermione used in /Goblet of Fire,/ would imply a market for this.

- Do families have a monopoly?

Given the strong emphasis on family in the books, if generally only in the context of bloodlines, this does appear to be the case.

- Do they steal things from muggles to sell? (Knight Bus and Hogwarts Express were stolen)

Presumably, but this is likely situational. If the Wizards literally can't do it themselves, then they may use the Muggle artifacts as a base.

- Is it possible to use the repair spell forever?

Possibly, but it does appear that certain items are inherently resistant to it. Ron had to borrow Spellotape to "repair" his damaged wand, and /Reparo/ failed to repair Harry's wand.

- Are the coins made of pure gold, silver and bronze?

Goblin enchantments nonwithstanding, but yes.

- Was the conversion rate designed to not break the economy of the magical world or was it designed to help the muggle born?

Rowling can't do math.

- Is the first wand has a ministry subsidy?

If this were the case, Ron would not have needed a hand-me-down.

- Do all wands cost the same?

Er, possibly. Though I suspect there may be outliers--I have a hard time imagining Hagrid's wand, which was sixteen inches long, costing only seven Galleons.

- What was the main function of Room of Requirement and when was it created?

To provide a situational need. It is the Room of /Requirement./ If you don't need it, it won't show up.

As for how old it is, presumably it is as old as Hogwarts itself.
