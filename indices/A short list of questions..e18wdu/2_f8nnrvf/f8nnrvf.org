  How much does a wizard make per month on average? Do students pay to go to Hogwarts? Does everyone go to Hogwarts? Are there people who learn only at home or in the community? How big is Hogwarts? How many students do you have at Hogwarts?

  How do students cut their nails? Do wizards use soap and shampoo? Do potions work on muggles? Are there any other focus besides the wand?
