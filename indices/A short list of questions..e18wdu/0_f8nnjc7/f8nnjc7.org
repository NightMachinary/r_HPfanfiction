  How big is Hogwarts?How many students do you have at Hogwarts?

Rowling says that there is 1000 kids there, but she also said that the population of the magical UK is 3000, and those don't go together at all.

  Are there drinking fountains at Hogwarts?
#+end_quote

Is a topic for debate. Drinking fountains are really an american invention, while there are some decorative fountains in europe that have clean water going through them, the whole drinking fountains everywhere thing was invented by the temperance movement. You can't trust other peoples plumbing in europe, so drinking from their water? Not something that existed.

However wizards might not have that hold up, they might have had magicly pure water all through the medieval period, so might have drinking fountains.
