Oh we don't have many at all in the streets, only in buildings. Most places where a lot of people are likely to be, for example a school or a gym, will have quite a few. It is true that they are a lot more common in the US. I think that's probably just because we have much cooler weather so it's less necessary for people to have water available whenever they are outside. It rarely gets above 30°C here (86°F if I've done the maths correctly), and we usually don't have long periods without rain.
