Huh. Well, it's hard to argue with someone who lives there, I don't know personally what the streets of the UK look like drinking fountain wise, but everything I have read tells me that they are very uncommon there.

For example, here's an excerpt from a Guardian article.

  The results were startling. Across Greater Manchester, with a population of almost 2.8 million, there are no council-maintained drinking fountains -- with those that had been installed, decommissioned. The same situation was found across Merseyside, with all five councils replying that they have no working fountains, and in South Yorkshire, where a spokesperson for Sheffield council revealed that all fountains “were taken out a few years ago due to health risks and damage”.

  Tyne and Wear fares a little better, with one outdoor fountain in South Tyneside and two in Sunderland, while there are four across the West Midlands and one in West Yorkshire.

  In London the disparities were even greater: while Lambeth has 25, Newham nine and Southwark 13, a dozen councils -- including Sutton, Kingston, Brent and Haringey -- reported having no fountains whatsoever.

  Whether councils will share the enthusiasm of Gove and Khan for new fountains remains to be seen. Of the 32 London borough councils, only a handful said they were planning to install more, including Lambeth and Bexley, which is set to put one at Lesnes Abbey Woods.

In the US, almost every public bathroom of any description has drinking fountains outside it. Is that true there too? Or could you just be thinking that the amount of fountains there is normal while it really is just a few here and there?
