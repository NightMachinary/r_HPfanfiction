Fanfics have just made her a popular character with her â€˜ice queen' persona.

Personally I like her because she add more depth than Harry's other pairing(Ginny,Luna,etc....). The character development when breaking down her barriers by Harry is good when well written.

It doesn't really matter whats real/fake about her canon character, she is basically a blank canvas while still being a non OC which authors will utilize well.
