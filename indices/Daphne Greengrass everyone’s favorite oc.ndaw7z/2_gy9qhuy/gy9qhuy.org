I think that this is maybe a more a male oriented perspective and trending towards greater truth on ffn than ao3. I don't know a lot of women who care about or write Daphne or even Astoria as an important OC character or even one attached to Harry. But the point you're making about how authors use canon characters to write their own type of person while also sometimes following community "headcanons" is for sure annoying sometimes. But it's the nature of the beast, I think. Just gotta deal with it when you have large cast stories and a grab-bag of names in canon.
