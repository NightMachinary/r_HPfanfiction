In Canon, Daphne is litterally only a name. She is mentioned once in OotP where she is one of the 3 other student called to pass a practical OWL at the same time than Hermione. And that's the reason why she is popular.

She is an OC without being an OC. It is convenient because of lot of people don't really like OC and wouldn't try a fic where Harry is paired with one. But since she is a blank sheet, author can give her any personality they want without anyone being able to complain about her being OOC. A majority of the fics with her tend to use the "Ice Queen persona" (that I personally find a bit boring), but you can find anything from her being a Death Eater, to her just being a pretty stupid girl with a nice ass.

Also, "extended Canon" made her a Slytherin, which is once again convenient because she can be the token "nice Slytherin" that Harry can fall in love with without having to create an OC or whitewash one of the existing character like Pansy Parkinson.
