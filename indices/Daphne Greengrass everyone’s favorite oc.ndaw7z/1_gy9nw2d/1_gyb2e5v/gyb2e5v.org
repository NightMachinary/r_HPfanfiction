I like Daphne Greengrasses which are different (with or without the relationship with Harry): the one in “What's Her Name in Hufflepuff” by ashez2ashes linkffn(13041698) is just precious (but only a very minor character). Or the one in “Daphne Greengrass and the Year From Hell” by WhiskeyTangoFoxtrot linkffn(3912184;4236594) (unfortunately, unfinished). Much more interesting than the Ice Queen Heiress Greengrass.
