Seconding The Best Revenge. Harry is sorted into Hufflepuff but he's not weak or obsessed with pleasing people. I really like what the writer did with that Harry.

The best Slytherin Harry fic I read is linkffn(On the Way to Greatness). For a more cracky but also surprisingly touching fic, I enjoyed linkffn(When in Doubt, Obliviate).
