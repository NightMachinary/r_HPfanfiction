I read it a while ago And while it is a great recommendation for a time travel fic it isn't what I was looking for I dislike the idea of hufflepuff Harry because all the fics with it have him be weak. In gryffindor he is the golden boy the traditional hero we expect, in slytherin he is a gray version of tom riddle with attachments to other people, in ravenclaw he is hungry for knowledge immersing himself in the new world he is being shown, in hufflepuff he is a damaged little boy who needs help and drinks hot chocolate by the fire and is more concerned with other people's feelings than the plot Now this is just a very very generalized statement that I wrote, and not all hufflepuff Harry's are like that but I stand by it
