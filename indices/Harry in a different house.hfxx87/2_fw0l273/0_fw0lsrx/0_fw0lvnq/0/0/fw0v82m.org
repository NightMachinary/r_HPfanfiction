Guess it depends on the writer. I think and it's been awhile since I've read it but linkffn(strings of fate) has hufflepuff harry and hes written as a diplomat more than the warrior he was as a gryffindor. He gives all his friends nicknames like hermione is Athena and susan bones is diva(I think) their nickname for him is ambassador.
