Strings basically has him raised by his aunt only and he knows about his fame they deal with the "Harry potter" fiction books out there he even has a q&a session first year so that students who were fans of the books can get the real story. He even signs some autographs including one for the gray lady but he isnt a conceited ass about it. Imo it's a really refreshing take on harry who grew up differently. And harry is top or near the top of his class. I need to reread it actually. Maybe after I'm done with the fic I'm reading now.
