I think canon compliance is only acceptable when it's marauder since anything can happen in the years any friendships relationships as long as jily happens and the two snape incidents that are canon confirmed. However, all the endings are extremely bitter sweet and any scene with peter being a good loyal friend is filled with dramtic irony. I do love it though when Peter is more of a lackey than James and Sirius like because he'll do anything they ask, it seems more accurate.
