I don't remember the specific fic, but i read one where Harry and Hermione went to the same school before Hogwarts and she got him in trouble with the Dursleys and he hated her for it. This makes him supposedly Uber-cunning, in a way I've never seen in another fic. He's supposed to be “a snake in lion's clothing” (for lack of a better phrase) and the whole story from then on is essentially word for word canon except filled with Harry's inner monologue about why he's being so cunning by doing everything he's doing to appear and sound exactly like the boy-who-lived they expect and not who he truly is. The only real difference was that he let Hermione get attacked by the troll. I didn't finish it because it was ridiculous.
