Sometimes I like it. Sometimes it's done badly.

I quite like stories where the basic plot is the same just Harry is different because he's in slytherin say ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/14/][on the way to greatness]] springs to mind) but that's generally because the interest is with the character and their development. The plot is more of a sidenote.

Personally, I always write canon compliantly. My stories are only oneshots so it doesn't matter really since I just choose the in-between moments that weren't in the books...

I don't like reading stories that are too "non canon". If it's a big event like Time Travel or a character doesn't die, where obviously events will be different, sure im all for it. But I have no interest in reading a Harry/Hermione because in my head, that's not what happened so it feels wrong. To me it just feels fake and 'like fanfiction' (yes I understand how hypocritical that sounds).. Keep it canon please...

Though I'm fully aware my preferences are not at all reflective of everyone else's but hey! An opinion!
