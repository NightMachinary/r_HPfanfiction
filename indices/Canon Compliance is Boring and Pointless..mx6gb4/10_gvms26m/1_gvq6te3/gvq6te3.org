Yes I totally agree with you. I see so many stories were the author is introducing new interesting element but then just repeating canon, like the timeline wouldn't have a different outcome. Iv see it done many different ways, some rewrite entire sections from the book, or recape the actions without to many details, or worse write new action between the existing scenes and think that people remember every part of the books.

I think it comes down to experience, and getting better as an author. Following the main plot lines can be a great platform to shape your story after, but it can equally be a thin line to walk, to have enough material on your own and reusing to much from the books.
