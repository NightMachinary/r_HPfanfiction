It seems I used the wrong lingo, and people are upset and aren't understanding my point.

I meant writing canon events, and not changing things, even when things should be changed.

Like Harry having proper guardians, but them not being upset over him fighting a troll or the basilisk.

Writing Moody's early life and how he became Mad-Eye isn't what I'm referring to. I'm referring to basically writing canon events as they happened in the books. Like the books from Hermione's pov, a person who was there for the whole damned thing.

Figured I'd say it louder for the people in the back or not paying attention.
