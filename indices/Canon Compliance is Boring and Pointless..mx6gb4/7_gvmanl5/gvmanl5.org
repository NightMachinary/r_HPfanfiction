Sometimes even following major events is unnecessary. Like some people seem to believe someone /must/ escape Azkaban the summer of '93. In stories where Sirius is free, I've seen Bellatrix and Peter escape for no reason at all other than to hit the station.

The troll entering the school and CoS might be the only inescapable stations. Hermione doesn't need to be in the bathroom, though, and a lot of CoS things don't need to happen, especially if Harry isn't friends with Ron and/or in Gryffindor.
