As I understand it, canon compliance means the story doesn't contradict anything canon says. But there's lots of fics that are canon compliant without copy-pasting canon. Such fics can expand on the world's history, or describe character interactions that occur off-camera, or describe a possible future for the world, after canon finishes.

Here's one of my favorite canon-compliant oneshots, if you're interested in reading a relatively good one: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13268227/1/Compliant]])

(incidentally, it's also about compliance in the sense of obedience)
