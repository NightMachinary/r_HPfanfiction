That's not what canon compliance is. I only write canon compliance so I try, as best I can, not to change anything and instead write prequels, missing moments or alternate povs, or sequels around the existing story. It means that the reader already has an established knowledge of what has happened and I can play on that with bittersweetness, foreshadowing, or an in depth background.

You're perfectly entitled to find it boring - personally I don't enjoy alternate universe. Everyone likes different things.
