Well, I mean this kind of stories is not that common. If anything I love to see more stories were authors don't copy baseless fandom cliches with almost genuine perception of them as canon: all powerful goblins, Dumbledore being evil, magical cores being a thing, magical oaths being a thing (I am not talking about Unbreakable Vow), magical marital contracts, titles Lords and Ladies for heads of pureblood families, etc.\\
If anything, most good canon compliance stories are for those who love to see "missing scenes" that would fit into original timeline.

Though, I prefer stories with canonical worldbuilding but with major divergence event.
