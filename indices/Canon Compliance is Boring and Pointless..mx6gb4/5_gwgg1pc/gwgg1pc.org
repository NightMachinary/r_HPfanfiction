I agree so much

I think people keep things same because it gives you a framework to follow and a level of familiarity

Like for example.

In many fics where Harry ends up a slytherin he still ends up very close to Hermione. Probably because Hermione is a popular familar character and has a useful role and can keep providing that role of being the smart one.

Even though realistically it makes more sense a different Slytherin would be the one Harry got close to and someone else would fill the smart one role instead of Hermione. They'd likely have to be a more minor character that needed more fleshing out too and to many what makes fics fun to write is because its with familiar characters so that might not be appealing.
