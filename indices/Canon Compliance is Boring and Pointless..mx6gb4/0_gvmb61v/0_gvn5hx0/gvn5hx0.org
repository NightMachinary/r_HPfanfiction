Time travels that rehash canon stations are absolutely the most frustrating type of fics.

Time travel or knowledge about the future is the ultimate Deus Ex Machina, but these authors either have a too strong attachment to canon plot or don't know how to use future information effectively. The key to improve the outcome is not trying to alter some canon stations to their favor, but striking directly at Voldemort's greatest vulnerabilities using future information.

There's absolutely no fucking need to repeat the canon timeline. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.
