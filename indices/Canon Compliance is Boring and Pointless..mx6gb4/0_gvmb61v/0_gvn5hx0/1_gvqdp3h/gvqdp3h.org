Not if the Time-travelling is self-consistent. Or if your aim is to prevent a very specific event in the future which you don't want to butterfly out of control. Eg: Six Pomogranate Seeds. I do agree that sensible fics that don't change canon are far and few between. I believe the the time traveller likes to selfishly maintain a safety net of precognition in these fics versus the uncertainty of an open future.
