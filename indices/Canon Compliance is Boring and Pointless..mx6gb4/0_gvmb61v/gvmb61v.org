The thing you're criticizing is called “stations of canon,” not “canon compliance.” “Canon compliance” is generally filling in missing details from canon, like young Voldemort's rise to power, Moody and Tonks' Auror careers, Andromeda and Ted's romance, etc.

“Stations of canon” means rewriting, or sometimes even copying and pasting the same old memorable moments from canon with minor changes, like “If Harry had been raised by Sirius, Sirius would have been so proud when Harry got put on the quidditch team after that remembrall incident.” I'm not into those either, but I don't begrudge people who enjoy them.
