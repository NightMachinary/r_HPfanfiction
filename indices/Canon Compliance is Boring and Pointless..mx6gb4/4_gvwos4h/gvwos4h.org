I agree with you. I once read a story, (or should partially read) about Harry getting sorted into Slytherin, with the synopsis about how Harry's school experience would be different if he was sorted into Slytherin. The only difference was he was sorted into Slytherin, had different conversations inside the dorms, and didn't have Ron wanting to play chess. He still became friends with a guy and a girl, that he hung around with all the time, and once he stepped outside the Slytherin dorm, the author, rather than typing it all out, may as well as put a line in.. "See Philosopher's Stone pages 125-145." Other than the scenes inside the dorms, there was literally no difference from the actual book.

Alternately, I have read stories of Harry getting sorted into Slytherin, and while the events from the books still played out, Harry was doing his own thing, and was not in the center of it, so we heard of it peripherally, as Harry heard about it. For example, while Harry was still the Boy who Lived, it was Ron, Hermione and Neville that had the run in with the troll. The detention in the Forbidden forest with Voldement killing the unicorns, Harry wasn't there and heard about it from Draco. Also, as far as Quirrel and the Philosopher's stone was concerned, all Harry heard was that something happened and that Quirrel was no longer able to teach the remainder of the year.
