I disagree. I read/used to write fanfiction because I love the universe and like to explore it further or explore what-if scenarios. If I'm going to +write+ read something that has nothing to do with the Harry Potter universe other than the names then may as well read an original work. That way, if it's good, I can even support the author financially.
