Also with regards to what you were saying on crossovers... I'll admit I am not a big fan of those... but if you do it - and there are some done correctly out there - you need to have a dominant universe. Like in case of the two most popular HP xovers - Marvel/HP - do you have mutants that have some scientific explanation to mutants'/superheroes' powers which are pretty restrictive or do you go by the HP universe in which anyone can learn those skills? Or if you go for HP/LOTR... does the whole action happen in our world or in the Middle Earth? And, depending what you choose, do the rules from one universe or the other apply to magic?

For me Xovers are a pain because you have to pacify both fandoms if you are looking for popularity, but even if you write for yourself... you still need to be consistent in your storytelling. Personally, I think the only fandom that is somewhat compatible with HP is Sabrina the teenage witch... the only difference is that in one universe you have latin words for spells while in one you have rhymes (although judging from Ron's first on-page attempt at magic, that's not necessarily untrue in the HP universe).
