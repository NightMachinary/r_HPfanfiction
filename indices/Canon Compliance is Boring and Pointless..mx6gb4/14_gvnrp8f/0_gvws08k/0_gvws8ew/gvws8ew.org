I mean that the set up of the story remains largely unchanged. Harry is orphaned by Voldemort and is forced to live with his relatives until he gets invited to Hogwarts. That's basically the setup of the whole story. Also the personalities of the characters remain largely unchanged as well as the established magical world.
