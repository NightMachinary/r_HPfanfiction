What sort of What If scenarios can you write without changing Canon in some way? You can't have Harry sorted into Slytherin, as that goes against Canon. You can't have someone else fight the troll or go against Quirrelmort, as that again would be against Canon. Other that telling the story from say Lavenders or Neville's perspective, it would be extremely difficult to stay 100% Canon in any story.

On the other hand, I have read supposed crossover stories such as with LOTR, where the entirety of the story takes place in LOTR Canon, Harry is the only one there from HP Canon, and other than being named Harry and Hogwarts getting mention once or twice in the entire story, they may as well as cut out the Hogwarts mentions, changed the name of Harry's character and just said it was a LOTR story, as it really had nothing to do with Harry Potter Canon.
