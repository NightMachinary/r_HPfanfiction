Side note: there's a story where Hermione got Chinese food. She left the fortune cookies in the common room, and Dean or Seamus or both took them up to Trelawny's classroom. Firsties loved them, but Trelawny was somewhat miffed that the cookies were deemed more accurate than her. It's a minor thing in the story, but could probably be worked up into an amusing one-shot.
