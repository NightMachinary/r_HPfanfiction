Holy Hades, the opportunities are endless. First and second years being cute and selling cookies and getting points for them (like girl scouts), magical dolls of every professor (like can you imagine Snape's reaction?!) and the dolls could actually be enchanted to help with home work. Luna and Xelophilius making a deal with hogwarts and selling creature dolls. Binns actually being replaced and students learning more than just goblin rebellions. The rich purebloods showing off by donating a lot of money to Hogwarts as charity (ug ug, Malfoy). No, but it could give him perhaps even more power, betting pools on Quidditch matches et cetera. And like sooo many more ideas. Really, the opportunities are endless
