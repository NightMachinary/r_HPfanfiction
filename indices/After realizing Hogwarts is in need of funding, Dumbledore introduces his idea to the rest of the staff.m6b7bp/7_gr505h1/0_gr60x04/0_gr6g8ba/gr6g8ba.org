Yes, he sold him to Voldemort for 1€. Harry and Voldemort got along quite well and watched some old movies together. Voldemort had a bit of an online shopping problem in this one. He was also wearing leggings with a leopard print, which was probably inspired by the cover of the seventh book in German. Minerva tried to explain Dumbledore that 1€ wasn't going to help much but Dumbledore didn't quite get that. And in this version Dumbledore is also a rapper calling himself Fresh D. I think I need to rewatch the whole thing.
