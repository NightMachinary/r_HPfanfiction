There's an option you haven't mentioned: some people are just special.

I know a lot of the 'enlightened' members of the fandom don't like that, but it's fairly clear that it's true in canon. Look at Riddle, Dumbledore, Grindelwald, the Marauders, Snape, etc. They were all doing so much just as teens in school and even then, there are clear differences in ability between them. They are beyond just about anything the Trio and their yearmates are shown doing, the Harry Potter generation are a bunch of fucking slackers by comparison.

EDIT: Well, I suppose the Twins aren't bad, considering everything they invent and produce.
