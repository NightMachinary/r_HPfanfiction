It's not the ability, but more so the motivation.

Riddle and Grindelwald wanted to change the world. Dumbledore wanted to atone for Gellert and Ariana. Even Harry wanted to at first end Voldemort and then live through the Prophecy. Snape wanted to be better than his bullies, a motivation I can sympathise with. Remus wanted to rise above his Werewolf status. Sirius wanted to change his stigma as a Black, Peter wanted to fit in, and James wanted to be better in the eye of Lily, who wanted nothing to do with him. The Twins, brought up in poverty, wanted to use every skill they had to bring their family out of poverty.

Not everyone has that motivation. Not everyone has the will to act on it. It's not the power or magic that sets an individual apart, but their will to /do/ something.
