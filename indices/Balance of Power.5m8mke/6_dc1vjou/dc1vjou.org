In HP magic is like additional "layer" of reality. It is governed by its own rules that are different from those that govern "mundane layer" (physics, chemistry, biology, etc). Spells, potions, etc. they are like new technology, they are not easy to create, and many spells that are widely used in books are fairly recent creation. For example mending charm (reparo) was created in XVIII century.

Interesting example are unlocking charms. Alohomora was created in Africa and arrived in Britain in XVII century. Before then Open Sesame, and Portoberto were used, both more crude and causing damage to the opened doors. So, as you can see it's not easy to create a spell that do what you want.

Why some people create spells while in schools, while majority doesn't? Well, as with real life, some people are prodigal. And Snape is often noted and shown as one of those.
