There is another option. Magic is more than just something to be controlled. Maybe it isn't sentient per say, but it is definitely /aware/. Unbreakable Vows would not be unbreakable unless magic was aware of what constitues as a breaking of the vow.

Let us look at your example of Sectumsempra. By the sixth year of Snape's education, he was being targeted nearly exclusively by the Marauders. We can assume that it is around this time (maybe fifth year) that James saved Snape. Sectumsempra is not more lethal than any other cutter, except for the bleeding. Snape was one against four, and if magic itself responded to his need to create something to both defend himself and get revenge, then it makes sense Sectumsempra would be the logical choice.

A curse that severs all ties, that cuts through anything. It is the perfect offense against James Potter, who was skilled with Transfiguration. It was a perfect response to Black, who despised Dark Magic. The wounds from it cannot be healed except with a specific counter, similar to the bite/wounds from a werewolf.

If we assume magic is responsible for the creation of its own uses, then we can change how we see witches and Wizards. Magic, being sentient or aware enough to dictate how it allows itself to be used, would equate to Magicals /never/ mastering magic. But becoming knowledgable enough in magical use to explain it to others. This explaination also clears up issues in the DoM. Magicals have created Time Turners, yet cannot go back beyond a certain point. Magicals do not understand what is behind the locked door in the DoM, never mind "masters" of magic study it extensively. Magicals aren't allowed to know all about magic because magic itself does not allow it.

If we assume that magic is not sentient, then and only then do your solutions come into play.
