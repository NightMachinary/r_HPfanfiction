I think as with everyday life, people's apptitudes and skill levels vary wildly.

Take Lockhart as an example - playing armchair psychologist - it's fair to say he is a narcissist. Driven to seek acclaim/approval/validation. Possibly stemming from years of being told how utterly crap at everything he is (and he is, by his own admission). The only exception is memory charms. He uses that skill and parlays it into an (ill-gotten) life of public adoration.

So my own headcanon is that spell creation is an area where far fewer people have the necessary skills/talents in combination with the desire to pursue it.
