I think it's a combination of (1) and (3). For (1), canon actually shows Snape going through a lot of trial and error to invent /Levicorpus/, so it's probably not as easy as it looks. For (3), I'm with [[/u/mergirl007][u/mergirl007]]'s coding analogy. How many people are /good/ programmers (ditto for writers, artists, whatever)? It takes time, effort, and talent. And remember, magical Britain's population is only a few thousand by WoG--maybe a million worldwide. The entire planet can support the equivalent of just one major university, so there aren't that many people to draw on.
