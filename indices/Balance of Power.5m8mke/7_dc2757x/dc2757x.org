I think it's actually a combination of 2 and 3. If you remember, Luna's mom died because she made a mistake in spell creation. So, an adult witch who was presumably both intelligent and experienced still had a non negligible risk of death. In canon we really only see evidence of Snape creating spells. The twins seem to have more potions than new spells and the Marauders original creation is an artifact we have no idea if spells are even involved. So it might just be that Snape was willing to risk death from spell creation, or maybe wasn't aware of the risks involved.
