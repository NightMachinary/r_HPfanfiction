I compare spell creation to coding. Most people have coding manuals at their online fingertips should they ever choose to pick them up. So why isn't everyone coding their own websites and mobile apps and computer systems?

1. Lack of interest
2. Lack of ability (aka you have issues grasping the limits of what you can do)
3. Lack of time
4. Insert other reasons here

It's not that Snape is particularly awesome, he's the equivalent of the intelligent nerd in the corner coding his own Linux system. More power to him, but most people have their own goals and are happy (mostly) to use the standard operating system.
