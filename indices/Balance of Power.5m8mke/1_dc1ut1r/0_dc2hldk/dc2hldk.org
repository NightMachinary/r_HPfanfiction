I wish I could bold this, make the font larger and make it blink.

Magic in the HP world is a function of intelligence, knowledge, need and the ability to think in the right path. That is not common. And the least common part of that is *need*. Anybody can pick up a pen and start drawing, or writing or pick up a cheap computer and start coding, pick up a set of tool and start building things. The ones that actually do *and* do in a way that yields remarkable results are rare, really really rare.

And they do exist in the HP world. As another poster said: Grindelwald, Dumbledore, Riddle for easiest name recognition.
