As a frame of reference, I like to think of inventing a new spell as equal to inventing a new tool. Some spells are so commonly useful that everyone has it as part of their repertoire; diffindo = knife. More complex tools or spells usually come about due to special needs within an industry; Horton-Keitch Braking Charm = ABS brake system.

Thus, you get specialized spells like Sectumsempra, which is a cutting curse that makes several bleeding cuts that reopen when charmed closed by any but the proper counter-curse = depleted uranium rifle ammo that isn't quite so depleted. That last may not be the best example, since the rounds aren't the tool, but you get the idea. [I was going to use Jem'Hadar pulse rifles that leave anti-coagulants in their targets, but not everyone here is that nerdy to get the reference].

The twins are producing or in some cases reselling disposable end-products; a new kind of silly string or specially-recorded erotic audio novels. The tools are part of the task, but it's the end-product that is original, and that they can sell and sell again.

So, spell-makers are not unlike machinists, who take the pieces of simpler technologies and grind them into shape to suit a specific purpose. Not a widely-trained skill set, but very useful, even essential, if you're in the industry.
