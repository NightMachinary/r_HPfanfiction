I always preferred it being a mixture of the first three; making new spells is difficult, can be costly, and most importantly is not /at all/ appealing to most of the magical world. They just can't think of anything new to make.

Like, why make a spell that basically acts like a sword when you have /an instant-death spell?/

Though I also like the concept of certain spells using different languages; say, Salazar Slytherin using spells that require Parselmouth.

So... kind of all four reasons all at once, really.
