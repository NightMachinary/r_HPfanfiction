I'm sorry, but I don't get how runes or spell creation should logically lead to extreme power.

The stuff you said about spell creation seems good, but just because it's not said in the books doesn't make it a loophole. Coming up with explanations like this is part of what fanfiction is about. However, you seem to be equating being able to invent spells with being powerful, with no justification.

Also, there doesn't necessarily have to be an explanation for why someone is powerful. It could be that some people are just naturally more powerful than others.
