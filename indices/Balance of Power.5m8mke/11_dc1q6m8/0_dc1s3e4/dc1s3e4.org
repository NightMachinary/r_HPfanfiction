Spell of instant win:

1) My new spell instantly tracks down any target with the criteria I specify, from bearers of the dark mark to individuals with brown eyes to birth certificates for people born in january. 2) My new spell finds the target and gets as close as it can to them, if there is an obstacle in the way it goes through it or around it or floats as close as it can get to the target. 3) My new spells becomes an orb of fiednfyre and rapidly expands until the target is destroyed before dispersing itself. 4) My new spell hits everyone who can see it with a memory scrambling effect when it disperses. 5) The magical frequency of my new spell omits me from any and all of its effects and the orb of fiendfyre will never grow so large as to touch me.

And now I win at everything. The end.

I think you might be missing the point I was trying to make: in canon we don't have a reason for why the world is the way it is. There must /be/ a reason and fanfic tries to find that reason. but some people don't try to find a cause for the condition we observe, they just let the MC ascend to god mode because... idk, 'reasons'.

You do raise a valid point though, I need to add premise 4. Magical cores are an old standby in fanfic, and would be a legitimate reason why only some people get to be really strong.
