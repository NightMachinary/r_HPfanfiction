Well you wanted advice, so here it is:

Don't include any "spells of instant win". It's not going to be a great story if the author allows them to solve any problem with an invented spell. (It's pretty much the same as letting the MC ascend to god mode). Even if there is a reason for being able to create such a overpowered spell, it's unlikely to be satisfying to readers unless there is a greater than or equal cost. That doesn't seem possible with the spell you described, so maybe tone it down a bit and think about what sort of spell might be reasonable.
