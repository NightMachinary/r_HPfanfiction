I think that there's something important to keep in mind in these discussions, and that is that to wizards and witches, /magic may well seem mundane/.

After all, they've been around it for their entire lives. They're used to seeing their parents using magic for things like transportation and domestic activities. This is roughly equivalent, I feel, as us seeing our parents ride in cars and using everyday appliances.

Despite seeing these marvels of technology that would have jaws dropping just a few generations ago, few people feel an absolute need to understand everything there is about technology.

Why, then, should wizards and witches feel a burning drive to learn magic? Most jobs are unlikely to require a mastery of magic, so why would you spend countless hours practicing magic when you don't really need it in the end?
