  Ok so the main issue, is that the reward is so high now that logically tons of peopel should want to become like these people. We said that anyone with a keen interest can be like these people. So why aren't hoardes of people doing this?

Dumbledore did decades of research and work, studied under Flamel, and collected knowledge from all over the world to be as powerful as he is. Voldemort went through decades of travel through mysterious places in the world and learned magic unknown to most of the world to gain his power.

Why should a normal wizard or witch, who got through his exams and managed to land a job good enough to sustain his family, even think of spending decades learning magic and plotting to gain power? Power comes at the cost of effort, and people are inherently lazy. The easiest solution is rarely the grandest one isn't it?
