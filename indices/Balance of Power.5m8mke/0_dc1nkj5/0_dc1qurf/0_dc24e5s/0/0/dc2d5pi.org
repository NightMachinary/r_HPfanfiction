Ok so the main issue, is that the reward is so high now that logically tons of peopel should /want/ to become like these people. We said that anyone with a keen interest can be like these people. So why aren't hoardes of people doing this?

If you can answer that (and I have no answer to that), then you have a few more questions left, but the rest are good opportunities to world build.

(1) How do normal witches and wizards interpret these beings who are hand-and-foot way better than normal folk. Is there a religious-like worship? Are they scorned? You'd expect society to be super revolved around these few people.

(2) Political change must be frequent. If a select few are way better than the rest, than whichever faction in a conflict contains these few will win. If there's only a few key players, then it's very likely for one side to dominate (by luck alone).

(3) Why do these wizards not attempt to spread their teachings? Do they do so only to a select few apprentices? If Dumbledore told me he could turn my son into a powerhouse, why wouldn't I go with them?

How you answer the above 3 questions can be really cool worldbuilding for a fic. But the big question of "why are most wizards not like these people" is still there.
