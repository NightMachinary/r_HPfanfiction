The Rule of Counters is also one more thing to consider. If there is magic that can harm, then there exists magic that can protect from that harm. The Unforgivables are named as they are for that reason after all. It's not that they are the worst things that can be done to a wizard/witch. It's just that there is no magic that can block them.
