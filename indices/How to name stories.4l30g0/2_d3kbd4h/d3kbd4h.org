Naming stories for me is weird. Sometimes it's the very first thing I do, sometimes the very last. When all else fails, I usually just pick a song or album title that I like and pop it on even if it has nothing to do with the story. For stories that don't get published, they're sorted by pairing in sequential order, so for example, "Euphoria" started out in life as "Harry/Fleur idea 9" while my most current Harry + Daphne entry is "Harry/Daphne idea 32"
