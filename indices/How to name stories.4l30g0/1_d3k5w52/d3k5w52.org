"Untitled fic #" is how I organize my writing folder. I can crank out a few thousand words per day but rarely does anything get long enough to warrant a title, let alone publishing.

I'm a fan of 1-3 word titles for things I read. Doesn't need to be complicated, just catchy enough that Google can find it again when I forget. 'Character Name and The Plot or Object' is way too common and just a canon rehash habit.
