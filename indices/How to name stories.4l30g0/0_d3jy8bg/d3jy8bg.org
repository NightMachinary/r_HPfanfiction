Your story title doesn't have to point towards the plot, although it's an option - for example, 'The Lie I've Lived' is vague but applies to the plot revealed in the first few chapters; 'Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time' is much more direct. However, you should avoid intentionally misleading the reader. If your story is about fighting, politics and intrigue, then calling it 'The Days of Blood' or 'Right Word, Wrong Time' is fitting, and calling it 'Imago' or 'Disjunct' is fine, but calling it 'Moonlight and Roses' or 'A Soft Hand, Reaching Out' is bad.

As long as the story title wouldn't push away readers looking for the genre that you're writing, it's fine. I don't read romance stories, so I wouldn't check out a story called 'Moonlight and Roses' regardless of the tags on it, because there are so many options that it's easier to just scroll down than look for tags and the summary. However, if I can't tell the genre from the title - and it sounds interesting or at least not awful - then I'll skim the summary and tags, and decide based on that.
