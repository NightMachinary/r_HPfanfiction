There's always going to be a few reasons, and no one will be the same.

For some, it's driven by dislike of the side that Harry is originally with - usually Dumbledore and/or the Weasleys. Dumbledore in particular has a lot of flaws in canon, which makes it easy to identify problems and holes in the worldview. A part of this is also based in control/independence - canon Harry isn't very independent and gets led along by Dumbledore willingly, whereas some authors would want to see him push back and make his own path.

For others, it's because of the worldbuilding. In a lot of ways, the WW is quite shallow - and that strikes some people the wrong way (eg, Slytherins just being evil). That obviously drives a backlash of authors interested in the world, but also wanting to dive a little deeper - and doing so tends to lead to needing to take a more measured look at things that in the main series can just be dismissed as evil and not really looked at further.

One of the points of fanfiction is being able to change things - so in fanfiction where Voldemort is whitewashed, think of it as an entirely different universe than canon Harry Potter. It's in a universe where that's the truth.

For a non HP example, one that comes to mind is The Last Ringbearer - see its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ringbearer][wikipedia page here]]. Sometimes thinking of situations/concepts by flipping around who is good/evil can be interesting - and, depending on the type of story being told, I personally find it more interesting than just blanket good/evil.
