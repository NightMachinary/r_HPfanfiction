Thanks for the reply! I agree to some degree about the glorifying the aristocracy.

There is a feeling of your protagonist being better than anyone else by terms of breeding. (This is actually super interesting from a sociologist point of view, since we had almost 200 years of dismantling aristocracy and democracy, therefore such ideas should be abandoned, and yet they crop up in fanfiction. Super interesting)

About the house elves, I just attribute it to laziness not to anything else. Dobby was such a plot device in DH that authors feel justified to reuse it, since it's canon sanctified. I wouldn't expect anything deeper there than that.
