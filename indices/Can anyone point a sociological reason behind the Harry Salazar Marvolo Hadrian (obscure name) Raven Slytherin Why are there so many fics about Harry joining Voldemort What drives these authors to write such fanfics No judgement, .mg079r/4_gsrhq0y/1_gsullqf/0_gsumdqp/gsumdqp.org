Ahh, gotcha. I think that what you're talking about is mainly just the tendency of a lot of authors to glorify the aristocracy. Similar to how people came up with the headcanon that House elves supposedly die without being enslaved--- after associating canon Harry with a lot of the righteous civil rights stuff in canon, like S.P.E.W and Muggleborn rights and all that ish, people try to explore what would've happened if circumstances made it so that he ended up like the early version of Draco Malfoy. Of course, that's mainly to do with the “Harry being adopted by some pure blood family and joining Voldemort” and all that ish.

I have no idea why they go to the crazy lengths of placing him at the /top/ of the aristocracy and give him all those Lordships and all that--- maybe just overindulgence in making Harry as opposite as possible from canon?
