Harry was extremely passive and kind of sad in canon books. Even more so in the films (film Hermione is one of my pet peeves).

But I don't think that's the main reason. I wasn't talking about Indy!Harry fics. They are a different topic. Those fics are exactly what you talk about, a power fantasy that enables Harry to do shit and kick some ass.

My point was about the various Harry gets adopted/married/enlightened by the Voldemort side and becomes Hadrian Rasputin Marvolo Dracula Slytherin (gosh, it's fun writing that), falls in love with Snape or Barty Croush jr. or one of the Lestrange brothers, joins Voldemort and gets a personality transplant through whatever means necessary. There are many, many fics like that and have been for years.

Indy!Harry is totally different. Since Indy!Harry is always opposed to Voldemort, even if he doesn't care about Wizarding Britain and tells them to fuck off... (which is a totally separate issue, not germane to this topic).

Thanks for the input!
