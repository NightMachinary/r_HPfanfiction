I think it's just because a lot of authors get annoyed with how passive Harry was in canon.

When you think about it, there's more than enough evidence to suggest that Harry had the potential to actually become a really powerful wizard capable of facing a Dark Lord without relying on sheer luck and friends to survive--- but the potential was wasted, considering how he made use of it. He's quite lazy (though this is more an effect of being forced to hide talent when he lived with the Dursleys--- he never had a responsible adult that he felt safe around and trusted, who told him it was okay to do better, and set those expectations, so he just carried on), and relies on his friend as a crutch to save him in situations where he can and should perform better, time and time again.

His POV with regards to the Dursleys is... at times understandable considering the trauma of the neglect/abuse, but it's still vindicating to see him react with less inhibitions.

Every single book is basically him coming to Hogwarts after a terrible summer, letting himself be provoked by Draco Malfoy and trying to obsessively stalk and/or attack him (usually failing to do so without Hermione's help), getting bullied by Snape, and then almost getting killed by a Professor--- which would be fine if he learned from all that and showed some character development earlier on instead of as late as it took in canon, but that wasn't the case.

He lets things go way too easily--- I can't be the only one annoyed with how he handled the reunion with Ron in the Goblet of Fire, or the Deathly Hallows.

He's also a bit naive and more than a little self-righteous. He's still very likable, which is a big reason why the overwhelming majority of fanfics center his character and most readers prefer that POV being the predominant (if not singular) one.

I also think he is a bit bigoted himself, towards Slytherins, and towards Dark abilities like Parseltongue, which isn't intrinsically evil (I REALLY wish he had a pet snake in canon). I despise the Cursed Child storyline, and I think Harry would've actually been a great (albeit flawed) parent, but Hogwarts-era Harry honestly might have acted the way that Cursed-Child-Harry did towards Albus Potter without the character development and growth that Harry ultimately went through at the end of canon. He is a bit like his dad James in that regard, though unlike James (and Sirius), he likely would've been able to recognize he'd crossed the line at some point, like Harry sort of did in OotP and HBP.

After reading a lot of fanfic where you can twist all of that around, I think a lot of authors just decide to go over the top. Thus, Harry Potter becomes Hadrian Pendragon Sayre Tudor Blah Blah, his mother was actually a pureblood (somehow) and now he's the highest ranking member of the aristocracy, he transforms into an overpowered edgelord with a harem, his insecure/jealous friend (Ron) and condescending friend (Hermione) go from being flawed but likable to evil wretches laid to be his friends who would betray him without a second thought, and he becomes the infamous indie! Harry we've all grown tired of.

Him hating Muggles would make sense because of the Dursleys, though I think he'd still be fine with Muggleborns in this case because of his mother, and wouldn't be a full-on Blood Purist. Him joining Voldemort makes sense because it's not like he can remember the parents he lost, Dumbledore is just as bad in many (though not all) ways, and he presumably wants a quiet life more than he wants to be the hero. The rest of it though, is just overindulgence by authors who get excited at creating a Dark-ish, Mary Sue, Harry Potter.
