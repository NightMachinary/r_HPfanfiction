Potential wasted you say but the entire point of the series was that potential wasn't wasted. Harry is who he is because he values friendship, lpvr, joy and all those fluffy things over love. In the end, I think, as he walks tp his death, Harry would have choosen all the time he wasted with Ron doing absolutely nothing over becoming infinitely stronger.
