This. The "wasted potential" is precisely where the character work is. It is in these places that Harry becomes a complex and nuanced character instead of a generic action hero with a personality as interesting as cardboard. I've never managed to power through an OP!Harry fic because of how unrecognizable Harry becomes in those stories.
