A lot of people have that opinion. But personally, I just don't understand why achieving your potential precludes character growth and interpersonal relationships. I agree part of the charm of the series is that Harry isn't some all-powerful godlike figure and achieves what he does largely through his friends and good luck. But then there's a difference between someone who legitimately doesn't have that capability and makes do, versus someone who does have it but ignores it altogether, never learning.

From what we've seen in the series, Harry is more than capable of being good at Potions when he /wants/ to be, like when he saw Snape's memory and felty sympathy and made that Invigoration Draught perfectly. He also is able to cast multiple spells effectively on the first try, at levels that adult wizards can't reach, and is able to teach others as well, despite disregarding magical theory and the wand movements/incantation intricacies that people like Hermione are much better at. Examples include Levicorpus, Crucio, Sectumsempra, Imperio, Muffliato, etc. One of the most impressive adult witches at beauxbeatons, Fleur, isn't even able to make it past a grindylow while Harry not only does that but deliberately acts against them and stays with all the hostages in the lake until the end. Per the twins in HBP, most Ministry adults (even Aurors) can't cast functioning shield charms, yet Harry is able to do that at a level that's quite difficult to break through (he even deflects Snape's legilimency one time, which is saying something considering how powerful Snape was), and also taught other students this as well. All it took for him to do nonverbal casting was the absence of Snape (although he did read to do it from Snape's book).

Hermione, while being a bookworm, still made more than enough time to talk with Ron and Harry and go on various adventures and sneak out past curfew, etc.

The series is basically littered with examples of showing that Harry has the capability to become a really impressive wizard, but his utter disdain for power and lack of ambition makes him disregard that, and that supposedly makes him a more moralistic character who defeats Voldemort, per the moral of the story. I think the message that should have been pushed more, that Rowling likely intended to do to a degree but also toned down too much, was that power and ambition don't mean evil, but also aren't everything, and that while Voldemort was powerful, Harry's strength of character gave him an edge (but only an edge, /not a crutch/).

Ron Weasley at 11 years old cast a levitation charm so strong, it knocked out a fully grown Mountain Troll with its own club. He's no slouch himself. And he was a great character, albeit flawed. Sirius Black was the same, and he was pretty powerful. It doesn't mean that they'd be any less likely to die for the people they care about.

I don't think powerful Harry necessarily means indie! Harry, though that's certainly a common trope in fandom.
