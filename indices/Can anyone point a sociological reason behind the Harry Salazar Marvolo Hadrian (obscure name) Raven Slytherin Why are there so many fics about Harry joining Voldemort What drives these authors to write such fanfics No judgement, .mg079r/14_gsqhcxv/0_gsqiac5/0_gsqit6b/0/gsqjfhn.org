I could accept that. I read some Anne Rice novels, although they weren't for me.

Twilight does that to some degree (although I never read any of the books, nor watched any of the films, all I know about it is the usual anti-Twilight propaganda).

Therefore I can accept that premise but I don't think it's that simple in fanfiction. Is it?
