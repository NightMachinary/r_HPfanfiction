The idea that there is Absolute Good and Absolute Evil has always been fascinating to me.

As an amateur historian, I was always perplexed how people can even consider such a notion. Perhaps it's a signum temporis, perhaps it's not.

I agree with the reader getting sucked into the perspective and the worldview of the protagonist. Especially an inexperienced one.

A tangent: I always found it amazing that people associate the views of the characters with the author, which is rarely the case in professional authors. Although I've seen a trend developing when that is not the case anymore.

Thanks for your input!
