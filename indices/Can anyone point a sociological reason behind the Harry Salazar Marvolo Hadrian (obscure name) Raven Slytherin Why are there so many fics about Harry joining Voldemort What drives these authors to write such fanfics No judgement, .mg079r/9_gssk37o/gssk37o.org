I cannot answer why you would call your character 25 names. But as for the rest of it:

As an author, the very reason that drives me to write is to explore people. To study them, figure out 'what makes them tick', how the world shapes them, and how they shape the world. The natural consequence is that "normal" people are boring. Their motivations are a dime a dozen, they are insignificant, and don't shape the world at all. Far more interesting are the exceptions. People that aren't like the rest. People with world views different from the norm. People with conflicting goals. And finally, people with power, able to shape things around them, or with the desire to do such.

Tangentially related to that, I also like to play with perceptions and subjectivity. I love to introduce situations that make /the readers/ questions their convictions, by virtue of relativising the Absolute Good and Absolute Evil, and play with all the nuances in-between. There is no greater reward than when I write about commonly terrible situations or actions, but the reader is nodding along because it makes sense from the POV they are reading. In the end, this works because a potential to be a terrible human being is in all of us, and teasing out that aspect so that it can resonate with the POV creates a mirror for the audience where they end up seeing themselves.

Both combined leads, in terms of HP Canon, to writing from the opposite site the books present: HP is thankful world to write in, precisely because it's so black and white, so if you start writing about the Slytherins, Death Eaters, and Voldemort, the impact is that much bigger, as everyone has the source material in mind. So in this sense, Harry becomes merely a vehicle of getting there, if you want to write about the most popular character -- on the one hand. And on the other hand, exploring different Harrys, or ways in which he becomes different from Canon, is precisely the first point of doing character studies.
