I don't write these but I read a lot of them lol. I suppose, as some commenters have already pointed out, is that the way Dumbledore and the Dursleys don't get any justice AT ALL for all the horrible things they did just isn't very satisfying as a reader. Yes, Dumbledore wasn't actually evil, and certainly not worse than Voldemort, but he gets away with a LOT of negligence of his treatment of students, so I suppose these fics are trying to make up for that?

The abuse from the Dursleys was, in my opinion, not handled as it should have been; it was more of a convenient plot point to have no actual caring adults in Harry's life be able to step in and prevent some of the awful things he went through, than actual abuse. Fanon does exaggerate his abuse, as Harry wasn't beaten bloody or anything, but he was starved, locked up, and emotionally abused. The Dursleys face no repercussions for that, and readers even get the sense that they are trying to redeem themselves (Petunia's deleted scene, as an example). Personally it doesn't sit well with me, and paid that with how Dumbledore continuously forced Harry to go back to them?

The rich, heir to 50 houses thing is odd, I agree; it is a very classist trope. I suppose Lucius Malfoy's Aesthetic(TM) is just sexy lol. Villains are romanticised by fandoms always, especially if they're hot (and BOI was Tom Riddle a smokeshow).

Therefore, characters (Dumbledore and Dursleys) doing bad actions and not really suffering for it + hot villains + unlimited potential = evil!Dumbeldore + anti-muggle!dark!Harry
