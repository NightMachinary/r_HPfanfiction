I think the abuse of the Dursleys was overblown in fanfiction. It is pretty bad, but not fanfiction bad. They never beat, rape or starved Harry (there is that episode in Book 2 with the catflap, but it's never repeated).

I agree that romanticised villians play a role. It's probably the number one reason behind all those fics. The abused child fighting against his/hers oppressors.
