A few people have said about the names being a strange add on.

I'm catholic and my family are from Ireland. I have 7 middle names. So 9 names in total. Thats because I'm a only child and I'm carrying those names into the next generation so to speak.

The Harry into Hadrien or Harrison. Change is psychologically to make this character someone different in a sense. Names are fundamentally difficult to change in other peoples perception. I knew a woman in university who told me her name was one thing and then years later I found out it was her middle name. When I talk about her with others that know her by her first name. It feels wrong saying that name.

Linking back by using a different name, people get upset saying Harry Potter kicks ginny in the face. If the sentence is "Hadrien Potter-Black kicked his life debt slave ginerva in the face in revenge for trying to slip him another love potion" people are less likely to be as grumpy.

That points out that while they are Harry and ginny. They aren't the Harry and ginny you know.

Leading into your next point in your question. Why write Harry joins Voldemort. I've never written any fanfiction. Day dreamt it. But never wrote it down.

Voldemort is reprehensible. However JK kind of wrote a Saturday morning cartoon villain group. Oh so evil and clearly in the wrong. We want to be superior to everyone else. Its pure evil. Its racism taken to the extreme.

Its also the exact sort of propaganda that people are used to seeing in the news constantly.

Taking a semi recent example of Donald trump when he first joined the White House. He accepted a phone call from North korea(might be wrong on the country ). Now the news papers ridiculed him for this act as america doesn't recognise north Korea as a country and as such he shouldn't of done that. And thats fair. But the news didn't point out there were 10 other people in the office at the time, his political advisors who were there to stop things like that from happening. (I'm not pro trump or anything just a case of media bias that popped to mind)

Thinking about it logically. Voldemort and his death munchkins wouldnt work as political party or even as a terror cell as they have no reasonable goals. Pureblood supremacy doesn't work when you're murdering more purebloods than anyone else. So people write as if he had deeper ideals and what we read was just the rita skeeter spin on it all.

And having Harry champion a cause for whatever soapbox the writer wants to put him on works like that.
