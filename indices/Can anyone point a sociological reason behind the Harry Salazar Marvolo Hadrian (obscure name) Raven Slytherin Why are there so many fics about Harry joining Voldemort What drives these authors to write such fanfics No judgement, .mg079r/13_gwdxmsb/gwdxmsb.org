i don't really have an answer ro the second part, but as for the naming convention. we have stated several times throughout the books, that dumbledore is the greatest wizard of the time, etcetera etcetera. woi has the long name Albus Percival Wolfric Brian Dumbledore. and we have the "worst dark lord of all time" voldemort aka tom morvolo riddle, morvolo is a strange name by our standarts, and voldemort is powerful. dumbledore has several strange names, and is just as if not more powerful, and hes old, not in his prime. so logic dictates based off of what we know using just the original 7 books, people with longer stranger names because more strange names equals more powerfull/skilled wizard. sombody/somebody's started using the trope, and it stuck. people started to use it more and more, and it got more and more exaggerated.
