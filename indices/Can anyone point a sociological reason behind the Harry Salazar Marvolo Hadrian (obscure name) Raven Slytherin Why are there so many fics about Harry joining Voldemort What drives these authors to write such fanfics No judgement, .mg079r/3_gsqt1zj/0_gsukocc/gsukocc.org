Thank you for the reply, it was exactly what I was hoping for. It was very interesting to see your perspective.

Yeah, I can see that fascination and coupled with teenage rebellion (as good a term as any) it is logical that it lead to such fics.

The appeal of the Evil side is also understandable, they are cool. Especially in HP films when the bad guys (especially if you consider Snape a bad guy) were played by some very good actors and the good guys ... weren't (apart from Gary Oldman).

I think your viewpoint was the best one so far. It really hammers the point right down to the middle.
