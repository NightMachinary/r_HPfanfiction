I have written these types of fics and I have read them as well, so here's my (admittedly a bit disjointed and I don't feel sufficiently explained) 2Â¢:

When I was a teenager, a lot of the appeal was in essentially being able to deal with my feelings. Please understand I'm not saying everyone who reads/writes these fics is a teenager or that they should be looked down on if they are. For me, I had a /lot of feelings/ as a teenager that it felt like /no one could ever understand./ I was grappling with personal issues, an increasingly complex view of the world, and beginning to question a lot of the things I'd been taught -- and to be clear, for the most part my teenage years were relatively trauma free, I was just growing up, as you do.

So there was a big attraction to the fact Harry, in joining Voldemort, could basically act out on all the ways he'd been hurt. It was cathartic to me. Harry abandoning the Weasleys due to Ron's behavior in GoF? I /understood/ that and it gave me a way of feeling less powerless about betrayals in my own life that I couldn't do anything about. Or the fact that Voldemort was now the "good" side--well, I had a ton of feelings about how things I'd been taught growing up weren't as crystal clear or actually weren't good AT ALL, and there was a big appeal (and, to be honest, a satisfying sense of rebellion) in being able to say "this is good" even if it wasn't. It was comforting.

A big part of it when I was a teenager was also that, even though if you asked me about it I could tell you all about how awful Voldemort was and how prejudice is wrong and all that, the manifestations of that in Harry Potter didn't always translate to the real non-magical world. In other words, I knew logically that Voldemort was doing awful things and held horrific views where I would never espouse the real-world equivalents, but it was a lot easier for me to ignore or not see the parallels to real world events and suffering.

I recently went and read through a bunch of fics I'd favorited on my teenage FFN account, and a LOT of them fit into what you describe or are variants of it. Looking at them now, most of them just have actions that I can't countenance now. This is true of things I wrote as well.

But that being said, as an adult I still sometimes read fics like this, but nowadays I tend much more towards ones where Voldemort for one reason or another (trapped in a magical artifact? stopped from creating as many horcruxes? reincarnation? other random reason?) isn't /good/ but also isn't reprehensible like he is in canon (particularly canon extrapolated to its logical conclusions and viewed as a parallel to real world events/figures) OR where he is that bad but Harry's corruption is presented as neither romantic nor ideal. In other words, ones where it's presented as horrific that Harry would join Voldemort.

I like that some of these fics are complicated as well. This has a lot to do with what originally drew me to these sorts of fics as a teenager. In other words, there's something to be said for having an evil character that is, in many ways, a good person. Because quite frankly in the real world there are a lot of people who do evil things but in other ways are very good people. When I was younger, it was harder to reconcile that. But now I know that doing bad things doesn't negate the good, nor does doing good things negate the bad. It just is.

To take one associated trope in particular, a common theme you'll find in many "Harry joins Voldemort and/or becomes a Dark Wizard" is that that even Death Eaters would be horrified by the Dursleys' (and/or Dumbledore's) treatment of Harry because "wizarding children are special/sacred/the future." To some extent this makes a lot of sense. The Malfoys, particularly Narcissa, are shown to care for Draco, for example. And so there's something there about people who do evil and hateful things also doing good and loving things. And that's a really cool dynamic to explore, and one that can shine a light on how people are in the real world. Because in reality people aren't all good or all evil. But the problem is when the depiction isn't nuanced enough--when you get the "because the Malfoys love Draco they must be all good and are really just misunderstood" or "well, it's OKAY that they're blood supremacists because Muggleborns really are ruining Wizarding culture so it's JUSTIFIED racism." It's hard to depict a character that is a loving parent and also a racist murderer.

Also, and for the easiest answer, I've been a sucker for hero/villain relationships for basically forever--there's no way I'd want one in the real world, but they can have really intriguing (to read, not to live through) relationship dynamics.

*tl;dr: For me, a lot of the appeal is in relationship dynamics, investigating complexities of how people work, and seeing personal experiences/feelings reflected in fanfic in a cathartic way, but often times the writing isn't nuanced enough so it becomes an "evil people are really good" thing instead of "people are complicated and don't fit into neat categories" thing.*
