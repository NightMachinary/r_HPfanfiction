I think there's an appeal to trying to flip the narrative on it's head and see what you can do with it.

I also think that sometimes an author starts with saying 'Dumbledore is just as bad' and then it turns into 'Dumbledore is worse than Voldemort' and then into 'because Dumbledore is worse than Voldemort and Harry has to join a side, he should join Voldemort'.

And then the new name thing is probably because he wants to distance himself, and in a lot of these stories he feels obligated to pick up family names because of a trope that Dumbledore kept his inheritance from him

The abandoning his friends part is usually because they betrayed him in an unforgivable fashion of some sort, like the popular tropes of Ginny love potion-ing him, Ron being a fake friend for influence, and Hermione being a practically blind sycophant to Dumbledore and anyone with authority.
