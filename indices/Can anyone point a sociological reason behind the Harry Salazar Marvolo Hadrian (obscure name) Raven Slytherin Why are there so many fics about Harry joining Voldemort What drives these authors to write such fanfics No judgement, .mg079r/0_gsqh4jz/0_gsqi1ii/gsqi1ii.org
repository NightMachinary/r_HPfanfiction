So... What you just wrote is simply Bizarro world. Everything is opposite and that's it?

I would like to reiterate my original post. What would drive such stories? I know what they are, but why write them? (NOT that there is anything wrong with that. Fanfiction is wonderful in its diversity!) What desire do they fulfill?

Sorry for haranguing you, but I mostly seek the intent, the motivation, the reason why people write such stories... If it's just because the reversal, which I doubt it is but who knows... would be simply sad.

I think there is more reason behind this trope. There are many stories fulfilling it, perhaps not as many as indy!Harry, but I don't know. I see it pretty often.
