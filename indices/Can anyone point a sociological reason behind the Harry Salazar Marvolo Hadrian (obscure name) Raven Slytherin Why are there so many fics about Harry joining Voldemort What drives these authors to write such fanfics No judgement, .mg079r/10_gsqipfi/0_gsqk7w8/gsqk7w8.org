I don't think you get the fics or the target audience I'm talking about. I was mostly talking about slash fics with Harry joining Voldemort, usually it happens around the Tri-Wizard but not always.

Most of the issues you are mentioning go into Indy!Harry category not this (although there is some overlap). Which is another interesting conundrum. In which way are they similar? The target audience is probably totally separate, yet similar.

Food for thought.
