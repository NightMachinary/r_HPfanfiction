"Cool motive, still murder." - JKR

Voldemort in canon has a pretty tragic backstory. His mum came from poverty, used (societally acceptable) love potions, deluded herself into believing in Love, then abandoned Tom at an orphanage. He lived there in a life without love with only his magic to bring him comfort until he found a home at Hogwarts. From the moment Dumbledore met him, he was profiled against, considered evil, which prevented him from teaching at his beloved home. He alone gathered the oppressed and unwanted of society - the werewolves, Giants, and conservatives - in a Wizarding revolution against a corrupt government.

By accentuating his tragic/misunderstood traits and minimizing /everything/ else, Voldemort can be cast as a "good guy."

Dumbledore collaborated (and fell in love) with literal magic Hitler. He abandoned a baby on a doorstep to abusive muggles, knowing for a fact that he was condemning said child to a loveless existence and doing nothing about it. He stored the Philosopher's stone, a target of a mass terrorist, at a school for children. He left it to said abused child to slay a 60-ft basilisk alone, a werewolf + mass murderer, a death tournament for 7th years, annual character defamation, government-sanctioned torture, and Voldemort himself. And for what? His endgame was to convince an abused /child to voluntarily martyr himself/.

By accentuating his /really/ questionable treatment of children, Dumbledore can easily be cast as the "bad guy." There's a reason the Death Stick chose him.

Tl;dr -- I assume that the "Harry joins Voldemort" trope is an (over)compensation for how the good guys get away with so much in canon, while Voldemort, despite his humanizing origins, is made out to be a moustache-twirler.
