linkffn(Hermione Granger is Stupid) is a favorite of mine (despite the name) and it has pretty much everything you asked for. The initial motivation for the romance is a bit ham-fisted, but there's a lot of realistic and funny moments that you should be able to forgive the occasional minor misstep.
