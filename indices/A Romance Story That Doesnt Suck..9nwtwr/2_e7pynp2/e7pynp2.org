linkffn(Harry Potter and the Fifth Element; The Life he leads; A Beautiful Lie; The Half-blood Romantic; Black Bond; Harry Potter and the Elemental's Power; Fraterculus; The Legacy by storytellerspw; I'm still here by kathryn518; The Merging)

All of these are good to great in my opinion, personal favorites (romance-wise) are The Legacy, Half-blood Romantic and The Life I've lived. Keep in mind that not all of them are complete and may be abandoned, though they are quite satisfying to your criterias, with the exception of Ron being jealous (he is in Fifth Element, though). All of them are pretty slow burn romance wise, specially Black Bond and The Legacy, with Legacy only getting to a romance point halfways through, but its hands down, the best marriage contract fic out there, imo, followed closely by Contractual invalidation (which has nothing to do with what you asked, I'd say.)

Now, lastly, my favorite fic all time amongst all other fics is linkffn(Grow Young with Me). It isn't school-age, doesn't have teenage angst (Harry's 29 at the start of the fic) and there's no "teenage crushes, confessions, rejections, hurt, love potions, mystery," except perhaps the confessions part. Nor does it have a jealous Ron (he's actually lovely here, so is every Weasley, Hermione included, and this is coming from a Hermione Hater.) but its slow burn, is the best romance I've read in fanfiction (perhaps even in books in general, though I loved Red Rising's romance too much.) and Taliesin is simply wonderful to her readers in her Tumblr.
