That's the Indy!Harry route which only few fanfiction writers get right. Will Harry become an independent dark wizard faction (against both Dumbledore and Voldemort)? Someone more Grindelwaldian, maybe even breaking out ol' man Gellert to have an ally against Dumbledore and Voldemort? A pro-Muggle-born and/or pro-creature radical?
