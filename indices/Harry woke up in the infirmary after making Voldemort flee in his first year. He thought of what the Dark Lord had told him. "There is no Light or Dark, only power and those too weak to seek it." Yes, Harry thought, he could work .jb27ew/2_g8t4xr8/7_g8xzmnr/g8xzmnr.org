Agree with most what you point out, but...

There is nearly no other way history can evolve from what happened in canon. An awful lot of people have died on both sides - and a fair lot of the old purebloods on the Dark side who managed to survive /hopefully/ ended in Azkaban. That means that suddenly the muggle-born and half-blood magical people have more political leverage and can actually push for sweeping changes in society.

Besides - that the Wizarding world was massively behind Muggle society was glaring all over the seven books. Up until maybe ~1950 I'd say that Wizard and Muggle societies were relatively similar - patriarchal in structure, nowhere near as democratic as modern Muggle societies are, technologically newspapers and radio being the dominant form of mass communication, with the Wizarding society even being at the advantage (Floo network, Apparition, two-way mirrors, animated photos). But since then, Muggle society improved so massively - women got full equality, democracy spread throughout Europe while nobilities got the finger, TVs, computers and phones became a thing - that one has to be blind to ignore just how stuck in the past Wizard societies are.
