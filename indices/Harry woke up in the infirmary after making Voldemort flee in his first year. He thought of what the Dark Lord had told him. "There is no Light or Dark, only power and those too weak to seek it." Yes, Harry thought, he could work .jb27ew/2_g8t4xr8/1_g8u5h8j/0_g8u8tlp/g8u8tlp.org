Harry staying in Bill's room and finding a book on curse breaking and getting really interested in it could be a good lead up to it too. Or he's talking about the films with Hermione and Ron mentions it's "so he's basically a muggle curse breaker?"

It's actually be a really good chance to show more of the magical world as well as actually make runes useful for what he does in a non magic way, reading warnings and such. It'd be a really fun read I think.
