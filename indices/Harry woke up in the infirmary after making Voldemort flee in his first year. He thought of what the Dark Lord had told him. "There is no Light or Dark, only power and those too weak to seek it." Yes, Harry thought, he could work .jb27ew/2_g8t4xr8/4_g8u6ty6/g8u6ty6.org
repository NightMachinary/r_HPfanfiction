  uses Runes for everything magical in life (despite Runes being just a dead language)

Honestly, I agree with most of what you said, but when people complain about this it just grinds my gears.

YES! Runes in canon are just a language but, honestly, fuck that! We already have one of the most plot dependant, lazyass magical system ever, let us place some limits and logic in it for fuck's sake!

I honestly don't understand people that complain endlessly about Runes being used in a more D&D capacity as a magical language and binding method, it just fits the many, many others more consistent and expansive magical systems in fiction and allows authors to make HP magic deeper and less wishy-washy 'whatever, it's a children's book'.

'AriThmAnCy iS jUsT dIviNatioN' Yes! We know, fuck that too! How are spells made in canon? Does everyone in the world speak Latin spells? Even the people whose language /predates/ Latin by thousands of years(China, Japan, Africa, Greece, German, Anglo Saxons)?

Using magical math to create and modify spells makes more sense than someone reading a spell created by a guy and casting it perfectly despite not having the faintest idea of what it did? What did Snape just list the Somatic component in a universal, all reaching Master Spell List? What if a guy in Italy also made a spell whose incantation is Sectumsempra, which one would work? How is that done?

At least math is universal.

I agree overused tropes and bad writing are bad and make for bad stories, but don't couple that with expanding the magical systems and adding more things to it to enrich the story.
