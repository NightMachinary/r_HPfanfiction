Those of age would give a fuck about the staff anymore, considering they could rule whole land by themselves. Idealists like Hermione would all be shouting about stomping out cruelty and slavery of this world, while opportunists like Draco would seize the chance to rule over Muggles.

A staff of less than 10 couldn't possibly control 300+ teens armed with deadly weapons, especially not when the Ministry was no longer there to enforce any wizard laws.

I think the staff itself would be divided in this matter.

They along with most students would take their cues from Harry, who with his saving people thing certainly would not sit idle and let this land tear each other apart.
