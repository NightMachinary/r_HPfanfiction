Harry Potter magic is broken as fuck, people seem to underestimate it because the movies relegated it to laser tag battle and crossing wand streams. Things like Apparition, disillusionment, self transfiguration etc are just too difficult for the GOT world to combat(thats not including all of the defence spells/dark spells that could destroy armies like fiendfyre, bombarda, confringo etc etc) . I'm pretty sure they could take over Westeros with minimal casualties if they wanted to.
