I can suspend my disbelief pretty well, but an entire school of practically omnipotent beings (relative to the magic users in Westeros) and they wouldn't just go out there and fix the world as they please? Especially if you have idealists within that school like Hermione who'd have a bit to say about smallfolk and nobility.

I like crossovers like "The Difference One Man Can Make" where Harry ends up being the only wizard and becomes the Witch King of the North, making it entirely clear that he /could/ wreck the entirety of Westeros to shreds, but doesn't because, well... he's not a genocidal psychopath.

But hundreds and hundreds of wizards and witches being discreet about it? 0/10 disbelief not suspended.
