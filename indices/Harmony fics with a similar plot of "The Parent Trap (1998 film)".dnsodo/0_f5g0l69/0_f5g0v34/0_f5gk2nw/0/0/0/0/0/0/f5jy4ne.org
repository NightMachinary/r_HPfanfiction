It actually wasn't that bad of a fic, but again, bashing Ginny was a bit unnecessary.

My rule is if you have to bash Ginny to do your pairing, you did your pairing wrong. Bashing should be avoided for any pairing fic.

I've seen quite a few that just ignore any issues or outright say magical America, Australia, or whatever place is better though. Fantastic beasts might not have been perfect, but having other, but similar hot topic issues to blood purity was great in the magical USA.

Although I'm not sure the law of averages works for everything, because you're assuming an even, finite distribution (although, I'm not sure whether it would apply if wizarding cultures are small-scale, non-technical muggle cultures).
