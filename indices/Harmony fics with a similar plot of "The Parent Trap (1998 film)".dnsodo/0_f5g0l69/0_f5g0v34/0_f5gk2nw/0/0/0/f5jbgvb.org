To be honest, the "reconnecting after a few years apart" is one of my guilty pleasures... Though I would agree that the separation is never for any realistic reason.

(The only relatively good reason I have seen for that trope was; Hermione left for australia to find her parents, while she was there she found out she was pregnant, she sent a letter to the father and never got a response, because someone was throwing away any mail she sent to the guy. Guy doesn't know where she is and she thinks that he doesn't want anything to do with her because she never got anything back from her weekly letters.)

But really for the most part the trope is Hermione leaves and doesn't come back because... plot? I enjoy reading them, but it's usually the execution that shines not the setup.

I do agree, that I prefer plot heavy stories also. A mediocre plot based story is better than a mediocre romance based story. A good romance based story however can be... ya know, good.
