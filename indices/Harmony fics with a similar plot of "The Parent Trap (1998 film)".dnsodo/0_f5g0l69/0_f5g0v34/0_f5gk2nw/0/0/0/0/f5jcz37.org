Even then it just serves to vilify Ginny (Breakfast in New York comes to mind), or whoever threw away the letter. I get why they're your guilty pleasure (Rise of the wizards is mine, at least for the first half because a lack of information between Harry, his friends, and Dumbledore cause the plot, despite everyone's good intentions.). And the illogicalness of the situation in that Harry would just send an owl or something instead of just not talking to her.

You also get the trope that /insert magical destination here/ it's more advanced than Britain, which is either the result of American writers, or laziness.

I just don't get that heartwarming plot. It's just a rehashed movie romance. I don't want to read that.

I'm trying to think of a litmus test for it.
