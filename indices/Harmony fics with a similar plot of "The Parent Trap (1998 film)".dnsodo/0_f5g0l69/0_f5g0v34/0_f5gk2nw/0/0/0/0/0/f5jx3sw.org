I might /might/ have been talking about Breakfast in New York, yes...

Honestly it also doesn't have the best setup, but it is the best of the worst in rationalising these sorts of things.

Yes, but no also, If you go to another part of the world, there will be things better and worse than where you started. The author is invested in the ideas that they made up for the other places and so tend to only talk about the upsides and not the downsides.

Also the fact that if you know nothing about any range, you should assume you find around the middle. Teleport into a universe to document smartphones, find a random one on the ground, it's a Galaxy S5, so you can assume that they probably made up to s10s in this universe. See a cop car with the number 163? law of averages, it is probably near the middle so they probably have about 300. We see the state of magical britain and we can relatively reasonably assume that that they are in the middle on most issues because we have no range.

But I do agree, they a lot of times miss on talking about the "worse" parts of other countries.

  I just don't get that heartwarming plot.

Most of the time that I enjoy it, it is paired with a good B-plot.
