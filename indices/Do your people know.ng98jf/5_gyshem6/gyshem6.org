My mother is my beta reader. My brother has read my story. I have mentioned my story to a friend and one of my cousins. My father and stepfather also know that I write Harry Potter fan fiction, but they know the canon so poorly that I haven't even suggested that they read my story. Oh yes, and my grandmother knows too, but she doesn't understand English, doesn't know the canon at all and I don't think she even understands the concept of fan fiction. She probably thinks my story is just my English practicing project.

I've got high standards which means I don't write anything I would be ashamed of if people found out. The vast majority of fan fiction is of poor quality, but it doesn't mean fan fiction couldn't be of high quality, and I'm confident that my story is very good.
