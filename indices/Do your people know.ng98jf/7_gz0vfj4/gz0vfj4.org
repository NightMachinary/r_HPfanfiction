When I told my family when I was 13 that I'm writing fanfiction they were proud of me at first... especially that I had about 50 reviews after posting my first three chapter. But when they read it they were like "what's this crap and why are people enjoying this shit?" so I never told anyone IRL again about my passion for fanfiction.
