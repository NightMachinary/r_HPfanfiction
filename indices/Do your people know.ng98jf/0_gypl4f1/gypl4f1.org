My sister knows because she reads them too (although we don't send each other recommendations or talk about it, we just know we both read them but have 0 idea about each other's favourite ffs or tropes)

My mother knows although I don't know if she really understands the concept of fanfictions, she knows I love the books and read "stories" about them, but I think she just assumes it's like filling the Canon gaps. Not also completely different plots.

I don't hide it from my friends, they are just not interested in it and never ask about it.

I used to be ashamed of it years ago in highschool, but now I openly share them/talk about it on social media.
