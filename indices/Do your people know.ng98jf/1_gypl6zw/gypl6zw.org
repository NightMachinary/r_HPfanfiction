My husband knows and likes to read my writing. My family know because my sister borrowed my laptop and accidentally stumbled across it. A friend knows because we spent ages kind of dancing around the topic then finally just admitted to one another that we both read and write fanfic. Honestly I'm old enough now that I'm umbothered if someone thinks it's dorky or cringe or whatever, at the end of the day it's a harmless hobby that brings me joy. Definitely when I was a teenager and in my early 20s I kept it quiet though.
