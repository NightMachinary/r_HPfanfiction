Eh, not really, especially with Susan. All three are blank slates, but Katie is a little more defined and others can play the role she can. Hot, older Quidditch girl? Cho. Hot, Gryffindor chaser? Ginny.

Daphne has a really great name, is a Slytherin (which is built-in conflict), potentially rich, and Greengrass is a 28. Susan has a canon, high-ranking Ministry connection, who put up a good fight against Voldemort. She also has a few dead family members from the war.

Factor in the type of stories this fandom enjoys and I can see why we don't get too many Katie, Alicia, or Angelina parings.
