Fuck, I saw "recommendation" and got excited thinking you were going to recommend us a nice new H/K fic. Shame on you for disappointing me like that, man. Use the "request" tag next time.

That said, there are a few where H/K is the early relationship like linkffn(a cadmean victory), but there are very few fics where H/K is the endgame pairing. Off the top of my head, linkffn(harry potter and the muggleborn chaser) is the only one that comes to mind.

Oh, there are also lots of harem/multi fics featuring Katie, but you asked for "good" so I guess they're all excluded.
