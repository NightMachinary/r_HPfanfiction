I've started to read both of these twice and given up all four times.

My problem with Blackpool is twofold. Firstly, it's written in the present tense even though the story is in the past, although it contains flash-forwards to events that happened later than the scene being described but that are still in the past. Confusing?

Second, I grew up only a few miles from Blackpool and any attempt to romanticise it into anything more than a wind-swept, chip-strewn hellhole isn't going to fly for me. Yeah that's unfair but tough.

Prince... Oh boy. This has the same tense problem but it also has the problem that others have already mentioned that the prose is flowery way beyond acceptability.

My beef with using present tense to tell a story is that it's not what the present tense is for. A story is something that happened; something the storyteller is now relating to an audience. So you use a past tense, usually the perfect. The present tense is used for dialogue between characters or, occasionally, and if you know what you're doing, to narrate things like dreams where the author wants to pull the reader into the story and experience something along with a character.

If you're going to write something that deliberately ignores standard grammar then you have to know exactly what you're doing. I don't believe either of these stories work.
