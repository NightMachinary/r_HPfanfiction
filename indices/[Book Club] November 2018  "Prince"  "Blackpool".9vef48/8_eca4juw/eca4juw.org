I'm late to this sorry - I'm going through the past bookclub threads in order to find good fics to read. Blackpool is exactly what I love in a fic - well written and plenty of angst, fills out the canon by exploring characters that are underwritten (though I also like AU stories). Thank you for all the recommendations.
