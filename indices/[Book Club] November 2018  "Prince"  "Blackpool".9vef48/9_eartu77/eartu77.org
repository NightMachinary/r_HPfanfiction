First time checking out /Blackpool/. Couldn't get into it. It's a novel's worth of words, but written like a one-shot, if that makes any sense. It looks nice enough, but my eyes just kept tripping over these sentences that are trying too hard to be evocative, while the characters and the plot don't have the substance to back up the pretty turns of phrase. That's harder to notice in a one-shot; it doesn't work when stretched out for nearly 70k. It feels oddly twee for a dark fic, too.

/Prince/ ... well, this is my third or fourth time trying to read /Prince/. My issues with it are similar to /Blackpool/: style over plot. The writing is tighter, though, and the stylistic choices are more excusable in a full AU. But it's main problem is one that's the opposite of the other fic -- it reads like the condensed version of what should be a longer story.

Edit: Could not finish either of them.
