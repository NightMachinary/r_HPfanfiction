Blackpool is an absolute smash.

It really speaks to me as an older brother from a slightly abusive family. Puts Harry's abuse into perspective, and generally paints a new picture of what magical abuse might look like.

It makes Sirius into the most tragic figure of all time. Endures endless abuse, stays true to himself, saves(fic)/loses(canon) little brother, ... loses best friends, imprisoned in misery-prison for 10 years, meets godson, and dies.

From a storytelling perspective, I like that it is a HP-universe story that doesn't take place 95% in Hogwarts.
