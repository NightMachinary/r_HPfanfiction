Prince is beautifully written. It really is, the entire appeal of the story lies solely its style and nothing else.

Every element of the plot seems to be poorly planned out, and every character feels interchangeable. Everything just seems to be thrown aside to accommodate this focus on pretty writing.

The story itself has no substance whatsoever, but the language is pretty enough that it can hold up on it's own. However, it's just disappointing that there just isn't anything more to it than pleasantly constructed sentences and nice imagery. It's like vanilla extract, it sure smells nice, but tasting it is just disappointing.
