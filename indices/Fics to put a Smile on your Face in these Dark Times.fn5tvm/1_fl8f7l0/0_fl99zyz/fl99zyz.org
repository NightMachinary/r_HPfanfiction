not really crack, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10191828/1/A-MODern-Man]] is pretty amusing. it starts off with Luna telling harry that due to being the Master of Death, he could will himself into another universe, one where his parents lived and he wasn't the boy who lived. then, when Harry starts actually disappearing, a wide eyed Luna protests by exclaiming: but...i was just fucking with you!" heh.
