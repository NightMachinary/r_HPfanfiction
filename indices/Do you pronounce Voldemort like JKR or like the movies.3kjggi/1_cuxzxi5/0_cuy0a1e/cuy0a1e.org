Interesting! I like Malfwa. I think that Voldemort without the /t/ does sound more sinister, which I like.

 

I heard that in the French editions, Severus Snape is Severus /Rogue/. True? If so, do you think readers get a different impression of him with a different last name? the alliteration from the double S of Severus Snape conjures feelings of snakes (of course), sneaking, shifting, etc. Rogue sounds more solid, brash. It means /arrogant/ in French, correct?
