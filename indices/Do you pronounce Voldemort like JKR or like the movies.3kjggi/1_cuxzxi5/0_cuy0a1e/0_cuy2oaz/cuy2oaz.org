Yes I grew up with Sévérus Rogue, and yes "rogue" means arrogant or unpleasant (but is it's a very old and rare word). It doesn't have the same feel to it, less snake and more uneasiness (like a bad taste on the tongue).

The thing is that the French translation of names is a mess... some are not translated at all (Weasley, Granger, Mcgonagall), but a lot are... and if sometimes it works (Wormtail/Qeudver Longbottom/Londubat are both litteral) and sometimes your learn that the name of the Dark Lord is Tom Elvis Jedusor (for the I am Voldemort thing). What always sounded off for me as a kid was that there was English names (Lavande Brown, Fred Weasley) and very French names, for example Oliver Woods is Olivier Dubois, Sprout is Chourave (which is a kind of Turnip) Hogwarts is Poudlard ("bacon lice") the houses are Gryffondor, Poufsouffle, Serdaigle (Eagle Claw) and Serpentard ("Snaky")
