Wow...that is a heaping mess.

  the name of the Dark Lord is Tom Elvis Jedusor

That is wonderfully terrible. The dark lord's middle name is Elvis. I like it. The mix of literal and interpretive names really screws things up.

  yes "rogue" means arrogant or unpleasant (but is it's a very old and rare word). It doesn't have the same feel to it, less snake and more uneasiness (like a bad taste on the tongue).
#+end_quote

That is an interesting impression. It jives with the idea that as a rule, no one enjoys being around Snape. He presence has an oily feel (not just his hair) and interactions with him leave a bad taste in your mouth, you can't wait to be away from him.

  Hogwarts is Poudlard ("bacon lice")

That is a most unfortunate translation
