That's not to strange, I think. When reading I don't think about the pronunciation at all, which occasionally makes it difficult when I'm end up talking to someone about the story. I remember discussing the /Wheel of Time/ series with someone, and realizing I didn't know how most of the names should actually sound. It grinds a conversation to a halt if you have to stop and try pronouncing /Nynaeve/ 5 different ways.
