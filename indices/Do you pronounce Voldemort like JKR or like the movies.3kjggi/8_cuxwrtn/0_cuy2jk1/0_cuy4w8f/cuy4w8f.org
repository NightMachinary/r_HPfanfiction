Hermelien Griffel, for those curious to know what it is. It's pronounced H-ehr-mu-line.

Curiously, the nickname 'Mione' would actually make some sense here if it'd be translated, since Lien is a popular name here.

Other names are:

Weasleys -> Wemel (suggesting that they have something to do with small animals).

Dumbledore -> Perkamentus (the Dutch name for parchment + -us)

Neville Longbottom -> Marcel Lubbermans (which roughly means 'unhandy')

Gregory Goyle -> Karel Kwast (which retranslates to Carl Brush)

Luna Lovegood -> Loena Leeflang (Luna Livelong)

Alastor Moody -> Alastor Dolleman (meaning Crazyman)

In general, the names are a bit more punny than the original. I think the translator was Venugopalan Ittekot, who also did the Discworld books?
