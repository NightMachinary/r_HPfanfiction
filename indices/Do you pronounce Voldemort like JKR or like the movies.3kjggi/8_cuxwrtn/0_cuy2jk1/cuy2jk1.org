I'm Dutch, I pronounce it without the 't'. (Or well, my inner voice does so, I'm not sure when the last time was I actually pronounced it myself, if ever)

I'm guessing it's a result of loaning my books to my father's girlfriend when I was young (before the third book came out), and her being somewhat of a Francophile. We probably talked about the books a bit and I learned that pronunciation or such.

My pronunciation of 'Hermione' is the same as in the movies though, as I didn't read any of the books in English before seeing the first movie (and her name is different in Dutch).
