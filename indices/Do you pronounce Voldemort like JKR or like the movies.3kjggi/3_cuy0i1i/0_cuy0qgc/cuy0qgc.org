Same here. So far I think that is the same for most English readers. A dutch readers said they pronounce the t, and a French reader says they leave it out.

 

I'll always keep the /t/ but I do like the feel of the French version. It sounds more dark and sinister to me. It's much better suited to being a long drawn out dying breath: /darn you Voldemorrrrrr^{rrrr^{rrrr^{rrrr}}}/.
