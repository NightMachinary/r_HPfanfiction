I've seen this on a few websites, but nothing terribly reputable, so take it with a grain of salt:

  The pronunciation of "Voldemort" was changed for this movie. When J. K. Rowling wrote the books, she intended for the final "t" to be silent, just like the French phrase from which the name is derived. For the movie, however, the "t" is pronounced (probably to make it clear that the root "mort," meaning "death," was part of the name, since viewers couldn't see it written down). Evidently Rowling must have consented to this change, because she now pronounces the name that way as well.

Except that JKR /doesn't/ pronounce it that way. So like I said, a grain of salt.
