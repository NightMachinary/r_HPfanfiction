Then imagine this scene:(loosely based off PS)

"What was his name?" Harry asked, unsure if he even wanted an answer.

"I's no' proper ta' spea' 'I's name 'ere" the large man replied, looking at the tables around the pair to make sure nobody is close, before pulling out a quill and a bit of parchment. After writing something on it, it's promptly handed to Harry.

"Lord Voldemort?"

"No, ye' don' say the T". He said, looking annoyed that Harry said his name even after his efforts to keep quiet

"Why's that?"

"Why would I know? I ain't some soddin' poofter like Malfoy."

Boom. We know there's no T pronounced.
