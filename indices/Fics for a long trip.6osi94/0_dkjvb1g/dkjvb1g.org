[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): 626k words and nearing completion. A great war story with excellent fight scenes and political intrigues.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): 670k words long superb war epic. It's no longer a simple fanfiction, but an original fiction with HP characters and settings. This story is still in progress and now entering the endgame.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: 660k words long Canon rewrite in a non-magic AU, but still with superpowers. It's one of the very few fanfics I enjoyed more than the Canon. The Trio are a lot more cunning and ruthless in this story. I also like how the Years are weighted. For example, Year 7 takes one third of the overall length, while Years 1-3 occupies less than 30%.
