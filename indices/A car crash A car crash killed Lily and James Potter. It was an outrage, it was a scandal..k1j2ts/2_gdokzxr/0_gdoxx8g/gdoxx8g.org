I mean, if you get hit by a semi going 70 MPH and sandwiched between 2 cars, it's pretty traumatic.

Yes they play a sport where metal balls chase after the players, but getting hit by one still broke Harry's arm.

Where did they fall from over 20 feet in the books?

  crashing at neck breaking speeds and getting back up with minor injuries

I mean the only time I can think of this happening is in the World Cup, with Krum doing his feint and the other seeker hitting the ground. I always imagined that there were impact charms on brooms (like air bags in cars) that lessen the impact. Otherwise it wouldn't really make sense.

But then again, what does make sense in these books. They seem to not really stick to any rules in particular anyways. So just try and have fun with the prompt. Or don't. Don't let me tell you how to live your life.
