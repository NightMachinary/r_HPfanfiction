Right I think the whole point of that encounter was that he did accidental magic. I would assume that if you were an adult wizard, who we don't see doing any "accidental" style magic in cannon, who fell from that height, and didn't use magic to help with the fall that you would be injured.

I know in fan-fic it is common to use accidental magic to save characters lives very often, but in cannon I don't think there are really any instances of using magic once someone is an adult (I think Harry in PoA was the oldest we have seen someone do accidental). Example would be Neville falling from his broom in flying class broke is arm (as opposed to bouncing).
