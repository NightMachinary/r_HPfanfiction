Lily definetly should know how to survive a car crash+ isn't it heavily implied that the durability of wizard kind is superior to muggles, eg sports players falling from over 20 feet, crashing at neck breaking speeds and getting back up with minor injuries...

Wizards allow 12-13 year olds to play a sport where they send automatically chasing metal balls after the players, no way does a car crash actually kill them
