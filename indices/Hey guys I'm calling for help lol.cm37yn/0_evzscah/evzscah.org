I think FFN has more Harry/Hermione pairing than AO3.

Here is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10&s=2&c1=1&c2=3&_c1=6&pm=1][the link to 1200 finished Harry/Hermione fics on FFN, sorted by number of Favorites]].

Some fics do not list their pairings explicitly, but are very good Harry/Hermione ones:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): 20 years old Hermione sends her memories and powers back to her 2 years old self. Both hilarity and heart breaking moments ensue.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871): Bind Harry never went to Hogwarts, but has superpowers. Defeating Voldemort is the easier part of his journey.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]], linkffn(11916243): Harry and Hermione are running from a marriage law and directing the war behind scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5681042/1/Heart-and-Soul][Heart and Soul]], linkffn(5681042): Sirius takes the charge after the dementor attack. Harry gets together with both Hermione and Fleur.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13161929/1/Invincible][Invincible]], linkffn(13161929): Crossover with Battlestar Galactica and a decent 'Wizards in Space' fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695087/1/Larceny-Lechery-and-Luna-Lovegood][Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood!]], linkffn(3695087): Harry and Hermione are robbing Death Eaters blind.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): Hermione time travel from Jame Potter's POV. Very unique story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance][Resistance]], linkffn(2746577): Hermione leads the war effort after Harry was captured.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Badly traumatized and deranged Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Susan time travel and make their enemies pay.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/1/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks]] and its sequel [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][Shadow Walker]], linkffn(6092362): Harry embarks on a major dimensional travel to find his lost Hermione. In the sequel, a Hermione he encountered in another dimension attempts to find a new home for herself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): Badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are accidentally thrown to another dimension. Harry and Hermione didn't get 'officially' together in this fic, but I think they definitely will.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382): Light hearted family story featuring Harry and his three girls.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/The-Sea-King][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511): Excellent postwar one shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): This is my favorite postwar fic, with an implied Harry/Hermione/Ron pairing.
