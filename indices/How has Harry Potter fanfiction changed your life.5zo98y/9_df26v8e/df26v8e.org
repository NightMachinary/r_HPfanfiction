Bucking the trend here; I mostly see positives.

I have become much more confident in my writing- I've had to truly consider how an audience will read what I present, and how to pare it down to the essentials. I'm much more at ease with committing to long projects with multiple milestones, as I've proven to myself that a 50 (or 66) chapter epic is not beyond my capabilities. Having an audience has toughened me to criticism and opened my eyes to the difference between criticizing a work vs. criticizing the author.
