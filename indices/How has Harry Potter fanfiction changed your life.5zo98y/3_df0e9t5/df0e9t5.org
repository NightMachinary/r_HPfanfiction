It first was a great way to avoid the post book depression that comes with finishing the series. And it has provided hours of enjoyment.

But it definitely has negatively impacted my drive to get personal tasks and goals accomplished. For example, I'm writing a screenplay and fanfic provides an easy and unwelcome distraction from completing it.

It also has made me a bit too obsessive about the HP world. Before finding fanfic, when I did a reread of the series, I'd be sad for a while but then move on with my life. Now it's like I can't go 30 minutes without thinking about a character and fanfic is definitely to blame.

I think the more you read fanfic, the more the characters seem real. You interact with them every single day. It's not that healthy, but fanfic is addictive. There is so much out there that you can read and read and never get through it all.

But I don't think fanfic has negatively affected my life. I think it's a symptom of stagnation in it and unhappiness with certain aspects of my life, particular my boring job. If I had an exciting job or was doing something I was passionate, I doubt I'd have the time/desire to read much.
