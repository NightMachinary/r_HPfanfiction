It was there for me during a rough time and gave me a welcome escape, as well as a great way to keep myself stimulated in a boring job.

Now that time has passed and I'm at a happy, exciting point in my life, it's actually having a negative effect and has changed from comforting to stressful. My job is now interesting and challenging and the daydreams about fanfic are becoming an irritating nuisance. I can now fill my evenings with fun, happier things than before so there's no great pull to write- which makes me feel guilty about keeping readers waiting and not fulfilling promises to write a sequel. Not that there's even any time any longer - I don't have those long train journeys I used to have, and I work longer hours with more social commitments. I've turned off email alerts for reviews because, no matter how kindly phrased and well intentioned the constructive criticism is, it no longer feels useful and just gets me down when it's the first thing I read in the morning. It's not so much life getting in the way, but more that life is moving in a direction where fanfic doesn't really fit any more. It might be time for me to step away.

This isn't a flounce post. I'm still hoping suddenly something will kick in and I'll have the urge to write again. But I might start drifting away, I guess.
