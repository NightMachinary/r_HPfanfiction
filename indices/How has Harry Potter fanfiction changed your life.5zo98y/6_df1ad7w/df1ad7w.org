I have a horribly addictive personality. In middle school and early high school, I was obsessed with maps and with Eastern Europe. Then, with RP-intensive MUDs. These larger phases are generally interspersed with spare months of doing nothing but one thing, including drawing nonstop or writing or running. It's like I can only focus on one thing at a time.

Right now, and since mid last year, it's been HP fanfic. This phase has lasted a lot longer than I thought it would. When I eventually do drop it, I'm sure it'll be cold turkey just like most everything else until I get roped back in like six months later. It's a drain on my time. Yet, so are my other 'hobbies'. I'm used to it.
