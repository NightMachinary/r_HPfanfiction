LOL. I /know/ I've read a funny fanfic years and years ago, where Harry is pining for Hermione and lamenting that if she and Ron have kids together, the kids will have Ronald McDonald hair, bushy and red. It may be the same fic where Harry daydreams of having kids with Hermione that have the deadly trio of bad hair (from both), bad teeth (from Hermione), and bad eyesight (from Harry).
