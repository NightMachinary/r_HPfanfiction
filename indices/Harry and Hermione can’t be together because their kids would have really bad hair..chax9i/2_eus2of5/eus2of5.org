I have this headcanon that the Potter hair is literallty the result of a curse, that's why Harry's hair grew back so quickly when Petunia cut it. I like to think that a Potter from a few hundred years ago was a very vain man, always taking care of his appearance above all else. This man had a rather spiteful wife, one who would exact cruel and unusual vengance on people who wronged her. Well this man also had a mistress, kept secret from his wife, whom he would often visit for wild and passionate um...relations.

Well lo and behold his wife found out about his side-wench, catching them in the act, the Potter's hair wild and ruffled from his exertions. Knowing his vanity his wife cursed him to never again be neat or tidy. To always be scruffy and disheveled. This curse was so strong it even passed to his future children, though it weakened over time until only the hair was untameable.

Thus we end up with Harry and his eternally uncontrollable hair.
