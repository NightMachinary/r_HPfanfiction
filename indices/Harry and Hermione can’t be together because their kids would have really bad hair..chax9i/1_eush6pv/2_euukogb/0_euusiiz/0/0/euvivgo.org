And that is not my definition of nice.

Detangle in the shower with water and oodles of conditioner if it's a wash day. If it isn't, put diluted conditioner in a spray bottle with water, wet down your hair, and comb out or finger detangle. Then scrunch and style. Standard day 2+ refresh routine. You can also plop and wrap your hair before bed, sleep on silk pillowcases, etc to minimize tangling.

Look at the wiki on the curly hair subreddit, or Google the curly girl method.
