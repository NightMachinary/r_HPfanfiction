No. That's not how it works. If you believe in genes and evolution, you believe in science, and things that have been proven to be right, or at least close enough. If you believe in genetics affecting intelligence, then (most of the time - see below) you are wrong.

False.

If the parent has some sort of mental illness that affects their intelligence, and they pass it on to their child, then genetics do affect intelligence. If they don't, the child is just an idiot. Not racist, just factual.

If you are a caveman and know lots of hunting techniques, that's great. If you can't actually do them, that's not so good, and you're probably going to die.

Natural selection does not stop at the brain. Again, not racist, just factual.
