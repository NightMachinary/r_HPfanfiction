One problem is it isn't often I find a long story that is a simple Harry/Fleur (though it does happen). Most have her in a trio.

Howwver the story Heart and Soul by Sillimaure is pretty much what you are looking for as it is a slow burn though it does turn into a Harry/Fleur/Hermione.

Fleur's Surprise by Harry50 is another Harry/Fleur/Hermione story that you might like.

One of the few Harry/Fleur stories I know of is Harry Potter and the Silver Vixen by patton44. It is a WBWL story.

And His Angel by durararaaa has Harry meeting Fleur at the world cup and taking things from there. The author did complete it/discontinued it as they planned to rewrite it.
