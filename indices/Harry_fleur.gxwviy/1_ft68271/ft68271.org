Not sure how much you've read already, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c97t8l/harryfleur_all_of_it/][this thread]] is a great starting point, although admittedly a year old now. If you have not read them, I especially recommend linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) and linkffn(letters). In terms of incomplete fics, I really liked linkffn(his angel) and linkffn(ingenio ab artifex), but both are abandoned, so read at your own risk
