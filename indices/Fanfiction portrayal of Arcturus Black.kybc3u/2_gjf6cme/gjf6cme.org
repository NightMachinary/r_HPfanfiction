Wasn't he in cannon poisoned by the Malfoy ?

Anyway, I think that he didn't do anything because he had family on both sides of the war, Andromeda, Nymphadora, Sirius and Dorea more on the light, and Bellatrix, Narcissa, Cyrus, Regulus, Walburga, Orion, etc... on the Dark. Then there is the Black matriarchs who married kinda everywhere (Weasley, Longbottom, Goyle, ...), Alphard, and the Black women who didn't marry but I cannot find the name of...

So seeing as family was fighting family, I suppose he didn't do anything so that some family members could be spared if either side of the war won (with favors for exemple).

Finally, he must have been kinda old, if he fought during Grindelwald's war, around 100 I'd say in 1981, so maybe he was just tired, as powerful as he might have been.

That's my opinion on his inaction, tough one might say that he probably still attended the Wizengamot from time to time.
