I see him as a tired man, he saw horrors in Grindelwald's war, he saw countless dying in front of his eyes as he fought against the Lord of Nurmengard. Then in the First Wizarding war, he saw his family break apart, some leaving to other nations to escape the madness, some fighting for a madman who wanted power and was willing to raze the world for it, while one forswore his own family and listened to the words of a man who manipulated for the "Greater Good" , the same ideology he once fought against. He saw entire families die, pureblood families who had been a part of their world for centuries, all proclaimed as Blood Traitors just because they were against the bloodshed wrought by a man-turned-monster who had a bad childhood and was alienated by the manipulator. He saw his world crumbling,family falling, kin killing kin, he saw his nation falling to ruin, all because of a corrupt government, a power obsessed madman, a man who thought that he was right above all else. Arcturus Black was a man who watched the world burn.
