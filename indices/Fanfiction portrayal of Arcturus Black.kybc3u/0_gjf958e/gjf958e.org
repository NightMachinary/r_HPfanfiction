I think there is no canon explanation for his death or about him in general. Besides his name, believe it on the ancestral carpet and Sirius's comments, we don't know anything about him. You mean Cassiopeia Black(1915-1992). :)

Now that we have canon out of the way, in fanfictio, there are countless theories as to why e.g. Andromeda was allowed to survive.\\
He wanted to ensure the survival of the family(or Bloodline) or why Sirius remained the heir despite that his mother burned his place on the carpet etc. But these are all theories, he died in 1991 according to canon by the way.
