  Less than a year after the death of the Potters, Rose Evans and her husband Lyle take care of their orphaned grandson, Harry, and try to take steps toward a future where he'll be loved and accepted. Spring is coming, and with it, the memory of stiring warmth, and the first real hope for life and growth. ( The au where Harry's muggle grandparents were alive and well)
