"Harry, that's not Salazar Slytherin. He doesn't look anything like him," Hermione interrupts.

"Of course I don't," the portrait intervenes before Harry can respond. "It's a family thing. Runs in my genes. Everyone looks different as they age. The appearance of Slytherins changes exceptionally so as we age," the portrait points his non-nose up into the air proudly.

"I've never read that anywhere."

"Sure you have," the portrait persists. "My heir Tom Riddle is quite famous. And he doesn't look anything like he did fifty-some-odd years ago."

"Famous? I've never even heard of this Tom Riddle," Hermione refutes.

"Exactly," the portrait nods. "And that's only after fifty years. This portrait of me was made based off of my current appearance after one-thousand something years of age."

"That's not how portraits work."

"But this is a special portrait. It's more like a portal to a secret chamber, so to speak. Like how the fat lady guards Gryffindor tower. But better, because it's Slytherin."

"That still doesn't explain why you have a basilisk-face," Hermione taps her foot impatiently.

"It's called magic!" The portrait snaps. "Something you mu-- muggleborns might be unaware of.... I'm sorry for the outburst. The wizarding world just tends to be very discriminatory towards creatures, and I've been a victim of the creature prejudices for a very long time. Even when I came across a pupil with a toad-face, she didn't understand - despite our shared grievance. So excuse me if I get a bit defensive at times..."

"That's terrible!" Hermione exclaims. Suddenly outraged at the portraits lack of support."

"Yes... yes it is," the portrait stutters out. He appears to be in shock at Hermione's flip in stance. Rolling with it, the portrait expounds: "Yes, it really is quite terrible. Sometimes I just can't get myself out of bed, it's so terrible. I've been practically asleep for a thousand years."

"Is there anything we can do to help? Do you have enough resources down there? Are those goosebumps? Are you cold? I could knit you some hats?"

"That's... sweet, but no that's quite alright. Those are just scales. But, well, actually, there is one thing you could do... Harry my boy, if you could just hiss 'open' in your best impression of a snake..."
