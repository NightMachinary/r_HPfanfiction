  Lily Potter, Harry and Ginny's youngest child, heads off to her first year at Hogwarts, hopes of a future of love and ambition at hand. But more than just school, boys, and the trials of growing up will challenge her: A lost mystery has stirred from a long rest in the years since Voldemort's final defeat - and evil abhors a vacuum. Hogwarts again will be a magnet for trouble.
