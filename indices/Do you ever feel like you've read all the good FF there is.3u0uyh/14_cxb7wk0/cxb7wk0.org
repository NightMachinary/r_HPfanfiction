My problem is that I tend to not finish them.

I stop reading fics the moment its storyline interrupts for some forced romance or "sidequest", as I call it.

Seriously, there are fics out there who would be /so much better/ with 50 to 100k less words. So, yea, for me it seems like I got all the good ones checked.

So, let me use this platform to remind our dear writers out there: Cut the living shit out of your stories until you reach the core of your story.
