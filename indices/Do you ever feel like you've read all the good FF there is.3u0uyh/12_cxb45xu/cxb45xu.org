Sometimes. I've been reading HP fanfic for about a decade now, and during several of those years I've had a ton of time on my hands because of health issues. I pretty much /have/ read everything from certain parts of fandom. Branching out into new themes or pairings helps a lot, and sometimes there are random fics I stumble upon that I love (like, there's a Draco/OMC one that's got the whole alpha/omega nuttiness of all things, but the characterization of Draco is just so, so glorious that I'm in love. And I often have a lot of trouble with romance fics focused on Draco).
