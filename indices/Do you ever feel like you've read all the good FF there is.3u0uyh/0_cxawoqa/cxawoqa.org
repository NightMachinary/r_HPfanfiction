Not at all. There are hundreds of thousands of fics, and even if only a thousand of them are good ones, it would still take years to read them all. Two years is not nearly enough time to read them all, and that's also how long I've been reading HPFF myself. Good luck finding new ones, you'll find that there's too many to chose from. I have a list of ~400 fics waiting to be read.
