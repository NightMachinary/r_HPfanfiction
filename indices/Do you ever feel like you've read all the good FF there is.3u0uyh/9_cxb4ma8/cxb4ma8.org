I get that feeling sometimes, especially since my default search is set to 60k+ words, but I just change my settings when I feel like that. Pick a specific genre, a specific character, click a random page in the search results, something new.

I also follow a few authors on Tumblr, so that gives me the feeling like no, I definitely haven't read all the good stuff, people are still making it.
