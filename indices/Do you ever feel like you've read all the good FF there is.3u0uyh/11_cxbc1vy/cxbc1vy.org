Sometimes. That's when I either start writing my own story (recently completed a h/f story), or I reread a classic (a black comedy, denarian trilogy, etc).

Alternatively, I'll check out another fandom. The problem with that is that some other fandoms are tiny, and the amount of actual good fics might not even be in the two digits. Worm is a prime example - the universe is massive, so writing any sort of story that plans on going to end game is a daunting task and will likely involve hundreds of thousands of words. That's why I haven't written anything there yet. Then, the other half of that fandom is dumb crossovers or alternate power!Taylor, most of which are just cringeworthy. But every fandom is like that. Like go to the RWBY fandom, and then you've got like half Jaune!harem fics (boring), and half SI/OC fics (also boring). And then GoT/asoiaf has tons of crap like san/san (lol) that plagues it. And DF... well, there's like 5 stories total worth reading, all of which are unfinished/abandoned.

So yeah, when all that fails (and it usually does), I start writing.
