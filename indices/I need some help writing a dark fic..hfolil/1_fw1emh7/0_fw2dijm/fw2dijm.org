Well, what would you create? There are many fictional civilizations that would be a large enough threat to breach the Statute. I was thinking something akin to a combination of the Imperium of Man from Warhammer and the Augments from Star Trek. The story would be based heavily off of Resistance:Fall of Man. The heroes win in the end, but Earth is devastated.
