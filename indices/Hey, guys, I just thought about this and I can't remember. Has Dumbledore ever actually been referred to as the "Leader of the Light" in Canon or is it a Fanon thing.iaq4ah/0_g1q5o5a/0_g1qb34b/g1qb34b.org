elphias doge does refer to him working for The Greater Good in his obituary

  Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world's. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: *working always for the greater good* and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.

i highly doubt albus himself associated with it, though

  “Yes, I --- I did.” She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. “I think that's the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but ‘For the Greater Good' became Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say ‘For the Greater Good' was even carved over the entrance to Nurmengard.”
