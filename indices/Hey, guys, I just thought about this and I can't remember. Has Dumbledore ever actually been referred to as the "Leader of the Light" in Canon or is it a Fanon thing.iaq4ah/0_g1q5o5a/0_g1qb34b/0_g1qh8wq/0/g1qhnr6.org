yeah, i mean, harry agrees with albus too:

#+begin_quote
  Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said, “How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the *greater good* than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?”

  A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart.

  “I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione.

  “Why didn't he tell him to hide, then?” shot back Aberforth. “Why didn't he say to him, ‘Take care of yourself, here's how to survive'?”

  “Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the *greater good!* This is war!

also this ootp passage is such a big oof

#+begin_quote
  “Do you see, Harry? Do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now? I had fallen into the trap I had foreseen, that I had told myself I could avoid, that I must avoid.” “I don't ---”

  “I cared about you too much,” said Dumbledore simply. “I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act.

  “Is there a defense? I defy anyone who has watched you as I have --- and I have watched you more closely than you can have imagined --- not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered. What did I care if numbers of nameless and faceless people and creatures were slaughtered in the vague future, if in the here and now you were alive, and well, and happy? I never dreamed that I would have such a person on my hand
