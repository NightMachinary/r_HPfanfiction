I think this is why Dumbledore is such a great character. He doesn't demand respect and reverence from others like Voldemort (or in a lesser measure Fudge) would. Hell, he even left Fudge slander him for a full year without even defending himself, and didn't even show any grudge when the truth came to light.

But at the same time, he knows where he stands and doesn't hide his power behind false modesty. All the quote you used could come as bragging if used by someone else, but from Dumbledore, it's more like he is just stating a fact.

Though in hindsight, I'm not sure "humble" is truly the best word to describe him.
