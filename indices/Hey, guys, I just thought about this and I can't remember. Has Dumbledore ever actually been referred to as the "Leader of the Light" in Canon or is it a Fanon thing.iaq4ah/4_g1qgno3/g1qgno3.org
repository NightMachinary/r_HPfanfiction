Nobody ever called Dumbledore the "Leader of the Light". I'm also pretty sure that anyone calling him as such would have been rebuked, the man is supposed to be humble.

Concerning "For the Greater Good", Dumbledore did use it once in a letter he sent to Grinderwald (before they had their falling out), but it was probably a youthfull error, when he made great plan to "change the world". He never used again in Canon (at least in front of Harry), and while he never gave a clear opinion of that sentence, he probably hated it considering its link to the death of his sister and Grinderwald war.
