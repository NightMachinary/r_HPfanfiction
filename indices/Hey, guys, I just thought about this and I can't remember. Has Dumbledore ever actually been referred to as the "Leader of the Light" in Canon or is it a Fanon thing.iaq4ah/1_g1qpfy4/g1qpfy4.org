There being a "Light side" in general is fanon, Dumbledore being considered its leader even moreso.

He uses "For The Greater Good" exactly once, in a letter to Grindelwald back when he was still on that side - and it's all but stated he regrets ever following that ideology. He never uses it in person, in any of the books.
