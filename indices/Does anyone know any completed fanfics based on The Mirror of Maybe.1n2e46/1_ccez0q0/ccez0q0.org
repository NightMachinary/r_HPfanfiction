/No Way Back/ would be at the top of my list for certain, but I'll do some poking around the Snarryficfind comm on Livejournal and see if there's anything tagged there. If you haven't visited it, it's a great repository of Snarry fic requests. There's a chance someone has asked the same question and had it answered.
