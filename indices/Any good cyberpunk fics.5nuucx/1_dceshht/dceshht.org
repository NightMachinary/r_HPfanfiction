Hmm, the closest I know to that is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12066162/3/Braindump-Ideas-un-edited-unfiltered-and-available-for-anyone-to-use][my own drivel]].

The only thing I found is linkffn(Enter the Dragon by Doghead Thirteen). Though I don't even know if it's good. Its a Shadowrun crossover with a endorsement by Tsu Doh Nimh (who wrote a continuation it seems).

Anyway, that's the best I have right now.
