I have no idea what Decker is (do you mean Dexter? I'd love to read about a Dexter!Harry, or a Jimmy Neutron!Harry for that matter), but the description makes me think of linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist), and its sequel, linkffn(Madness at the Gate) (sadly the next sequel is IMHO too much of a time skip).
