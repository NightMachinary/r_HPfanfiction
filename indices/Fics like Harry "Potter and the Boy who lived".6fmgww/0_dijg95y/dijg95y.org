Welcome to an example of the "One-Of-Kind"-Story.

Like A long journey home (for me at least) there is simply no story which comes close at the moment in a similar genre. Sure, there are a few Raveclaw!Harry stories, and some more WBWL-Stories, but non like the one you mentioned. I fully agree that this story is great.
