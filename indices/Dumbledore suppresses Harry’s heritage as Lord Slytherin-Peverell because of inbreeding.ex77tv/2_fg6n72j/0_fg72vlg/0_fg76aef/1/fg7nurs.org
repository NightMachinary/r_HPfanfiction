I remember reading that fic but It's a dead one so I didnt bother remembering the name. That and it leaned towards death eater mentality. I believed Harry end up believing that Lily's blood really look like mud and just bleed it out.

I think a more interesting way to change 'dna' is for a magical bone marrow transplant. It's more visceral and can be used to steal identity. Imagine having Harry Potter's Dna but when the blocks comes off you find out your not really HP, someone just changed your blood dna but not the rest genetic make up, hence the block to prevent the original gene from expressing themselves.
