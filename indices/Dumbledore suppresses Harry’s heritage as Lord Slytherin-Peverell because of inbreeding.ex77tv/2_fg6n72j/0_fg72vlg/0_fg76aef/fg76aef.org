Not exactly what I had in mind. Like in a fic where Harry and Salazar are in the family castle and salazar discover that Lily blood is incompatible with the slytherin blood in Harry blood (the fic assumed that Cadmus Peverell line and Antioch Line intermarried at a point, not impossible parseltongue is a blood trait and a horcrux is a magic and soul trait, for Harry to speak parseltongue he had to have slytherin blood), and so salazar recommended a ritual to bleed out lily blood from the rest and research a blood line compatible with slytherin bloodline and potter. I sadly do not have the title of the fic and research it.
