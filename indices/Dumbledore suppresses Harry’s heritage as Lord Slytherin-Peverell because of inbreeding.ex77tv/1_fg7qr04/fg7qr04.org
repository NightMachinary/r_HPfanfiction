Humans aren't inherently magical, they never were. The greatest ability that they do posses is the ability to cross breed with any species that can accommodate human copulation.

This has posed an issue due to atavistic traits tends to express themselves the more magical a human is. Not that Harry knew of it, he was muggle raised after all. Besides, Goblins will never turn down good business nor do they make a habit of volunteering information wizards unless asked.

The human body is never built to carry that much magic. Slowly the body starts to morph to its closest magical being form. The change itself isn't bad, it's just maintaining magical body needs magic. Thus all available magic for basic spell casting is non existent. The only bright side to this is that the changeling gets the ability of the magical creature they partially become. It is common sense that a limiter is placed to keep magic level to wizard. Unfortunately, no one explained to Harry and the goblins plan to offer a new block to be placed of him for a price.

No one expected a non magical ugly squib will be Harry's transformation, in fact, no one expected a transformation at all. It was baffling until they looked at Harry's family tree. It seems that the Atavistic genes of Peverell-slytherin overpowered and is a closer creature origins than Galatea of the Potter's. Too bad all Harry got is an ugly fishy face, no magic but able to breathe underwater and ability to speak in tougues. It seems the Salazar came from the fens, in a sleepy town called Innsmouth.

It seems the goblins win again. Another poor sucker pays for removal of blocks then pays to put it back again. Hey at least Harry can read necronomicon without dying. Not that he plans to build a bridge over our time stream to the old ones, that's certain death for sure.
