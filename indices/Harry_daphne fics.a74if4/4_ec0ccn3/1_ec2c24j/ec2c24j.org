Is.. is that version actively updating? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11260631/1/A-Different-Sort-of-Bond][It's also on ffn, but it hasn't been updated since 2016.]] They're pretty different, but seem to be the same fic. There's a few bits here and there that are almost exactly the same. Seems like he heavily edited it and reposted it on ao3.
