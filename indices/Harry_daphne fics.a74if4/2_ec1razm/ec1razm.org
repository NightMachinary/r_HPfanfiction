A Fine Spot of Trouble [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/]] Completed, nicely written, some drama but good ending, Ginny bashing, no smut, 130k+ words.

The Marriage Contracts Redux [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux]] Completed, comedic (almost a parody), nicely written, serious weasley and dumbledore bashing, no smut, 70k+ words.

These are two that I read again from time to time for they are good and fun.
