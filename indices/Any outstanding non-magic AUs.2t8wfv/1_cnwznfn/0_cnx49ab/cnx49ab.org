I love this one, but seem to remember it being extremely sad? Idk, it's been a while. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1608067/1/Life-As-Experienced-Through-Your-Fingers][Life, As Experienced Through Your Fingers]] is pretty good. Though it will be up to you if it's well-written. It's another DM/HP with a few good side pairings if I remember correctly.
