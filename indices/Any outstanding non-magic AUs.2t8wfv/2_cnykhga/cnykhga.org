Can't believe no one has suggested Almost a Squib. Hands down one of /the/ best Squib!Harry fics out there - and an amazing fic, regardless, even if squib!Harry isn't your thing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][*Almost a Squib*]] - /What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a/ *nonpowerful, but cunning,* /Harry./
