As [[/u/her0_wraith][u/her0_wraith]] and [[/u/Hellstrike][u/Hellstrike]] point out. Longer fics usually cover longer time spans, as an example Years 4-7 or so. So the word count going over 100K is not that hard to believe when most of those books went over that by themselves.

For myself I just check if the average chapter-wordcount is good and go from there. Good for me is between 5k and 12K. As soon as a chapter tips over that it tends to have a sludgy middle that gets nasty to drag yourself trough. On the other hand shorter chapters means that you'll hardly see any progress inside of the individual chapters.
