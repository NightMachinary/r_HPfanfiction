One of the rules I used to have, when I was much newer to fanfiction, was that longer word counts usually meant better fic quality. This isn't really true, but it was a pretty generic way to root out some of the higher effort stories, although I have since found many short fics or oneshots that are good.

I would say it's a matter of preference from the reader, but I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't really worry too much on it, if the fic is high quality then it doesn't matter.
