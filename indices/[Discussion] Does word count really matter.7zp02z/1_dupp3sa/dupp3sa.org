It's personal taste. Some people prefer epics rivalling ASOIAF in length, others oneshots. And it is even down to mood. Sometimes you just want something quick to read in twenty minutes without having to keep track of twelve plot lines and twenty OCs, sometimes you want something to waste a weekend on.

Personally I'd say that chapter length is much more important. I won't even touch a story with less than 1000 words per chapter.
