Word count does matter but not as much as some would say. Word count is important when considered in conjunction with the number of chapters. Generally shorter chapters are of lesser quality so if a story has say 60 chapters with 100k words than the average chapter length is just below 2k words and probably not as good as a story with 30 chapters and 100k words. The chapters should have more substance that way and contain more than just a simplistic plot point.
