Depends on what the story sets out to do. If it spans a lot of time it will likely need a bigger word count unless your narration makes clear a lot of time has passed, in which case you can make it shorter. Narration let's you skip more time, but delving into the dramatics requires you to slow things down to progress through scenes, meaning it becomes lengthened, so you'll need more page length to cover the intended material.
