depends on if its complete or not. for example, an incomplete story with only five chapters and 20 something thousand words is almost guaranteed to frustratingly end before the plot arc has even developed. Biggest pet peeve is a great plot summary, but a story that is abandoned before it addresses what the summary promises. Anyways, if the story is complete and has an intriguing/unique plot summary, i'd be willing to look at it. But i tend to sort fanfiction.net to only show stories that are 80K+ words so i might not even see the short stories in the first place to give them a chance
