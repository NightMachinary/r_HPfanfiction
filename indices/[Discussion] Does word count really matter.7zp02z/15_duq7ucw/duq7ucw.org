I tend to use stories as escapism so the longer the story the longer I can keep the immersion going. I prefer long fics and because of that I miss out on many short fics that have many sequels. But longer fics still tend to have a better quality than rooting through hundreds of short fics that are not long enough to get immersed in.

In another note I absolutely detest when a story is just over 100K and most of it ends up being inane rambling from the author at the start and end of every chapter. 100k story you say, well it's actually only 60k if you ignore the author notes.
