Personally I get frustrated if a fic is too short. I love reading and read really quickly. When I get into a world I want to be able to immerse myself in the story for several hours. My go to number is 40k, I read shorter fics but much less often. It's just annoying to fall in love with a world and characters and suddenly there is no more.
