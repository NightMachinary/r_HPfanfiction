100k is fine for a year in detail. Its a bit on the short side for a multiyear story. This is fanfiction so you can often cut out background and detail in places where we already know. Often if we get descriptions of things its because they've been changed, otherwise we can assume its same as in canon. Longer stories often have issues with pacing and excessive detail, shorter stories can feel rushed. If you're happy with what you've written, if you can justify all your choices then its probably fine.
