No matter how long (or short) your story may turn out to be, trust that there'll always be an audience for it. That's one of the many positives with the HP fandom being that it's so large.

Personally, I like fics that stay between 100K - 250K though I'm not opposed to reading stories that are longer. However, I normally draw the line at fics that are complete (or continually updating) that are past 500K. The longest story I read on FanFiction was Vox Corporis that had 323K words. (Just for fun, the longest book I ever read was Stephen King's The Stand which clocked in at 1,320 pages on my Kindle.)
