It could launch a full scale investigation into his medical health. They could discover the horocrux and remove it. Starting all hands on deck war preparations and horocrux hunt. If you go with him being abused they could discover it. They would probably find evidence of the basilisk which would certainly raise questions. The fact that he was missing vaccines/was abused could start an investigation into the hog warts hospital wing/records. (Could have bad albus, or just an overworked/underfunded poppy). Could lead to mandatory evaluation of all students, (discovering more abuse -of DE kids), or of any other muggleborns (snape, Tom, and Harry probably aren't the only ones). Or you could have them look into harry's sealed medical files and find out the black was his magically oath bound godfather and thus couldn't have betrayed him. Or you could have him be sick in a long drawn out, touch and go sort of way. Dragon pox for instance can be deadly. Or it could start a pandemic amount the muggleborn, which leads to massive reforms. There are a lot of ways one could take this.
