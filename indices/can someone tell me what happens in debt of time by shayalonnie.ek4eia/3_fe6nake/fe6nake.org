In the scene where Sirius and Hermione kiss in present day, it's the Battle of Hogwarts.

Hermione is the oldest of the trio and was born on September 19th 1979.

The Battle of Hogwarts took place on 2nd May 1998.

Hermione would have been 18 and would turn 19 around 4 months later, (if that makes you feel any better. The age of becoming an adult in the wizarding world is 17 though.)

I love the story and I totally cried. Amazing! You def should read it if you ever feel up to reading a lot!

One of my favorite things was the relationship between James and Hermione. They are such adorable siblings and they had such a cute bond, I love it!
