I actually liked parts of this story. Book One is the essentially DH but with Sirius. Book Two is Hermione transported back in time to be Mia Potter and grow up with the Marauders. Book Three is the in between after Mia “disappears”. Book Four is when Hermione and Mia essentially merge and it's a bunch of wish fulfillment (torturing Dursley's, blackmailing the Wizengamot, etc.)

Things I enjoyed: I actually LOVED Lily/James in this story. I found their love story compelling and makes sense with canon. I found some chapters genuinely funny and enjoyable to read. I got emotional at a couple as well which is hard for me in fanfic. I liked the Potter family in general, and yes she and James have a sweet relationship which was cute. The overall writing quality was consistent for the 700k+ words which is impressive.

Things I disliked: Mia is essentially an OOC but perfect at everything and loved by two men blah blah blah, that got a bit old. Also the soul bond weirded me out a bit, but I'm also not into them in fanfic. Also personally disliked the werewolf/animal form hyper-senses. No you can't “smell” embarrassment. I also thought a Harry was kind of an idiot and I get that it's not his story but there's no reason to change him the way he was.

Overall, I found it to be worth the time involved mainly for Book Two because there's a lack of quality Marauder era fics out there and I enjoyed this part. Book One was my least favorite to be honest. And the guilty pleasure part of me enjoyed Book Four because who doesn't love Umbridge getting fed to the giant squid?
