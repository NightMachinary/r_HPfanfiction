I don't have a through enough recall to summarize it with the accuracy it deserves.. but a few things- 1: the changes to the timeline are so well thought out that it really is worth the read. 2: the Sirius/Hermione things starts out a bit odd but it adjusts pretty quickly(and she is /technically/ 18 in the beginning.. also.. time travel.) 3: there is currently a podcast being produced that might be a better way for you to get through it? It's called firewhisky & honey ... they just wrapped up the first season/book! Good luck!
