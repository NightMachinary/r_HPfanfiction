  It can be that he was the secret keeper all along and so Lilly and James were never betrayed

Here's the rub. This scenario can turn out to be a lot more horrible than canon if Pettigrew is still the traitor. All he has to do is to lead Voldemort to Sirius (in canon, Sirius knew where Pettigrew was hiding). If Voldemort succeeds in killing Sirius, which is highly likely, the flaw in the Fidelius Charm comes into play. Everyone who knew the secret becomes the Secret Keeper, /including Pettigrew/. The Potters still die, Voldemort still falls in the same way, but Sirius is dead and Pettigrew remains free, his treachery unknown.

The only way I could see the Potters survive is if Sirius manages to escape Voldemort somehow or if he manages to warn the Potters via Patronus and they evacuate.
