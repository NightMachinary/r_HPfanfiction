From what I can see from reading through FFN's ToS, they don't explicitly say anything about not using real people. However, they do say that

  You further agree that you will not, in connection with User Submissions, submit material that is contrary to the FanFiction.Net Community Guidelines, found at [[https://www.FanFiction.Net/guidelines/]], which may be updated from time to time, or contrary to applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations.

If you go to the Community Guidelines, it gives the following list

#+begin_quote
  Entries not allowed:

  1. Non-stories: lists, bloopers, polls, previews, challenges, author notes, and etc.

  2. One or two liners.

  3. MST: comments inserted in between the flow of a copied story.

  4. Stories with non-historical and non-fictional characters: actors, musicians, and etc.

  5. Any form of interactive entry: choose your adventure, second person/you based, Q&As, and etc.

  6. Chat/script format and keyboard dialogue based entries.

Use of real people would fall under item 4 and would not be allowed, though I think it could potentially be possible to argue that you are using them in the historical sense of them having in the past been the actor/actress for the character, and have it as an Easter Egg. I wouldn't try it. Though I think it's kinda asshole-y that they buried it that far. Plus the guidelines haven't been updated since Nov 2008.

Interestingly enough, Bungle in the Jungle and Turn Me Loose fall afoul of item 5.
