There's no chance they'd win the case, of course, but they could still try, both being greedy and stupid people who think they are better than others because of their heritage. Hepzibah would try to bribe Wizengamot members and Marvolo would insult the judge and hiss at everybody in Parseltongue. Then the Prophet reports on the case, and mayhem ensues, because everybody would suddenly dig up their family tree and claim to be a descendant of the Founders, trying to get their own piece of Hogwarts.

It wasn't really a serious prompt, hence "courtroom farce" instead of "drama". It was actually inspired by a discussion in a different thread about all those "Hadrian Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin" fics where Harry inherits Gryffindor Castle, Merlin Manor, Slytherin vault and Hogwarts itself.
