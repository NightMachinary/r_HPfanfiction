Judge: This application has been brought by Hepzibah Smith and Marvolo Gaunt, who seek a declaration that title in Hogwarts castle vests in them. Please present the title deeds to the court.

Lawyers for Smith and Gaunt: So yeah... we don't actually have the title deeds.

Judge: So you're not the owners. Case dismissed!
