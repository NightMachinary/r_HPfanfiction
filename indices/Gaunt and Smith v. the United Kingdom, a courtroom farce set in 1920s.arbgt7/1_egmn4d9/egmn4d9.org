This is probably the dumbest thing I've ever written. Your prompt set to the tune of Fuck Tha Police:

[Albus D]

Right about now, Wizengamot is in full effect

Judge Albus D presiding

In the case of the Founders vs. the Auror Department

prosecuting attorneys are H Smith, Tom Gaunt, and Gryffin-motherfucking-dor

Order, order, order Tom Gaunt, take the motherfucking stand

Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help your snaky white ass?

[Gaunt as Witness]

You goddamn right!

[Albus]

Well won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Gaunt] Fuck the Aurors coming straight from the Floo

A young heir's got it bad 'cause they ain't from the mudblood zoo

And not like the other halfbloods so Aurors think

they have the superiority to kill those in authority

Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a wand
