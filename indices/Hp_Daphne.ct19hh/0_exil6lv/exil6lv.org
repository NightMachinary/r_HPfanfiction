Have you read the Downward Spiral saga?? Harry gets super dark in it, and he's with Daphne after the 2nd or 3rd book I think. The first two books honestly aren't the best in terms of writing, but if you can get thru it just to understand the content, I PROMISE it gets so much better. Here's the first book.
