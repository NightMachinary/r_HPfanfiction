too lazy to check if any other comments said the same thing, but personally I think it's because the author wants to see what could happen if Harry pairs with a Slytherin. Given that we don't really see much development of any likable Slytherin characters (or any Slytherins, really), she's an easy "blank slate" for the author to use. Also, I think it's done for a similar reason that Sirius was/is so often paired with Marlene McKinnon (when not paired with Remus); it's easier to accept a little-known (but still canon) character than an OC.
