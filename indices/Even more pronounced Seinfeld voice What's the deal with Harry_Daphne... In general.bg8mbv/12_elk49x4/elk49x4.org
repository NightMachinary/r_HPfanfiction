There are two possible options:

1. For all lovers of Lord Potter and stuff like that (which I am certainly NOT), she is an ideal replacement for Ginny or Hermione, when they need to drawl on Lordship, wealth, high etiquette, and otherwise feel smug.
2. She could have the same advantage of any other non-central person in the HP universe. By having no history of her own, she allows to write original character with her own story. Although it is not strictly Haphne (technically, Harry ends up with Ginny, most likely, the sequel is unfinished), I really like linkffn(3912184), because it adds its own strong character with her own story, which adds something.
