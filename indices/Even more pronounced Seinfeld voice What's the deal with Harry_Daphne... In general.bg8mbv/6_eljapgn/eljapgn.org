Basically what everyone else said, but I like when authors attempt a “not all slytherins are evil” type fic and pairing Harry with a slytherin is an easy way to do that. I think the gryffindor/slytherin pairing makes for an interesting dynamic, and because Daphne is a blank slate that means she can be whatever the author needs. Although at this point she usually ends up as the “ice queen” pure blood that teaches Harry about pure blood culture.
