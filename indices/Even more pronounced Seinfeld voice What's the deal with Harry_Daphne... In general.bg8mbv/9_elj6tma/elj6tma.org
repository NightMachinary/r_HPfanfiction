I was attracted to write for the pairing because she is 1.a blank slate canon wise and 2. she is a Slytherin to boot, making it more compelling.

I personally have no interest in Draco/Hermione because Draco in canon is such a garbage human being...specifically to the trio. These types of stories can be written well but either characters need to go wildly OOC or the author needs to come up with a really great narrative explanation (Delenda Est with Belatrix/Harry for example) to make me buy it and believe it.

The fact that Harry never really mentions or makes note of her in canon speaks to how discreet and quietly she behaves. So you can have the interesting dynamic of Harry in a relationship with a Slytherin without all of the emotional baggage and awfulness associated with 'known' Slytherin peers of Harry.
