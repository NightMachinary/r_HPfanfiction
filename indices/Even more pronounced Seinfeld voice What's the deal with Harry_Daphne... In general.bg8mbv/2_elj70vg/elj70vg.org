Authors can do whatever they want with her, same with her background.

Personally I can't stand the pairing nor the character itself, like, 90% of the time is just bullshit politics played by 11 year olds or harem fics that feel the need to add a slytherin into the mix ''to teach Harry how to be cunning'', cunning being just giving long ass speeches and dumbing down everyone else while making them scared of a CHILD playing politics.

But I get it. Those brilliant Avada Kedavra Orbs that makes whoever looks at them feel the sheer Raw power contained inside them is just sooooooooo compeling...
