I haven't read a lot of Harry/Daphne (I guess I read one fic of the pairing, given that I am not keen on romance focused stories).

I almost included her in my fic for a few reasons, which I think are the same why people do include her in theirs:

- She's a blank canvas that can be made into anything, and has the bonus of being Slytherin and pureblood (drama potential), and never openly opposed Harry/doesn't come from a family of Voldemort supporters (that we know of);

- Not technically an OC, which works better to not alienate people who are put off by OCs;

- Is in the same year that Harry, which gives opportunity for interaction.

I guess that other reasons people write Harry/Daphne is because... she's blonde, I guess. And fanon has stereotyped her into 'Ice Queen of Slytherin' or something like that, and that blew out of proportion at some point in time.
