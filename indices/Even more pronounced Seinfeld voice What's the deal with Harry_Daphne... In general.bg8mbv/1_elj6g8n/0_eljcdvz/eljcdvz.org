This is my impression. There is also kind of a fanon consensus that she's kind of smart, with a dark personality, and kind of punk rock? There are exceptions but this is common enough that I'm surprised if she's not like this.

People want Harry to be with "a Slytherin", and Pansy and Millicent have already excluded themselves by being described as unattractive, and Tracey Davis has a name that's too ordinary, I guess?
