The other facet is she's considered aristocratic, whereas Tracy Davis is a halfblood, and therefore obviously only minor aristocracy at best, since most of them are Purebloods. And only Lily Evans is allowed to marry above her “station.” Most Indy!Harry stories have some element of Harry being some sort of solo-Illuminati mega-rich VERY IMPORTANT PERSON, and such a personage can't be with a /peasant/. Imagine if they started get ideas above their station!

Plus, as a blank slate not explicitly friends with Malfoy and his ilk, like Parkinson or Bulstrode (conjecture from Chamber of Secrets & Inquisatorial Squad member), and not even a member of the inquisitorial squad that we know of, she's therefore “neutral” and the perfect person to help Harry create his own super-awesome-faction-of-edginess(TM).
