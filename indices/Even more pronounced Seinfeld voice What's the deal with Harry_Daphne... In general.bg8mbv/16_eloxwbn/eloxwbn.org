What Feld?

This pairing is not "wrong" it's a way to introduce an OC without actually totally making up a character :)

It also pairs Harry with a Slytherin, which opens up a lot of possible insights into the working of the Wiz-World and MoM (Slytherins are interested in those sorts of things, most Gryffs and even most Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs aren't! They aren't looking to game the system and find advantages etc. after all, a Slytherin is!)
