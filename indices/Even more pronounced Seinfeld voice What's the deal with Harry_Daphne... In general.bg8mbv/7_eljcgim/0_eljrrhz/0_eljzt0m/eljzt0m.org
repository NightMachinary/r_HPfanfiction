If one really wanted parallels to Harry for a potential love interest, there's always Susan Bones. She's a half-blood (pureblood father, often described as being from an old, prestigious lineage), with family in the original Order of the Phoenix, said family were also killed by Voldemort during the first war (canonically it was an uncle and his wife and children that were killed, but fanon tends to add her parents to the body count due to a general lack of info regarding them), and she's often touted as the last of her family line (usually in any HBP AU's that diverge after Amelia's murder).
