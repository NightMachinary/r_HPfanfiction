She is a Slytherin. Making Harry fall in love with a Slytherin open a lot of door for author and can make a pretty interesting story with either cursed lovers from both side of the war of a spy from the other side.\\
In Canon, the only Slytherin girls in Harry year we learn about are Pansy Parkinson who is just nasty and like Draco or Millicent Bulstrode who is big and ugly. Both Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis are blank canvas you can use to make them whatever you want before they fall in love with our MC Harry, but with her pureblood statut and member of the Sacred 28, Daphne is a bit more interesting than Half blood Tracey, hence why she is THE character to use when you want a Slytherin romance.
