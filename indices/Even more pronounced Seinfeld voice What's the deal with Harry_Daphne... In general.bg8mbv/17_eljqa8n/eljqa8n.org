Harry/Daphne is my 2nd favorite pairing for HP fanfics (after Harry/Hermione).

From my perspective, I like the character for many of the reasons others here have already stated.

1. Pro inter house unity (to an extent) in stories because she's a Slytherin (and presumably a wealthy pureblood since her little sister in canon married Draco).

2. She's a blank slate. She's barely mentioned in the books aside from name and house, meaning authors have a lot to work with. The most common trope is the “Ice Princess of Slytherin”, but I've seen many other versions of the character aside from that. As some have said, this means she isn't a OC character (and I don't read OC docs aside from the occasional FemHarry ones). Further, because she's never mentioned as being someone who teases or pesters or antagonizes Harry, it allows authors to separate her from Draco and Pansy (often as the trope “grey faction” children)... supported in fandom by the fact no Greengrass is ever named as a death eater in canon.

3. Potential inter house conflicts (given that most of the House has death eater parents).

4. Potential political involvement of stories (due to her pureblood nature).

5. It allows for an inter-house relationship that isn't Dramione. Like another poster, I hate Draco. So seeing him paired as the main pair with my favorite character (Hermione) is awful to me.

6. “Ice Princess” - there is a reason in Japanese anime the Tsundere character is often the most popular. Daphne's trope is a tsundere (a character who is cold at first, but warms up over time to become loving to the lead).
