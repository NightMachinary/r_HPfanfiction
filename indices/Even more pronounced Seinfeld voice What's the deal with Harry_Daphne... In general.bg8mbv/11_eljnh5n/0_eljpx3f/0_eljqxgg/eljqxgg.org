Actually, this is what the epilogue says:

#+begin_quote
  Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again.

Astoria being Draco's wife only became canon (as opposed to word-of-god) in /Cursed Child/.
