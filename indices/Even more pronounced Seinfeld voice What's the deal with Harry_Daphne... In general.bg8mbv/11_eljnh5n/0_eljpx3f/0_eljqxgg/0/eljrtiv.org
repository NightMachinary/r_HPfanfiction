Huh... now I know. I've never read cursed child, nor seen it, and truthfully from what I know of it, I never want to. I feel like there must be some other mention...

/does some research/

A ha! In 2007 in Time magazine J.K. names Astoria Greengrass as Draco's wife. “Astoria Greengrass, younger sister of the Greengrass family.” So, fandom took it from there until Cursed Child came out and gave her a horrible end... unless that's what you meant by word of god (since J.K. Is god of the HP universe).
