For reference, here is Daphne's one and only appearance in the books:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle, and Daphne Greengrass. Students who had already been tested did not return afterward, so Harry and Ron had no idea how Hermione had done. (OotP, Chapter 31)

A lot of the answers below focus on her being a pureblood Slytherin, but while JKR did imagine that as her background from early on, it's not technically canon.
