there's a rather popular fic (that deserves its popularity imo) on ao3 that actually starts under the premise that Harry only learned he's a wizard when he's seventeen.

I can't quite remember why Harry didn't go to Hogwarts, but, well.

It only covers one possible outcome out of probably what could be hundreds (Harry transferring in would be an interesting read if done well - especially considering he'd be older/more mature when sorted which might influence which house he gets) but it was fun to read :)
