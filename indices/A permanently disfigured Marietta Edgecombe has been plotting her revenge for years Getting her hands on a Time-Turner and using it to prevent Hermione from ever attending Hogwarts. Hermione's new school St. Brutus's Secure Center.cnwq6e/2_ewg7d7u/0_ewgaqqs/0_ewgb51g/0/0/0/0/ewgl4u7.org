Her lighting Snape on fire, well I actually admire that, and it was an honest misunderstanding.

Book 2, she was cool. She did break some rules, but it was all for a good cause.

Book 3, she enables her cat to attack Ron's rat.

Book 4, she was in the right.

Book 5, she scarred Marietta, not as a preventative measure, but as a vindictive one. She didn't even know about the pimples until she saw herself in a mirror.

Book 6, she confunded McLaggen and attacked Ron. While Malfoy should have been expelled and sent to prison for his various misdeeds in that book, Hermione was not that far behind.

Book 7, nothing again, although her logic and deduction skills took a hit.
