"Way too far," is Hermione's fucking /SLOGAN/, dude. Lighting people on fire, illegally kidnapping and imprisoning a journalist for /DAYS/ on end, shooting Harry in the fucking face with a stinging jinx just to hide him from Death Eaters, removing her parent's agency entirely and modifying their whole lives and their own minds without consent, drugging and imprisoning two students to impersonate them, stealing books from Dumbledore's own office /RIGHT AFTER HIS FUNERAL/...?

And of course, physically assaulting Ron until he bled just because she was jealous he wasn't dating /her/. That's abusive ex stuff, and she wasn't even an ex! (And it was stupid, because yeah, he's going to want to /totally/ want to date you now that you've assaulted him for something he didn't even know about, and for exercising his free will as a human being to date someone not you)

I could go on and on. Like, holy /SHIT/. Hermione was a fucking sadist when she put her mind to it.
