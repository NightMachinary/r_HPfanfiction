The difference between speculation and fact is that I did not say it was absolute. That was my issue with what you said.

I did not say it could not be healed; I said it was not after significant effort, that's canon. The scars are too, as Rowling said that in an interview.

You said it was healable. Due to the unknown nature of the jinx, we don't know if it can be healed.

Canon (books, interviews, Pottermore) are the only sources of valid information.
