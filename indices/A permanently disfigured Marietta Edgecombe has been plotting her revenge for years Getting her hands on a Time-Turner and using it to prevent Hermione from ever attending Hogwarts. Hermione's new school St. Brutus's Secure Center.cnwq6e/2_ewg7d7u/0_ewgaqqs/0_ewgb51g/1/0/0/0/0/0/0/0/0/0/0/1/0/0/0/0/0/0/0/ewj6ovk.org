The significant effort was madam pomfrey being unable to heal it in book 5.

" It was small consolation that the last he had heard, Marietta was still up in the hospital wing and Madam Pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improve- ment to her pimples."

Fred and George had a punching gag I mentioned earlier that left a black eye only was healed by a cream they found.
