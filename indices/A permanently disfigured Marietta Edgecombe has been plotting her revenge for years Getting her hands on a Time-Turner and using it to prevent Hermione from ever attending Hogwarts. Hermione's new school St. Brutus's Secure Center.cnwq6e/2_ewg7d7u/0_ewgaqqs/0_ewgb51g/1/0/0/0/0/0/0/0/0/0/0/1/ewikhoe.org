I love how half this comment section is just us arguing. Tell you what, let's just agree to disagree, and get on with our day. I mean it seem kind of sad that we're still arguing about if a fictional injury can, or cannot be healed in a world of magic. Pointless to argue about. So good day/night, and good bye.
