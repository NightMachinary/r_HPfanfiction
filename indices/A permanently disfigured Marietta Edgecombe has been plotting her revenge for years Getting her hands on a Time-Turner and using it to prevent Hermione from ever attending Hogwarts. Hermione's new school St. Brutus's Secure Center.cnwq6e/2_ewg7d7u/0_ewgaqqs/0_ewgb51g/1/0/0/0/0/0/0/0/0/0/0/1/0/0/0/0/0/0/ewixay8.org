Yes, but canon also stated when introducing Moody that it's injuries created through black magic that is difficult to heal. That's canon, and unless Hermione used black magic(possible sure, but not likely), than it is healable with minimal difficulty /according to canon/. That's what i'm saying. So Marietta couldn't have searched very hard, otherwise /again according to canon/ it'd have been healed.
