They weren't healed, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been healed. It could be a lack of knowledge on Edgecombe's part, or just the fact that she didn't try that hard while in school(with Voldemort being on the rise, I doubt it was the first thing on her mind), or maybe after the war it seemed less important. We don't know. What we can be fairly certain of is that it wasn't caused by dark magic, and that it's canonically stated that it's injuries caused by dark magic that are difficult to heal. Taking all this into account says that it's highly likely that it's healable, but it's also likely that after everything that happened with Voldemort, she just doesn't care that much about some minor scarring compared to what happened to a lot of people.

Tl;dr it's only as permanent as Marietta wants it to be most likely. Permanent by choice basically.
