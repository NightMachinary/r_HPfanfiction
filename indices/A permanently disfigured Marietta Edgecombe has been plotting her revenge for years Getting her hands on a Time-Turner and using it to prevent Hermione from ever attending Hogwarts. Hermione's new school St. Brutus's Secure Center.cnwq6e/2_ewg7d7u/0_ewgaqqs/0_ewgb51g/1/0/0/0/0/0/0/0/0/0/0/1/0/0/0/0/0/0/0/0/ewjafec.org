And as i've already stated, Pomfrey is, essentially, a school nurse. She is not a professional working to heal more obscure, and difficult medical conditions. She is a school nurse. If I had a broken bone, I could expect a school nurse to splint it, but i'd expect someone who works at a hospital with great medical equipment, and a constant supply of knowledge(as in constantly studying, readying themselves for any possible case) to know the best way on how to help me heal. Not a school nurse. Sure she might get the odd case from the odd spell, but she's not working in a hospital that caters to tens of thousands(the public), and has at least hundreds of patients at a time with the most exotic, and dark curses coming through their doors(whether by DE, adventuring, or just pushing the boundry of magic).

Basically, Pomfrey is not the best healer, or even best choice in the country by a long shot.
