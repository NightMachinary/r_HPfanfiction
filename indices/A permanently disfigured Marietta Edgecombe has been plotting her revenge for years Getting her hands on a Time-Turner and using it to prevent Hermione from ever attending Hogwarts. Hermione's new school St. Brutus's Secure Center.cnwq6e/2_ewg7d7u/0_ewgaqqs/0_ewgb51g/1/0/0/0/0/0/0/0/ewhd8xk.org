We only know that it was attempted by Poppy, that is all we know. Unless you can tell me where else she went to try besides a school nurse, then it's only disfiguring in the way that she hasn't gone to St Mungos. It left scars behind, but the scars were the end result of her pimples popping, so since the magic caused the pimples, but not the scarring, it is possible to heal. Unless you can either provide evidence on it being dark magic, or that she has tried St Mungos, the best either of us can do is speculate.
