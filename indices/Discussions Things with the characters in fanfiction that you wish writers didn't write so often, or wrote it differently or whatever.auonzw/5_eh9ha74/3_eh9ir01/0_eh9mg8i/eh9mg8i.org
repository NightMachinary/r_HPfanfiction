Eh. Muggles one don't, but neither do they store your money as big piles of gold guarded by a dragon. A magical blood-test to determine whether you really are a blood relative of the person whose legacy you are claiming sounds perfectly reasonably like a thing Goblins might have and do. I know it's usually used annoyingly, but that's because it's used as a segue for introducing that Harry is the heir to ten different Old Family Vaults. The idea in itself, as a piece of worldbuilding, isn't too objectionable.
