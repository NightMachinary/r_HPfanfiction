  The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there --- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug

Sure, he doesn't get beaten until his bloodied and barely breathing, but for me that qualifies as a form of child abuse, especially when you realise Harry was only just ten or eleven at the time. One of the things a child needs most is love, a warm feeling of safety, support and acceptance and Harry never had any of that.
