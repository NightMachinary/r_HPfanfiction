And I understand the word abuse normally implies physical violence and that's mostly not the case in Canon other than a few instances where Dudleys were overzealous with their reactions.

But I also think that is abuse at its core and stories, if leaning towards angst and drama, should carry the undertones of that past, without being all whiny about it, because, sadly, there are millions of children who grow up suffering far more than Harry did. Most of them make it into adulthood as relatively well-adjusted people and not at all spineless cowards who flinched every time a door opens. Nor do they tend to cry all that often.
