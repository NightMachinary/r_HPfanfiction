Yeah, that's all very dark and unpleasant. I'm not in any way disputing that. But that doesn't necessarily make it "abuse", and even if it fits some legal definition of it or other, it's kind of misleading to call it that in conversation: again, it gives the impression that the Dursleys were actively out to harm Harry, which I really don't think is the case for the most part. They mostly just stuck him where they couldn't see him and tried to forget he existed.
