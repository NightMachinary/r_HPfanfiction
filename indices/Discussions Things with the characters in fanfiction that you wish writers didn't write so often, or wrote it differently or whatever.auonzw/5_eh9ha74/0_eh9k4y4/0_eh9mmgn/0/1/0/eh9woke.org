If it's legally abuse, which you acknowledge it might be, how is it misleading to refer to it as such? Your only argument seems to be that there wasn't any physical violence (which there was, albeit to a /much/ lesser degree than the edgelords would have us believe), therefore it's not abuse. Which, y'know, is implicitly dismissive of real people who have lived through similar abuse, because make no mistake, the Dursleys' treatment of Harry /is/ abusive.
