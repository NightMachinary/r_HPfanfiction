I have said it time and again: the Dursleys' treatment of Harry is horrible. Of course it is. No one's disputing that. And yes, legally speaking, it is "abuse". But stressing that the Dursleys were abusive to fanfiction authors is preaching to an already overzealous choir. If leaning too far the other way is what it takes for people to stop writing about Harry's secret scars from Vernon's beatings, I'll do it.
