  And sticking a growing boy under the stairs is what abuse is at its highest without involving physical or sexual violence.

I wouldn't say "at its highest". The Dursleys are definitely emotionally abusive to some extent, with a bit of debatable bordering-on-physical in specific instances, but mostly they seem to be guilty of criminal levels of child neglect, rather than active abuse.

The point OP is making isn't that the Dursleys are blameless, but rather that "they treated Harry badly, bordering on abuse" doesn't necessarily translate to "Vernon beat him with his belt buckle every other weekends" as many authors jump to assuming.
