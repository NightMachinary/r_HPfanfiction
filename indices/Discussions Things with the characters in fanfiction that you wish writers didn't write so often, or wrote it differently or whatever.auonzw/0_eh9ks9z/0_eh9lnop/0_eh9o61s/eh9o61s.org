It's the power of the plot railroad.

Seriously though, I think it's because authors want to see how characters react to the canon situations, like how Ninja AU Harry would handle the TWT and the Graveyard scene, which only happened due to a number of set-ups, like the Weasleys going to Egypt, Pettigrew dropping his Scabbers disguise, and the whole PoA plot. It's the same reason why Harry makes friends with Ron and Hermione in so many fics, and so many crossovers and Muggle AUs, even though they only got together because of the Troll in the Dungeons. Their friendship dynamic is good, well-established, and the author can't think of any other friends to pair Harry up with as an alternative.
