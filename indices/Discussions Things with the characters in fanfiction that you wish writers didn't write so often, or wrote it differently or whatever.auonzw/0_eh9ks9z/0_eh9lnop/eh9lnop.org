Yeah I don't get it either. You have fanon, it's a wide web of stories you can write about. Why still write about Sirius dying? Why still write about Dumbledore or another x character here dying? And they often die in a similar manner that they died in canon, which is just ridiculous.

The characters are three dimensional people, who have real conflict and thoughts and different opinions. Writing them in a way that reduces all of that is incredibly annoying.

Hell sexualizing anyone, especially at a young age, rather it be Luna, Ginny or Hermione is a quick way to hit the back button for me.
