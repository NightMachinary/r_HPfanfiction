  Short Harry.

I mean, 10 cm below average would put him at ~170 cm (5'7"), which would show the lasting impact of the abuse without making him comically short.

  but he got taller by DH

Which makes no sense tbh. Hogwarts does not offer a balanced diet (I think there is no mention of salad or raw vegetables in any book). The Dursleys interrupt even that each year, sometimes pretty badly (especially years 2 and 4). The substitutes are often candy and cake, so not exactly healthy either (lots of carbs, maybe fat but little else). And the hunt has remarkably bad food quality.

I could get behind Harry out-growing his childhood malnutrition if there the proper steps were taken (eg supplements or a potion regime) or he had a constant supply of moderately healthy food, but there is nothing in canon which suggests he could grow back what is missing.
