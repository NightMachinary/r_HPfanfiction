  Snape isn't a woobie and would never become soft and nice around people he liked, if he liked anyone at all.
#+end_quote

Eh, I find the first half of that sentence really debatable. I agree he definitely would never come anywhere close to "soft", and his idea of being nice is probably to always sneer at you instead of constantly making cutting remarks. But that doesn't necessarily diminish the emotional suffering he went through. There's such a trope as "Jerkass Woobie" --- a character who still deserves to be felt sorry for, but is nevertheless a hugely unpleasant person aside from that.

  Sexualizing Luna. Why is she made into a manic pixie nympho girl so often?What exactly is the appeal of this.
#+end_quote

¨shrugs¨ I'd say half of it is the fantasy of the wholly sex-positive hippie girl, which Luna is the closest canon fit for if you want to shoehorn it into the story, and the other half is people who got a crush on the actress playing her in the movies.
