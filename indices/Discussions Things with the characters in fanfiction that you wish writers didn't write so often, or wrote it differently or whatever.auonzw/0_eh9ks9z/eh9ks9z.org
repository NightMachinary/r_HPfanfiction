Pet peeve thread #420342?

- Killing off characters in an AU fic to preserve the canon timeline. The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/285498][Boy with a Scar]] AU Harry series (well known for the "Harry raised by a loving Petunia" oneshot) is guilty of this, killing Sirius off in multiple timelines, in the same canon DoM battle, even if the set-up circumstances were different.

- Making characters woobies when they weren't woobies, in a way that reduces their character. Snape isn't a woobie and would never become soft and nice around people he liked, if he liked anyone at all. Draco isn't a woobie who is abused by Lucius.

- Sexualizing Luna. Why is she made into a manic pixie nympho girl so often? Especially when she's 11-12 years old? What exactly is the appeal of this.

- Badass Flawless Hermione. The real Hermione is bossy, socially awkward, insecure, and close-minded when she gets an idea in her head and refuses to hear other people's side. Seems to be a symptom of mixing movie canon with book canon.

- Short Harry. Harry was smaller than the other kids back in Year 1 and 2, but he got taller by DH. I don't mind if Harry's childhood stunted his growth and that is remarked on, but 5-foot tall teeny tiny adult Harry is weird. It shows up a lot in slash where Harry is the "bottom".
