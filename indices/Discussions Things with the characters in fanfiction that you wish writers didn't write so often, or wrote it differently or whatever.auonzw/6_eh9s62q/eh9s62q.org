Luna was wasn't brutalized with knives or pushed down stairs by the entirety of Ravenclaw House every time she entered the common room without the protection of Lord Potter, her stuff was stolen was stolen by a few mean girls,hell I like to imagine even that stopped during her fifth year due to the Ravenclaws who had been in the DA standing up for her .
