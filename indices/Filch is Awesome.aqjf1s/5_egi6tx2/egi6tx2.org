While awesome might be pushing, there was one fic... I think Magical Relations. Harry went to Hogwarts without Hagrid and didn't realize he was rich. Harry got a part time job as Filch's assistant so he could pay Uncle Vernon back for school supplies. After Harry found out about the Potter vaults he cut his hours back, but remained friendly with Filch. Filch would claim Harry's detentions for easy punishments.
