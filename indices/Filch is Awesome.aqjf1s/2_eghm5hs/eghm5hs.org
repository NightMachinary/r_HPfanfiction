I wanted a story where Harry, Ron, Hermione and Fang capture Voldemort and say 'Let's see who you REALLY are!' and pull off his mask and it's Argus Filch!

"No one suspects the SQUIB!' He'd say, "My plan was to scare everyone off Hogwarts and get RICH selling it to condominium developers!

And it would have worked - except for you rotten kids!"
