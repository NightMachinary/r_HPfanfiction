Yes, there are many. Here are some I like:

[[https://wwwfanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/][A Black Comedy]], linkffn(3401052$: Harry falls through the Veil and joins Sirius in a new dimension. James and Lily are alive. Voldemort is also still around, but gets messed up by “that fucker”.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/][A Riddled Universe]], linkffn(8678567): Harry falls through the Veil and joins Sirius in a new dimension. They meet a good Tom Riddle and new villains.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12972342/1/A-Step-to-the-Right][A Step to the Right]], linkffn(12972342): Postwar Harry and Hermione dimensional time travel to a world without Voldemort

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3959072/1/Deepest-Reflections][Deepest Reflections]], linkffn(3959072): Canon Harry and the one from "Dark Prince Trilogy" universe swap places in Year 5. James and Lily are alive in the other universe.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry is thrown back to 1975 and has to team up with Bellatrix. This is my favorite time travel fic, and the characterization of Bellatrix is excellent. Lily developed a crush on him and was quite jealous of Bellatrix.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]], linkffn(2705927): During the Horcrux hunt, Harry is thrown into another world where things have gone even worse, despite his 'parents' being still alive.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925): My favorite dimensional travel perhaps. Badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are accidentally thrown into a new dimension during a mission. Things are rather different there.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Powerful Harry somehow ended up in 1970 and busted a Death Eater raid right away. Bellatrix became very impressed.
