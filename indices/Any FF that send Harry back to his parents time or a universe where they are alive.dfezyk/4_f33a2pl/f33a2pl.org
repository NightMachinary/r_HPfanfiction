Linkffn(Delenda Est): a bit of an AU with some back-and-forth on the whole time-travel, but it is complete.

Linkffn(Stages of Hope): more of a dimension-hopping fic, but there is certainly Harry interacting James and Lily (if insanely).

Linkao3(C'est la Vie by cwyscross): not completed, but it is honestly a fic that is both routine in many ways yet strangely endearing to read - bonus is there are two Harrys.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Defiance of the Hero): this is the sequel to Sword of the Hero, here Harry dimension-hops into a world where he got killed in 1991 instead of defeating Voldemort.
