My issue is that I really want to find a fic with Harry and Draco becoming good pals, not just a substitute Ron, and while the above mention one has him in slytherin, it's just not what I expected. But definitely will try to tough it out while I also read “They Shook Hands” just started year two and I appreciate the author is a bit more subtle about rivalries between houses (one of my complaints with OtWtG is how lazy it is “wow harry, for a slytherin you act like a lot like a grffyndor” “Wow what a boneheaded Gryffndor move Potter” etc etc)
