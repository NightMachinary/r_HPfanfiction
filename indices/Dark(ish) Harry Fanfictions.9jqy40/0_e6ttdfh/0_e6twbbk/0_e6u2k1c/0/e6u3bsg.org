For what it's worth, I remember worrying that the fic was heading towards the manipulative!Dumbledore trope (which I hate), but later chapters ended up being much better on that front, with Harry realizing all the conflicting priorities Dumbledore is trying to juggle. So if that was your problem too, maybe give it another shot?
