  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Regulus Black wakes up in a dark cell during one of the most eventful months of his life, not very sure of how he came to be there, and with only a stranger named Harry for company. An awkward almost friendship is born. Meanwhile, Harry Potter might have made a mistake. Or two. All he knows is that things aren't really going his way right now, and that his cellmate's mostly alright. Mostly.

  She had a life once, but she doesn't remember. All she knows is the ashes and blood she tastes as she wakes up yet again... She's got one more try to get it right. - Haesel hadn't quite thought of this when she'd accepted Death's 'chance to live with those she'd lost'. AU, time travel, fem!Harry, T for now?
