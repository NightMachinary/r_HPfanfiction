linkffn(a long Journey Home by Rakeesh) comes close

- fem Harry is the only time traveler
- she isn't dark, perhaps gray on the fanon light gray dark scale
- she's a little OP but for /very/ legitimate reasons
- there's some poking fun at Dumbledore in one chapter but it isn't close to bashing
- there is definitely non-slash romance
- she does return to the present
- in the present she does sorta meet someone from her travel into the past if visiting their tomb counts
