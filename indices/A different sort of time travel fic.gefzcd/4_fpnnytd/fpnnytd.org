if you don't mind Snarry, there is this fic I like with Harry traveling to the time when Voldy still didn't kill his parents. I don't know if he went back right after the Hogwarts battle or if he was an auror, but he came back in time as adult. it's a lengthy fic focusing on the first wizarding war. it is marked as unfinished, but I think I remember them defeating Voldy, so it might just be a couple of loose ends missing.
