Binns is reading from the textbook (about The Lord of The Rings, which is a true story in this prompt), and mentions something similar to Voldemort (similarities between Sauron and Voldemort surviving their initial defeats). Harry is intrigued and asks a follow-up question. A student actually asking a question is a rare enough event that Binns actually has to process what had just happened before responding. Later, when Binns has had time to process what happened, he realizes that Harry, his student, has taken an interest in his subject (something that he cannot recall happening since before his death). He smiles because he's happy to finally be listened to.
