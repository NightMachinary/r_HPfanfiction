It was a nice afternoon for a nap as the late September light streamed in the window. Harry was just about to fall asleep listening to Binns when a thought struck him.

It was only the second month of seven years of classes so far. This was far from a revolutionary or wild thought though.

No, it was the implication that it implied. Implication backed by repeated experience and anecdotal evidence. Of course though our primary protagonist, a young first year student Harry Potter, had no such fantastical explanations for his thought.

"We read a lot about Goblins, weird."

Nearly all they had learned so far in History was about Goblins, in fact.

He remembered overhearing upper years talking about it as well. Binns almost entirely taught about goblin wars.

That was a whole crackin ton of wars. Especially with someone who had control of your money.

There had to be a reason right? Either goblins and people just couldn't see eye to eye due to racial differences.

Or...

They had a damn good list of reasons to go to war over.

With this thought firmly explored as well as one can while also contemplating a nap our protagonist moved the story along.

Well after jotting off a note, a note that is central, key even, to our story.

"Why goblins fight so much???"

°•○○•°

It took our brave hero a handful of weeks until he unearthed this deep secret. Oh yes, they braved many a danger together, young Harry and his best friend Ron.

"Um Ms. Pince, we're looking for a book about why Goblins seem to fight so much."

Truly a harrowing quest fraught with many a danger!

They had conquered the Library of So Much Boring Stuff!

Harry had sorta, kinda, not really, but close enough, been about half right.

Goblins did have a fundamental difference of mind then a human. Not one you couldn't work around but it was there.

This was something obvious in hindsight, and foresight for most people as well.

They also had a culture that thought the best way to succeed was to stick a knife in your boss.

This meant their idea of negotiating was what others called full out war.

Combined with a fairly legitimate list of grievances and Harry wasn't so sure Wizards were totally the good guys.

Of course some grievances were obviously impossible or just wrong.

Such as the right to own a wand. Goblins even freely admit they cannot use a wand with much success. They just want them for a status symbol.

Goblins are tied too heavily to stone and metal for a traditional wand to work. It was as silly as letting a human have a Goblin Jürißt. The pick like metal focus was a goblin rite of passage into adulthood just as much as a wand was for a wizard.

Also, legalizing blackmail, extortion, and kidnapping was generally seen as a bad idea by everyone worldwide, except for the Goblins.

Had our protagonist been older, more seasoned, and just a shade more clever he would have made another discovery. The complete lack of any laws whatsoever regarding bribery.

However our intrepid hero did not make any such discovery, as that would be an entirely different prompt altogether.

Harry found a fascination with a species, that near as he could tell, was the embodiment of the Dursley Family. Nothing was to good for them or to bad for those they disliked.

If his uncle and cousin weren't so big he would suspect they were related to goblins somehow.

It was a simple letter, and 1 galleon 6 sickles, later to get a Literaricus Language Learner course. Within a week he was fluently cursing to everyone he could, baring the teachers who seemed to all speak it, in goblin tongue.

Gobbledygook translated to 'I don't know what I am saying'. It was a rather hilarious pun in goblin tongue.

This started a controversy once everyone found out The-Boy-Who-Lived spoke fluent, and exceptionally foul mouthed, goblin.

Of course the wizarding public was quick to follow their boy hero and soon speaking Goblin was all the rage.

When Literaricus discovered the cause of his recent boom in business he swiftly capitalized on it. Sending young Harry Potter a new language free of charge every two weeks. Sales were sky high and more importantly, goblin puns, the finest of linguistical art forms, was on the rise as well.

So it is with a somewhat heavy heart, not literally though as that would require an emergency trip to the hospital, we return to the plot.

It was nearing the end of October that another thought clawed its way out of the depths of our easily bored and energetic preteen protagonist mind.

What other bits of really interesting history and culture was just lurking around to be discovered.

°•○○•°

Hermione was an alright sort once you got her to drop the snobbish act. Ron still thought she was mental, but he kept the comments to the dorm room now.

She was scary good at asking Ms. Pince for information, and finding it even!

Harry had never really stopped his interest in History so when Hagrid dropped the Flamel's name his eyes had widened.

He had quickly made an excuse and left without letting on who that was.

Hermione had started to talk about it but Harry had sushed her hard and sternly.

"Not out here, in the dorm room, trust me."

Goblins actually had a word just for the Flamel's. Urq'Hi, or a bad investment. They hated the Flamel's with a burning passion. Gold was only useful when it was limited.

The Flamel's had successfully single handedly funded the destruction of more goblin agendas then the rest of the world combined.

Which the excess of gold into the markets had completely fucked their system multiple times as well.

Ron and Hermione understood a bit how serious it was that the school had the stone currently. And more importantly, the Flamel's had the sheer balls to store the stone in Gringotts!

Which had gotten the vault it was stored in robbed.

So Harry had did the thing he was legally required to do, per the treaty of 1734, and let the goblins know what he knew about the Flamel family and their stone.

°•○○•°

Albus sighed as yet another Gringotts owl made its way towards him. Somehow they had learned the Flamel's had stored their stone there and that was the vault that had been broken into.

Oh, and that Albus currently had possession of the stone. Which apparently was a capital crime, and if he did not surrender the stone would be tried in absentia.

That meant he was obviously guilty, and would be sentenced to death. Which he was kindly informed would not only be painful, it would be slow, and he would be charged for it.

Edit: accidentally hit submit on my phone lol, far from over.
