I like the prompt, and the actual history of magic and magicals in HP is sorely underdeveloped.

Unfortunately, I can't get behind a LotR/HP crossover, at least not one where it turns out HP is happening later in Arda after the world has moved on to a different Age, because I think the two worlds are pretty incompatible.
