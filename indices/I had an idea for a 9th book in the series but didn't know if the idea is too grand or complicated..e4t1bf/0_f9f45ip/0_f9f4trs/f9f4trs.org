Yeah so it's not actually paradoxical but as face value it seems it should be.

So basically it extends what happened in Prisoner of Azkaban where Harry directly meddling with time in is part of the timeline, but it takes it a bit further in that two timelines coexist. A big piece of symbolism throughout the story would be the use of the Infinity symbol. They meet in the middle and directly affect each other but need each other to exist
