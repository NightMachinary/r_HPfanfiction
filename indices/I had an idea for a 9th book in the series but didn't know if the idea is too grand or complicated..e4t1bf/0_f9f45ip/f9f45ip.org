My suggestion: throw away any paradoxical time travels and make your story a dimensional travel (or a dimensional time travel in which there won't be any paradoxes).

The benefits of dimensional (time) travels are many:

- No paradoxes
- Protagonists have maximum freedom of actions and choices
- Friends and foes can be different
- Events and facts can be different
- Protagonists's knowledge may not be useful or could be even counterproductive in the new world, thus raising the challenge level
- Protagonists may have counterparts there, and I find such encounters usually amusing
