I second this recommendation. I spent a while reading it, the pacing seemed to fit well, but it was also the type of story where if I put it down for the day, I'm not going to have to reread a chunk to get back into it. I loved the expansion of magic in it, I loved some of the conflicts, and even when the last story leaves off, it was winding down instead of being at the height of a plotline.
