/(poke me with a stick if I'm still missing the obvious)/

I think you'll often find yourself disappointed if you compare all fanfics to /Lightning's/ quality of writing. Lightning's almost as good as a professional writer, and what puts them below that level, in my opinion, is not the writing style but the plot development and the falling back to strawman characters' actions for driving that development.

Maybe /GreenGecko's/ Resonance isn't a masterpiece, reading which will increase your TOEFL score by some ~10 permanent points, but as I've said it doesn't have any major problems either. No major sputtering in the text flow, not that many mistakes and typos, etc. The author here needs a tool for describing the characters, their interactions and their story; and their (even if somewhat simplistic) writing style accomplishes just that.

p.s. If you /do/ know any stories that are written as well as the Sacrifices, can you recommend them to me?

edit: I think /Lightning/ has one more drawback too, actually: they often stretch their text for too damn long instead of trying to cut it a bit shorter.
