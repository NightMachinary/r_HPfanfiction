I didn't think the writing was terrible at all, at least there was only one persistent horrible grammar error that bugged me (throughout the whole trilogy) and that was the author's use of "may" where "might" should have been. No spelling mistakes that weren't just typos.

I do remember the writing was really... spare... when it came to emotions. For Snape and Harry's relationship in particular, their feelings were only described through actions, not adjectives, at some points- but I almost felt that made it more powerful.
