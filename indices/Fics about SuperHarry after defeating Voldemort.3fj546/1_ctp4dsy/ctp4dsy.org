Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance trilogy]] (W: 1,713,423; Abandoned) by GreenGecko. But I'll warn that it's slow at plot development --- though it's one of the few stories that do this for the sake of realistic CharDev --- and that Harry's not that super-powerful at the starting chapters.
