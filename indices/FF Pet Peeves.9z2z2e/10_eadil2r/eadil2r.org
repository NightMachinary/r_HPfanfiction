Any kind of bashing. As in, portraying a character in a bad way that is not supported by canon. Dumbledore isn't evil (misguided sometimes, possibly manipulative, but never evil), James isn't abusive, Ron isn't greedy, etc.

Authors portraying characters as being bad isn't a bad thing, but they need to do it in a way that is /plausible/ with what we know is supported in canon. All the above examples can be portrayed both as less than honorable, or as great people, but /bashing/ just makes the fic bad.
