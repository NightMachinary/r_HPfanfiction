Repetition of words can be annoying to the reader, hence why some authors try to avoid repeating names over and over again. Beginners may have difficulties finding a proper "middle way". - Rowling herself used names alot, so often in fact that I found myself disliking a few scenes because she wrote "Harry" instead of "he",- which may be excused because there were two "he's" in the scene, - then again, maybe its something English? Who knows.

Regarding the often abused green eyes. This is an important outer trait of Harry's character. But instead of repeating the fact that he has green eyes, emerald, as green as jade, and whatnot, they should describe what effects the outer traits of a character or the personal traits - characteristical behavior etc. may have on others.
