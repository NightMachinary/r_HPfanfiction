linkffn(The Art of Self Fashioning) Harry gets sorted into Ravenclaw and thus doesn't get a chance to bond with Hermione or Ron. His best friend is Terry.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School) Harry ends up in Slytherin in a more militaristic Hogwarts. Doesn't interact with Ron. Hermione and Harry eventually form a platonic working relationship, but I wouldn't call them friends, allies more like.

linkffn(What you leave behind by newcomb) Harry is one year older than in canon. Best friends are Cho and Cedric.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) Harry isn't the boy who lived, his brother is. His relationship with his family isn't antagonistic. He also gets sorted into Ravenclaw and doesn't get along with his housemates.
