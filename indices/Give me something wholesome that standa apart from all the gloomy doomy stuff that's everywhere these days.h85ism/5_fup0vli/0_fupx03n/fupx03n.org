I'm left scratching my head as to how is it racist for Hermione not to recognize that Cho is a Korean surname to the point where she has to tiptoe around the question and apologize for being a "stupid white girl". Would the same amount of kowtowing be warranted if Hermione displayed ignorance about the names from two European countries? Rhetorical question.
