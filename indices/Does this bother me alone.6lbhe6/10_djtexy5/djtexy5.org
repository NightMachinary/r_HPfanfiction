In general, I agree. Most of this is very annoying.

Just two things. First, I'd like to mention that the age of the characters doesn't actually matter. It could be cutting it a little close with, for example Arthur and Molly, where we have some defacto timestamps on them becoming parents, but Bellatrix, Andromeda, Lucius,... the rest, are really fair game for canon inconsequential age-changes, that may open up an avenue to something interesting.

Second:

  James and Sirius eating like pigs. What canon proof do you have of that?

Nobody needs proof of a character trait, if the trait has never even been spoken about. Its a completely new addition to the characters. And to be quite honest, even just outright changing canon-established character traits may be fair game, as we know so very little about that time anyway.
