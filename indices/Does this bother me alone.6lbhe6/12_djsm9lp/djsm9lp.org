  ) Marlene McKinnon, Hestia Jones, Emmeline Vance, Alice Longbottom, and Dorcas Meadowes all being Lily's best friends
#+end_quote

Maybe the best friend part, but saying that Gryffindor girls don't have a tight knit circle in their years when it's quite obvious they do is pretty disingenuous to canon evidence.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius and James not being able to tell left from right without Remus by their side to guide them.
#+end_quote

If it's canon compliant and Remus is their Hermione, that's how Rowling would have written it. Not saying it's a right or wrong interpretation, but if the writer is trying to make it pseudo-canon compliant, that's how it needs to go.

  as both Sirius and James were described as very bright by Professor McGonagall
#+end_quote

"And Harry, your mother and father---the dead ones, you remember? Yea, they were idiots, got themselves blown up and everything." I honestly can't imagine anyone saying anything mean about a person's dead relatives, though the Marauder's Map was a group effort, it's implied that James, Sirius and Remus was genius' in terms of Magic, just maybe not socially.

#+begin_quote
  Peter being this stupid, drooling and utterly useless boy. Why not make Peter a likable character? Shocking, I know! The rest of the marauders considered Peter their friend and that's why his betrayal was so depressing.
#+end_quote

As far as we know, Peter was an odd sort of fourth wheel that would leech on their fame and glory. He gravitated towards power and his spirit animal was a rat. You could make him likeable, but not for long, something big has to change in order for him to become a Death Eater.

#+begin_quote
  James and Sirius eating like pigs. What canon proof do you have of that?
#+end_quote

Do you have canon proof they don't? I don't understand why that matters, though, seems like a small issue.

#+begin_quote
  Peter doesn't have blonde hair, he has mousy brown hair as far as I can remember and please correct me if I'm wrong.
#+end_quote

Once again, small issue. Harry's hair color alternates between Raven, Pure-Black, and Jet-Black in almost every fanfic I read, it doesn't detract anything.

#+begin_quote
  Now, this makes me want to shoot myself. Lily is by far the closest thing to a Mary Sue in the entire series but that doesn't mean she is one. Lily is made into a prodigy in fanfiction as people write her as powerful enough to take down two death eaters twice her age with a single spell. She is also written as stunningly beautiful, the smartest witch in Hogwarts and overall small details that make her into an utter Mary Sue.
#+end_quote

All of this is Canon-Compliant. She is apparently a prodigy the likes of which caught Horace's attention, she was called beautiful on numerous occasions, and she was called the smartest witch of her age too.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius having a girlfriend every other week because of what? Because he was handsome? Being attractive doesn't mean you snog every single girl your eyes rest on.
#+end_quote

Because that is what Sirius is like. He's cheeky, he's wild, and he has a very short attention span. Hell, he gets James and himself chased by a Police Helicopter for fun.

#+begin_quote
  Petunia being the devil.
#+end_quote

She takes out Childhood agression on a child that didn't deserve it. What did Harry do to her to warrant such emotional abuse? They made him live in a freakin' cupboard!

#+begin_quote
  Remus having wolf senses/features outside of the full moon. In the fanfiction world he is super strong and can smell anything from Slytherin dungeons while up in Gryffindor tower when it isn't the full moon.
#+end_quote

Why not? Could very well be a thing from what we see from Greyback who has wolf speed and strength outside of full-moons.

#+begin_quote
  Snape not having friends aside from Lily. It was implied that he did have friends (Avery and Mulciber).
#+end_quote

Acquaintances and friends are different things. I seem to remember that Remus said he was usually alone if not for Lily hanging around at times.

#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix, Andromeda, Molly and Arthur had all graduated from school when MWPP were first years and Lucius was a fifth year.
#+end_quote

Not sure I've seen this too many times. In fact, it's almost always Molly, Arthur, Frank, Alice, etc ... mentioned several times as being apart of James' year in fics.
