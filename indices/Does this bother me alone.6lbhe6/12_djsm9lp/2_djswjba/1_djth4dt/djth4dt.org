  Lily isn't a prodigy.

The term most definitely applies to her. A Prodigy is defined by someone with exceptional skill in a certain field, so technically, she was a potions prodigy.

  You need to remember that Horace was talking about one of his favourites and he himself says that he is biased.

But Horace doesn't just choose anybody to be his protege as Lily was. In fact, Dumbledore said this when he was talking to Harry about him.

  "You are talented, famous, and powerful --- everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry. You would be his crowning jewel."

Lily was a Muggleborn, so she likely wasn't famous outside of her social sphere. So it only leaves Talented and Powerful, traits of a Prodigy.

  Take Ron for example, he has the same wand wood (which is generally good for Charms) and I really don't seem to remember that he was described as exceptional at it.

Actually, he was exceptional at Charms. He got an E on his Charms OWL.
