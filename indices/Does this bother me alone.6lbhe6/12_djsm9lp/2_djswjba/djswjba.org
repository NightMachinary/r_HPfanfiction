Lily isn't a prodigy. You can say that Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald are prodigies because they are/were. You need to remember that Horace was talking about one of his favorites and he himself says that he is biased. Imagine that Ron and Hermione are dead and Harry is talking about them to Hugo and Rose. He wouldn't say that Ron flunked History of Magic and Divination. Hermione will seem like a prodigy when Harry describes her brains but I don't think that she is. Now Lily is brilliant at Potions but the same can't be said for other subjects and Charms. People seem to think she was a prodigy at Charms, the best enchanter/enchantress since Merlin himself. Just because her wand was good at Charms doesn't mean that she was. Take Ron for example, he has the same wand wood (which is generally good for Charms) and I really don't seem to remember that he was described as exceptional at it. I don't seem to remover that she was the smartest witch of her age. Please give me evidence from the books if you can because I don't seem to remember it.
