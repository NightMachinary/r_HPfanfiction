  Lily isn't a prodigy. You can say that Voldemort, Dumbledore and Grindelwald are prodigies because they are/were.

This is a bit unfair. You need to remember that Lily was 21 when she died. Voldemort, Grindelwald and even more so Dumbledore have had decades to perfect their arts and gather experience. And those three were more than prodigies, they were simply geniuses.\\
So, was Lily a genius of the level of a Tom Riddle? Probably not. It doesn't mean she wasn't among the most gifted wizards.

You don't need to be Ramanujan to be a top level mathematician. Hell, you don't need to be Ramanujan to be considered a genius, even.
