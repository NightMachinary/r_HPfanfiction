  Someone actively trying to protect Harry is a bit far fetched in my opinion.

Well, his mother could have. I mean, Hary's parents, the Marauders, and Dumbledore at the very least knew that Voldemort was going to come for Harry. It's not that farfetched that one or more of these people would have tried to devise some countermeasures. I know if I had been James, I would have.

  Rowling said that the Harrycrux was an accident
#+end_quote

Yes, but it doesn't mean he didn't want to make one. The accident could have happened before he actually makes the Horcrux. I'm not saying that's what happened, but it still makes sense.

  Voldemort wasn't trying to create one as he had already split his soul into seven parts: himself, the didadem, Hufflepuff's cup, Slytherin's locket, the ring, and Nagini.
#+end_quote

You missed the diary. Despite, are you sure Nagini was a Horcrux at the time? I can't remember. But if Voldemort wasn't trying to create a Horcrux, it removes one of the best ways to explain the accident. Because it's the only thing truly unusual about Voldemorts' raid. I mean, the father falls protecting his wife and child, then, the mother falls protecting her child, and finally, Voldemort's attacks the child. Nothing seems unusual.

And it still doesn't tell us how everything happened.
