What do you mean by 'the freakish accident theory'? If you mean the one about Voldemort offering her a chance to live, then that's not convincing at all and I've always found it a weak attempt on the Queen's part to make Harry survive with his scar and all.

And I sort of hate how people in the series glorify her sacrifice because she was given a second chance. I'm sure that Molly, Narcissa or even Mrs. Crouch wouldn't have moved aside too. And I've got a theory that she didn't even listen to Voldemort's offer.
