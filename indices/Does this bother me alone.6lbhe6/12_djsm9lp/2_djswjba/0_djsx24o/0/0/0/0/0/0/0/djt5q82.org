Yes, the fact that she was willing to stand between Voldemort and her son is enough to cast the charm and being given the chance to live is ridiculous since she had already accepted death when she heard her husband's body hit the floor.

Someone actively trying to protect Harry is a bit far fetched in my opinion.

Rowling said that the Harrycrux was an accident and Voldemort wasn't trying to create one as he had already split his soul into seven parts: himself, the didadem, Hufflepuff's cup, Slytherin's locket, the ring, and Nagini. The act of murdering Harry's parents and the attempted murder of a guild rindered his soul unstable and that's how the Harrycrux was made.
