  What do you mean by 'the freakish accident theory'? If you mean the one about Voldemort offering her a chance to live, then that's not convincing at all and I've always found it a weak attempt on the Queen's part to make Harry survive with his scar and all.

I agree. Although I meant something a little less defined by freakish accident theory. The idea that the sacrifice alone was enough to save Harry. If you want, that something simply went wrong during Harry's attempted assassination, and Voldemort died instead.

  And I sort of hate how people in the series glorify her sacrifice because she was given a second chance. I'm sure that Molly, Narcissa or even Mrs. Crouch wouldn't have moved aside too. And I've got a theory that she didn't even listen to Voldemort's offer.

Absolutely. Simply willingly standing between the Dark Lord and his victim is already akin to sacrifice yourself to protect the victim. A lot of mothers would do that.\\
The only thing that could have an impact, and isn't usual, in this situation is the attempt of Voldemort to make a Horcrux out of Harry's killing. So maybe, he botched the ritual, or Lily's sacrifice worked because he was making a Horcrux. Maybe the fact that his soul was already splintered played a part.\\
Or someone actively protected Harry with a spell.
