My mistake, Nagini became a Horcrux after Voldemort murdered Bertha in GoF.

You're right, nothing seems unusual in the murder of the Potters.

You said that someone trying to actively protect Harry that night isn't far fetched. This raises a question, who was at Godric's Hollow that night aside from Lily and James (if Lily didn't cast the charm or James for that matter)?
