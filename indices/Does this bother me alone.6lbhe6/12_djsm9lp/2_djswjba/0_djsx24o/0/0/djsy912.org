  My point is that people make her out to be on the level of Merlin, Dumbledore, Peverell brother type of stuff.

It is excessive and ridiculous, yes, especially before age 21.

  They say that she knowingly and willingly cast the love charm and that is just wrong.

Why not? She's a skilled witch that happens to know an unusual and powerful spell, I don't see the issue. You don't need to be Merlin to perform obscure or powerful rituals. It is completely possible that when she learned about the prophecy, and that Voldemort was after her son, that she decided to try and find a way to protect Harry further, stumbles on this ritual or spell and decides to roll with it in a gambit. Or that she adapts or alter a preexisting ritual or spell to do so.

We know nothing of the magic involved, except that it's unusual and requires the sacrifice of your life. We don't know if it's difficult to perform, we don't know if it's that complex a piece of magic. And we don't even know the maximum extent of Lily's skill. Or Voldemort's or Dumbledore's or Merlin.

Now, as the spell isn't widely used, it is safe to assume that it is outside of the grasp of the average wizard, or simply really obscure. All it says us, however, is that Lily is no average witch. It doesn't make her the second coming of Dumbledore, let alone a Merlin.

If it were the case, she would give Voldemort the fight of his life, and potentially, Harry Potter would be a far shorter read ;)
