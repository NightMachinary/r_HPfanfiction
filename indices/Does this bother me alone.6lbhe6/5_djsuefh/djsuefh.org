I agree with lots of these, (especially 3, 4, and 7!) but number one makes a lot of sense in people's stories because otherwise, where are Lily's friends? She's said to be well-liked, right? And yet no one ever mentions who liked her, besides James. None of her friends ever get in touch with Harry. We never hear about a godmother.

If her best friend or friends are dead or out of commission, problem solved. Yeah, there isn't much evidence for it, but (other than what you mentioned about Alice) there's absolutely nothing against it either. And when it comes to Alice, the training program for Aurors isn't that long, because Tonks is a super young one. I often hear three years, but I don't know if that's canon or fanon. Anyway, say it's three years. Alice could easily have been just a year above Lily then. There are very few Aurors, we know that the Longbottoms were well-liked, not so sure about famous, but all the other Aurors would have known them because there just aren't that many Aurors.
