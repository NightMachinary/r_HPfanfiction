She may have had friends that are dead as there was a war going on but why do they have to necessarily be called Marlene McKinnon or Dorcas Meadowes (they're practically OCs and Mary Sues but people let it slip because they've got canon names).

The fandom has given them their own personalities and it has become quite popular. Marlene being this female version of Sirius + being dirty. Dorcas being this younger version of McGonagall is quite popular or being as innocent as a unicorn.

What I'm saying is why not make your own OC instead of giving her these names as you have to stick to these personalities because it has become very popular to the point of people considering it canon.
