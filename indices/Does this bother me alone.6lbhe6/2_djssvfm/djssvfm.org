A lot of these depend on the story. If the author can give me a believable scenario and characters, I will forgive most things.

Molly and Arthur are definitely quite a bit older than the Marauders and it bothers me when people make them the same age - Bill and Charlie had finished school and were well into careers by the time Harry and co started, even though James and Lily were only a few years shy of being teenage parents.
