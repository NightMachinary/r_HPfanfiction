It is indeed dumb. With regards to issue number 1 it is especially dumb that Hestia Jones or Emmeline Vance were Lily's best friend since Harry meets both and they don't mention it nor to they try to have a part in Harry's life. That being said, having nothing but OCs is often unpopular and these are canon names to fall back on and pretend they aren't OCs.

7) Is the one that grates on me most, especially when concerning the interactions between Remus and Lily. Just for a moment remember that Remus went into Hogwarts expecting no friends and being terrified people would learn his secret and hate him. James Potter was his friend, probably his first friend, a friend who included him and led the others to become animagi to help him. Lily is the girl who constantly puts James down and depresses him. While James Potter might have been a brat, all evidence suggests you couldn't ask for a better friend. Remus would likely take issue with the idea that James is terrible and might even avoid Lily because of it. Never forget how petty children can be. If Remus and Lily were as close in canon as in a lot of these awful fics then Remus would have been able to tell Harry lots more stories about his parents.

2) James Potter and Sirius Black hold the record for most detentions, it is likely that equated to losing a lot of house points but I think I remember reading that they earned as many as they lost meaning that they were likely brilliant.

Honestly most Lily and James stories are extremely formulaic and poor compared to several other pairings. I won't more but have to settle for trying them only when I'm too tired to actually think.
