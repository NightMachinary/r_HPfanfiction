I mean, it's likely that people /did/ tell Harry about his parents, but we don't really see it happen on-page in canon, save for a few small instances. I want to agree with you, definitely, because if we assume that Harry was left in the dark, then everyone who knew his parents but didn't talk about them are total bastards.

But characters like Vance or Jones being Lily's friends are unlikely due to the fact that Rowling would have made it much more important, or at least mentioned it in passing. As it is, Sirius and Remus are the only real links to Harry's parents that we know of, and making Vance/Jones/insert-actual-OC-here Lily's friends is, I agree with [[/u/herO_wraith][u/herO_wraith]], a bit of a ham-fisted attempt to use canon names for what are just OCs, like any character in fanfiction that is just a name and has no actual personality to work with ^{/cough/} ^{Daphne} ^{/cough/} ^{Greengrass} ^{/cough/.}
