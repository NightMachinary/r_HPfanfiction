I didn't defend Vance and Jones being Lily's friends, because in my headcanon they were years apart from each other. I don't think people told him a lot about his parents, mind, and they probably limited themselves tactfully to only the positive things, but he wasn't kept completely in the dark. I mean, they were quite willing to share photos of them with Hagrid.

War and possibly nepotism may also explain how someone only a year or two ahead of MWPP being able to become a well-respected auror by 1981, so we can't completely disregard Frank and Alice being around their age. (Just see how Tonks, being only 3-4 years out of Hogwarts by Voldemorts return, often gets glorified in fanfics.)

Daphne Greengrass doesn't count, since the fanfiction community has made her almost as real as - or even more so than - most canon characters.

Also, this is fanfiction - people can name their OC's whatever they want. I'm much more annoyed with the characters being copies of Harry's contemporaries, like Pandora spouting Quibbler stuff, Frank Longbottom being a clumsy herbology whiz, Lily being "super Hermione", etc. Well, that and Peter being Secretly Evil All Along.
