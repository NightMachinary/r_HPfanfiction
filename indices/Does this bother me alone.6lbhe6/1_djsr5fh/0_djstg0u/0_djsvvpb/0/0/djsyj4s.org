Fair enough, but people acting like the personas they've created for these background characters as canon will always irritate me, just as OP isn't happy with things like the often-assumed friendship between Remus and Lily because they're both apparently bookish. But I also agree on that last point. They should be distinctive and individual, not copies of characters we already know, because otherwise what's the point?

However, I'm gonna disagree with you on the Greengrass front.

No amount of "she's the /Ice Queen/ of Slytherin" will make her character real - or, as you say - more than the canon characters. She is and always will remain an OC and /nothing/ more, no matter what anyone does with her. This "persona" that gets transplanted from story to story doesn't equal an actual identity, and isn't helped by the fact that many stories with her in (from a massive variety of authors) give her about as much depth as shot glass, with actions that wildly differ from the /Ice Queen/ identity they slap onto her.

By all means I've seen /interesting/, /original/ versions of Daphne Greengrass that are engaging to read, but the fact that she's Daphne has nothing to do with that part. The same identity could be equally as engaging if it were transplanted onto some random person called Cleetus.
