Why do people assume that nobody tells Harry anything about his parents? Sirius and Remus may have had lots of moments with Harry "off screen" - nowhere in the book did anyone tell him that James Potter was a pureblood, but Harry knew it anyway (when trying to find out who the HBP was), suggesting that people did tell him about his parents.
