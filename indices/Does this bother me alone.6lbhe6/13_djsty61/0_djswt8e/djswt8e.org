1) We don't have any evidence that they weren't Lily's friends. Those girls are the only adult female who are relatively Lily's age. It's more easier to make them Lily's friend as to create OC.

--------------

There is certainly evidence, however weak, that leans towards them being older than Lily.

Dorcas: Voldemort killed her personally. Would Voldemort consider a teenager to be some serious threat? I really don't think so and I always imagined her as being older as to having more experience.

Emmeline: She would have talked to Harry about his mother had she been her best friend, I really see no reason not to.

Hestia: Same as Emmeline.

Alice: Mentioned in post.

Marlene: Now Marlene bugs me very hard. I recall that Lily was saddened by the McKinnons' death and not specifically Marlene's death and I don't think Moody would mention a teenage girl to represent a prestigious magical family and refer that they 'killed her whole family'. He would have mentioned the mother or an elder.

I've always imagined Marlene as the Molly Weasley of the original order for some reason. Then again, we don't have evidence to support either my theory or fanfiction writers' theory and it's al left to the imagination.

Besides, Lily wouldn't mention the death of her best friend and Sirius's love interest with some light gossip about Dumbledore.
