I'm playing the devil's advocate but... 1) We don't have any evidence that they weren't Lily's friends. Those girls are the only adult female who are relatively Lily's age. It's more easier to make them Lily's friend as to create OC. 2) I admit it also bother me those who describe James or Sirius as stupid. 3) The only reason why Peter was considered as friend is, in my opinion, because he was the fourth Marauder's member. In Snape's flashback we can see how Pettigrew is pathetic. 4) Never saw it in a fic. 5) Never saw him with blonde hair in a fic. 6) Lily is described as the smartest witch her generation. Besides she was pretty enough to make a boy fall in love with her for years even after countless rejection. 7) I admit it bother me too. He is suposed to be the most mature, not boring. 8) You probably never met girls. I know guys who change girlfriends very often just because they are good looking and funny. 9) She is the devil. She hated everything that had to do with magic because of her jealousy. You don't lock your nephew in a cupboard if you like your sister. 10) We don't enough about werewolves in cannon to see if it's true or not, so why not? 11) I consider him as Pettigrew, a pathetic idiot who follow others. 12) Bellatrix, Molly and Arthur should be graduated. Lucuis was a seventh year (Head boy, we see it in Snape's flashback). I'm not sure about Andromeda.
