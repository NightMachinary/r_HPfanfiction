Hermione had flaws. She doesn't fit all the criteria of a Mary Sue. A character being a a self insert doesn't automatically mean that it is wish fulfillment. Hermione certainly wasn't pretty - she was average at best. She was too anxious, panicky, narrow-minded, focused at facts and too sensitive. Besides she doesn't end up with the hero. She ends up with Ron.'

Lily is the closest thing to a Mary-Sue - if she isn't one that is. You're right, people don't speak ill of the dead so she might've been selfish or shallow or vain.
