You're not alone. But it's really hard to find a fic without most of those tropes.

Somehow sirius became a womanizer and james an idiot. Even though I don't like them I can recognize that they were as brilliant as harry in their time, perhaps even more.

Also snape had friends, evil friends, yet friends netherless.after all they were the bad influence that annoyed Lily.

I don't know where this tropes came from, yet they've been taken as canon by many.
