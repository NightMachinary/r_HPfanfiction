With regard to the issues you have about 'no canon evidence' I'm genuinely confused why that is would bother anyone. It's fanfiction, authors are at perfect liberty to flesh out characters however they want or change things in the canon - like would you also be bothered by non-canon pairings like Draco/Hermione or Harry/Luna? The whole point of fanfiction is to deviate from canon, tweak canon, or fill in the gaps.
