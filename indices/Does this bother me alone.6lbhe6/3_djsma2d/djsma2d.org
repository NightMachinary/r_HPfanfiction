I like to imagine Alice and Frank being Seventh years when the marauders were just starting Hogwarts. It works well with Canon.

Some stories do show the Slytherins boycotting Snape because of his mudblood friend and while it does seem odd as the Canon portrays it differently but it is a bit less annoying because it made a little sense at least.

I do like Marauder fanfictions with Snape as the main character because it differs from tropes like these. They do have the tendency to glorify Snape but as it is his younger years rather than the Professor we are familiar with, I can tolerate them. In linkffn(The Prince's Harem) Snape does have friends after the infamous Worst Memory and my favorite Marauder era fic linkffn(Time Turned back) does deal with the perfect Lily trope.
