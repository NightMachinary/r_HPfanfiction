Lucius graduated most likely in '72 (and was even mentioned as being a Prefect in Snape's first year), whereas Narcissa graduated in '73 or '74 (being born in 1955).

Bellatrix ('69 or '70), Molly ('68 or '69) and Arthur ('68) may have, but Andromeda could have stuck around until '72 for all we know, since her year of birth could be anything between 1952 and 1954.

Sirius did imply in GoF, however, that Lestranges' (a married couple), school years overlapped with Snape's.
