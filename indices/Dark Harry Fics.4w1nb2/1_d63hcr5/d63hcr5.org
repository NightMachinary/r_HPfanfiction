Sacrifice Arc by Lightning on the Wave is a huge EPIC, spanning 7 books, the story features a powerful and determined Harry, who is not afraid to use dark magic and allies with death eaters and dark creatures. The world building is phenomenal, with the best theory of dark and light magic I've encountered, the magnificent battle scenes are not to be missed.\\

Another one is A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold. Also feature a powerful Harry, in a much darker world setting than cannon. Going by cannon standards, the Harry here is definately a dark wizard, but remember, dark doesn't necessary mean evil.

Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war."
