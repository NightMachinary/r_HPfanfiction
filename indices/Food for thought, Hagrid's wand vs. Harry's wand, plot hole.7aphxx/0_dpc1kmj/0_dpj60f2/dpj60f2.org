It never said the wand was faulty, harry never tried to use it before he fixed it with the elder wand. And How was Hagrid able to get the wand back? if the ministry destroyed it, they would have disposed of it too, wouldn't you think? Or is this just another "Dumbledore" answer? It really seems that "Dumbledore did it" is Rowling's favorite go-to answer.... and Jahoan, I don't think it would have been transfigured. If I'm not mistaken, once you transfigure something, it loses all properties of the object it was before it was transfigured. My guess is that if "Dumbledore" is the answer, however he got the pieces back, he attached the umbrella parts to the tip of the wand, that way if someone did the "finite incantatem" spell, he would still be able to use his wand, it just wouldn't look like an umbrella any more.... I'm probably just rambling here..
