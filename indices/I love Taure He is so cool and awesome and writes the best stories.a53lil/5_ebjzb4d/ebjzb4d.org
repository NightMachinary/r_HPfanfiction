I'm here for an appreciation post. The One He Feared is one of my favorites and I'm excited about Victoria Potter. I'm very impressed by how realistic of a preteen girl Victoria is, especially written by a guy. I had to double check because she's so much better written than pretty much all preteen girl fanfic characters regardless of the author's gender. (And no offense, but a lot of male writers don't know what to do with an eleven year old girl.)
