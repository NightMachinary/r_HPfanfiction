I had this idea ish for a fic myself. My take on it is that he's slowly becoming more and more competant by virtue of having to deal with the concequences of his actions, stuck continuously going back in time and repeating Harry's 5th year until he's succeeded in preventing Voldemort from getting a foothold in the country. Problem is, that the deck is already rigged against Fudge to an absurd degree, mainly due to his own actions ever since he arrested Sirius Black.

My end for it would be Fudge going back further, breaking the time travel device in the process, and ending up just before arresting Sirius. That way he can stop the rot settling into the ministry in the first place.
