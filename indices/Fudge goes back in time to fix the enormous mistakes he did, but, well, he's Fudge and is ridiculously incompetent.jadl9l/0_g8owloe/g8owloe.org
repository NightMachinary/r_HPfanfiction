In the first war, when Voldemort returned, Fudge immediately went to a war footing. Because of this, Voldemort saw no need to hide. Voldemort's sudden violence and Fudge's incompetence lead to many lives being lost. Fudge decided to go back in time to fix everything.

Having gone back in time, he decided to cover-up Voldemort return this time, to avoid the blood-shed that Voldemort would do. I think we all know how this turned out.
