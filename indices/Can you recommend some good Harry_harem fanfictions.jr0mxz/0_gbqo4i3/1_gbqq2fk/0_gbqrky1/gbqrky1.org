Someone beat me to the rune stone path. I've never read all 50 chapters, and honestly it isn't worth it. But it's fun for a while. The biggest problem with pretty much all Harem fics is that the author never knows how to end it, so you get these 1 million words, 70 chapter long epics that could be cut down to 10 chapters of smut.

None of these are amazing; but they kept me entertained for a while. linkffn(5790760) linkffn(6193196)
