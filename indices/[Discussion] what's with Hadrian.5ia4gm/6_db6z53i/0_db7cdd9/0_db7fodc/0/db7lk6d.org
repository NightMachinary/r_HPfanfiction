yeah see, that's my biggest issue with fics. The line between fanon and canon has gotten so blurred over the past couple of years by Pottermore and Cursed Child that it's hard to tell where it lies anymore.

At this point for the purposes of my own entertainment and enjoyment I've just decided on thoroughly ignoring anything touted as canon past the original 7 books and 8 movies. JKR's pottermore writings and the cursed child have just screwed the pooch for me in terms of what's canon to the point where I have to laugh at it and say she'd have been better off not writing them.

A huge part of why I got into Harry Potter fanfiction in the first place is because it was always such an open world to put your own ideas into, and that it had a culture all its own outside of the books and movies. The pottermore writings and especially cursed child have just taken so much of that open world away for me that I have to ignore them completely if I still want to enjoy the world of Harry Potter. IMO, JKR screwed the pooch big time and really shouldn't have written pottermore or signed off on cursed child.
