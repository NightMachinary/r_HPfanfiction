I hereby claim that, if I ever end up writing a Harry Potter fic where James Potter's parents appear, they will almost certainly be Dorea Black and Charlus Potter. (Though my current fanfic plans don't have anything to do with them at all - I'm more likely to write about Lily's family. Which, IIRC, doesn't yet have much canon on it, fortunately.)

Mind you, after /Cursed Child/, it's hard to properly feel what's canon at all. That story pretty much just took a bunch of bad fanfic cliches and ran with it. Meanwhile, many of the /good/ fanfic cliches were pounded into the ground (it was pretty much accepted fanon that North America is really progressive regarding Muggles and non-pureblood wizards, until the No-Maj article came out a few months ago, explaining that it's actually somehow even worse than Britain).
