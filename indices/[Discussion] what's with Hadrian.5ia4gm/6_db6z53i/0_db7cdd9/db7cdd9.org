For the record, unless they were written within the past calendar year, most fanfics when referencing the father of James Potter ignore the whole Fleamont thing because it simply didn't exist at the time the story was written.

Fanon has held for years now that the parents of James Potter were Charlus/Charles Potter and Dorea Potter nee Black.

Also there's the point that Fleamont came from Pottermore, which a lot of fans (myself included) don't view as canon and choose to ignore.
