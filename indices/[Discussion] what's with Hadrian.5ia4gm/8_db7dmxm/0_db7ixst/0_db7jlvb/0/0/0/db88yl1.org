Ginevra is the Italian form of Guinevere, so all the consonants are in the same order, only the vowels are different. Because all the Weasleys have English royalty names.

Ginerva is from people who think it's like Minerva but with a G, but that it not a name that actually exists. It's one of my pet peeves.
