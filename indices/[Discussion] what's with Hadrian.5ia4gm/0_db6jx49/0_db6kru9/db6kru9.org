I agree that fanfiction is great with it's ability to let people change characters into what or who they want but I feel that the name change is completely unnecessary and it's becoming very common for people to put that as his full name that it just seems to be there with no after thought, which means that people are almost taking it as canon: the sky is blue, Harry's name in fanfiction is Hadrian, and Dumbledore should have said it calmly.
