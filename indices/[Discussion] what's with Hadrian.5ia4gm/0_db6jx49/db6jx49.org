In a world where names like Lucius, Nymphadora, Sirius, etc. exist.. Harry seems kind of plain. It's a fantasy novel. If you want our character to BE epic then they need an epic name. In cannon Harry fits because to be honest Harry is very plain and average. One of my favorite things about fanfiction is its ability to truly change who Harry IS. And still feel honest enough to the source.

Edit for spelling. On mobile.
