Harry is as Petunia once described it, a nasty common name. When renaming to Hadrian they are either trying to add class for pureblood related stories. Alternatively I have seen some where they are trying to work around the ridiculousness of magical contracts like those of the goblet of fire by giving him a "true" name which people wouldn't know so they couldn't bind him. In this later case its a plot device and the first Harry related name they think of perhaps because of the number of the first type.
