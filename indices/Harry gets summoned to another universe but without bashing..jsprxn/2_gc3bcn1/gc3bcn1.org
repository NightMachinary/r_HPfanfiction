I just shared this rec on another post, but it kinda fits here, too. This epic-length series might fit the bill?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/481666][Harry Potter and the Road Not Taken]] may be something like what you're looking for. I'd start with The Boy with Kaleidoscope Eyes, but the prequel, West of the Moon, East of the Sun, sets up some of the cross-dimensional stuff and could be read first, too.
