ugh. the name escapes me and I can't get to ff.net on this computer, but he gets zapped to another universe (i /think/ its the one where resisting veritaserum breaks some great Laws of Magic or somesuch [dont worry, thats the only really "huh?" thing about this one]), changes his name to Chris Collins because his parents are alive and he has siblings. While he does know the odd Dark spell For Reasons, he can't really be considered dark (he's also quite snarky, which...actually, i think was a fad at the time).\\
