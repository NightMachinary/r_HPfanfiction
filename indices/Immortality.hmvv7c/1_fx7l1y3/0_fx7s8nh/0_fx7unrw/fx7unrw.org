Ah, okay. Cool, then yeah, I'm with Alouda and Wassa on this one. People'll probably be at least irritated if you give him any romance stuff (though some may read it anyway, if Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is any indication), but they'll probably be okay with an immortal always-child otherwise.
