There's lots of lengthy slash stories without smut, though most tend to have at least one sex scene, however brief. I personally don't mind them. What I hate is when there's a sex scene every other chapter (sometimes every single chapter). That's when I lose interest (unless the fic is otherwise excellent, in which case I'll skim over the smut).

There's nothing wrong wish sex scenes. Slash authors tend to overdo it, though. Like, I enjoy a good sex scene as much as the next person, but there's only so many ways you can write two (or more) people screwing without it getting boring.
