More ranty stuff:

Screw harry/many, harem fics are all horrible. And its really annoying if you read a good romantic story, build up is great and finally the 2 get together - only for harry to start banging other girls a few pages later, and his main pairing obviously is super ok with it. I dont even like this in smut, but in "normal" fics this is just atrocious.

Same if theres to much sex in the story, if you are writing a proper story lemons are totally not needed. If theres something very important happening in between - sure, write a sex scene. But if its just porn for the sake of porn its horrible.

Also, but this is quite personal, i hate slytherin!Harry who is super nice, befriends hermione and neville and is just an awesome guy who is liked by everyone. It doesnt fit at all.
