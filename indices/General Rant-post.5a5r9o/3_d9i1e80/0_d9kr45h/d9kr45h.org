Yah, I hate harem fics, too. Poly is fine, but harems put me off.

Smut, as with anything else, should either progress the story or reveal something about/develop the characters. It should also be used sparingly, so as not to become trite. That's just my opinion, of course.

Also, I agree with you on the whole Slytherin!Harry thing. He doesn't have to be bad/evil or anything, but I always find it odd when he's portrayed as this giant teddy bear who wants to help everyone.
