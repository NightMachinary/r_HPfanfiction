The white snowy owl of Harry Potter must be named Hedwig, no exceptions.

I'm sure that is a cosmic law with some severe punishment in the afterlife for those who break it.

No, but honestly, if I read "snowy owl" and that animal isn't named Hedwig it feels weird to me. I rather Harry gets a different breed of owl, or a different pet altogether, but that is such a small detail... I can't bring myself to care overly much in all honesty.
