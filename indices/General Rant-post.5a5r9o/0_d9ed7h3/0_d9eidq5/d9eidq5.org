To be fair, though, in some stories it really doesn't make sense for her to be called that way; heck, I remember once trying to read a story in which there happened to be a moment when Lucius bought Harry an owl and /he/ named her “Hedwig” (suffice to say, the fic ended up being rubbish later, but yeah, why the heck would Lucius use that name?). But no, gotta have the stations of the canon.

It's one of the few compliants from this post I can somewhat agree with. But it's to fanfic authors rather than to us, so I can but shrug.
