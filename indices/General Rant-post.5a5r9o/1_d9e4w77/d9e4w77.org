What bewilders me is why almost all the fics where Harry has some kind of creature blood (whether potion accident, animagus traits, inherited by a parent) or curse(vampire,werewolf) that inevitably means he needs to find a fucking MALE mate (to do what exactly!? ಠ_ಠ MPREG! (╬ ಠ益ಠ) Sure that makes sense, ABSOLUTELY NOT!) and be sub/dom (Seriously?! What happened to your human mind and free will? Did you have any in the first place at all?). Are these some kinky fantasies or for 'special' people, because certainly aren't good for plot building.

I mean come on! Magical being! Awesome racial traits like any fantasy game! You are an high elf with high reflexes, agility, grace, sight. There is a culture hidden from the magical world in its own realm with its own magic, traditions, weapons, armor.

But unfortunately you turn out to be submissive male and need 100 mates to fuck you in the a** and chase after you like some kind of mindless animals. And for some reason you are OK with that and like it because the transformation has stripped you from any rational though. Oh and that world that your race belongs to, too bad but it's not there! Your racial traits? Congratulations, you never need to use them, because your mate will do everything for you and you are his weak submissive *****!

Why can't you concentrate on the cool part of being a vampire or werewolf?! Why does having creature blood and having some awesome animal features need to mean you are a furry? Why does it need to be some kind of sick perversion of a romance where there is no choice and instinctual 'attraction' (more like free will destroying obsession) rules everything, in fact why does it even need to be an obligatory romance in the first place? Why the hell are male Harry and Malfoy/Snape/Zabini/Greyback(WTF?!Why?! T_T) mates?! It doesn't make any sense at all! Attraction based on instinct should be towards the opposite gender unless you are a snail hybrid or something, and it certainly won't be towards Harry's most hated people.

But that rant is going nowhere. There are usually warnings (thankfully!) and I can skip those fics.

What ticks me off is that fanficion is being flooded with low quality slash (trash!) that doesn't make any rational sense plot wise and that almost all creature blood fics have people of the same gender paired up, or have an obligatory pairing at all. Can't the magical world scorn you for your traits /hum/hum* Dolores /cough/.

I just want more supernatural magical beings that act like their lore expects them to. Some diversity in races that doesn't start with overly helpful goblins (house elfs) and end in gay vampires. Stop ruining my childhood T_T. I've lost almost all respect for vampire!elf!werewolf!Harry.

OK this was a pointless rant. But I've vented and I guess you're not alone? I usually don't care if the fic is slash, but when everything revolves around that and it doesn't make any sense I just can't stomach it. Usually if the story has good enough rational plot I'm fine with it as long as it isn't a central point to the story.
