  Why are there endless trigger warning everywhere, yet at least 50% of slash stories seem to just forget to mention that suddenly harry gets banged by some dude halfway through the story, with no reason at all plot wise. Its just there for the sake of itself. 50000 words read and having to stop halfway through is just infuriating.

You know, I've been reading fanfiction for over a decade and I've never, ever come across a fic with surprise!slash or surprise!sex. Like, ever. In fact, most authors seem to go out of their way to warn for potential/eventual slash just so they won't get flak from people who don't like it.

Now, het? Het is an entirely different story. I can't even count the number of fics I've read that turned out to be het fics with little to no warning from the author. I like het, don't get me wrong, and I read a lot of it, but I'm really picky about the het ships I like/fics I read and I hate when it's sprung on me out of nowhere, which /always happens./ And god forbid you message the author to ask why they didn't warn for het romance at the beginning of the fic (or at least as soon as they realized the fic was heading in that direction). Let a slash author pull a stunt like that and they'd find themselves the target of a flame war.

A plotty 100k fic that has hints of slash gets slapped with a "BEWARE OF GAY!" warning label by everyone, but a plotty 100k fic that has explicit het is considered gen and anyone who complains about it is scoffed at for being "too sensitive."
