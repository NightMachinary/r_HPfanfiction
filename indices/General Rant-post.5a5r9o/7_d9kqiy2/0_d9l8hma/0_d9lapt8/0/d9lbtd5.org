No, being gay is not "normal" it is accepted, sure. But just by how many people are gay and by how many people are hetero, gay people by their very nature are a minority.

The fact that slash does require a warning and hetero stuff doesnt basicely just proves my point.

And as this is my rant post (online) gays can just go off and die somewhere as they ruin my reading pleasure. I dont like reading slash, many people dont like reading slash. Its just is like that, call it what you want.
