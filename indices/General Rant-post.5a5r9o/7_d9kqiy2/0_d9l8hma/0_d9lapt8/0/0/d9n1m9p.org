One in every twelve people have asthma. Asians only make up 5.6% of the American population. According to you, asthma and Asians apparently aren't normal, either. Just freak anomalies, being minorities and all.

  The fact that slash does require a warning and hetero stuff doesnt basicely just proves my point.

It proves the point that most people are homophobic? That heteronormative idealism is still unfortunately rampant? Why yes, it does.

  And as this is my rant post (online) gays can just go off and die somewhere as they ruin my reading pleasure. I dont like reading slash, many people dont like reading slash. Its just is like that, call it what you want.

"Online gays." I'm not sure if you're referring to real people who are apparently only gay online (wtf) or fictional characters/couples. Either way, you're being gross as hell. I'm actually praying that you're a sheltered teenager who doesn't know any better because the alternative is just really effing sad.

Respond if you want, but I sure as hell won't be reading any more of your ignorant and grossly homophobic drivel.
