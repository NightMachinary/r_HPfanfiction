Yikes, what kind of fics are you stumbling across? That sounds horrid. Yeah, everyone's got the right to rant. I'm not seeing as many slash fics as you seem to be finding, so I dunno.

One thing I could suggest that you may have already done is to find the authors that you like and then check out the stories that /they/ have favorited. Usually, that opens up a few other authors I may not have found before and I can keep going on and on like that for a while. Also, AO3's filtering and tagging system is by far better than FFN's when it comes to this, so maybe play around with that.

But I know that you came to rant, not ask for advice so I'll stop there. ^{-^{;;}}
