So? What does that have to do with anything, people generally dont like to read slash ro stuff about gay protagonists in general.

Take this subreddit and look at the poll at the pront page, its about as PC as it gets, people are extremely left on the political spectrum, not relgious or in other ways "backwards" thinking - yet even here most people dont want to read slash.

Its the 1.5-10% of gay people and teengaged girls wanting yaio.

And since as stated before, this is just a rant post and all the slash is pissing me off. I whish it didnt exist. Dont know what your problem is with that standpoint.
