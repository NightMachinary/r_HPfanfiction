  I dont want to read about gay couples, i just dont - most people dont. In "normal" literature that is pretty much accepted and thus 99% of books released are heterosexual or nothing at all. I dont mind it being there but so many interesting reads are ruined for me by this.

If that were true then slash wouldn't be so rampant in fandom, don't you think? Frankly, I think the reason there's so much slash in fandom is because there's not enough queer romance being published--not because it isn't what people want, but because it's still seen as "high-risk" and "niche-writing," and because there's still a stigma attached. It has nothing to do with the fact that people don't want to read about it. I mean, the most popular romance fic on AO3 is a slash fic with over 529,699 unique hits. That's over half a million hits. That's a lot of people.

I think it speaks for itself that most fandoms are dominated by slash pairings, don't you?
