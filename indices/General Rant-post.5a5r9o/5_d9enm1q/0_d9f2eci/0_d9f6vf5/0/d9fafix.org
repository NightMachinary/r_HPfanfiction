Which is why i made a rantpost about it, if people like gay stuff - go ahead and like it. Im not telling people not to write slash, but now and then i want to be angry about it being everywhere.

But deep down inside me when after 200k words old voldemort starts going down on 12 year old harry without a warning anywhere i just want to take the author and punch him into the fact and tell him to be a disgusting fuck elsewhere.

I dont want to read about gay couples, i just dont - most people dont. In "normal" literature that is pretty much accepted and thus 99% of books released are heterosexual or nothing at all. I dont mind it being there but so many interesting reads are ruined for me by this.

I like (usually horrible) wrong bwl stories, dont know why but i do, but whenever anyone ask for them you get saving connor linked, every single time. And it looks like an amazing read, dark but good harry, its long, its interesting - and its full of HP/DM and thus i just get angry when i see it.

This doesnt transfer into irl, i have nothing against gay couples outside of the internet, but here it makes me mad. And thus i made a rantpost about it. Fuck slash, fuck it with a stick.
