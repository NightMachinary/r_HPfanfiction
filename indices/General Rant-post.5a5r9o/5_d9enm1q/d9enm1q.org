YKINMKBYKIOK, basically.

I understand what you mean, there are a LOT of fics out there that aren't my cup of tea. Thing is, no one is writing specifically for me, so that's kind of inevitable. I tend to find an author I like, then I check out the fics that /they/ bookmark because I can assume we have some of the same tastes. That always opens up a few new stories I didn't know about.

Also, be a bit more open to tropes. I don't like Lord Potter either, but if I find a fic that features that I might stick with it because it has some other plot element that I do like. I have a few tropes that I just refuse to deal with whatsoever (de-aged fics fall under this), but I've learned to be flexible with some of the others.
