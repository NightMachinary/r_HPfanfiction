A Cruel & Beautiful World by Lena Phoria. I'm not sure if it's readily available online anymore, but if you can find it - it's amazing. Voldy won, Harry's in hiding but the DA/resistance are still active. Hermione was captured and enslaved, but escapes. Dramione.

Manacled by Sen Lin Yu Starts post-war, Voldy won. Hermione had been kept in sound & light deprived isolation as a prisoner, but is put into a ‘repopulation' program (inspired by Handmaids Tale) and given to Draco. Awesome story that has about 20 chapters of ‘flashbacks' in the middle, which are from during the war and explain what happens to each character, relationships, capture etc. Its a beautifully written piece. Flashbacks are my favourite part :)
