Bro. You do not know what a GAAS game is.

Assassin's Creed you could consider a GAAS but even that is tenuous, all the quest and content updates are free and the microtransactions are a very tiny part of the game that give you cosmetics and xp skips, but they're not really incentivized at all.

MGSV and Shadow of War are just not Games as a service at all, shadow of war had completely useless microtransactions that were removed from the game entirely after launch and there are no regular updates like a GAAS game, just two expansions.

Hogwarts Legacy is being developed by Avalanche who haven't made a GAAS game ever, maybe they're starting now but there's nothing to indicate it whatsoever.
