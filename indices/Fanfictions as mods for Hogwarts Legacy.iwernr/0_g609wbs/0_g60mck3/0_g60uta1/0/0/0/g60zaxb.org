I can't speak for the last three games, since I haven't played them, but the new God of War game is definitely not a game as a service.

Games as a service are games that have regular monetized content updates. God of War 4 doesn't have any paid dlc or microtransactions.

God of War 4 did introduce rpg mechanics but that doesn't make it a GaaS.
