I think there will be very little chance of modding being catered to in a game this costly, from this dev team or publisher. GAAS seems to be the way these larger IP based games are headed and making your own stuff directly inhibits the publisher's ability to sell that same stuff to you.

I can still be hopeful and indeed a love the idea, I just don't see it happening.
