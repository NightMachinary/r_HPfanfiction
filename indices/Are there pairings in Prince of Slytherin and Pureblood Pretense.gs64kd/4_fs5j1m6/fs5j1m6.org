Pureblood Pretense has a whole bunch of potential options for romance, but it hasn't gotten there yet. I don't doubt there eventually will be, as it's a pretty big part of the source material (Song of the Lioness). But also, remember the main character is barely fifteen. There's still room and time to grow into it.
