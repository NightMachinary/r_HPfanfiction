Have you browsed Northumbian's works?

linkffn(8465313) is one of my favourite stories. Its really rather mundane but its just nice. It doesn't try to set the world alight nor does it risk cutting itself on its own edginess like so many other fics do, its just really nice. That being said, the author has written almost 90 stories which are actually one larger collective work. Every story happens within the same universe which, until recently was tied as closely to canon as possible. You might need to read some of the other stories to understand the characters mentioned in this one. Also, the fics will be listed in update date not in the order they are intended to be read. The author's profile page has further details on this.
