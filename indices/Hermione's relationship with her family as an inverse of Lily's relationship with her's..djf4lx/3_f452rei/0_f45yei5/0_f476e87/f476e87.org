You've got a point. I also wonder like....idk, I don't remember if the books say anything but did they know what Hermione was up to? I mean if I were a parent, and my child was nearly getting killed every school year, I'd probably try my best to keep her home. But you know they're Muggles so....it'd probably be easy to hide things. If Hermione felt like she was always lying to her parents about her safety, maybe that's why she would always be at the Weasleys, a family who understood everything that was going on.

I'm sure she still cared though bc she wiped their memories before leaving then came back. Just a weird relationship. And if my child cut our ski trip short, I'd be sad because I don't see that child often.
