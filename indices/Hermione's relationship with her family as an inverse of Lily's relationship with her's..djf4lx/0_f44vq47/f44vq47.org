From what little is shown of the Granger parents in canon, their unease with the magical world isn't due to the magic, but the people who live there, and how they treat muggles. I think they would be accepting of Hermione as a witch, but wary of other witches and wizards, since their first exposure to them didn't leave good impressions, and no one tried to correct or explain anything. Including Hermione, once she learned about the two sides of the last war, and the prejudice against anyone who didn't qualify as being a "proper wizard".

At Gringott's. Assaulted by an overly pushy Arthur Weasley who treats them like zoo animals. And Hermione never does introduce anyone.

  "So you don't think I'm a match for Lucius Malfoy?" said Mr Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione's parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, *waiting for Hermione to introduce them.*

  "But you're Muggles!" said Mr Weasley delightedly. "We must have a drink! What's that you've got there? Oh, you're changing Muggle money. Molly, look!" He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr Granger's hand.

At Flourish and Blott's. Watching Arthur and Lucius (two grown men) get into a fistfight and almost stampede the store.

  Mrs Weasley was shrieking, "No, Arthur, no!"; the crowd stampeded backwards, knocking more shelves over; "Gentlemen, please---please!' cried the assistant and then, louder than all, â€˜Break it up, there, gents, break it up---"

  The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid's waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, *the Grangers shaking with fright* and Mrs Weasley beside herself with fury. "A fine example to set to your children... brawling in public... what Gilderoy Lockhart must've thought..."

Then Mr. Weasley is pushy again, and no one explains to them what the fight was about.

  They said goodbye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side. Mr Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs Weasley's face.

It'd say that the rocky relationship between Hermione and her family is not the Grangers' fault. They're parents, they made an attempt for Hermione, but it's hard to involve themselves in Hermione's life when Hermione is the one who goes to boarding school and skips out on them on the holidays post GoF.
