Hermione chose a cat over an owl, so if she did use the school owls to deliver letters to her parents, the Grangers would only be able to write a reply if the owl stayed in their house, instead of flying off straight away as messenger owls do.

So it was on Hermione to keep up communications with her parents. It's not like they could call her on the phone to ask how she was doing at school.
