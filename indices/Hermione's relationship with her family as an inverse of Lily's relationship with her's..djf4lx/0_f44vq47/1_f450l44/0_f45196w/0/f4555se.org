Oh I know it was on her that she didn't have communication. Even if she used Hedwig or a school owl, I'm guessing she wouldn't write much, as most of her attention would be taken up by the crazy events that were happening. I'd think it would be hard to write about mundane things after being cornered by a troll and petrified by a basilisk. Also, a lack of communication for a months without explanation would have damaged their relationship even more. I really doubt she told them about the insanity of Hogwarts.
