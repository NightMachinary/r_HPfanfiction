It's a Harry goes back in time and raises Tom fic, and definitely one of the better ones. Incomplete and ongoing, but the updates aren't regular. It's also one of the few that addresses the Grindelwald/Elder Wand situation in-depth, with a separate interpretation from the Fantastic Beasts movies. Overall, really well-written, really interesting plot, while also discussing the muggle side of WW2 in the background. It's tagged Tomarry, but it's gen so far.
