I've seen a lot of fics that draw on this by positing that a lot of Muggleborns are from lines of wizards and squibs. One (Royal Ward) has a hilarious scene where the muggleborn finds out he's actually related to the Malfoys.

(This isn't so bad, as in this fic, the Malfoys aren't as bad as they are in canon.)
