  But Lilly's parents were muggles, not squibs, so where did she get her magic?

This interview essentially made it so that Squib is defined by having magical ancestors but having no ability to cast magic.

This in effect makes either (or both) of Lily's parents a squib.

Honestly, in the grand scheme of things, this is like Schrodinger's box. Every non-magical person is both a squib AND muggle at the same time. Until you "open the box" by checking their ancestry.
