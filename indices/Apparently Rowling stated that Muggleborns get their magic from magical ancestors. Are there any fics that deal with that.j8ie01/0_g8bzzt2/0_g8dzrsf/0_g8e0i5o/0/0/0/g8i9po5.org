I know Harry's name is just Harry. I was just saying that some people (in fanfiction) want to make Harry sound all pureblood-y with titles and so they lengthen his name to Harrison or Hadrian. That doesn't mean I like it. I was just stating that.

I know that Potter-Black was fanon, I never said that it wasn't. And Sirius named Harry his heir, meaning that he gained the Black fortune. Sure, he may not be called "Potter-Black" because hyphenating isn't a thing with adoptions, but you can play around with it. And I don't really care about how titles work in real life (though I do try to stick close to it if I write fanfiction about it), but you could just say that Titles work differently in the wizarding world.

People who write about fanon know that it may not actually work that way. But guess what, it's fanon and fanfiction. We make it work. Just because you personally dislike Lordships, that doesn't meant that other people don't. I personally love it if it's done well enough, or even if it's cliche. It's a guilty pleasure of mine.

And no wories about sounding condescending, I'm sure I sounded a bit condescending in this comment and I apologize for that. I just wanted to state that I know that Lordships and the Marauders and the hyphenated names are fanon. I know the difference between fanon and canon most of the time.
