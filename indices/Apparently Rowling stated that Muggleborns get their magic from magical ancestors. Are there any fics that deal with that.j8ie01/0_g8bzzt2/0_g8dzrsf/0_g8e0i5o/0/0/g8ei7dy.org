His name is Harry, not Harrison or a shortened form for Harrison. Harry. Son of James and Lily, not Jamificus or Lilian.

Potter-Black is fanon, and bad fanon at that. Being a godfather doesn't always mean legal adoption, just guardianship, and even if he were adopted by Sirius, it's unlikely the name would be changed or hyphenated unless it were specifically requested and agreed to by both parties (and that'd be an in-story development, not something automatic by law or presumed by culture). Being an heir for money and property doesn't equal inheriting a name, too. If Titles were a thing, then yeah (we see precedence of this in real-life with the peerage), but they're not. It's just overused, terrible fanon that needs to be burned on the whole.

The Queen could drop dead after naming me her heir over her biological family, but I wouldn't be called "Blah Blah Windsor" or "Blah Blah Lastname-Windsor".

Peverell? Dead name from the past, and it ties back into much overused fanon "wizarding nobility". A historical curiosity and part of the background plot, nothing more.

Lordships? Again, bad fanon. There are no wizarding lordships or nobility outside of tropey fanon. The only canon "evidence" was one line on a tapestry from an inbred, incest-obsessed crazy family that came off as being more egotistic than an indication of being a "noble house".

Same deal with the "Marauders": it was called the "Marauder's Map", not the "Marauders' Map". As in a reference to their little friendship group's activities (no, not focused on 'pranking', but I have no doubt they enjoyed doing jokes on people). The latter implies the they called themselves the Marauders, as per fanon.

As for the Harry/Tom thing... eh, whatever floats your boat, I guess, but Gaunt and Slytherin "titles"? Fanon. Voldemort claims to be (and is) of Slytherin's (through Gaunt) lineage, but claiming the name? smh

I apologize if I'm being a bit condescending, but when people presume (bad) fanon is canon, it makes me wince on a deep level.
