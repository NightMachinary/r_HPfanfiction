Lol. I do hate it when Harry has all of these titles and stuff usually, but I don't mind Harry being called Harry (or Harrison if you wanna make it sound all pureblood-y) Potter-Black. It just makes sense that he inherits the Black name and forture. The Peverell title adds onto that, as well, if you want to add an extra thing. Or you could say the name was (forget the word) added into the Potter name so that's how the Potter's got their lordship or whatever? Then you can add Gryffindor on if you're doing a Founders thing or are shipping Harry with Tom who takes up the Gaunt and Slytherin titles.
