The Secret Life of Epsilon Brown has them mostly act like children - running out to the grounds to play footie, how those little green army men are superior for waging war to magical toys for 11 year old boy reasons, etc. He's a bit more mature than most for reasons that are explained, but it's literally the only fic I've seen with pickup football games, so it wins points for that. Crossover with Men in Black.
