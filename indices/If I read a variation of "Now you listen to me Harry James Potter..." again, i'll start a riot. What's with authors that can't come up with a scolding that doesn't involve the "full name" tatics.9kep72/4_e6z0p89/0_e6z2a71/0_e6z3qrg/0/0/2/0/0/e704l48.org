  doesn't do very well when the solution requires creativity and intuition rather than logic
#+end_quote

90% of the solutions between Harry, Ron and Hermione in the stories are solved by Hermione. Many of which are creative and intuitive. Shit, some of them are /inventions/, like the coin used in the DA.

  She also has a hard time listening to other people's point of views - the SPEW thing showed cultural insensitivity as she refused to acknowledge or believe what the house elves themselves and whole lot of other people were telling her.

"The SPEW [sic] thing" is entirely deconstructed /only/ in fanon. Canonically we have no reason to think that /being against slavery/ is in any way the incorrect solution. "House Elves rely on wizard magic" or any of the other weird excuses Death Eater / Conservative Wizard apologists in fanfiction are /purely/ fanon.

In the actual books there's no reason to think that Hermione fighting against slavery was a bad thing. The only real arguments posed against Hermione's point of view was from Ron himself, in which he mentions that they're just happy doing what they're doing. But as a group of creatures who we saw treated poorly and having their agency taken away, we have absolutely no way of knowing what they'd actually think.
