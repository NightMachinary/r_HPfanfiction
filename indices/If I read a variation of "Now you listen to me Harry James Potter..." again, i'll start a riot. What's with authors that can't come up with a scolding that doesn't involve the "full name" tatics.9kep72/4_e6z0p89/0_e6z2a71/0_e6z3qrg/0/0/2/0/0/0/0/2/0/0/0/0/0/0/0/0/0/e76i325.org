Okay, fair enough. You're taking it a step further, I can respect that. So this debate was originally about whether or not she was /clever/, though the OP was conceding that she was intelligent.

Your furthering the debate by creating the addendum that not only is she /not clever/ but she's also /not intelligent/. That's fine with me, I don't mind this.

To clarify, though, are you arguing that she isn't intelligent or that she /is/ dumb? It's a very important distinction and I don't want to misrepresent your position.
