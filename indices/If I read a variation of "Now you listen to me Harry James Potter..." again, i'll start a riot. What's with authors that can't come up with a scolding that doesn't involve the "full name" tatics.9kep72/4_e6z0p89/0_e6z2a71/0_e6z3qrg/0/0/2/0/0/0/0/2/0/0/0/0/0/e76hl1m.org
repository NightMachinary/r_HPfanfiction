  Very well, you want to talk about things she does when she isn't under pressure

lol w0t? I never said that at all. YOU started applying that requirement, not me. I just pointed out that you did it. How could you possibly determine that I'm suddenly wanting to shift the entire debate? That's ridiculous.

You're attacking an argument that I'm not making. I believe that's called the strawman fallacy?

I've never once said she was perfect. I've never once claimed she's not made mistakes or made dumb decisions. That's an argument /you've/ decided to create because it's actually a winnable debate.

Stop for a moment, go back, and refute any of the /actual/ arguments I've made. Please.

EDIT: I just realized you're also attacking me, personally. Ad hominem, as well? C'mon, man.

  I hope your goddess will forgive me.

Now you're applying a value to me that you think I have. Just because I think Hermione is /CLEVER/ and /INTELLIGENT/, the only two things I've claimed in this entire comment thread, suddenly she's my /"Goddess"/? Hermione isn't even my favorite character, dude. Attack my ACTUAL ARGUMENTS LOL
