  I already know that she isn't perfect. My point is that she isn't smart.

  To be honest, if I wasn't extremely biased against Hermione I could admit that she is cleverish.

I'm, like, super confused. What, exactly, are you attempting to debate? I've already listed a shit ton of examples of Hermione being clever from all of the books, of things off the top of my head. So far your only counter seems to be, like, 2 examples of bad ideas or, at least, 2 examples of ideas that backfired.
