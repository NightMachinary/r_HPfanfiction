Other than Dobby, all the house-elves we met don't want to be free, and adults (I think she tried talking to Remus amongst others?) including Hagrid were advising her to drop it. As for the coin, she didn't invent it, she based it off the dark mark and then researched the spell work unlike Snape who came up with new spells while he was about her age. Harry is intuitive in solving mysteries, but Hermione for the most part a​ct​s as the researcher of the group.\\
Edit: Where do you get 90% from? The solutions she has are from research like in the second book where she logically researches magical creatures to find the basilisk.
