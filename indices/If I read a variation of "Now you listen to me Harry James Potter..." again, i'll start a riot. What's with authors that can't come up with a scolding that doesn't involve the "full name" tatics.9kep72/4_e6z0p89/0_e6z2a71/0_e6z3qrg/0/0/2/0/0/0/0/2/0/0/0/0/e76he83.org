Very well, you want to talk about things she does when she isn't under pressure, then let's talk about her fifth year. Maybe you remember when she had the /ingenious/ idea of writing everybody's name on a piece of paper that was later found by Umbridge? Or wait let's talk about her putting a curse on the list that would punish the traitor AFTER the backstabbing.
