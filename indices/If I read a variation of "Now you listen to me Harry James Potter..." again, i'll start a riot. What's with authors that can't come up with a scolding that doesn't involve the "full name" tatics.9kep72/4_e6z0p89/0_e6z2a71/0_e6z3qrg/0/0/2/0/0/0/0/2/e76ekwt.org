I always founded Hermione not smart or clever because of the following.

In Philosopher's Stone, she trusted a riddle wrote by Snape and made Harry drink a potion. If it wasn't a children book, all the potion would have been poison and Harry's life would have lasted one book.

You could say that she was only eleven at the time, but when I started to read Harry Potter I was even younger and I thought about it.
