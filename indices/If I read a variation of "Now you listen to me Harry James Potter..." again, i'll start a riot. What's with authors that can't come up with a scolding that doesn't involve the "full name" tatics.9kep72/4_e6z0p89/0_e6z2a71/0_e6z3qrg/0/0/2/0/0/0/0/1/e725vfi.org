In book 2, she leaves a page with basilisk info and 'pipes' in her hand writing. Harry jumps to Myrtle, the bathroom, and he and Ron do the rest. First year, Harry and co are pretty much hand-fed clues (Hagrid keeps spilling information and Harry gets chocolate frog card) and Harry decides someone was going after the stone when Dumbles is away. Most of Hermione's part generally was book knowledge - figuring out Remus was a werewolf due to researching an assignment from Snape, figuring out the basilisk due to research, etc. Being methodical is not a negative trait, but it is a trait she has. No one is completely lacking in intuition (I don't think?) and having perfect intuition is basically being clairvoyant, but Harry's more of the nutrition guy and Hermione is more methodical than intuitive. She is also not very open to possibilities outside of academic sources, unless it is something that disagrees with her sensibility. The Weasley twins are creative - almost everything they do is new and ingenious, doesn't mean they never research or do things other people have done before. Hermione making the coins doesn't make her a creative person.

She states she got the idea from the dark mark, which allows Voldie to call followers to him, implying all the dark marks are connected somehow. She, being knowledgable about magic, also knows about the protean charm, so she combines the two ideas. But you are right, it is an innovative use as far as we know.

Having said all that, this is a series written for children which means that reading it as an adult makes me notice things that I didn't as a child. For example, why didn't Dumbles, or any adult really, figure out it's a basilisk? Once you realize such creatures are possible, they're kind of obvious as long-lived serpents that petrify and kill with their eyes. Same thing with stone - if we assume that Dumbles is light and intelligent and all that is good, why would he leave a valuable artifact he knows people are after behind protection that three 11-year-olds could by pass and behind a door that can be opened with a first year spell? JKR wanted specific characters and then shoe-horned them into her plot - the books are good for the most part, but there is a reason they're not considered great literature the way LOTR is. Hermione was written to be a bookish character, Ron the street-wise side-kick, and Harry the poor mistreated orphan turned hero. If Hermione was as awesome as her fans think, then she would be a Mary Sue - super intelligent, powerful, creative, has her choice of the cast, loving well-to-do parents who totally forgive her for erasing their memories, and a humanitarian who's the only one to see house-elves for the slaves that they are. Honestly, who needs Harry or Dumbledore with her around?
