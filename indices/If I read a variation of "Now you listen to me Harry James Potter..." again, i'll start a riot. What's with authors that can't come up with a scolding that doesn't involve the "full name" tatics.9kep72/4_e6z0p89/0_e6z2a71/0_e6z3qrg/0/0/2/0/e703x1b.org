She is very tied to structure - doesn't do very well when the solution requires creativity and intuition rather than logic. Maybe the definition of clever is different in the UK, but I never associated her with that word. Intellegent, yes, but cleverness requires originality in thinking that she didn't really demonstrate. She also has a hard time listening to other people's point of views - the SPEW thing showed cultural insensitivity as she refused to acknowledge or believe what the house elves themselves and whole lot of other people were telling her.
