No, she is intelligent. Intelligence is defined as one's capacity for logic or understanding. Two thing that Hermione clearly has seeing how she solved Snape's Riddle in her first year. Clever and intelligent are different even if they are related. Somebody who is clever is creative with their ideas, they can come up with ingenious solutions to their problems. Something that would apply more to Harry than Hermione. To be honest, if I wasn't extremely biased against Hermione I could admit that she is cleverish.
