  Other than Dobby, all the house-elves we met don't want to be free
#+end_quote

I'm not going to claim that Rowling did this on purpose, but the House Elves' reactions were very analogous to USA history with the slaves. When you're told that you're shit and that you need to be directed in life from the moment you're born, you start to believe it. Do you think every slave in the US wanted to be free? /Absolutely/ not. Sure, /some/ of them fought for their freedom, but a /lot/ of slaves didn't. Shit, some of them fought against the North during the Civil War (though, of course, some were forced to).

I know it's almost contradictory to state this, but someone /born/ into slavery does not /necessarily/ have the agency necessary to /choose/ whether or not they need to continue to be enslaved. After they've been given their freedom, they're free to do whatever they want.

  As for the coin, she didn't invent it, she based it off the dark mark and then researched the spell work
#+end_quote

Look, Rowling doesn't exactly go into great detail about how a lot of the magic works in the Harry Potter series, but from what I can tell there's no spell with such deviation in canon. The Dark Mark was a fucking /tattoo/ on a human that would burn when people were being summoned. The D.A. coin was an enchanted piece of metal which heated up when a message on the coin changed, with a "Master" coin, as opposed to Voldemort choosing any random follower with a Dark Mark (remember, he didn't have a Dark Mark himself).

The implementations were /wildly/ different. Perhaps "invent" was too strong of a word. I'll recant that. But her solution was absolutely not the same and so absurdly, obviously creative and clever that I'm not sure where you're coming from.

  unlike Snape who came up with new spells while he was about her age
#+end_quote

I never tried to make a comparison between Snape and Hermione. Snape was definitely a very clever person. Is Hermione /less/ creative? Perhaps. That's not really a debate that I'm trying to have, though.

  Harry is intuitive in solving mysteries, but Hermione for the most part a​ct​s as the researcher of the group.
#+end_quote

I... honestly can't remember a single case in which Harry solved a mystery on his own.

In Philosopher's Stone, they were all wrong. All three of the trio.

In Chamber of Secrets, Hermione is the one who figured out what Slytherin's Monster was - something that not even the most knowledgeable Wizard in the world, Dumbledore, figured out.

In Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione is the one who knew about Remus being a Werewolf. Something she had no reason to "research", by the way. That was all intuition.

In Goblet of Fire, Hermione tirelessly helped Harry wherever she could, including teaching him how to perform the Summoning Charm.

In Order of the Phoenix, Hermione was the one who tried to tell Harry that going to the Department of Mysteries would be a huge mistake. Talk about Harry's intuition on that one, why don't you.

In Half-Blood Prince, Harry definitely got a one-up on Hermione in the whole Draco debacle. No denying that. She also instantly knew that Harry was "cheating" in Potions. I put it in quotations because I'm not necessarily agreeing, just pointing out that she knew it very quickly. She also was the one who told him that using the book would end badly for him - which it did.

In Deathly Hallows, Hermione /literally/, due to her own preparedness, got them out of /every single/ bad situation that the Trio found themselves in. Every situation, perhaps, with the exception of Malfoy Manor. However, she also didn't crack under torture. Not necessarily relevant to this discussion, but I enjoy saying it, because she's a fucking badass.

Sure - a lot of those solutions were due to the fact that she was "book smart". However, "book smart" doesn't cover it. She very /creatively/ and /intuitively/ used her own intelligence for those solutions.

The idea that Hermione was a useless researcher who spent too much time in books and not actually paying attention to the world around her comes from /bad writing/ in /shitty fanfiction/.
