They're... entirely different things. Like... that's going to get super confusing. But, anyways.

You're saying she isn't clever. Can you make the case for /why/ she isn't clever? Because you're rebuttal to my listing of 7 examples of clever ideas is by bringing up a single clever idea had two huge problems. If we're going tit-for-tat, you've got ground to make up. I'm assuming there are either /more/ examples or a different line of reasoning for why you think she isn't "smart"?
