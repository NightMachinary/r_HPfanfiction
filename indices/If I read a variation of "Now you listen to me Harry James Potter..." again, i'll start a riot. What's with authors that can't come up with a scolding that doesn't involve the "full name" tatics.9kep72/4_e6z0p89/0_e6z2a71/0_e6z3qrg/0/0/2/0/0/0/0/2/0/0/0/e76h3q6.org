There's a massive difference between intelligence, cleverness, and /composure/, the last of which isn't something that was being debated. You're attaching meanings to words that literally don't exist in the real world.

Clever, in the context of the debate:

#+begin_quote
  showing intelligence or skill; ingenious.
#+end_quote

Intelligent, in the context of the debate:

#+begin_quote
  having or showing intelligence, especially of a high level.
#+end_quote

We've established that Hermione is intelligent. We've established that she has clever ideas. Suddenly, now, you're attributing, "Well, she has to do it under pressure!"

You're thinking of /composure/, specifically while under pressure, which, again, is /not what we're debating/.

EDIT: Also, I'm not going to downvote you just because you disagree with me.

EDIT2: Although, ironically, this post was literally downvoted before I could even /edit/ it, the first time. Within the "ninja edit" period. Nice projection lol
