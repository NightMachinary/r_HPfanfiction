Considering that those descriptions are often for either Ginny and mostly Hermione, and I don't read either pairing as a general rule, it doesn't bother me because I don't see them. But yeah. its annoying. In general, I hate Hermione with a passion, so most of the times I just skip fics where she's one of the MC.
