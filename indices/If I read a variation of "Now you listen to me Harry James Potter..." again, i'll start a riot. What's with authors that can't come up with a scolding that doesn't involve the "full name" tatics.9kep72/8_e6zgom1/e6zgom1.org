You object to emerald orbs, but not chocolate/cinnamon pools? I've read that more times than I care to count, and as a brown-eyed girl it kind of pisses me off that the only description you can get for brown eyes is those two things. Hermione's eyes are brown, we get it! Stop bringing up food and making me hungry.

As far as full names go, Hermione using "Ronald" in the movies is even more grating tbh. That's Luna's thing! Hermione just calls him Ron.
