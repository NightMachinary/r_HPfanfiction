Now listen here Naupiz Zebra Eighteen... I don't mean to dox you or your emerald orbs, but this kind of invective is just too much! It had better be one damn quiet riot because some people are trying to sleep over here.

Now that everyone knows your full legal name and that you accidentally(repeatedly) dipped your wedding tackle into basilisk green eye shadow, put those verdant orbs on ice before they turn a particular shade of puce and a throbbing vein begins to pulse wildly.

Just watch yourself there mate(cub) or I'll cast fiendfyre, whose incantation is quite helpfully fiendfyre, or perhaps some amazingly powerful wandless magic.

To my own chagrin, it seems that spells cast wandlessly always come out of my own ass, it's a very unique effect that I learned in a book titled Butt Magic and the Jedi Crossover. Unsurprisingly, it was no use to anyone, anywhere, at any time. Shazaam!
