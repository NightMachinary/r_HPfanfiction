This works with almost every female pairing that Harry has, when he goes into that "Nobody loves me" or "I'm guilty of their death because I farted in their direction" mode. This particular time that made me do this post was a Harry/Susan and then I ragequit the fic. But I've seen Daphne, Tracey, Cho, Fleur, Tonks and OCs. The only one I can't remember reading that does this (based, ofc, on the author) is a Harry/Luna.
