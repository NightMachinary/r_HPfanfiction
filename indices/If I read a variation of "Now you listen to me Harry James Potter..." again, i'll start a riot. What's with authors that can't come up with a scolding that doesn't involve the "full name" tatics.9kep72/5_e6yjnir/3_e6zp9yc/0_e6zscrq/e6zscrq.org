Which is funny because apparently, Luna is the only one who did that in canon.

I don't see it working for Cho (she was far too mopey), Fleur (just weird with the accent) or any older love interest like Tonks, Amelia Bones, Narcissa Malfoy because that would just fuck up the already unbalanced relationship even more (unless you are writing a mother kink, but then Lily would be the partner of choice).
