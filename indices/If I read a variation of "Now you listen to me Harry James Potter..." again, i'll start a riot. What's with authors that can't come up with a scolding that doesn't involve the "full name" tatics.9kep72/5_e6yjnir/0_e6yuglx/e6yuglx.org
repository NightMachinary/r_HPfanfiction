In the movies it's Luna who says it. She doesn't say his middle name (?), but I can only hear that in her voice. Molly never actually scolds Harry. Hermione tends to just huff and roll her eyes when it comes to Harry. He honestly doesn't get scolded very much in a motherly sort of way. So it's a bit OOC when we see the wonderful women in his life scolding him.
