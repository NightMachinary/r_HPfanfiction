I automatically assumed that it was Molly, Ginny or Hermione who would deliver that line.

At the other hand, many other approaches don't seem to fit for the well established characters. You can have Padma Patil tell Harry to "stop being a lazy bum, put your/his dick away and start thinking about solving the fucking egg", but it would be incredibly OOC for Hermione to deliver that line. And I can't think of many scoldings which do not sound like Snape, a disappointed parent, Molly or are too vulgar for the main cast.

And how often do you need to scold the MC? If they seriously fuck up, swearing works to an extent, but unless someone is using the idiot ball as anal beads, there's no need for a full dressing down either way.
