Harry : "No Headmaster, I swear I didn't put my name in the Goblet of Fire!"

Dumbledore : "What the fuck did you just fucking say, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class of the 1898 graduation class, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Grindelwald and Voldemort, and I have over 300 confirmed captures. I am trained in gorilla wizardy and I'm the top dueler in the entire International Confederation of Wizards. You are nothing to me but just another little pawm. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this wizarding world, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret Order of the pheonix who will confirm whether you put your name in the Goblet of the fayah, so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in non-wand combat combat, but I have access to the entire library of the Chamber of Secrets. I will wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."
