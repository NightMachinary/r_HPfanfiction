linkffn(Murder Most Horrid)

This is also Bellatrix/Hermione, and Tom Riddle just has a random Ministry job, he's only mentioned once. Thank you for the other recs though, will check them out. I tried reading Fractures, but the writing has a lot of issues, especially with tense, and is technically not up to scratch, will check out the others.

The Pureblood Pretense series has a Tom Riddle who became a politician instead of a Dark Lord.
