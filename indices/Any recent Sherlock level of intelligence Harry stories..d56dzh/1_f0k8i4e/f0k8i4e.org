Not sure how well this meets your criteria but Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) casts Harry as a natural legilimens, giving him Sherlock Holmes levels of insight into the motivations of others.

It's a trope-busting WBWL fic. I like it, but I've seen criticism from others that it's failing to live up to it's premise.

I think it's mid year three right now, some 800k words.
