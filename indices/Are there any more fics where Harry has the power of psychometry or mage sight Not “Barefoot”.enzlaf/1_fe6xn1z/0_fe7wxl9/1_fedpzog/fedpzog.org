The only logical justification would be if time operated under a time loop philosophy which would make the past set in stone.

Under those rules the 'current' Voldemort would know that a 'future' Voldemort has already sent a 'future' Harry back and it didn't negatively effect anything up to that point in 'current' Voldemort's history.

The main downside to this tactic though is that you give your enemy years to plan. The plans themselves couldn't really even start until you've already been sent back, as operating knowledge up until that point needs to remain the same, but this could be counteracted if you send them back far enough. What kind of intricate 'plan' can survive centuries of time and happenstance without a cog of that plan failing to turn.

As for evidence of time operating this way, we have the time turners in book 3 and the insistence by Hermione that they shouldn't even TRY to change what they already know happens.
