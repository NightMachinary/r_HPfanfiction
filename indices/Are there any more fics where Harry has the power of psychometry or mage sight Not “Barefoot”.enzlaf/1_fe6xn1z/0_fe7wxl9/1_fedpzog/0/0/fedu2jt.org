Oh, no doubt that it's not the best plan, but the main cons are mitigated the further back you send someone.

For instance, if you send someone back 1,000 years under the 'time loop' style of time travel, what could that person actually do to you? What kind of plans or preparations could survive the march of 1,000 years? Could you actually enact vengeance when you are so far removed from your target?

Overall I think the main failure of the plan in the summary is that it was only 200 years, that's still arguably close enough time wise to have an impact.
