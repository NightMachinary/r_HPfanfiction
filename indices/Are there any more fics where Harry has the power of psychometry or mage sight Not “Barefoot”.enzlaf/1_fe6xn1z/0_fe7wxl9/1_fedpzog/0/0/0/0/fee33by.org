But not necessarily due to the premise, but to the execution of that premise.

Imagine if it was something like this. Voldemort finds a ritual that allows him to remotely send Harry back 1,000 years. A ritual that's possible due to a combination of the brother wands they share, and because Voldemort is willing to sacrifice his own wand as a requirement; and also sacrifice the protection of blood he stole during his re-birthing ritual. Voldemort would in essence see it as turning the things that caused his failure in the graveyard into his success in removing the threat.

But the ritual doesn't go as planned, instead of it sending Harry back 1,000 years, it's only 200. This is due to the fact that Harry has more than just his own soul, he also has the fragment of Voldemort's with him. The soul tether is enough for it to only partially work.

Now, Harry isn't so far back in history that he can't plan or prepare against Voldemort. Before that though, he must figure out what happened and why. He needs to delve into the nature of his connections to Voldemort and in doing so discovers the soul fragment within himself and the concept of horcruxes in general.

Overall, I find the above a perfectly plausible unpacking of the synopsis which could make for a compelling setup to a story.
