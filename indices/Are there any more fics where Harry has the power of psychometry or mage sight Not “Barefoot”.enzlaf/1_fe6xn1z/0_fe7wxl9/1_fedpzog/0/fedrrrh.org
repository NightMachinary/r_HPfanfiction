Not just plan, in book 3 they did a lot more precisely because it had already happened, they just hadn't been aware of it.

Voldemort risks this happening to him, as he's clearly not omniscient. Perhaps a second after he send hims back, Older!Harry finishes a spell he learnt in the past on the horcruxes and kills him.

After all Voldemort's advantage in canon came from age and experience, why give Harry time to catch up?
