There's always [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lovegoods-guide-to-lovecraftian-horrors-hp-oc-si-ish.388120/][Lovegood's Guide to Lovecraftian Horrors]]. The MC is Luna's insane older brother whose mind was fractured at a young age, combining two personalities into a singular one. Slytherin meets Lovegood and chaos runs rampant as a result. A few chapters in, he dabbles in runes and gains Mage Sight. Unfortunately, Mage Sight wasn't meant to be turned on 24/7 and Sol Lovegood begins to notice... things that notice him back.

Overall, it's one of my personal favorites, really. I wholeheartedly recommend it!
