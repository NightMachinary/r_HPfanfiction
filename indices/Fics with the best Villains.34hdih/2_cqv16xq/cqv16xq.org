  /"For the Aurors, the name Gallowbraid was an in-joke---it meant a non-existent person, a red herring. The phrase 'to chase a gallowbraid' meant to pursue a figment of one's imagination. This phrase originated from Alastor Moody's allegations that a Dark Wizard called 'Andros Gallowbraid' was the perpetrator of certain crimes during and after the first reign of the Dark Lord. Having no records of such a man or any proof of his existence, however, it was widely believed that the aging Auror was steadily going senile, that Gallowbraid was simply a concoction of some of the worst Dark Wizards he had sent to Azkaban, and a convenient villain to blame for the cases he could not solve./

  /Now, of course, we know better. Sadly, that knowledge came after the damage had been done."/
