And that's where JKR shines. She writes minor villains well. Umbridge because of the way we identify with her character. Same with the Dursleys.

Crouch because of the scenes with Neville (even under the poly juice).

Lockhart is a buffoon but is generally well received in Wizarding world.

Peter is a wonderfully written sniveling coward, Lucius is the perfect smarm.

She just has issues with the Big Bads.
