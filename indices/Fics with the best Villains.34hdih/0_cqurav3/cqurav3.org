Other than my stock recommendations of [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/][Worm]] by Wildbow (not at all HP) and The Alexandra Quick Series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]] (only the slightest bit HP) , both of which feature wonderfully complex villains, Harry Potter is difficult in this regard because JK Rowling kind of sucks at writing villains. Any good villains in the HP universe have to be either OCs or wildly AU. That said, I would say that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] by Kwan Li, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] by Marquise Black and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings]] by AngelaStarCat all do a decent job at making their villains mysterious, ominous, or menacing.

Edit: I want to clarify what I meant by 'sucks at writing villains', because it bothered me when I re-read it. Rowling is very good at setting up the surprise reveal: Quirell is Quirellmort! Moody is Crouch Jr! What she isn't good at is building multidimensional villains. Once you're aware of those surprises (as everybody who reads fanfiction is) there is very little of interest left. Voldemort, Pettigrew, Crouch Jr, Umbridge, they are all not only evil, they are horribly unpleasant people. She not only doesn't explore their varying pathos much at all, the characters as written are so unpleasant that it is AU to write them as anything other than purely evil. There are interesting concepts there to be sure, but its really up to the fandom to do the heavy lifting of developing those villains. /rant.
