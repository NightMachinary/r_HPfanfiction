[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of a Dark Kingdom]] has a fascinating take on Voldemort and his relationship to Harry. Voldemort essentially ends up mentoring Harry, yet Harry is still recognisably the Hero we expect and him to be, and Voldemort is still quite Villainous, or at least, power-hungry and competent. Their relationship is very complex, abusive, even. Added bonus: it has a well imagined Britain where Voldemort won the first war, and a pretty decent Snape.
