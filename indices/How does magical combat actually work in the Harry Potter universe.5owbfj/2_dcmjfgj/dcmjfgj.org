Dodging (or side-stepping) really cheapens magical combat. Perhaps they are warranted, if one is sufficiently far away, but otherwise it's a an easy copout shortcut. My preference lies towards specialised shields and transfiguration/conjuration for defence, and curses/charms/transfiguration for offence.

Canon doesn't have a lot of examples of such magic (a few super-cool duels aside), so if one wants to delve further into magical combat, get the fuck down and invent some spells and magical effects.
