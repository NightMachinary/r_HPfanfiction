Wizards and witches shooting coloured lights out of their wands is as basic as you can get. That sort of magical combat is for those without much knowledge in magic or power in general.

However, once you get to Dumbledore and Voldemort levels of skill, then things become more esoteric and strange. The duel in the MoM atrium is a prime example though the movies managed to make it look pedestrian (Where's Voldemort's conjured shield?!)

I like to imagine when you're a master of magic, and have learned strange and nearly forgotten spells from ancient tomes then the spells you can pull off are wondrous and frightening to behold.

Picture a wizard waving his wand, nothing happens at first and so you think it's a dud spell when suddenly your entire perspective shifts, what is up is down, what is left is right, that would instantly fuck you up, you will no longer be able to fight like that and all it would take is simple stunner or killing curse to finish you off.

How about a spell that adjusts the gravity around your opponent, either making them float harmlessly or crushing them into the ground as if an elephant just landed on them.

Then there's transfiguration, Dumbledore was supposedly a master but we don't get to see really creative uses in either the books or the films, I like to imagine any mundane object could be turned into a vicious animal. Say a fight breaks out in a classroom, well, all those desks and chairs suddenly become lions, tigers, wolves e.t.c. Or you could even deliberately not finish the transfiguration so that a floor tile turns into a lion's face which bites and snaps at anyone who walks near it.

Then there's the real heavy hitters, like Fiendfyre, infamous for being wild and uncontrollable for most magicals, well, if you have an iron will (thanks to Occlumency) you could control it, like the giant snake Voldemort conjured in his fight against Dumbledore. If there's Fiendfyre how about other elements? A water version of Fiendfyre would be just as devastating, at least fire if hot enough can instantly disintegrate you, drowning is a slow and painful death.

Lastly there's creative uses of mundane and seemingly harmless spells such as Wingardium Leviosa, like Ron demonstrated with the Troll, a heavy object falling on someone's head would kill them just as easily as a killing curse.
