I'm going to pull from the expanded world and say it's probably a lot like what we saw in Fantastic Beasts. Or at least takes a lot from that world. Mostly silent casting, and among powerful witches and wizards; point casting.

When we witnessed duels and fights in Fantastic Beasts (especially during the ending scenes in the duel between Newt, MACUSA, and Gellert) we didn't see many wand movements at all aside from shielding and batting away spells. I think combat in the wider magical world would be much like that.

Most likely all combat would involve silent and point-casting to some degree, except for maybe the most powerful of spells like the unforgivables and fiendfyre. Now the more intricate aspects of battle I think would be a bit different. I imagine a fight against multiple enemies would involve a LOT of dodging and shielding and be very much in line with the idea of guerilla tactics. In a one on one battle though I imagine it would be much more like your typical duel that we've seen multiple times in the series.
