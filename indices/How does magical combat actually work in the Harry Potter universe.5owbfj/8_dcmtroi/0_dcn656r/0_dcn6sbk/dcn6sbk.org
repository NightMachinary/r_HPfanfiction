That's an interesting point. I was pulling the concept from Dogwizard from the Windrose Chronicles. It does beg the question though, why doesn't anyone die after walking through a ghost? If we presume that ghosts are around freezing point, then one would think that they die.

Just to pull a workable answer out of my ass, free magic and magic fluctuations are most common in places with large amounts of magic, such as Hogwarts. Students aren't affected because they have a magical aura around them already as a result of them having magic and leaking it constantly. The leaked magic turns to wild magic, but not immediately, and acts as a sort of buffer for the magic. It isn't overly noticed in the muggle world, because iron and iron alloys negate and absorb the free magic, especially in cold temperatures, hence cold iron being anathema to Fey or magic spells. Given how much iron is in and around London, that should account for them not dying.
