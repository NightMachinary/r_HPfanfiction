You could write a fic like that. You'd have to divert from canon -- kids at Hogwarts can bring in apparently mundane animals -- and any Muggle walking through Diagon Alley is at risk, so you'd have to tune the strength somewhat. You'd see Muggle artifacts working outside Hogwarts but failing more often near magic.

  Given how much iron is in and around London, that should account for them not dying.

You'd be able to put a CD player in an iron cage or box and operate it in Hogwarts.

This also makes protective enchantments hardly worthwhile. You can just bring in an iron pipe and crawl through, ignoring the enchantments.

Not saying that this means it's a bad idea. These are just things you'd have to consider.
