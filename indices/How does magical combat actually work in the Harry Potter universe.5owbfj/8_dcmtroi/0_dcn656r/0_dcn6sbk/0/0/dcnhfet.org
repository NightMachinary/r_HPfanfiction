It really does make a lot of sense, at least the iron part. Sort of like a faraday cage for magic. Of course it would only work with direct magic, so Stupefy is fine, but Incendio is not. Protective enchantments are a bit more tricky because the canon is so inconsistent. We see age lines which indicate barrier wards, but we also see how Apparatus is impossible in all of Hogwarts, which indicates AoE wards. Tanks may be a great idea for attack, but then you get the issue with wild magic. Maybe the more focused a magic is, then the less it is interfered with by iron, explaining why vehicles don't fail next to the Leaky Cauldron/King's Cross. So vague magic, such as DADA curse or wild magic, or accidental magic are all easily negated, Stupefy is weakened, and wards are barely touched. Magic is interesting because the mechanics are so unintuitive, so I really enjoy trying to figure out workable mechanics which fit with canon.
