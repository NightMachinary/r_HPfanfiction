I think that we have to consider the mechanics of spells to begin with. We have mostly two types of combat spells, projectiles and non projectiles. Projectile spells are those such as Stupefy, and must be shielded against or dodged. Non projectiles encompass everything else, such as Aquamenti, Incendio, and various transfigurations.

Now surprisingly enough, we never get an indicator that power is a factor in spellcasting, at least canonically. The fandom likes to assign power, because being able to send Killing Curses all day is ridiculous and should be nerfed. But as I see it, spellcasting is about the mind. You concentrate on putting someone to sleep, and thus get the stock Stupefy. Emotions can influence this, since as you get angry, you are more able to concentrate absolutely on what you want. This leads to spells which supposedly require an emotional component. The Killing Curse for example, requires that you must totally want somebody dead, without doubt. Now this can be done emotionless and calmly, especially by Voldemort who may or may not have mental issues anyway. But for the majority of the population, this mindset doesn't come into play unless they truly hate somebody with all their heart. This explains how the Aurors are able to use it when given the go ahead, how Voldemort can hand them out like candy, and how others have more trouble with them.

While spells don't have a power requirement, people can still get tired casting them. It is hard to concentrate, especially on difficult topics. This explains Voldemort's and Harry's prodigious abilities. Both of them are very driven people with an ability to understand and comprehend spells which is far above their peers. Harry can cast the Patronus, fully mastered the Summoning charm in a matter of days, and pulled off the imperious curse on his first try. The reason he isn't on Voldemorts level is simply exposure to magic.

Now why does only Dumbledore and Voldemort use flashy AoE spells when dueling? Well first let's explain why nobody else uses them. Finite. They can be canceled easily. Finite sort of acts as the EMP of magic. A lot of magic can be canceled by it, so transfiguring the ground or animating it is next to useless. But to cancel projectile spells, finite would need to collide with them midair. So the only option of projectile spells is to shield or dodge. But wait, what about wand motions? Wand motions (headcanon) are a series of movements denoting parameters and variables of the spell. With the proper wand motions, you can make a Lumos on par with a Lumos Maxima. However, you can also hold these parameters in one's head, making concentration more difficult and the spells sloppier, but allowing point casting, which is essentially just pointing and shooting. So this is why fights devolve into duels. There is an interesting website or post somewhere where someone calculated the speed of a spell to be on par with a starwars blaster bolt, which I thought was funny. But you have enough time to dodge, but can still be hit if one aims. Shields block the physical effects of a spell, but are connected magically to the caster, who must concentrate on maintaining the shield. The unforgivable curses are mental attacks, so they infect the magic enough to drop the shield, since you cannot concentrate through an imperious or a cruciatus.

So why does Dumbledore use transfigurations? Well because both he and Voldemort are too damn good at shielding. Any traditional spells would just not make it through, thus they must get creative. If both Lord Level wizards can toss out multiple transfigurations per second, then finiting one or two will see a hole form in your defense, where the opponent gains the advantage. The only solution is to transfigure the transfigurations.

All of the above applies to magical vs magical combat. Magical vs muggle combat is different, as muggles cannot cancel spells. Thus, a self perpetuating swamp transfiguration in the middle of London would bog down the population, literally. Invisibility may be countered at some point, but not before the heads of the military are imperioused. Teleportation would never be countered well by Muggle forces, though automated turrets might work. Admittedly, bombs and guns would do a lot of damage but the wizards have an easy way of countering, in negating kinetic energy, and targeted vanishing wards. The way I see it, Wizards as a society are a heavily adaptable nation of the best guerilla warfare fighters where everyone is armed and dangerous. A wizard may teleport while invisible into a nuclear power plant, and short out the power while breaking open the nuclear containment, then teleporting out.

And that brings me to a final theory. Why does electricity fail with magic. Magic is the art of breaking reality, so when some magic leaks off, it turns to wild magic. It's like have an engine in a car which loses heat because it is not 100% efficient. This wild magic randomly messes with reality. It will create pockets of hot or cold, pockets of reduced, increased or reversed gravity. Some wild magic would stop elections from flowing, some make them flow backwards, and some force quantum tunneling to increase range by orders of magnitude. And each of these pockets randomly mutate, changing sizes and melding into each other. This would provide a great explanation for the failure of electronics.
