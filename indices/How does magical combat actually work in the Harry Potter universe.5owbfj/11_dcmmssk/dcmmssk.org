Spells, if you discard the movies, are actually hard to see. only the most taxing spells create light show like in the movies. Most of the jinxs and curses are invisible or only seen as ripple in the air. Also spells are might not be fast as bullets but they are actually hard to dodge. So if you want to imitate Yoda you must be supernaturally fast. Voldemort has done a lot of rituals to make his body spell resistent and enhance his body. Dumbledore though could have been gone the other way. accumulate a lot of magical knowledge, enchant your body and clothes, cast lots of defensive spells on yourself to turn yourself to an unshakible force. Lots of fanfic would tell you to get close to your target to defeat them but no self respecting wizard would let you get that close to themselfs.
