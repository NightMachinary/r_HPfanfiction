Nice find for the ricochet, but the next question that needs to be answered is, what speed due they travel at? In the example provided, it very well could have been that all the spells were cast near simultaneously, and it wasn't until it was all over that people realized what happened, otherwise, why weren't Hermione and Goyle able to dodge the spell?

Two bullets fired at each other can very well richochet too, but that doesn't mean you can see, track, and dodge one fired at you.
