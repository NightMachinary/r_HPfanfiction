This was right after Voldemort tried the Imperius and Harry resisted it. Voldemort then fired another curse at Harry and this happened.

You have to remember that this was at the graveyard and that the entire duel happened while they were surrounded by Death Eaters. And there were only about 25 of them there. And really, a circle made out of 25 people isn't that big so Harry and Voldemort were standing rather closely.

Another interesting quote is this, once again from the GoF:

"Hermione hung back in their next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson to ask Professor Moody something. The rest of the class was very eager to leave; Moody had given them such a rigorous test of hex deflection that many of them were nursing small injuries."

Hex deflection, not practicing shield charms, not using counterspells. Deflection.

We don't know what that means for sure, but with the ricochet quote from before we know that it is possible to redirect spells. Put that together with the term 'deflection' and the fact that Harry can dodge a curse from Voldemort after being Crucio'd and we can safely conclude that dodging is possible in a duel. We can also conclude that perhaps the fanon trope of 'parrying' isn't as farfetched as some people may believe.

Now, I don't think that spells move slowly, but I do think that wizards and witches can react, dodge and perhaps deflect a small number of them.

Now the next part is my own opinion and isn't as waterproof as my previous arguments. This is simply my hypothesis on how magical duels work now that I thought about it for a while:

This all leads me to believe that, barring transfiguration and the elements, a magical duel consists of trying to get initiative with a multitude of rapid curses while dodging/deflecting/shielding (dodge when you can, deflect when you can't and shield when you can't do either or have to stop multiple spells) your enemy's curses.

Shielding is probably the last resort because that forces you to stop attacking, which allows your enemy to stop dodging and deflecting and fully focus on taking you down.

Once you add transfiguration and wide area spells you change everything quite a bit but I think the basics would still be the same.
