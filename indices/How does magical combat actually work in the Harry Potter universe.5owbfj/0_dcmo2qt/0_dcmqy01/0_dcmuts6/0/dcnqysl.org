You omitted a relevant section of the scene from Goblet of Fire.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort raised his wand, but this time Harry was ready; with the reflexes born of his Quidditch training, he flung himself sideways onto the ground; he rolled behind the marble headstone of Voldemort's father, and he heard it crack as the curse missed him.

Harry started moving when Voldemort first raised his wand, so before the spell had been cast. And the spell struck the headstone Harry was hiding behind since we're told it cracked, implying if Harry didn't have cover the spell would have struck him, so he didn't really dodge it.

For your second example, the Shield Charm has been shown to deflect hexes (but not always), it's possible that was what they were practicing. Of course, it's all speculation and I think it's open to interpretation.
