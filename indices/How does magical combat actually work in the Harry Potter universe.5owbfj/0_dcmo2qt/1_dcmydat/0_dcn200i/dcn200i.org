You dont dodge the bullet, but you can dodge the gun. I.e while its impossible to dodge a fired bullet it is possible (well theoretically) to dodge before the shot is fired so that the second the shot is fired you already dodged.

For bullets this means dodging in the time of a trigger being pulled so its pretty much impossible, however spells do take a lot longer to be performed, and 0.5 seconds or so is ample time to dodge. This means that even if spells were as fast as bullets it would be much easier to dodge them compared to a bullet.
