This, the priori incantatem effect and other examples scattered throughout the books, shows that spells, or at least curses and jinxes, do in fact show up as projectiles. I do not know why so many people suddenly think that this isn't the case but they are wrong.

Spells can collide, they can ricochet, they are tangible. They can be dodged, they can be blocked and they can be parried. Spells move fast but wizards seem to be faster, stronger and more perceptive than muggles either way.

Just look at quidditch. Flying at high speeds while dodging projectiles, hitting those projectiles, which are fully capable of breaking limbs, with one hand while moving towards it and being capable of finding and tracking a small highspeed flying object all show just how superior wizards and witches really are.

Is it really such a surprise that people like that can sidestep 'jets of light' when they are prepared for it?

Everyone has their own idea of how magical combat should be in the Harry Potter world, but keep in mind that spells can be seen, they can be tracked and they can be dodged.
