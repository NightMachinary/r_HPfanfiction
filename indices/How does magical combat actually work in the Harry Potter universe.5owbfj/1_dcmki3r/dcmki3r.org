There are largely 4 different scenarios and 3 of them are shown in the last few chapters of Order of the Phoenix, the last is shown towards the end of Half-Blood Prince.

Listed in chronological order :

- Scenario 1 : Two magic users or two groups of magic users of unequal skill face each other, where the weaker group is fighting to flee. This scenario is perfectly described in the bowels of the department of mystery in book 5 where Harry and the gang are facing Lucius Malfoy with a variety of death eaters. From the weaker perspective, this fight involved a lot of running while keeping objects such as doors and shelves between the line of sight, and also firing spells over the shoulder as general disruption. From the Death Eater perspective, this involves a lot of chasing, corralling, and doing what you can to corner the opponent to stop them.

- Scenario 2 : Two magic users of equal skill face each other. This can be shown best with the Belatrix and Sirius fight in front of the archway. I believe it would look very much like a medium distance fencing match, probably within 15- 20 feet of each other. It would involve lots of movement of the wand to hide to hide when and what spell you will be casting offensively or to immediately begin casting a shield or parry as needed. Generally in this type of combat, the first hit lands will be the deciding blow. These fights will be quick where the first mistake made in positioning or awareness will be met with a deathblow, especially if one side can emotionally disrupt the other.

- Scenario 3 : Two grandmasters face each other. This is the Voldemort vs. Dumbledore fight. These are the fights that feel like a proper 'magic' fight, where each player has a space around them that is theirs to control and command to their will in every sense. Need to protect someone? that statue that is nearby will become animated and act as a physical barrier. Need to attack? Summon a wave of flame to send towards your enemy. A wave of flame coming at you? Reverse control of it, or deflect it with a wave of water. These are the fights that are determined your creativity and resourcefulness of imposing your will on the environment around you.

- Scenario 4 : A weaker person tries to take on a someone more skilled in a direct confrontation. This is the scenario at the end of Half-Blood Prince where Harry gets absolutely schooled by Snape. Harry's intention, strategy, and spells were immediately read and deflected before even having a chance to start.

Also, in general, I don't think spells themselves really act as 'trackable' projectiles. Yes the books describe 'flashes of light' but I think this description is comparable to seeing a 'flash' from the barrel of a gun. Yes, line of sight is important, but the thought of seeing a spell, identifying it by it's color, tracking it's location, and coming up with the appropriate defense to that specific spell is ludicrous. For instance, in baseball, a pitcher is 60 feet from the batter, and a ball pitched between 90 and 100 mph, even with these metrics the batter only has a small fraction of a second to react to which pitch is coming at him.
