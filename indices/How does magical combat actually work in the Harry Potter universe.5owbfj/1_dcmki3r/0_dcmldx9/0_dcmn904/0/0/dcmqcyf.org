Spells being nonverbal is why I gave the disclaimer in parenthesis, but we must also keep in mind that the killing curse, and other unforgivables, were ALWAYS verbal. Why else would Voldemort take the time to make the full incantation in his fight with Dumbledore.

That being said, we don't know the functions or limitations of the shield charm. Could it be that a good shield charm will deaden the effects of a spell meant to sever an arm to only give a paper cut? If so, a shield charm combined with a bit of movement could very well be a useful defense. If it's a spell that can't be weakened by the shield charm, perhaps all those spells NEED to be spoken, giving the defender extra information and time to make the appropriate response. This to me seems plausible, and may explain why the 'grandmaster' duel was one consisting largely of transfiguration. Only through that type duel, could you get a spell to the scale needed to alter and modify the environment, which opens up completely new avenues when it comes to attacking and defending.
