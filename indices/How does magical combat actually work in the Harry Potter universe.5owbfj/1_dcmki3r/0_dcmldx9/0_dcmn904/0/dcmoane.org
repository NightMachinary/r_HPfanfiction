In canon, nonverbal casting is taught in year 6 - so, skilled wizards and witches won't give their spell away by that. Further, countering a spell before it's finished casting would require you to cast much more rapidly than your opponent. Given the reaction times of humans, I don't really think that would work out that well with spells that travel too fast to block.
