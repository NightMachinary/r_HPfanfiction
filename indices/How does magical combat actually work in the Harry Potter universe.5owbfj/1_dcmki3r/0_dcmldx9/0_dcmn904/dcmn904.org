Well as we see in scenario 4, it is possible to figure out which spell is being cast and counter it before it's even finished. Surely there is a time to recognize and prepare a defense against a spell, but doing so purely by the light given off is not it. It would have to be by the movements of the wand, the incantation (if spoken), or general knowledge of the caster's favorites. If the light of the spell is involved at all, it would be the last piece, the deciding factor between a narrowed down list of reactions.

As for the speed of the battle, I think that much is a given. Fighting with a weapon has always been a quick endeavor, it's movies that tell us otherwise.
