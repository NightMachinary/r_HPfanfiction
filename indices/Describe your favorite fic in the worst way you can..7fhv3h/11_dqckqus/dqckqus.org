Set after GoF. Harry combines with Voldemort's soul after a dementor makes him a Partially Kissed Hero. He gets a personally crafted, basilisk-venom-cored, super wand. Then Indy!Harry trains with fem!Hogwarts to become a dueling expert. Icy Daphne Greengrass is the focus of his affections but Tracey Davis is interested too, moreso after Harry single handedly stops Luna's bullying with an explosive announcement in the great hall. Some Dimension Travel, bit of Harry/Bellatrix, possibly Harry/Pansy. He watches Tonks (who he's shagged) die. Merlin's portrait's alive and Harry's collected all the founders' portraits which he keeps in the trunk where he lives with his surrogate mother Narcissa Black (previously Malfoy) who worries about him when he goes out on his missions with the Aurors. He's an animagus too.
