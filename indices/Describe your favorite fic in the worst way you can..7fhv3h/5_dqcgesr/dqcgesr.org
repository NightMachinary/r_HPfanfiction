WrongBoyWhoLived!Harry Mistreated!Harry Slytherin!Harry AU, Classic cliche of being abandoned by his family and left at the doorsteps of his aunt's when he was a child, has a twin that's favoured by both parents. Smug, cocky, over-confident twin; immature, bigotted Ron.

Really though, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is one of the best-written fics out there.
