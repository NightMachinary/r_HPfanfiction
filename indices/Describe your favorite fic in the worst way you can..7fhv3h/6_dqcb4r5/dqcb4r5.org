There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6ltn5v/describe_your_favorite_fic_in_the_most/][a thread]] about that a while ago, with some pretty good entries.

Some of mine (both old and new):

- Hermione gets sorted into Slytherin, bullied by Pansy and Draco, and possessed by Tom Riddle's Diary. Will she change Draco's mind to gain his protection? Will Snape manage to save her from herself? (/Applied Cultural Anthropology/)

- Like HPMOR, but with Hermione as the lead. (/Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation/)

- Nonmagical AU. Harry, Hermione, and Ron go to school. Harry plays sports, Hermione studies, and Ron socializes. Canon pairings. (/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/)

- Harry kills Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets, learns wandless magic, hides his plans from Dumbledore, and seeks out ancient artifacts in a relentless pursuit of power. (/Forging the Sword/)
