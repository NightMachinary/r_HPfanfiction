Since my favourites are already mentioned, I'll have to go with the second bests.

- Hermione is framed for theft and will get her revenge by robbing the people who accused her clean.

- Lupin gets thrown into the future and initiate a fairy tale romance with Hermione, who smells of rose oil and olives.

- Hermione resurrects Sirius because they've banged, and then she goes back to the past to do the fateful banging.
