For my own stories:

A souless Harry Potter slowly begins to drain the souls of Hogwarts students, while driving the staff insane and bringing terrifying beasts under his control. A brave Dark Lady attempts to stop Harry, but is foiled by the Dastardly Sirius Black and the cunning Gilderoy Lockhart. (Like a Red Headed Stepchild)

Muggles kidnap and brainwash Harry Potter while plotting to topple the ministry of magic. (Harry Potter and the Iron Lady).
