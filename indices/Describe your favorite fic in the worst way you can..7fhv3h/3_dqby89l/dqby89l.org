Lord Voldemort successfully defeats himself while making Harry Potter look like an insane maniac (Seventh Horcrux).

Harry Potter goes back in time to terrify Neville of the future as he enacts various get rich quick schemes (Oh God Not Again).

Gilderoy Lockhart does what Voldemort never managed to do: Make Harry Slytherin, and bring all of magical Britain under his thrall (When In Doubt Obliviate).
