I feel like shitty writing is a legitimate reason to not read something. A few grammar/spelling/formatting errors I can deal with, but not writing style :/

I know writing fanfictions isn't the same as writing in a workshop, but I can't deal with oppressive writing, because it never fails to not make me be bored. Even with a nice plot.
