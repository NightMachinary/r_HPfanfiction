MPreg and slash. While I have a "live and let live" attitude towards homosexuality, I don't go looking for it.

Too many references to Star Wars or superheroes and stuff like that.

[name]!bashing, GreaterGood!Dumbledore and so on.

Too many dark themes: it sort of feels like I'm abusing the characters by reading those stories.
