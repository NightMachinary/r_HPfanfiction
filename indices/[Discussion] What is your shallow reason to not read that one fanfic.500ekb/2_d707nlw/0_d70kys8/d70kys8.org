What if it's used as a joke? Some clarification, I'm writing a fic, one that I won't link, and in it Harry makes fun of random things which are popular tropes. Mpreg, evil dumbledore, cores, etc. are all the things that my little Harry makes regular jabs at. In one scene, Harry sits in Dumbledore's office and jabs at the fact that the lemon drops are coated in Veritaserum and that all the Slytherins know that.

The only reason I'm asking is because my Harry called Granger 'Mione to annoy her, even more so after she just stated that she dislikes any shortening of her name. I know that a lot of people dislike this and I dunno whether I should make that clearer. It's not a crackfic, its just Harry being Harry and a little asshat.
