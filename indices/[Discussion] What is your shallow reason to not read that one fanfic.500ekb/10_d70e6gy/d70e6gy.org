I can be pretty petty sometimes. XD

If the summary says "I suck at summaries" or any variation of this, I will not read it. Summaries are hard, but I'll read a fic with a sucky summary over no summary ANY day.

Established relationship in a romance. For me, this defeats the purpose of a romance. I want to see how they got together. I want to see them when they don't even LIKE eachother yet. I want to read about those tense, heart-fluttery moments where the world is shifted on its axis and everything changes. I find that absolutely essential in a romance.
