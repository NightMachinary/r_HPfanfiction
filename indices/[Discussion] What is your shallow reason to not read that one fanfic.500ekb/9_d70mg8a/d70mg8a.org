Obvious self-inserts, like "During Harry's 7th year, a new girl from the US arrives at Hogwarts! Harry (and Ron, Fred, George, etc) seems interested but so does Draco (and Snape!), and she seems very powerful and is somehow related to Voldemort (or Sirius)!"

I'm fine with OC's if they're well written and work with the characters and plot. But I hate self-insert Mary-Sue's that an author created solely to pair themselves with their favourite character like some strange diary entry. Especially the authors who try to claim that they're not writing a self-insert despite the fact that it is stupidly obvious to everyone with a functioning brain.

"I suck at summaries". Sorry, won't get my sympathy and I will just skip to the next fic. That's why books have fucking summaries. It's advertisement. If you can't even bother to advertise your fic, I won't bother to stop and read it.
