I once read an (otherwise good) fic where the author stated it was based on the movies and therefore Harry had blue eyes. And not to comment telling her it was wrong.

I was compelled to download it and do a search-replace on blue/sapphire/cerulean/etc (though I think she stuck to simply blue), and put green. The read-through was much more enjoyable after that.
