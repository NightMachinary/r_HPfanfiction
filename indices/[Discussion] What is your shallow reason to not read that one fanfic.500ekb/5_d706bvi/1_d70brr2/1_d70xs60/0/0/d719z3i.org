  Nope. Harry is described as tall in the seventh book.

We do know some characters are taller (Bellatrix, twins, Ron, Draco), some have the same height (James) and some are shorter (Hermione, Mundungus) than Harry. Ultimately we do not know Harry's actual height, so slapping a number to Harry's height and calling it canon is wrong unless JKR stated the 6 feet figure.

As for athletic, our disagreement here might be caused by different interpretation, but to me when is someone described as athletic I imagine someone with a well developed muscular body and Harry doesn't have of that.

After having said all of that I have to correct my previous post a bit. I should have said "both of those are headcanon" rather than fanon, I don't think there is a fanon accepted height of Harry.
