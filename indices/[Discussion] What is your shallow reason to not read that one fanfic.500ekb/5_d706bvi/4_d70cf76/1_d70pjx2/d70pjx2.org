I really enjoyed linkffn(The never-ending Road). It's a Snape rescues Harry (or in this case Harriet) from the Dursleys story. I never read fem!harry before and never thought I would like any fics like that but I thought this story provided a very interesting perspective if Harry was a girl. I really liked how the author portrayed the character, you can definitely still recognize Harry's personality and yet the character is changed in a realistic way to account for the fact that she is a girl.
