I know what you mean, I almost did not read it because of that ship because I find it distastefull. But I can tell you that I finished it (although it's not actually complete yet) and there is no pairing at all at this point, it's more of a friendship mentorship story and other than Harriet having a crush on Snape very very late into the story that actually makes sense in context, there is no romance between them at its current completion point.
