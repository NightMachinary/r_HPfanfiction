Hmm ... basically, omake are extras added so that the author would not have to keep to a rigid page count with every chapter regardless of how well it fits the story, as those Japanese comics that are not self-published are first released in newspaper-esque comic collections in which every author whose comic gets in has a number of pages given and not one page more or less than that.

That's why they are so ubiquitous in Japanese comics, in any case. And the word does mean “extra”. As they generally tend to take on the form of “outtakes”, some people do enjoy adding those even when it is not necessary and likewise some people do enjoy reading them.
