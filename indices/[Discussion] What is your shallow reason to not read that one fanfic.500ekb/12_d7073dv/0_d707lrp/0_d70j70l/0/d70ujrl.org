I go with AU is when it's big changes, like Harry is blinded, Neville Is the chosen Jesus, Harry is actually salazar slytherin in disguise for the entire book. So AU changes a fundamental part, like chosen jesus, house, harry is a sexgod.\\
Whatif I think of as: Harry/someone argues that taking 50 points off for wandering around at night is terrible, Someone argues that going into the *forbidden* forest when there is something that is *killing* unicorns out there is a bad idea, Decides to go find the Mirror to see if Sirius isn't being tortured. So small changes that could change something big later.
