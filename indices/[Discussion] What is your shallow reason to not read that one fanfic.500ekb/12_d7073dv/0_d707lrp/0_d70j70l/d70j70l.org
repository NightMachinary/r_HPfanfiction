I think there's a difference between "What if" and a more traditional AU.

An AU is Harry is in a rock band. And not a wizard.

A What If is more like "What if Harry was blinded by one of his early adventures"? Or, more drastically, "What if Neville was the Chosen One"?

Personally, I prefer Missing Moments, which flesh out the story.
