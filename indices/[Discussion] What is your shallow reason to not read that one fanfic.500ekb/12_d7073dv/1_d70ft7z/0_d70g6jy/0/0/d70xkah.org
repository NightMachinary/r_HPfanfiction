There is a very thorough warning at the beginning of the fic. I rather enjoyed that one as well, as the theme is to show that even if truly horrific things happen to you, you can still heal.

I agree that glorification of some horrendous act is distasteful, but merely shining a light on a terrible act that happens all the time is acceptable in my book.

I can perfectly understand somebody not wanting to read about such a serious and unsettling topic. It's not for everyone.
