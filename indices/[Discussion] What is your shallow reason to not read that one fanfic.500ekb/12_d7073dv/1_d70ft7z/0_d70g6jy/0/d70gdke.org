Yeah, exactly. I read for fun.

I think the best example in my case is Yellow Submarine by DWP. You open it up and /BAM/ from the get-go there's the detailed description of the aftermath of a gang rape. I know a lot of people hate the words, but a trigger warning there would have been much appreciated.
