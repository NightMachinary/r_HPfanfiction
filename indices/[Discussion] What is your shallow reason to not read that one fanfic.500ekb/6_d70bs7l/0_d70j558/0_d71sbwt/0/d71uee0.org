Completely agree, it's the most dissapointing thing about HP fanfic in my opinion. You have this great universe and setting that isn't so fleshed out with rules and history that it's stifling for any creativity, yet there's also enough interesting elements there that can be played with. Yet most stories boil down to the same elements.

I'm actually reading a Harry centric fic atm because it took an interesting concept for me "what if Harry knew about the Horcrux inside of him" and the author was doing well in giving some character development based on this that you wouldn't usually see in a fic. However then the usual tropes started creeping in, Harry learning more was handled well rather than just "I need to read and become powerful!", there was a smart reason for it. Then out of nowhere his eyesights fixed and he's promising Hermione he'd study more and learn an art or musical instrument and that's made me put the breaks on because it now sounds like it's heading down the path 80% of Harry fics usually go. It's so frustrating.
