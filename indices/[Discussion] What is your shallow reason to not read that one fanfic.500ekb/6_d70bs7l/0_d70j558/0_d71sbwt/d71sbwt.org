Right there with you. I don't refuse to read fics where Harry's the main character, but I don't usually seek them out. I'm just kind of... tired of Harry. I want stories set in the HP universe that focus on something I haven't already read about 10 times before. I wish there were more OC-centric fics that aren't shitty self-inserts.
