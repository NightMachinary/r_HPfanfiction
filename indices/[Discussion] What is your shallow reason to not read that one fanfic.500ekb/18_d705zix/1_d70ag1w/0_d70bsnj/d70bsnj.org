Yeah, but what about the other characters I'd just listed.

I should had added that "names" can be extend to middle & last. Harry James Potter is a simplicity in itself, which somewhat creates a dissonance with his The Chosen One identity, 'cause his name isn't an OP kind of name.

I feel like I should add that I'm not into the regular OC names I used when I was little. Just creative names, not something that's commonplace. I don't know about y'all, but I once named one of mine Amity Goodwill....
