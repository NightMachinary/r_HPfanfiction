I'll start first.

Names. Dull, ordinary names. In some fanfics the OC's names are along the likes of: Tim, Sarah, Chris, John, Mary, etc. etc. In a world where the characters' names are Filius Flitwick, Pomona Sprout, Dolores Umbridge, Severus Sneip, Dumbledore, Weasley, Longbottom, and some are named after constellations and have hidden allusions at least try to make them distinctive. Especially if they're wizards, especially if they're raised in the wizarding world.

Creative names add authenticity to the story and to the HP-verse. I get peeved when there's not a drop of creativity in names-creating in a story, which is something I try to get rid of, because I'm sure I've reject a great deal of good stories out of a bizarre pet peeve >-<
