I don't really stop reading fics for shallow reasons - slightly OOC characters, lack of humour, lack of creativity, a few small facts wrong, spelling/grammar mistakes are no reasons for me to abandon a story, because I know how difficult writing is and maybe I'd miss out on an otherwise really good fic that way.
