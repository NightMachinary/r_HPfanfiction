It's because “prolouge” is a misspelling, similar to the “rogue”->“rouge” kind only the author doesn't get to use the excuse that the spellchecker ignored it because while “rouge” is a word in itself “prolouge” sure as heck isn't.

And typos in the synopsis or chapter names (when not deliberate for the sake of making a pun) are enough for some people to stop reading as soon as they start, as spellchecking those few words isn't really hard if they'd entertained the thoughts of spellchecking that thing at all (and if they hadn't, well ...).
