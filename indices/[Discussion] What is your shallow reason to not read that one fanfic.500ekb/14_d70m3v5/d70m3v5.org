If Harry isn't one of the prominent characters in the pairing, I usually skip over it. Usually, this isn't a problem since a majority of fics at least have Harry in the main pairing, but there are plenty of notable non-Harry ships. For example, Hermione/Snape. For some reason, the idea that Harry isn't some part of the focus weirds me out for whatever reason.

Also, if a fic is already longer than around 250k words. I don't think that I usually have enough time to finish those works.

Last but not least, I just don't read slash. Even if it's well written or whatnot, slash really isn't my thing.
