I don't think you know how the auto mod works. You can set it up for your sub as you see fit. In this case it was set up to flag all posts that mention the word "smut" as NSFW. Which is a very basic way to do it. Since it also flags posts asking for "No smut please" as NSFW.

But at least the bot message says it itself:

#+begin_quote
  This bot is not very smart, so don't be alarmed if you don't think your post actually violates the rules.
#+end_quote
