This was an idea I had for a project I never ended up writing, but did end up using it for a tabletop setting.

The way I think of it, the technical definition would be something like "A method to describe and analyze the magical components to an otherwise deterministic world." In other words, it's capable of finding fate and meaning in events using magical math. Somebody like Hermoine would reject it on the grounds that she views the world as a rational place with magic tacked on, where Arithmancy describes the world in a holistic manner - seeing no difference between the strictly mundane deterministic reality and the mystical power of meaning and fate. It's self-contradictory, presenting ideas like free will as something you can consistently describe and predict, while not actually opposing free will as a concept within its own framework. Accepting that contradiction and moving on from it is a major part of what makes a good arithmagician.

In practice, it would be wacky math. You would have brand new operations that work with a number's tone, color, mood, or any other adjective you wouldn't normally associate with a number. You might have narrative-like constants, such as the "sacrificial hero," a tone which appears consistently in events to shape the final outcome, and those can be put right alongside normal numbers and used in mundane operations. The mundane math and the mystical numerology-like components would work in concert, and could not only accurate describe what an event actually was in a magical sense, but to predict possible futures based on known current magical components.

It would look similar enough to mundane math that a muggle mathematician would immediately recognize it as math-like, but most of the time, it would be formatted differently. Entire chunks of a formula may not even follow normal order of operations, because some of the mystical operations change even that. The final product could even be animate, if what the arithmagician was trying to describe was complex enough. That would certainly cause a regular mathematician to throw their hands in the air and give up, but nonetheless, it's still fundamentally a mathematical system.
