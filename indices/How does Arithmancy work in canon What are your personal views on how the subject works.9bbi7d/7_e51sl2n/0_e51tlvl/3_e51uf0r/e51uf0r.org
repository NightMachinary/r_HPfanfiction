If you believe the spell invention side of arithmancy I feel like in curse-building many magical security systems are custom made for the places they protect, which means there isn't a general all purpose "Finite Incantatum" to get through them but rather a curse-breaker would have to derive their own counter-curse and make sure it doesn't trigger any fail-safe curses that blow them up whilst doing so.
