Most likely it's just the wizarding version of probability theory. However, fanon versions of it are much more interesting (spell creation is fun to do when you don't die), so long as we don't get shit like defeating Voldemort by solving an arithmantic equation...

So I suppose it would be useful if you want to work at Gringotts or in whatever the Minsitry's records department is.
