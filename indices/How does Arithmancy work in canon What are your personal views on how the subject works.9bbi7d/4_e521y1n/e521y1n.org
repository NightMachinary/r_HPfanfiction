I imagine arithmancy as the "hard science" version of divination. Divination which is very concrete, strictly based in rules and numbers, with consistent, predictable outcomes. But I'm also someone who really likes the idea that Divinations isn't just the Hogwarts version of astrology, i.e. it isn't just woo fluff but (with a competent teacher) is actually a functional branch of magic. So I see Divination as more of an art, often relying on instincts about what /feels/ correct, with lots of room for interpretation and a lot more flexible than Arithmancy. It also, due to that flexibility, has the potential to be much more powerful -- but inconsistently so. In this way Hermione's position makes a lot of sense, as others have said. Even putting aside that Trelawney is a hack who can't teach, Hermione would like that Arithmancy is very predictable and logical and rules-based, and she'd see it as more valid because of that. Kind of like how people get very up-in-arms about hard vs soft sciences and write off "soft" sciences (or the humanities) as worthless.

Arithmancy could be useful for predicting outcomes of actions/paths, and making decisions based on which is more likely to be successful/more powerful/whatever. I can actually see that being useful for the usually fanon applications of arithmancy in spell-crafting or potion-inventing. One could use numerological translations to deduce which incantations/ratios of potions ingredients/steps are most optimal or are most likely to be effective.
