I really don't see Hermione becoming anything like Lord Voldemort. It certainly makes for an interesting head canon, but I don't know where this comes from and I've seen it posted multiple times. Hermione's qualities of loyalty, bravery, and selflessness are much more evident than power hungry, manipulative, and ruthless.

I don't think Hermione would have became a Dark Lord if she didn't make friends with Ron and Hermione, it certainly would be a possibility but I would be surprised if she became that way. Tom Riddle had a much different childhood, from what we know about Hermione she loved her parents and they loved her. During these formative years they couldn't be more different.

I think you are missing a link to the analysis by obversa.
