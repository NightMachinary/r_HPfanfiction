I don't know, while I think she does have nearly enough potential to be as talented. I mean, this is Hermione, I can't see her being a dark lady or whatever it's called. I can, however, see her as someone whose views on justice were so extreme, that she became notorious for being harsh and cruel. Someone who goes by the ends justify the means. Kind of like Barty Crouch Sr like someone already mentioned.

I just don't see her being like Riddle in the sense of hating muggleborns, as she's one herself.
