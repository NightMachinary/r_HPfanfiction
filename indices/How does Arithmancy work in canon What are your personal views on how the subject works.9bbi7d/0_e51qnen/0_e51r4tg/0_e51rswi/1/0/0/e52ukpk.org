  I don't know, while I think she does have nearly enough potential to be as talented.

Well...she /did/ become Minister for Magic at an earlier age than what Slughorn predicted for Tom Riddle, and she had an enormous impact on helping to reform the Ministry of Magic, wizarding law and government, etc. I'd say that should count for more than enough potential to be as talented as, if not /more/ talented in some areas, than Tom Riddle.

  I mean, this is Hermione, I can't see her being a dark lady or whatever it's called.
#+end_quote

Yes, she's Hermione. I'd also point out that, according to pathologists, [[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5gjbqk/we-asked-a-pathologist-a-bunch-of-questions-876][almost everyone and anyone is capable of murder]], as well as other dark acts, under certain circumstances. Even if you can't personally see her doing such things, she's certainly capable of it, especially in a scenario where Harry and/or Ron had been killed or threatened.

To me, Hermione could also turn Dark if, like Voldemort, she believes it is "the right and just thing to do", and if she truly believes what she's doing is "right". Like you stated, this approach would be "the ends justifies the means".

  I just don't see her being like Riddle in the sense of hating muggleborns, as she's one herself.
#+end_quote

I agree here. I don't think Hermione could ever hate other Muggle-borns.
