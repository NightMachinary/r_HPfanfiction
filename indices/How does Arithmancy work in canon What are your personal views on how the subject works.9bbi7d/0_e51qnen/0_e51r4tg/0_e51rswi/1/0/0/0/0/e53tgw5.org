  Hmm, is Cursed Child canon though?

J.K. Rowling:

  The story of #CursedChild should be considered canon, though. @jackthorne, John Tiffany (the director) and I developed it together. [[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/615498601809211393?lang=en][(Source)]]

/Cursed Child/ was also recently [[https://wizardsandwhatnot.com/2018/04/30/you-cant-say-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-isnt-canon-anymore/][added to the official timeline of the /Harry Potter/ series on Pottermore]].

  I haven't read the books in a long time so if you'd prove me wrong on this I'd be grateful, as I like to believe she can also be as talented ;)

Of course! In the answer I wrote for Quora, and linked in my main reply, I went into detail about how, and why, Hermione can also be as talented, if not more so, than Tom Riddle.
