Hmm, is Cursed Child canon though? Either way, I don't think it requires magical power to become Minister. However, I do believe that Riddle is more talented, he's more creative and open minded, as well as more in tune with his magic than Hermione. He's supposed to be the most powerful dark wizard to ever exist. I don't think she's creative (Half Blood Prince book?) either but I haven't read the books in a long time so if you'd prove me wrong on this I'd be grateful, as I like to believe she can also be as talented ;)

That's an interesting study. I can see how a Gryffindor can turn dark as they can be overly chivalrous, and it isn't pretty but I just have a hard time believing Hermione would be THAT ruthless. Like you said, I'm biased, I can see how she's capable of it, but it's just my Hermione, so I can't see her being that morally unhinged. Well, she has Harry and Ron to take care of that, especially Harry.
