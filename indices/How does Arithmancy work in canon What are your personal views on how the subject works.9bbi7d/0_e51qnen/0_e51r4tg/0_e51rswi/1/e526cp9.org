  I really don't see Hermione becoming anything like Lord Voldemort. It certainly makes for an interesting head canon, but I don't know where this comes from and I've seen it posted multiple times.

It comes from me, seeing as how I wrote the original in-depth analysis of both characters, including listing all of their many similarities in the books. You can read the full post [[https://www.quora.com/Since-Hermione-was-such-a-talented-witch-do-you-think-if-she-was-evil-she-could-have-been-as-bad-as-Voldemort/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][here]].

Addressing your mention here:

  Hermione's qualities of loyalty, bravery, and selflessness are much more evident than power hungry, manipulative, and ruthless.

A close re-read of the series reveals a Hermione that clearly has Slytherin qualities. They're also apparent in PS/SS from the start, albeit in a more subtle manner, and become more obvious as the series progresses. I cover these traits in Hermione's character and development in my close-read analysis [[https://www.quora.com/If-Harry-Ron-and-Hermione-had-not-been-in-Gryffindor-which-houses-would-they-have-wound-up-in-and-why/answer/Amber-Goldsmith][here]].

"Power hungry, manipulative, ruthless" are all negative traits, and are typically on the extreme end of Slytherin house. However, the vast majority of Slytherins, and even Tom Riddle himself, do not fall into this rather one-dimensional depiction. The books are quite clear that, when Riddle was at Hogwarts, everyone thought he as a charming, prodigial wizard and a "golden boy". Even Dumbledore admitted respect for Riddle's "brilliance" in COS.

While the reader knows that Riddle has these traits, they were not at all apparent when he went to school, or even for a time after he graduated. The same could be said of Hermione: the reason why many readers overlook her Slytherin qualities is because she typically keeps them carefully hidden.

Yet Hermione's ruthlessness - as seen with her treatment and attitude towards Rita Skeeter, Marietta Edgecombe, Dolores Umbridge, and even Severus Snape (she set him on /fire/ in PS/SS, with absolutely no remorse, second thoughts, or qualms) - is also one of the aspects of her character. Her ambition is also quite clear, even in PS/SS, where she mentions wanting to be in Gryffindor "because that's Dumbledore's house"...and Dumbledore is a great, accomplished wizard.

Also, Hermione /is/ manipulative at times. She literally manipulates Gilderoy Lockhart into giving her a pass to the Restricted Section in COS, using the same technique that Tom Riddle is later shown using on Horace Slughorn to get information on Horcruxes in HBP. In OOTP, she also uses manipulation in order to put the secret hex on the DA sign-up sheet, copy Tom Riddle's spells and tactics, and to trick Umbridge into going into the Forbidden Forest.

Before that, Hermione tricked Rita Skeeter in her Animagus form in GOF, and used the Time-Turner in POA while manipulating (even gaslighting) Harry and Ron in order to keep her use of the object a secret. In COS, Hermione used manipulation (Polyjuice Potion) in order to help get Harry and Ron to sneak into the Slytherin Common Room, etc...

  Tom Riddle had a much different childhood, from what we know about Hermione she loved her parents and they loved her.

I'd point out that this is speculation. We don't really know all that much about Hermione's parents, and there are some indicators in the books that suggest that Hermione increasingly isolated and distanced herself from them as the books progressed.

Hermione spends the vast majority of the summer before second, third and fourth year with her parents, and some Christmas holidays. However, after that point, Hermione is shown increasingly spending time with Harry, Ron, and the Weasleys, instead of her parents or Muggle family.

There are also hints of Hermione's increasing distance from her Muggle parents as early as GOF as well, where she seems to be more emotionally volatile and easily upset than usual. We also never see Hermione writing letters to her parents, or discussing her parents and home / family life with Harry and Ron, in the books or films.

[[/u/OwlPostAgain]] wrote a great analysis of Hermione's drifting away from her parents on this thread [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/1bmlxu/why_is_hermione_at_the_weasleys_earlier_than/][here]], which also falls in line with what's hinted at and shown of her character in the books.
