I think its like it is in canon.

Hermione likes logic. Action leads to result. She can see the connection, she can understand it. If she does the correct wand motions with the correct pronunciation the spell works.

Trewlawney doesn't do anything. She just says things. Hermione can't see the process so she can't understand it. Divination by numbers could be seen as statistical likelyhoods. Actions have probabilities, framed like that Hermione can see a process. Its not nonsense and waffle. She works through the task and gets an end result.

Hermione is a muggle with a wand. She likes her logic. She doesn't like the more magical bits of magic. When Dumbledore called music a magic beyond all we teach she likely thought Dumbledore likes music. It is possible that there is magic in music. The love and sacrifice that Lily protects Harry with is vague, there is magic that is hard to understand that exists without a dedicated process but Hermione likes process.
