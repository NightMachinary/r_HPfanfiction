My headcanon is that arithmancy is magical diagnosis. You need it to create spells, you need it to understand spells and its effects. Take broom making for example. You can use a levitating spell to make a broom float. But for precise steering and auto-leveling, you need arithmancy. Similar uses in curse breaking and medical applications. Applying it you can visualize magic as a logical entity, a function or an equation that you can analyze and manipulate. I also believe that floos addressing is similar to IP addressing. But here for each address you use arithmancy.
