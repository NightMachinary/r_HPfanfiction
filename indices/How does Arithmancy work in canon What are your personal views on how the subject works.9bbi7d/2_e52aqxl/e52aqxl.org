  I've often seen Arithmancy used in fanfiction as a subject that helps you with spellcrafting. I think that's unlikely, however, as it would be a core class of it were that useful.

Why?! There's no reason the average Wizard needs to create his own spells *ever*. Wasn't Luna's mother a Spellcrafter? Seems super dangerous, another reason never to do it.

I think Arithmancy is so vague in canon that you can make of it whatever you want as long as it is cool and interesting. At this point I don't give a single shit about minor inconsistencies with canon.
