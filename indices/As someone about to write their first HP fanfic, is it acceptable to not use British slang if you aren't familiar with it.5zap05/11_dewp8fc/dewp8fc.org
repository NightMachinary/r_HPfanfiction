I just think that what you should do is to be aware of some differences in vocabulary. Soccer being Football in Britain, to name one of the most famous examples.

Everything else is just "nice to have", but not necessary. I wouldn't pander to people who go on the elitist-rant about the britishness of the HP fandom, not even mentioning the fact that a foreigner using some of the british slang may even sound a tad bit cringey.
