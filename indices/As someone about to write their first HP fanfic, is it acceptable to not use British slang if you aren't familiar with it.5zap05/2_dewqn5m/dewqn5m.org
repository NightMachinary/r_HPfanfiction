The simple fact that you're taking the matter into consideration is promising enough, to be honest.

Beyond that, I wouldn't worry too much. Simply avoiding Americanisms should be your priority, as opposed to replacing them with "Britishisms". Unless you plan on inhaling hundreds of hours worth of TV/radio shows, that particular rabbit hole is too deep and murky to bother.

Case in point:

"You might wanna stop givin' it all that if you ain't lookin' to get bottled, sunshine."

"Ey jam yuh hype, rudeboy! I'm a skeng man, unuh... /(kisses teeth)/"

Both examples derive from the same region and mean more or less the same thing. Vernon Dursley lives about half-an-hour away by train and wouldn't be caught dead saying either (though his adolescent neighbours might).

So as long as your characters aren't eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while jaywalking with their pants sagging, you should be cushty.
