Yes, it's alright to stick with what you know. Some people here get really elitist about that kind of crap, and if it's what you prefer in your fiction then fine, but "Americanisms" have zero impact on whether or not your fiction is good. It's all about preference.

Now, if you WANT to go the extra 10 miles and research British slang/euphemisms and find a British beta, that's awesome too. But in the end, it really is just personal preference.
