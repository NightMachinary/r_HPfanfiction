  what really bothers me is when the plot revolves around very american issues: such as paying for medical/healer care, or school.

There are some aspects that changed over time, such as gun ownership laws, which were much looser in 1991 than they are today. (That's why Vernon Dursley could get hold of a shotgun.)

The NHS wasn't founded until 1946, after Tom Riddle graduated, so if you're writing about the Grindelwald war, you can write about private insurance.

On the other hand, you also have things that are common between modern UK and modern US that changed over time -- for instance, rationing was in effect in the UK for a decade past the end of WWII.
