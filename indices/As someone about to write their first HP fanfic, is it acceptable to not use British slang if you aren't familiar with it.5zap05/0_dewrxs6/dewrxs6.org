not so much the slang, you can try to avoid americanism while not necessarily including british slang. what really bothers me is when the plot revolves around very american issues: such as paying for medical/healer care, or school. or when they eat exclusively american foods. it breaks the "suspension of disbelief". i know it's weird, but people eating alfredo pasta bothers me more than owls and broomsticks...
