Always happy to help with Brit-picking. I've beta-read for a few different authors and some want to get things perfectly British while others really aren't interested.

Personally, as long as things aren't /too/ glaring I don't mind some Americanisms but when Harry's saying "gee mom", eating waffles for breakfast and talking about what he's going to do in the "Fall" it breaks the feeling of immersion I have with a good story.

Rowling didn't use very much slang in the books so if you keep your characters similar to the way she wrote them you won't go far wrong.
