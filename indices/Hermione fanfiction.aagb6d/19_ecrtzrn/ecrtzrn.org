I've written a few short stories with Hermione in them, playing various roles from lead to wingman/best friend. Nothing with a deep-running plot, instead the focus is on the characters and their interactions.

In /Under Guard/, Hermione has a run-in with Tonks and develops a crush (femslash, obviously).

/Bad at this/ is my take on the whole "friends with benefits" idea after I got fed up with too much angst within that subgenre. Not explicit.

And /Drool/ has Hermione as friends with both Harry and Fleur, so she sets them up for the Yule Ball. Mostly comedy.
