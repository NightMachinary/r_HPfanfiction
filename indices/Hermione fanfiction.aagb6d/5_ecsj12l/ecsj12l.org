Almost all of my suggestions will be Harmony or no pairing. There is exactly one Dramony I enjoyed, and it was one where canon Hermione got sent to a reverse universe where good guys are bad and bad guys are good.

*Main character*

A little Child shall lead them is gold. Baby Hermione fixes everything. WARNING: you will cry at chapter 5 linkffn(10871795)

Escape is great fun where Hermione sees a marriage law and nopes all the way to America. linkffn(11916243)

Patron was already mentioned.

*As a shared main/secondary character*

One of four dimension lost characters in Stages of Hope. linkffn(6892925). Great war weary Hermione.

One of three main characters in Sum of their parts. Very true to canon characterization: linkffn(11858167)

*As a secondary character*

Nice supportive Hermione (with unrequited love) in Sand in the hourglass. Sequel is set up for her to be a main character. linkffn(12188150)

Not Hermione centric, but Red Knight has a very interesting broken Hermione linkffn(12141684)

Note: These are all AAA quality fics that I can recommend to every fan. If you want, I can dig up some of the grade AA, A, or BBB fics (on my follow but not fav list)
