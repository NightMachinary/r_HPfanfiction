I forgot to add one of my favourite Hermione fics of all time - [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=661&chapno=1][Hermione, Queen of Witches]].

This fic follows canon from the perspective of Hermione writing in a diary that interacts with her. I don't know how to describe it more appealingly but it was a really thorough and interesting way to look into canon events from another perspective and I didn't find it dull or repetitive at all.

Unfortunately it was abandoned at the 5th book which was a real shame but it's a fantastic fic all the same.
