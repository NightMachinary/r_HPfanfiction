Well, a lot of the tropes which make Malfoy an insult to good fanfiction are impossible with a female version of him. So it would most definitely be an improvement.

Or let's put it that way, a fanon Fem!Malfoy would be slutshamed into oblivion and not called sex goddess. A twelve inch cunt would be a really odd description. And abs aren't part of the female beauty ideal (even though they look awesome on women).
