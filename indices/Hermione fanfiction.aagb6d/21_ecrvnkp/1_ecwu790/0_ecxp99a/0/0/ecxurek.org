I understand what you're saying, but the point I'm trying to make is, essentially, this: some of the men that I've been with, either short-term or long-term, are men that â€˜canon' me wouldn't be with in any way. I know Hermione's personality is made quite clear in canon, but it also leaves a lot to be explored. I can't believe that a woman of her type would be satisfied with Ron. Whilst opposites attract, there do need to be some common interests and they have little beyond Harry and the war. Hermione and Snape have more interests in common and, in my opinion, more compatible personalities; such as a love of books and an ability to read, sitting in silence, for long periods of time without the need for constant conversation.
