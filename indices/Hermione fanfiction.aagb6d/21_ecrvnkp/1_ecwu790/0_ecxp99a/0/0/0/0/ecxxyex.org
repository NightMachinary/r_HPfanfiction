I disagree with you on many of those points. And I'd like to bring up the theory of Snape having Aspergers, but it's 2019 here and I would like to go to sleep. I obviously didn't list all of the reasons that they would be compatible because that would be a fairly long list and it was already late at night when I joined this conversation. Let's agree to disagree.

In future, maybe make a separate post in the sub for questions like the original one, which I didn't get to see, but would assume is similar to the comment I responded to, rather than making the comment on an existing post where you are likely to receive nothing but downvotes because you may come across as attacking people's personal preference.

Edit: Your question/opinion would have been appropriate on a ‘Discussion' thread, but is not suitable for a ‘Fic Search' and recommendation thread.
