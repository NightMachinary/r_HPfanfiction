Yes, but they are still not compatible. Snape will never truly get over Lily, nor can I see him looking at Hermione that way. Period. Also Hermione is someone who'd probably go for Draco before someone like Snape. You can't just point out a few things they have in common, and expect for a relationship to spring up. They're are way to many people out in the workd for both Snape, and Hermione. What your doing is thinking of it in a way as if there is no-one else, but the problem is that Snape would probably never get into a relationship, and Hermione without(forced in my opinion) Ron is more likely to go out into the world, and explore it. Snape, and Hermione are just too different, and at two wildly different stages in their life that forcing them together is incredibly unlikely, and too unbelievable unless you change their characters a lot.

Their age is also something that'd be difficult to overcome, because even if she's 18, Snape is still much older than her, and Hermione(unlike you) has in no way shown even the tiniest flicker of interest in older man. So again, unless you make changes to their core characteristics, and the story to explain it, it'll not be in any way believable.
