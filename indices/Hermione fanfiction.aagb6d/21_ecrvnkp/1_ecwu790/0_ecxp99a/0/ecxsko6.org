That's all good, and well, but the argument i'm trying to make is that canon Hermione wouldn't do that in any way. It's fine if your into that, and writing a story based around that is fine too, but if someone's going to make a Snape/Hermione story(or Riddle), you've got to change the characters in a major way. Either by changing the story, or the core character itself, butt it has to be donein a believable way otherwise it'll be a poor quality story.
