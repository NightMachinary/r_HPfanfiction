I'm gonna just point out a technicality here. Hermione in canon was at least 17 years old in 6th year, which, in the Potterverse is the wizarding age of majority. If you have issues with this, she could quite plausibly be 18 during sixth year, which voids your underage argument entirely.

As for why so many people like the pairing, I, for one, have daddy issues and my relationship with authority figures (males particularly) is difficult. I have never slept with a man who is not my type, but, and this may be TMI, I have been whipped and tied by men 20-30 years+ my senior, and I have played with them in a sexual capacity without any intercourse. It's a lot to do with what the person can provide you and what you can give them. In my case, if you're holding a whip, I'll wait until I've assessed your skill with it, then I'll probably approach regardless of age or appearance.
