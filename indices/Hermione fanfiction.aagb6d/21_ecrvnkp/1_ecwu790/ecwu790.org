Wow, a lot of people seem to hate me stating the truth. Guys, it's ok for me to have a different opinion, if you disagree with it, let's talk about it like normal rational adults. Don't just go the passive-agressove route, and downvote me. That solves nothing. I mean you do all know that canon Hermione as a character would never even think of Snape, and Riddle in that way. You do also know that they are both killers minimum, and you also know that unless she's left Hogwarts at the time, she'd be underage. I don't get what's so hard to understand about that. Are all the downvoters fans of such disgusting pairings(to me), or do you guys just hate the truth. I'm honestly curious, why all the hate?

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
