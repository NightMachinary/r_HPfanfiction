It's not that. He's free to enjoy whatever pairing he enjoys, i'm just trying to point out the problems that come from such a pairing to both the OP, and anyone who reads this. Not trying to hate, but i'm pretty sure i'm allowed to post my opinion on these requests, god knows it happens enough when I make requests, I took that to mean that it's generally allowed, and even encouraged. After-all, if everyone else can do it, why can't I?

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
