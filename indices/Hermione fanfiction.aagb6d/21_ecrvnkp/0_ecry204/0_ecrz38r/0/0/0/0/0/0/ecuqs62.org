Stop putting words in my mouth. I never said a story has to have no conflict, nor did I say that romantic partners have to match. No i'm specifically talking about why HERMIONE will not date SNAPE, and RIDDLE without severely changing the characters, and/or the story. If you honestly can't comprehend what i'm saying, then you truly have a pathetic understanding on how a story is structured, and how characters interact. Just save yourself the embarrassment, and shut-up, or continue making yourself look like the idiot you appear to be.

Thanks,\\
