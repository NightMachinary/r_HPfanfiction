You seem to believe that relationships are believable only if the partners are perfectly matched, close in age, have lots in common, and believe the same things. A young muggleborn would never have a relationship with an older blood-purist. Similarly, in real life, a young immigrant woman would ever marry a much older, extremely anti-immigrant politician, for example. Relationships like that just don't exist even in fiction, certainly not in real life. Even if they did, there would be no point reading about them. Stories are interesting only if they contain no conflict, and the characters agree on everything.
