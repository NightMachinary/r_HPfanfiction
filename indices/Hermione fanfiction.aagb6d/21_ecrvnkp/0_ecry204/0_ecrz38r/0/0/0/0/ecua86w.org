I know. Again not pointing out problems with people's taste, just pointing out why a relationship could not work between Hermione, Riddle, and/or Snape unless you change their stories drastically, and their core character. If you have basically canon Hermione from say fifth year all of a sudden develop a crush on canon Snape, it's not in any way believable. The actual problems are that if you don't massively overhaul the story, and/or the characters, it's not going to be in any way believable, which will make a very poor story(quality wise). I do hope you can understand the mechanics of creating a story, otherwise this discussion is pointless.

Thanks,\\
