You are saying that these pairings “would not make a good story” to someone who has already expressed a fondness for these stories. If you reread the original post, you might notice that it doesn't say, “I like these types of stories. Am I wrong? Please let me know if I am, and I'll stop reading them, because the last thing I want to do is like different things than random people on Reddit.”
