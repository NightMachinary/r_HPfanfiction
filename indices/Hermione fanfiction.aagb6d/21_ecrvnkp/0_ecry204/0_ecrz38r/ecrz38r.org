Why does anyone talk about stories. Book clubs exist so you can specifically talk about stories, and charactors. I talk about it, because I can't see a way to make such a pairing believable without seriosly changing the story, and their core personalities. It's not believable, therefore would not make a good story. I'm talking about it, because such a pairing also disgusts me. I could see Sirius dating Severus more believably than Hermione dating Severus, it'd also be less revolting, because of the whole not being half(and less) his age.
