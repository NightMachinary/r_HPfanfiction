  Instead of the one sentence, I got an argument about the ethics of intertemporal executions but still no answer why Hermione wouldn't kill Voldemort.

The ethical argument /is/ the reason why. You asked why Hermione would choose not to kill a baby who has not committed any 'evil' actions, and the ethical argument (nature vs. nurture, etc.) explains why it is rational for her to choose not to. Your question was answered; whether or not you can agree with the logic of the answer is a different matter.
