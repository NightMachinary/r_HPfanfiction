Well, to be fair, you do have quite the talent for getting yourself into these sorts of arguments. Possibly because /you/ keep bringing up Hitler all the time. Given the time period of OP's story, your question was certainly valid but at the same time... not everyone wants to read fanfiction dealing with real world Muggle issues. It's perfectly okay for someone to tell a story that doesn't deal with that.

OP clearly said that there would be future chapters dealing with this topic and that Hermione is taking Muggle issues seriously, sounds to me like anything more could be a spoiler. If this wasn't sufficient for what you would want out of a story you could have just washed your hands at this point and moved away from the argument.
