  Are you saying it's now Hermione's responsibility to ensure the Internet is created earlier?

No, I joked that she might as well deal with Hitler (and Stalin) because the internet was not yet invented so she might as well get going with that (since dicking around on FB isn't possible yet).

As for the Hitler question, what else would a time traveller in the 30s do? The main question was always about killing Voldemort, not what she does afterwards.
