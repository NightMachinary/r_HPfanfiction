That is an entirely unsatisfactory answer for someone in Hermione's situation for two reasons. It would have been valid if you dropped a random person in front of baby Voldemort who did not know Voldemort, but:

1) Hermione just lived through a war against Voldemort where she lost people she held dear. Voldemort, through Umbridge, was purging her entire people. Voldemort killed her best friend's parents, he and his supporters are behind pretty much everything wrong with the magical world. She would have been exposed to countless atrocities, taken many lives, lost friends and so on. Is that a good base for being merciful?

2) Hermione is the best example of "the ends justify the means" we get in the books. Just look at Umbridge, Marietta, Snape (in PS) or the Polyjuice plot. Hermione didn't even bat an eye at the illegality of that one. Dumbledore with his second chances might give Voldemort a second chance, but do you really think that the girl who underhandly cursed the DA list would have a moral issue with killing Voldemort, time travel or not?
