My traumatized Hermione just lived through a war in which innocent children were killed, just because of the way they were born. It really isn't a stretch for me to say that she would be extra opposed to baby-killing after that.

In canon, she put a curse on the DA list that people willingly signed. Baby Voldie didn't sign anything. He didn't ask to be born, or raised in an orphanage in which he never knew love. The situations are completely different. If you can't see that, I'm concerned about you.
