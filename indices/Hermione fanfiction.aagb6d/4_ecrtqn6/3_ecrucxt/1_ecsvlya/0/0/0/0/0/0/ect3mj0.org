First of all, your initial question very clearly included the topic of fixing the situation around WWII. Don't pretend you only asked about Voldemort, you brought this topic up yourself.

Secondly... what? Are you saying it's now Hermione's responsibility to ensure the Internet is created earlier? Very random, could've picked a million things to fix. Bringing back medical advances, ensuring that ancient knowledge is preserved, whatever. So why the point about the Internet? How would she even do something like that? It's not like the average person would have the required skills.
