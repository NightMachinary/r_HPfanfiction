I don't like time travel into the 30s/40s due to the historical clusterfuck going on. I don't mind the usual rewind back to 197X or 199X.

I originally asked the author for a one-sentence explanation for why Hermione does not murder a magical fascist leader when he is most vulnerable, especially considering the fact that Hermione came from after the war. Depending on the answer, I might or might not be interested in the story. Instead of the one sentence, I got an argument about the ethics of intertemporal executions but still no answer why Hermione wouldn't kill Voldemort.
