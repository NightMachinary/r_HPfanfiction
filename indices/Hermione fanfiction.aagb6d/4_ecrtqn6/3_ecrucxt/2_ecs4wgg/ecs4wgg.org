Exactly, even if Tom Riddle only had a 1% of chance of becoming Voldemort, the risk was already too high. Of course, the odds were magnitudes higher in canon.

A traumatized, time traveling Hermione would absolutely kill the young Tom Riddle. Anything less would be gambling with the lives of thousands.

I might advocate letting some other bad guys, such as Barry Jr and Bellatrix, off the hook for now and put them under observation first. But I will be totally merciless and paranoid when it comes to Tom Riddle, that person is simply too dangerous to be kept alive.

However, this does not make for a good story, so I'd like to go one step further. As the butterfly effect would have it, killing young Tom had the unpleasant consequence of Grindelwald winning. With Dumbledore dead and Nazis secure in power, Hermione must fix the mess she had unintentionally caused.
