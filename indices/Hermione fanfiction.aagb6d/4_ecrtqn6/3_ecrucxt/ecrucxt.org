In one sentence, why doesn't a war-weary Hermione simply kill Voldemort and focus on the more important things, namely that small business called Second World War?

Leaving Voldemort alive is nothing but gambling with the lives of his future victims, including but not limited to her best friend's parents. And why would Hermione choose a few hundred/a thousand magicals over 50 Million people? Her own grandparents were almost certainly involved in the war effort, so she has a personal interest besides preventing one of the greatest tragediin human history.
