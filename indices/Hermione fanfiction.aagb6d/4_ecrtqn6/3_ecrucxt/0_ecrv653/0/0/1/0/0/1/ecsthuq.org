And there isn't as much of a difference between domestic abuse and other crimes as you think. Most mass shooters are men who abused their female partners. If an abuser has access to a gun, he's more likely to kill his partner. If he has access to automatic weapons, he's more likely to kill more people. You can imagine what happens when he has an army, or a wand and fanatic followers. The difference is in what resources he has, not how evil his intentions are.
