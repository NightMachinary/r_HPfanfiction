The EU is nice, but I thought we were discussing a period of history several decades before it formed.

“Even if the government is wrong, usually other states will intervene at some point.” I just wrote a scene about flying brooms, but you're the one living in a fantasy world if you think that's how governments work. Governments aren't machines that automatically do the right thing, except for those rare occasions when an exceptionally evil baby like Voldemort or Hitler grows up to break the machine. When other states step in, it's to gain power, not for ethical reasons.
