Checks and Balances, or separation of powers, can be found in all states with EU membership, Switzerland, Norway and so on. And even if the government is wrong, usually other states will intervene at some point (eg Congo Free State).

If "Checks and Balances" is a purely American term then I would like to apologise for misspeaking, since I was taught that it is just a synonym for "separation of power" (Gewaltenteilung in my native tongue).
