But we aren't talking about randomly killing bad babies, we are talking about killing a very specific person to prevent the atrocities he will commit. Riddle had murdered at least 4 people by the time he was 16 and framed two people to lifelong sentences. No matter what you might think about nurture, neither the orphanage nor Dumbledore's parlor tricks taught him that.

And you seem to forget that by letting him live, Hermione is directly responsible for any and all wrongs he commits. And she came from a time where Voldemort had killed thousands, so from her point of view, she is killing the most dangerous person in magical Britain.
