We don't know what happened to the other kids raised in that orphanage. We do have lots of evidence that people raised in bad orphanages, or abusive homes of any sort, are, statistically speaking, much more likely to commit crimes than people who were raised in nurturing homes.

If your hypothetical ethical time traveler were to do as you advise and go around making the world a better place by killing babies, she'd mostly be killing babies who are fated to be abused children. Feel free to write your fanfic about Hermione the Ethical Baby-Killer, but I can think of better uses for a time-turner.
