I think you should stop reading fanfiction and start reading history. “Checks and balances” isn't some sort of natural law, it's purposefully built into the American constitution. It doesn't exist in many other countries. Even here, it is not a mechanism to ensure ethical behavior. All it does is address how our three branches of government share power. If all three branches agree on something unethical (slavery, Native American genocide, etc) there's nothing to stop them from committing all the atrocities they want.
