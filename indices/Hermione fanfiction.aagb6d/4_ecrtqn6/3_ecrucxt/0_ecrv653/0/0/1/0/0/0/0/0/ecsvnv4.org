You have this strange idea that the orphanage that raised him from birth to age eleven, and then every summer after, had no influence on him. Do you know what early 20th century British orphanages were like?

It's a wonder anyone came out of those places sane.

You're assuming that all that prejudice in wizarding society would have just sat there harmlessly if Voldemort hadn't channeled it. No one else would have stepped into the power vacuum, huh? Bellatrix would have just taken up knitting? Or would you have to kill baby Bellatrix too? And baby Lucius, and the Lestranges, and Barty Jr, and and and... How many babies do you have to kill to make the world a better place?
