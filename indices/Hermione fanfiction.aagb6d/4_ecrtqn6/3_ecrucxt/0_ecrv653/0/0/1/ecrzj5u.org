The difference is that Voldemort isn't just possibly dangerous, he is proven to do so. And leaving him alive is dangerous. One mistake, one second of inattentiveness might be enough for Voldemort to escape, to disappear. And then blood will be spilled. Unnecessarily, I might add, if a certain time traveller would have just killed the madman when she had the chance. Comparing that to crimes against humanity is just bad taste.

Voldemort had no qualms about killing Myrtle. He killed his father for being raped. He killed that Smith woman over a bloody cup.

Obviously, the orphanage wasn't an ideal place to grow up, yet the other children there didn't became genocidal fascists bent on racial extermination. That was pure Voldemort on his own.
