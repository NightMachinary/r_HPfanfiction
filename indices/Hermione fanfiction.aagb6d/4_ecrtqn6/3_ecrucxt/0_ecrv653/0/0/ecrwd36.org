You're advocating killing a baby who hasn't yet done anything wrong, because he might do wrong in the future. Some babies are just born evil, you seem to be saying, so the best thing to do is kill them. That happens to be the same argument actual Nazis used to kill actual babies in WWII. They thought they were improving the future by doing that. (Of course, they didn't have any actual knowledge of the future, unlike Hermione, but the logic was the same.) If you're that firmly on the nature side of the nature vs. nurture debate, you probably won't like my story.
