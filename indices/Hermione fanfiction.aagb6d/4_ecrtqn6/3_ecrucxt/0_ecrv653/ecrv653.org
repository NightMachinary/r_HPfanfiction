Yeah, there's a discussion about that in the story, although I haven't posted that chapter yet. I'm telling it from the point of view of the muggle Tom Riddle, and Hermione is keeping a lot of secrets from him, so readers don't know her whole plan. Rest assured that Hermione does take muggle events seriously.
