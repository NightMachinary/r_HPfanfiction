I know it feels rushed, but I have SO much plot to get through, it's hard to fit it all in.

I realize that after chapter 8, my readers must all want to rescue Hermione from those scheming Riddles, and possibly kill Tom. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but rest assured that after many convolutions of the plot, and some serious personal growth, this actually works out. I've written some dark stories, but this isn't one of them.

I should probably see the Fantastic Beasts movies, but I haven't even seen most of the Harry Potter movies. I'm more of a book person. From what I've seen from the trailers, the FB movies contradict some book canon, so I figured that trying to base my story on contradictory source material would be confusing.
