Makes sense. sounds like you've thought things through which is good!

Eh, the movies are worth seeing simply because there is no book form. Honestly, the material may contradict in points, but the plot/material isnt what you're watching the movies for - its way more about discovering the world of HP, the creatures in it, and the daily spells a wizard uses just to get around and live life. The plot is meh; the experience is great.
