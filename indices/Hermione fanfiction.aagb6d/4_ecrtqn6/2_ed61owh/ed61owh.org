Heya, just read this off the comment here and I'm up to the current chap. Such a well executed idea! I love how snobbish the riddles are - totally fits with cannon - and how well the family has integrated into wizarding society.

The only point of criticism that I can offer is that things seems a bit rushed/ time in the story seems too streamlined. Its hard to tell but it feels like only a week or two has passed in the story since she arrived, but they've DONE so much in the story that it feels jam packed with the wizarding culture, like she's been there months already.

Are you sold on the Hermione/Tom Riddle senior pairing? The more I explore Tom's character the more I dislike the pairing, honestly. I'd rather Hermione be a bamf and... I dunno, make waves as an inventionist, or teaching duelling, or duelling itself. You've set her up to go so far with her skills that pairing her to Riddle, to me, feels like locking her down. He's so derogatory to her, especially to her looks, and while its certainly probably a truth within the story, it doesn't make me look forward to the pairing. Perhaps just my past experiences of being needled at in a emotionally toxic way, but I just don't see the two of them being together particularly healthy.

Looking forward to when Hermione explains the future travelling, the lies are grating after a certain time lol. And no doubt the riddles will take every advantage they can from the future items (bag) and information that she has... Really want to see that capitalization, if it happens that way.

Really respect what you're doing here! You may want to check out the fantastic beasts movies for additional ideas of how to use magic in the everyday world. There are some really cool spells in those movies and while the movies themselves weren't that great, the glimpse into the life of a regular old wizard is invaluable to the imagination. They also play around with including muggles into the wizarding world and it's in the total opposite way that you do it - they don't blend in at all lol.

Thanks for writing!
