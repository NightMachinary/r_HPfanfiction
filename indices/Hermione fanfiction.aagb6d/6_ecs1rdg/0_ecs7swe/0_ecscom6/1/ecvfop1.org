Considering that I'd read almost all of your recommendations I thought I'd give Family Matters a go. It's a really fun story with an interesting plot but God it's so poorly written. The grammar and spelling mistakes are pretty bad but worse for me are the massive inaccuracies. At some point Hermione uses Evanesco */on herself/* what the hell? And too many plot points which are under-developed and rely on characters just being stupid, e.g. Harry and Ginny not carrying wands on them. Anyway, just needed to rant a bit cause that story could have actually been really good with some betaing, as it is I definitely think it's by far the weakest suggestion on this list. All the rest is awesome though!
