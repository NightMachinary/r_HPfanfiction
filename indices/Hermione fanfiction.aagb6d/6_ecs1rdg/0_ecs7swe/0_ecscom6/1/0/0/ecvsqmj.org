I'd still agree that it's a fun ride, it just feels like wasted potential I guess. It could genuinely be really good if the obvious stuff got fixed. And the plot is really interesting, not the usual stuff you see in SSHG stories - always good to get some more unique plots! I'm still gonna finish it (got a couple of chapters left) but I could only ever rec it with quite a few caveats.
