A) People are angry that that story is only Harry/Emily from Harry's side, or

B) People are angry that you would suggest that should be a pairing in that story you sick freak, he's like a badjilion years younger than her, practically a child, she's not a pedo (just a psychotic murderer sort-of-but-not-really seducing her prophecised opponent), or

C) People don't like that story, period, because it doesn't align with their vision of what should happen.
