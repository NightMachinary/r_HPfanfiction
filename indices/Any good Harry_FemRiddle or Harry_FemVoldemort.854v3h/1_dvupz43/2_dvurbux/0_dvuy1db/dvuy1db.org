If you count someone who's basically bipolar as the best, yeah, I guess. I'll consider her well written if she truly ends up as a master manipulator of Harry and doesn't really give a shit for him. Otherwise, it's two different people in the same body and I find it incredibly jarring to see Emily be all kind and loving and then kill innocents the next chapter.
