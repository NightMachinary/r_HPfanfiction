So, why the Trace didn't detect all the heavy, including unforgivables, spell casting in the cementery at the end of GoF?

It wouldn't have detected Harry, but it would have detected a lot of spells and curses around an underage wizard. The logical explanation is that a Death Eater at the DMLE covered it up, but Voldemort probably didn't have the ministry so infiltrated at that point.

Alright, yes, plot. Or maybe Voldemort knows a spell to block the trace. But that's another exception.
