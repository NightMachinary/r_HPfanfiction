Why is there a Trace? Because of the Statute of Secrecy. If there's an adult supervising, you don't need to alert the Obliviators automatically; the adult can make a reasonable determination. So the Trace just...doesn't fire.

And at Little Hangleton, there was an adult around supervising. Unfortunately, that adult was Voldemort.
