Why are people so adanant that Riddle's magic /didn't/ alert the ministry?

His uncle confessed, and he had the weapon of choice in his posession when they came to his address (after /somehow/ finding out about three magically killed muggles.) They might have thought that the Trace was just triggered by a muggle born neighbour or something. The case was closed, wasn't it?

EDIT: Dumbledore hinted at the trace going off, but not at it being Riddle who did the magic.

Also, if it was wand based, why didn't they just give Harry another wand et voil√†, he'd gone incognito?

EDIT 2: Canon is pretty obvious about the Trace being put on wizards not the wand. Moody said that Harry had the Trace on /him/, not on his wand.
