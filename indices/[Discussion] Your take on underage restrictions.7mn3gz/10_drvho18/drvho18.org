As far as we know, the Trace is on the witches/wizards, but it's not that it is by themselves but rather that it is a device or charm (most likely an enchanted device) that pings an area if there is magic done there and there are underage witches/wizardsm, and if there are also of-age witches/wizards then it pings that too and if they are Aurors nearby it just ignores the underage ping because why bother if there are Aurors on the spot.

If you go with that model then the ministry (or at least the monitoring device) could see that there is magic being done during the OotP thing but also see that there is an Auror on the spot and ignore it because either it's the Auror who is casting or it's the kid but the Auror will manage anyway since it's just a kid; likewise, since there were no adult wizards or witches and only one underage one in the vicinity when Dobby did his thing, the device would automatically assume it to be done by that wizard. Do keep in mind that the ministry doesn't seem to care about, or bother to monitor, house elves, and there is no reason for anyone to assume that maybe it was a house elf who used magic in an all-Muggle house because really why would they.

An important thing to note is that the restriction itself, at least in spirit, seems to exist as a precaution against casting of magic by those ill-equipped to deal with reversing any effects if there was a need when there is nobody who can aid them with that nearby. With that, there really would be no need to care about spells being done in the presence of Aurors because they are, or at least should be, good enough to not have any problems should something need to be reversed.

Going further with the theory, this (the fact that she would be pinging the trace if she was nearby them) was why Ginny did not go on the camping trip with the trio. Her resignation in this case would make less sense if she could escape the Trace by using someone else's wand, or if she could do so by simply not casting at all until it became necessary, but if she knew that she would ping the Trace just be being there and being underage (and considering that her father works, or at least worked, for the ministry, it would not be strange for her to know that much about the Trace), well ... that obviously would be enough of a problem to justify her not insisting that she wants to go with them when she obviously wanted to.
