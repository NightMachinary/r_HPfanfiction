Ok, this is how I understand it, the trace is first and foremost location based, if I recall there was something said somewhere that the trace can't identify who's casting the spell just that what was cast and where it was.

Going by this that means that the improper use of magic office has a detailed record of where students live so they can identify who cast the spell, what I imagine is that there's a giant map of Britain which has locations that light up when underage magic is being used locations like diagon alley, hogwarts express train line and hogwarts are just permanently lit up.

As for the Dobby case, I imagine that really strong magic near someone with the trace could trigger it, so Dobby's magic was mistaken for Harry's. And would explain what Mad Eye says in DH about not uaing magic around Harry as too many people would trigger it, while Tonks was able to use it in OotP as there was just her.

With the Tom Riddle case, maybe in his research into dark magoc he found some way to temporarily block the trace or renove it altogether, seem like something he would do.
