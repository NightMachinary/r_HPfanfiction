I think that trace traces magic performed where there shouldnt be any kind of magical activity or when there there is a sudden surge of magic and then they compare it to the closest magical child. Dobby- Sudden levitation charm. No previous instance of magic. Lumos while trying to escape dementors- There were dementors which are highly magical creatue. And the lumos was performed wandlessly(But doesnot explain how the patronus was detected. Maybe because it is such a powerful spell??) Tonks packing for him with magic- There were already witches and wizards present in his house. And i also think some wards also play a role somewhere. But i could also be making very wrong assumptions. What do i know? Just a simple muggle.
