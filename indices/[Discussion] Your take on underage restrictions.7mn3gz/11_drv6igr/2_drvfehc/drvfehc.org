It could also be that the trace just doesn´t work around wands that aren´t traced, like the trace on the wand can recognize other wands near it and deactivates itself for the time being. Though one solution that is very simple, if not very elegant, is that Dobby just somehow made his magic activate the trace in an attempt to keep him from going to Hogwarts. I actually kinda like the second explanation because it also explains why he didn´t get an expulsion letter after Harry blew up aunt Marge like a balloon, I know he wouldn´t have been thrown out because of politics, but an automated response should´ve come nonetheless. It´s just that only magic with a wand registers and accidental or wandless magic doesn´t, though the graveyard scene opens a anther can of worms.
