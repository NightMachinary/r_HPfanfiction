Of course, if people had to resort to such drastic measures, it would mean they were ready to go undercover and consider the Ministry an enemy.

As we later found out in DH, the Ministry was pretty much an ineffective paper tiger that was only capable of tyrannizing law abiding citizens. Their own aurors, for example Dawlish, got slapped silly left and right when people started resisting. Those Hogwarts kids, who had just a couple years of defense training, were already able to take them head on and prevail.

When the citizens finally rose up at Battle of Hogwarts, their combined force along with the Big Bad's minions got completely walloped up. The Ministry was such a joke.
