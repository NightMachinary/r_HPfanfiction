The Trace /is/ placed on the wand, but it does not detect the magic cast /from/ the wand --- instead, it detects any magic cast in the vicinity of the wand and sends the info to the Ministry.

Thus, Riddle could bypass the Trace by using his uncle's non-Traced wand if he didn't take his own wand with him and got far enough from it.

Meanwhile, Dobby in /Chamber of Secrets/ used magic while mere meters away from Harry's wand, so it tripped the alarm.

The /Order of the Phoenix/ example definitely has to do with the Order members preparing their trip in advance. If respected Auror Emeritus Moody sends a letter explaining he's going to be in that area casting some magic, but not to worry, he'll make sure the Potter kid doesn't, it's completely unrelated --- the Improper Use of Magic Office is probably going to take his word for it.
