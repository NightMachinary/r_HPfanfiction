Harry was caught because magic was done in /his/ house, close to him. (I imagine the trace having a radius of about a metre or so around the wizard, since their magic is done through a wand in their hand.) He did after all try to stop Dobby.

Tom Riddle, being the son and grandson of the muggles, probably would have been a prime suspect if Morfin Gaunt didn't confess as well as possess the wand used in the murders. They'd definitely check Tom Jr's wand.
