First of all, the Trace was not active in Wizarding locations at all. That should explain why:

- Hermione could use spells in Hogwarts Express and Diagon Alley without problems.
- Riddle could use magic to stun and memory charm his uncle.
- The Ministry Six could use magic inside the DoM without alerting anyone.

Second, it was heavily location based. The Ministry looked carefully at places where Muggleborns and Muggle-raised lived, that was how they caught Dobby and thought it was Harry.

Third, there had to be wand based tracking, just to get those kids trying to flash their magic in Muggle locations. I believe this was the way how Harry was caught in OOTP. However, when he wandlessly cast the Lumos a moments before, no alert was triggered. Since he was still some distance away from home, I believe the Trace activated here was not location based. Further evidence supporting wand based tracking was how Tom Riddle killed his father without settling off the Trace.

Finally in DH, Moody explained the Trace as trying to sense magic around underage wizards at all times. This explanation significantly violated several above mentioned cases. It also violated the cases where Tonks and Dumbledore cast several spells around Harry in OOTP and HBP respectively. IMO, JKR just wanted to force an aerial shootout and kill off more good guys. She even mentioned in her interviews that consistency in world building took a backseat to plot requirements in her stories.

As conclusion, I think fic writers have significant freedom in implementing the Trace in their stories. I personally favor a combination of wand and location based tracking as this implementation would explain the greatest majority of examples in the Books.
