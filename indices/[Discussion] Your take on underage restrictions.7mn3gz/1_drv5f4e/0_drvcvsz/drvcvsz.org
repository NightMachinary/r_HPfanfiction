I think it's simpler than this. It's always important to remember that Ministry /enforcement/ is not the same thing as /detection/. For example, they detect all magic cast during the school term but don't enforce against any of it because it's not against the law.

Another type of magic they don't enforce against is pre-Hogwarts magic.

And a final type appears to be redundant offences: they don't deliver you a notice per item of magic cast if you've already breached the law. So, for example, Harry only got a notice for his Patronus Charm, not his Wand-Lighting Charm. Tonks' magic seems to be another example of this.
