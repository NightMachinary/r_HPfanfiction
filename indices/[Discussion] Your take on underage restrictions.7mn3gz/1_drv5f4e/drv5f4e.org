I figured that Tonks works in the ministry and the improper use of magic office is a division of the DMLE where she works. She could have magically blinded it for the evening somehow or something. Easiest way?

However, maybe House Elves kind of use the magic of their surroundings? If a house elf was in a muggle household around only muggles, would their magic work properly? Yeah their magic works /differently/ but maybe they're just able to channel it differently. That would make it so that it was technically at least some of Harry's magic being used in CoS.

I honestly think it's a combination of location and person. Like a two way check. Do wizards live in x radius? If yes, not gonna worry. If no, check it out. Tonks /could/ have registered a wizard living next door or something.

Just ideas though.
