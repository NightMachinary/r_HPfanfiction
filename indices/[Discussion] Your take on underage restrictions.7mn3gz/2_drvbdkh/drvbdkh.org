Warning: a whole lot of thoughts, not yet edited for consistency.

The Trace is a charm applied to a witch or wizard when they get their wand. In cases where a child is given a family wand, the Trace may be applied by a Ministry official, Hogwarts professor, or wand-maker; the decree makes this a job responsibility, with fines for lack of compliance.

When magic occurs in the vicinity of the Trace, the charm checks to see if there is an exemption at the location; the Ministry applies these exemption charms to places of common magic use like Diagon Alley, the Ministry, St. Mungo's, all of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts. In addition, an adult wizard homeowner can get an exemption applied to their home for a modest fee.

The Trace will report what spell or effect was used and who else was present, but only by general type: muggle, underage wizard, adult wizard, Ministry official, or Professor.

At Hopkirk's office, the report is evaluated for possible violations: usually a violation is noted only if a muggle is present; a warning is issued if those nearby are all underaged wizards(or the Traced is alone). If there is a Ministry official or Professor present, the Trace is exempted.

The only vague situation is where there is an adult wizard present- the Trace may be designed to err on the side of caution and warn the parent or guardian of the Traced, or it may assume that the adult is in control of the situation and also count it as an exemption. More likely this is adjustable within Hopkirk's office depending on the level of threat to the Statute is currently set.

At a high threat-level, the underaged are essentially providing on the ground intel-gathering for the Ministry, except that wading through all the reports would be difficult.

If there was no known violation, the report is tossed/burned/otherwise ignored. In special circumstances (as when a Ministry official is interfering with Harry's life), the exemptions for adults, officials, and professors may be cancelled at a specific location 'as a security precaution'.

Accidental magic is not processed as a violation but also not tossed away. It's instead referred to the Obliviators squad (or rather the sub-department they report to) to evaluate whether they need to intercede. Much wandless magic registers as accidental. Apparation is a special case; if the Traced is involved in an Apparation, both ends are evaluated. If the Traced isn't present in both locations, the report is tossed. If the source or destination is in an Exempted zone, the report is tossed.

The use of enchanted devices is not subject to the Trace- Portkeys, invisibility cloaks, brooms, flying cars, and such don't set off the Trace. This also applies to potions and use of herbs and/or parts of magical beasts.

1st year problems: Hermione saying she'd tried a few spells without trouble. Possible explanation: she tried them whilst staying overnight at the Cauldron for immersion or she got to the Platform reeeaaally early.

2nd year problems: Dobby apparates in- no notice; Dobby lifts the pudding- notice, but only after dropping it on the Masons; Dobby disapparates- no notice; flying car finds Harry's house (how, exactly? It's not like they were given driving directions or had the internet...), flying car yanks out the bars on his window and flies off- no notice; Harry and Ron fly the car straight up from the lot near Kings Cross and across London- no official notice but Arthur is cited for the car (did he admit to owning it? wtf?) What's worse is that the notices themselves would AUTOMATICALLY make managing the use of magic in the presence of muggles HARDER to explain- not just because of the owls, but they're animated floating origami that talk! [film-version only, but still]

3rd year problems: Was Harry cited for detonating the wine glass? No. In fact he didn't get a notice at all despite having inflated his Aunt-in-law, even after taking the time to grab his trunk, inspect the suspicious hedge and then summon and board the Knight bus. If Fudge had a standing order to redirect any Potter incidents to his office, I might buy it, but it more seems like the Ministry only knew something was awry because a fat woman was floating around Surrey. Also, given what Stan said about the Knight Bus not needing to worry about being seen despite making anything in front of it jump out of its way, how much Obliviating is really needed?

4th year problems: none- all incidents are covered by Arthur's presence. Incidentally, this also demonstrates that the Floo can be enabled for ANY fireplace without even being touched... unless the prep has to do with a messenger owl dropping floo tracking powder down a chimney

5th year problems: cited for the Patronus but made no mention of Lumos. Also, WHY DIDN"T SOMEONE APPARATE IN to keep Harry safe and the Dursleys under control? Arthur and Albus had enough time to make their way in to the Ministry and argue his case- wouldn't it have made sense to send Molly or the twins (OK, maybe not the twins) or Lupin at least? They're all at Grimmauld, right? And then they let him sit and stew for 3 days before coming to pick him up?

6th year problems: Not for Harry, but the Gaunts were being confronted about magic used against muggles in the nearby village pub. How is it safer to allow muggle-hating inbreds who probably never went to Hogwarts or took the OWL exams to live near and taunt those muggles with magic, just because they're over 17? Did they get the Trace at all? Then there's the actual murder by Riddle using Morfin's wand... er, what? No, I think Dumbledore got that one wrong. Tom didn't borrow Morfin's wand and kill the Riddles himself. He cast the Imperius on Morfin while in the Gaunt shack and sent Morfin up to the house to do the deed. All investigations would reveal that Morfin, a known muggle-hater, had personally walked up, broken into their house and killed them. Morfin himself would (truthfully!) recount that he had done so, and any examination of his memories or use of Veritaserum would reveal the same.

7th year problems: the Battle of Seven Potters was predicated on the idea that the Trace would screw them up even if Harry was in the presence of an adult (even an Auror like Tonks or Shacklebolt!). What makes this hair-pullingly stupid is that Harry still ends up using spells in a running aerial battle. He lands first at the Tonks', then portkeys to the Burrow (outside its protections, mind you) yet receives no notices. They were so prompt in the past, too.
