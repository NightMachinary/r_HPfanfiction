Hold my beer, I think I can fan wank this. Year 1 The trace is applied on the Hogwarts express, Year 2 Dobby used his magic in a way that triggers the trace to help Harry in his own way. Year 3 wandless and accidental magic doesn´t trigger the trace Year 5 They assumed that Harry would be safe the next three days and he had one member as guard, while they needed time to assemble enough people to get him safely away. Year 6 I agree with the Imperius theory. Year 7 this one could be difficult, so they might fear that Deatheaters have access to tools that are used to track underage magic and a simple note that aurors are near won´t stop the the tools from tracking the magic, also they know the general location of Harry and are patrolling the skies to be ready to strike when he leaves or the protection runs out, so they used the seven Potters scheme, he again didn´t get a notice because of politics, because the order made sure, the ministry knows shit will go down. Also I think it would´ve been much safer to just call a cab or just get him somewhere else after year six, so he doesn´t have to flee from the Dursley´s in the first place grimauld place was relatively safe for a while, why not just send him there in the first place? Fuck the protection, it would´ve only been necessary if he went to Hogwarts, which I guess the order assumed he would go because, they probably didn´t know about Harry´s plan to skip his last year, so canon get´s that one I suppose...
