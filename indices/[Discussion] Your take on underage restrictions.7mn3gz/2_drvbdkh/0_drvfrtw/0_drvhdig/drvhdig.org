My take on that: Tom Riddle did go up to the house to evaluate his lost relatives on his father's side. After spying on them and coming to the conclusion that they didn't deserve to live, he headed back to the Gaunt shack with a plan forming.

Frank saw him during the day. The Riddles were murdered in their dinner clothes, at night (when Frank might miss Morfin sneaking up to the house), and found the next morning by their maid.
