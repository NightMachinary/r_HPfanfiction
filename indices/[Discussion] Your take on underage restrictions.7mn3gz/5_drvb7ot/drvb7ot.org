Mhm, well, let's consider this theory. House elves work by leeching magic from the bonded family. Since most purebloods have elves it's likely the lack of letters they receive isn't so much because of exceptions but because house elves doing their jobs will render the point moot. Now muggleborns don't have house elves neither do they know ownign one would be like having a waiver for underaged magic.

Now onto Dobby. Since he could produce Harry's signature it means he was already bonded to Harry at that point, which means this Dobby was a time travelling Dobby from the future that needed to set events going in a way that satisfies that future. So there we are: Dobby used some of Harry's magic to trigger a warning since ministry had no idea Harry "owns" a house elf.
