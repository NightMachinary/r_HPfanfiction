Ah! One of my favorite fics. The author deleted it off ffnet, but you can find it here: [[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_ginny/aon/a/1/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37]].

It's An Old And New World. Very amusing fic, with a ton of awesome shit. There's some grammar mistakes, but it's so entertaining you can easily look past them.

EDIT: actually, reading this version now and I swear it's a way better version than the one that was on ffnet, grammar- and formatting-wise
