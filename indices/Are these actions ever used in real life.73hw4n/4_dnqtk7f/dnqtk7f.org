Very common I think. Just lifting the hand up in a gesture to wait, hold on, give me a minute. Something like that.

  She laid her finger on my lips to silence me
#+end_quote

I'm sure it happens but that's pretty dang intimate and uncommon.

Going on a little tangent here, I feel like I see "she put a finger under my chin" in the context of making him look at her. I've definitely never seen someone do that in real life, I feel like it comes off as rather patronizing.
