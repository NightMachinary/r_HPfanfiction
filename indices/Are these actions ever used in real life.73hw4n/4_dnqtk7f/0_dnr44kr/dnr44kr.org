I think the patronizing nature really depends on the situation. Lifting someones chin with a finger could be a gesture that says "chin up high, nothing to be ashamed of" in a friendly, supportive manner. It could also be used to ascertain authority / dominance by directing the line of sight of someone. All depends on context.
