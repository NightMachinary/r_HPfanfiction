As someone who's done both in the past, the latter can be either a hand or a single finger held up, and I usually accompany it with a Mayes-ian phrase ("but wait, there's more") when someone expresses a strong emotion during a story I'm telling, while the former I've used primarily in very intimate situations to soothe a partner who is distraught, the best example being when they tried to apologise for "making" me "put up with" them in the aftermath an anxiety attack, and is usually accompanied by words of comfort.
