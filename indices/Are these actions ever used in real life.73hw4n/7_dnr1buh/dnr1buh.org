hand up : definitely. pretty much can do this for anyone you feel the need to interrupt.

touching someone else's face, especially a sensitive area such as the lips : only if you have a close relationship with the person and only then if it's the kind of relationship where it wouldn't be odd. if you wouldn't feel comfortable holding their hand to lead them somewhere then you wouldn't do this either as an example. i've done it before to a female friend, she licked my finger in reply, but she's the only person ever that i'd have done that too. wasn't a girlfriend but we'd hung out for years already.
