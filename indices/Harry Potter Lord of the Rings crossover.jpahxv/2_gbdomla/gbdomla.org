Copying [[https://reddit.com/comments/jk3w3t/comment/gaj4p1l][my comment from the last time this was asked.]]

Some of these are technically Hobbit crossovers, but I'm going to assume that's close enough.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous by Steelbadger) is a goofy crackfic about Harry getting sent to Middle Earth as an elf child and causing chaos and generally annoying everyone around him.

linkffn(The Unlikely Visitor by Quantumphysica) Sauron gets dropped into the Harry Potter world and has to learn to play nice.

linkffn(Five Istari and Four Warlocks by darienqmk) is mostly crack and general weirdness about an overpowered and immortal Harry, Ron, Fleur, and Katie exploring Middle Earth and causing a bit of chaos for about 1000 years. They finally reached the start of the Hobbit in the most recent chapter, but it hasn't updated since February.

linkffn(A Fate Touched in Middle Earth by Vimesenthusiast) is about Harry tagging along in The Hobbit. Updates are slow and irregular, but they're also large and they do happen.

linkffn(Incendio by savya398) Harry is actually Smaug's son.

linkffn(Steady is the Hand by rhosinthorn) is about an OC with some vague similarities (and even that is being generous) to Harry who follows Aragorn around like a puppy and has no real affect on anything in the story. It's good until you realize that Holly is pointless and nothing will ever change from canon. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, unless you just want to read an abridged version of LotR from an uninteresting perspective. But maybe someone will enjoy it more than I did.

And here are a few fics that I've read, but have basically no recollection of. They were apparently good enough for me to complete, but my standards may have been lower back then. linkffn(The Power He Knows Not by Steelbadger) linkffn(The Vanquisher by AJ Freas) linkffn(There and Beyond by SciFiFantasyWriter1)
