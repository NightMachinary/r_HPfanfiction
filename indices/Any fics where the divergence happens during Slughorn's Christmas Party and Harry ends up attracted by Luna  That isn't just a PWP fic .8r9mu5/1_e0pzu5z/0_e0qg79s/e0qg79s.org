By divergence, it means any point of the canon where the author changes and it become a butterfly effect in the story. Like in "Honour Thy Blood' where Harry is hit with the AK in the cemetery and is rescued by Arcturus, or like in "The Legacy" where because Harry finds an Occlumency book that Sirius left him, he discovers together with Dumbledore a way to bridge both parts of his splintered soul. Stuff like that. There's a huge amount of better examples, my brain just isn't working right now.
