I presume by "The Divergence" you mean something where Harry falls for Luna instead of Ginny? Well, I can't say I've ever heard that particular term used before, but as a longtime H/L shipper, I've seen quite a few of these.

"Loving Luna: An Epilepsy" by MayorHaggar - cute one-shot.

"Blame it on the Nargles" and "Wedding Wishes" by pixiestickers - two multi-chap fics, one set before the other, tracing Harry and Luna's romance beginning with Slughorn's party.

"She Who Hesitates" by pettybureaucrat - Harry and Luna share a goodnight kiss after Slughorn's party and then explore love and sex throughout their sixth year. Both characters are above UK age of consent.
