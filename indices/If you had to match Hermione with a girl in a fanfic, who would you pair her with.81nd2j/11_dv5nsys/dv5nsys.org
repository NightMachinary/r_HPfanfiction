Not someone her own age, for sure. She's academically ahead of her peers and runs rampant over them because she feels superior to them. Probably Tonks, because Tonks is funny, extroverted and fairly chill but has her own high-level ambitions, so they can mesh on the direction of their life goals while dealing with stress in different ways.

Hermione has a very grating personality, as someone else remarked, and I don't think it's easy coming up with a good match for her unless going with an opposites attract approach.

Fleur and Hermione are too similar, Tonks has some give to her but a spine of her own too.
