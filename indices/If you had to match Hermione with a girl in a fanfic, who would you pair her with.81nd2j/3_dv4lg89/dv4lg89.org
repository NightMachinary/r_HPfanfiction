Hermione is rather difficult to match with anybody. Luna, Fleur and Tonks could work well, if you go with opposites attract and have Hermione be a little hormone driven. Once they get through the initial clash of thinking methods (alcohol can help there, or being forced to spend a lot of time together), they could get along nicely.

Alternatively, someone studious could work, let's say Padma Patil or Penelope Clearwater. Not nearly as much potential for sexual tensions, but at the same time a lot less complicated.
