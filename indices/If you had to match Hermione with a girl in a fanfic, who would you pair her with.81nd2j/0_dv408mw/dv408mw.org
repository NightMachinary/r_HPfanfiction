I don't think that Hermione is "easy to put together with anyone," as you say. The opposite, actually. I feel that Hermione has a very grating personality actually, one that could easily come off as arrogant.

She is /very/ quick to criticise other's information if it's even the slightest bit wrong, Harry and Ron included. Take the "Wingardium Leviosa" lesson- Ron was seriously struggling, and so Hermione tried to help him. We (the readers) know that she was just trying to help, but Ron? He (understandably) misunderstood her intentions.

I don't have the book with me, but I remember her having a very "/Ahkshually/" way of trying to help.

Yes, that's only in the first book, and people change. But I don't recall Hermione actually changing in that respect. After the troll later that day, Harry and Ron very quickly befriended Hermione, and friends often ignore the parts of their friends they don't like in favor of the parts that they do.

Admittedly, I've gotten a bit off-topic here, so I'll try to get back on track. Maybe Ginny? They both seem to be good friends, and Ginny is supposedly an argumentative person (I can't remember if the text supports that- I believe that JKR had to clarify), and Hermione would most likely prefer someone who would be able to hold an argument with her that would require her to think.
