I think this only holds true if you go out of your way to keep personalities canon. In fanfic, you have license to change anything you want, keeping in mind of course that going too far from canon just means you'll be writing original fiction in a Harry Potter skin. But a lot of fanfic--regardless of how good it is--does stray from canon in /plausible/ ways, imo, that could reasonably result in changes in personality that would, for example, make Hermione more compatible with a wider range of relationships.
