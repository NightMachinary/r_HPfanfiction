I can't really think of a female character in the book that would work well with her without changing either of the character's canon personalities. Maybe Ginny? She has no problem standing up to her when she's being arrogant/annoying, but I feel like they'd still definitely get sick of each other. Luna/Hermione doesn't make sense and they didn't seem that close in canon anyways.
