Not OP, but this scepticism makes for great plots, like Hermione coming along on one of those magizoology expeditions to prove Luna wrong and they find an entirely new species in the forests of Dalarna or Hermione and Luna meeting earlier (like 2nd or 3rd year) and having a positive impact on each other. Luna becomes a little more grounded, Hermione a little less tight and they apply the scientific method to Luna's animals, going onto expeditions in the Forbidden Forest while dismissing the more nonsensical ones.
