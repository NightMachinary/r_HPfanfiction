From Angua's essay on the Sugar Quill:

  Ron, from early in Book One, is nettled and infuriated by Hermione's talkativeness and argumentativeness, and cannot resist responding to her verbal challenges, even at times when he is supposedly “not talking to her” (SS115/154, SS115/155, PA175/236, PA203/275). Harry can ignore or avoid Hermione to escape her arguments, but Ron consistently rises to her bait. In the classic comedic tradition, he finds the challenge irresistible, leading to Ron and Hermione -- as Harry puts it -- “always having a go at each other” (OP21/235). Being talkative himself, and from a large family of verbally aggressive people, Ron is not put off by Hermione's talking style the way Harry is. Like Hermione, Ron is surprised and offended in Book Five when Harry says their arguments are annoying (OP212/235). Like Hermione, Ron gets so wrapped up in their bickering that he becomes oblivious to their surroundings and Harry has to shush him (SS116/156 and 117/157, GF460/531) or he is surprised by a teacher (GF446/514). And, like Hermione, Ron can frequently be seen enjoying their contests of verbal one-upmanship. He has the quick wit and comic timing to match Hermione in her verbal aggressiveness, to tease her, to play Benedict to her Beatrice. Ron enjoys it, at least part of the time. Harry, obviously, doesn't.
