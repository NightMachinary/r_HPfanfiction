Thanks for the input. I think I do have an issue here and it's more clear now that I write about it. I usually use "Uncle Bill" and only rarely "Rose's uncle" for instance, since that's how Rose would think of him, and feels almost like touching on first person. On the other hand, I always do "Rose's grandmother" and never "Grandma", unless it's inside a dialogue. I guess I need to be consistent, use "Grandma" outside of dialogue once in a while or never use "Uncle Bill" outside of dialogue. I think I'm just unsure of what's the best way to go from a third person POV, not sure if the "Grandma" thing feels too first-person and should leave it for thoughts and dialogues only.
