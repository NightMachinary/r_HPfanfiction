For me, it depends on how the character is feeling about that relation at that particular time. When I write from Sirius's POV he nearly always refers to his parents by their first names, but when he's feeling particularly melancholic he'll refer to them as 'Mother' and 'Father'. Regulus is the other way around, they'll always be 'his mother' or 'his father' unless he's feeling distant from them or aggrieved by them.

As for capitalisation, the rule I use is to capitalise it if it's replacing a name. Eg,\\
'I told Mother to leave me alone' vs 'I told my mother to leave me alone'
