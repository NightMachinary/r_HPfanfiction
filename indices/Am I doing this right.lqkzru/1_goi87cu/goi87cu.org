I write second generation too, from Scorpius's and Draco's perspectives, also third person limited. This is a really interesting question! Here's how I've been referring to the other characters:

There's no sibling to refer to but as someone with siblings, I think Rose's internal monologue would think of her brother as "Hugo" rather than just her brother.

Scorpius thinks of his parents as exclusively his dad or his mum, so Draco is only referred to as "Scorpius's dad." His grandparents vary based on why they're being referenced, so if he's thinking of Lucius as a person who played a role in history, he'd say "Lucius Malfoy," but if he's thinking of him in terms of the development of the Malfoy family, he'd say "his grandfather."

He refers to his aunts and uncles as either "aunt Daphne" or just "Daphne." This depends on the intimacy of the family; I think of my aunts and uncles as either "uncle X" or just "X." I also, like you, don't really like seeing the "aunt" or "uncle" in lowercase. It doesn't look right to me, although it is right. Mum, dad, aunt, and uncle would not be capitalized.

A lot of the adults that are peers of Draco are referred to by just their first name in the narration and their titles in his dialogue. Occasionally, he may think of Hermione as "Rose's mum" or "the Minister of Magic," and if Hermione and Ron show up together, he'd likely think of them as "Rose's parents." The only big exception is Harry who could be "Professor Potter," "Albus's dad," or "Harry Potter," because he has that fame that would make most children think of him in a first name-last name context. In general, Scorpius uses a lot of first name-last name because he was exposed to most of these people first through books.

In response to overusing names to refer to a character, I would not be concerned with that. It may look clunky to you as a writer, but unnecessary synonyms are usually disconcerting for the reader.
