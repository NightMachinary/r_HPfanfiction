  if I should write the names as the POV character thinks of them or not.

A way to remember it: if your character has two sets of grandparents, ask if they're in the same room as the four of them. If they are, use their names after grandma and grandpa. If not, you can get away with not writing their names.

If you're worried that people won't know who you're talking about, include their names in the beginning to show them.

It's all about knowing who's in the same room/house/building. One pair of grandparents and you say their names at some point in the chapter is fine. If it's both pairs of grandparents, use their names. Obviously, Uncles and Aunts will always be named, although not capitalizing Aunt and Uncle isn't the worst thing.
