Off the top of my head for stuff that is sorta what you're looking for:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2666277/1/Something-Grim-This-Way-Comes][Something Grim This Way Comes]] has Dudley subbing in for Billy from the show and Harry as some 3rd kid. Mandy and Harry head of to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11188292/1/Deal-with-a-Devil][Deal With a Devil]] has a similar premise to the Denarian Renegade but goes about the whole thing very differently. Harry is also much more likeable in this one and there's lots of fun stuff pre-Hogwarts like getting kidnapped by vampire zombie fairy pirates or some combination of those. Personally I like it a lot more than the Denarian Renegade but it's up to personal preference.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] has wizard Lenin talking in her head. She also goes to visit Uncle Death sometimes too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10685852/1/On-a-Pale-Horse][On a Pale Horse]] has Harry ending up as Death's sanity crutch after Dumbledore summons him.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][Deprived]] Harry summons some sort of rage incarnate knight guy. It's kinda cool.

Harry accidentally summons Richard to Hogwarts in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11246463/1/The-Greatest-Prank][The Greatest Prank.]]
