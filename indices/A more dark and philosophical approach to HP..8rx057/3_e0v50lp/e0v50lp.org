If you are interested, I can write up what I think is problematic or weak with your fic. I was unable to make it past chapter 8 the last time I tried to read it a few days ago. It may be helpful as I am writing something similar. I'm just not sure how harsh or deep you want me to go.

It may take a few days, if you want the review, as I am sitting in a plane that is heading towards the runway as I speak.
