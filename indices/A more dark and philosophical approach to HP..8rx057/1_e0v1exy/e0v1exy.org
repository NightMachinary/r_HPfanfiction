The word you're looking for is "themes", Taure already mentioned it. In addition to what he said:

Most fanfiction is admittedly rather light on themes, but it does have them - even in the crackiest of fics.

For example, if you look ABC there are multiple themes going on:

- Merits of ruling by birthright (Harry vs. Wizengamot)
- The cost of fighting (Voldemort, Sirius, Harry and Albus)
- Potential of good / evil in the same person, "Who am I" with Riddlebottom
- Mental decline (Voldemort vs. Riddlebottom)
- Love and its types (Harry's Mother / Harry, Lily / her family, Ginny / Harry, ...)
- ...

And that is one of the crackiest fics in the fandom, yet it explores stuff. All of the stuff I've mentioned is in more than one scene. Why does this fic do it, when others don't? Because nonjon is a good author. A Long Journey Home hit quite a lot themes (Life and its relation to Death, Loss, Guilt, Redemption, Teching, ...), albeit too briefly most of the time.

Sure, it isn't Les Miserables, that has like 20 themes going on, all culminating in one song. The themes aren't "gritty" like some DC comics, but notheless these fics have them. And saying that tbe way DC handles themes is the only way doing it is also kind of wrong, because it has to fit the story, and if you look at the fics people write and read, these themes aren't high on their list, and also clash horribly with the themes of the original work.

While Death is a major theme in the books, so is friendship, celebrity, home, bravery, and selflessness. And of course, one of the overaching themes of the series: "Love Conquers All", and the different types of love. Grimdark just doesn't go to well with a lot of them.

And I need to say one thing: Darker doesn't mean "more philosophical". While a lot of fics could do with some more themes - and more /substance/ in general - they don't need to become darker to do so.
