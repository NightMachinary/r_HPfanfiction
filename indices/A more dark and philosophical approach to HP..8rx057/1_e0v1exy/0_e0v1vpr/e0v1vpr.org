Sorry. I never meant to imply that "darker" means more philosophical. I said I would include them both, but not necessarily that they are the same thing.

Not sure what ABC is. And I'm not dissing on other writers and say that they don't do that. I acknowledge that they do. But I just mean that there aren't enough of them. I kind of wanted more stories that have more deeper meanings. Like Sandman and Watchmen.

Yes, I understand that there are lots of light themes. And I understand that they are also philosophical. I'm just establishing my own approach, to let my readers know just what to expect before going in. Maybe that was the wrong thing to emphasize, I don't know. But I like to know that information if I'm going in a fanfiction.

I wanted something that establishes moral dilemmas, philosophical and controversial topics, that leave people to discuss it kind of how you can discuss the Batman's dilemma over killing the Joker or just letting him live. Like Formalism vs. Utilitarianism. Or Empiricism vs. Rationalism. I don't know how to explain it. Like how overall, the Picture of Dorian Grey basically establishes the essence of a human, from the time he can think to the time of his death.

I never said that the way DC writes is the /only/ way to handle themes. I didn't even imply it. I said I got /inspiration/ from it, and that there's a lot of good themes in it.

I'm not really /overriding/ the themes of love or bravery or selflessness. There is definitely light themes in my story. I just added in another layer to flesh out the characters some more. Just give them more challenges. Harry in my story is still noble and selfless. Ron, Dumbledore, and Hermione, they all still love him. Lily still sacrificed herself, which keeps the theme of "love" in the books. I just wanted to analyze it from a different perspective, to add another layer to it. I'm not /overriding/ it.

Yes, definitely there is not only darkness. That's what the symbol of the shadows implies.

I hope that clears up some misunderstanding.
