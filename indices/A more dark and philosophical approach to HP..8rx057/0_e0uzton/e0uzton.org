Self-promotion pro-tip: fanfic readers don't generally care much about the themes of a fic. And if they do, they will only care for the themes if the fic engages them on its own merits first.

If you want people to read your fic, tell them about the plot/premise, not that you want to analyse "justice, corruptness, the two sides of a man, the boundaries of morality". Those things may well be interesting, but you have to establish your credibility as a writer before people are interested in what you have to say about those things. Which means telling a story people want to read.
