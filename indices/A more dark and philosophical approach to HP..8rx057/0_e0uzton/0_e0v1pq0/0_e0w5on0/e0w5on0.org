  I'm just giving some background information to set the ultimate goal for me as a writer, that I intended it to be a little more than "just a story."

Having themes is pretty expected for any quality literature, even if you're writing "just a story". Having goals as a writer is great, but usually themes and story are often very tightly intertwined, and if you put themes first - that's when stuff starts to get preachy.

Sure, keep them in mind, play with them - but don't overemphasise, because that really seems pretentious. It's not about catering to your audience, it's that writing meaningful stuff is hard - and it can go really wrong.
