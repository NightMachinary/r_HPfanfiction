I guess I understand. But I'm not really establishing my credibility as a writer, nor am I saying that I am better than other writers for addressing these topics. I'm just giving some background information to set the ultimate goal for me as a writer, that I intended it to be a little more than "just a story."

I understand that I don't cater to majority of fanfic readers, but I just thought of introducing another approach.

I do have a plot. I just didn't want to go into too many details because I didn't want to spoil anything. Thanks, though. I really appreciate the feedback.
