My take on it is that a single Blood Quill scar is easily healed by Essence of Dittany or other methods, but if (like Umbridge made them) the same scar is reopened day after day, magical Healing will become less and less effective just like you can only /Reparo/ a single object so many times. Presumably, it would still be imaginable to cut off the part of skin with the scar on it by non-magical means and then regrow new skin in its place, but that's a bit extreme.
