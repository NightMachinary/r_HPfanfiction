I think the difficulty would be a build up of the curse with so much use of the blood quill and time. As in.

Why would I need to heal you from use of a blood quill, your natural healing should have taken care of it?\\
You wrote how many words? oh.\\
I am sorry if you had come to me right away I could have eliminated the scarring. But since you let weeks go by, the curse used to make the blood quill work has attached itself more firmly to your hand. I can only reduce the scarring, not remove it.
