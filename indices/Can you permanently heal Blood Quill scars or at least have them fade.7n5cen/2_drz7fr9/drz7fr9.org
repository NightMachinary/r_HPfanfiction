Its dark magic, damage done by dark magic is hard/impossible to heal. But Snape healed Dracos damage done by Sectumsempra a curse he created. So it could be possible if someone understands the magic well enough. Umbridge most likely would know how one would at least learn how to heal the damage done by a cursed item she created.

If you want you could also just say that Umbridge placed a variation of some curse with a known countercurse on the quill, and have it healed that way.
