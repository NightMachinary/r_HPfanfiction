You at least tried. Howver, I am afraid there is something a way more sinister behind The Roftang Conspiracy (and nargles, and ... have I mentioned linkffn(12407442) yet? No? I should ...). In my headcanon, Xenophilius went after the death of his wife really off the deep end. He just couldn't cope and he went to this fantasy world of his own and turned his originally eccentric but more or less sane journal into The Quibbler we all know and love (which turned out to be surprisingly popular in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_World_News][Weekly World News]] style).

For Luna, after the death of her very much beloved mother, her Dad was her whole world. Quite literally. With him going wild, most of their neighbours and friends (who were more friends of his wife anyway) left them (including Weasleys and Ginny for some time, unfortunately), and she was left with nobody else. There was no way how anybody not trusted as her father (i.e., nobody) could explain her the father was a bit off and there are actually were no nargles in the world.

Only a way later, when she really fell in love with Ralf, one evening on their mission to find fantastic beasts in South America, when moon was shining brightly, sitting around their campfire after the dinner, he was able to take her to his arms and lovingly explain to her that perhaps there is not enough evidence for the existence of nargles.

END OF PROMPT.

Oh, and I forgot to mention beloved story linkffn(Aftershocks by StainedGlassSkyscrapers) which is very very nice, very very sad, and very very unfinished (but suggested direction of the story doesn't seem to bring anything anyway, although I would love to see Padma/George relationship evolving).
