Could it possibly be The Shadow of His Wings by Mirabella? That one was quite good and had a Harry/Draco teaching at Hogwarts, although it's been forever since I read it so I can't remember if Neville was there too.

The website that it was hosted on is long gone, but wayback machine was able to find the fic, if you wanted to give it a peek. [[https://web.archive.org/web/20101204045909/http://theguestroom.houseofhobbits.com/hp/sohw_prologue.html][The Shadow of his Wings]]

Remember that it IS unfinished and short of a Christmas miracle will remain unfinished. Mirabella reappeared a few years back and started to archive her fics on Dreamwidth but then abruptly disappeared again, which makes me worry something may have happened.
