I recently tripped upon a pretty big bookmark list of HP/DM fic over on [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/katelawyer86/bookmarks?bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bquery%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=99&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&page=1&utf8=%E2%9C%93][Ao3]] that includes non-AO3 fics. Quite a number of HP/DM stuff I read ages ago is on there, so maybe what you're looking for is on there?

I agree with the other poster that The Shadow of His Wings could be it... but I wouldn't characterize the romance between Harry and Draco as reluctant. Draco is under some sort of curse from his father to produce an heir, so as much as he's enjoying their relationship, he will break up with Harry at some point, which Harry knows and hates.

The Shadow of His Wings is one of a very few fics I would pay money to see completed. Mirabella was such a good writer.
