Nonjon's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] definitely qualifies. Harry's and Sirius's ability to pick up women with surprise morning-after connections to one another is a running gag throughout.

Joe6991's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wasteland of Time]] also features a smooth-talking, flirtatious, Armani-suit-wearing Harry.

Harry in Perspicacity's pair of one-shots [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/10/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Sirius Gives Harry 'The Talk']] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/11/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Broom Closets and Socks]] might qualify in a pinch (though most of the action is off-screen).
