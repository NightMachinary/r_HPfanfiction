Strangely or not, Harry as a smooth talker seems to require a change of House.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/What-Would-Slytherin-Harry-Do][What would Slytherin Harry Do?]] by Big D on a Diet.

An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
