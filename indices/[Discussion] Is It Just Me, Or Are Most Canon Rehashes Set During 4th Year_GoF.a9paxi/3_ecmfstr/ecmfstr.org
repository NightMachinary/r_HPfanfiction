I think one of the main reasons for this is because it when Harry's most life changing events happen Spoilers.. eg in the fourth book, Cedrics death gives great room for character development. Ron's betrayal and abandonment of harry leaves room for him to make new friends it has a lot of openings for change, as the harry potter world opens like the introduction of new schools and a wider wizarding world it gives more opportunity to break away from canon, as well as a justifiable reason. In the fifth book with voldemort's return it also gives an author opportunity to give harry a chance to improve himself and dedicate himself to study, him suffering from PTSD from Sirius's death and if there was a will, its also when harry gets mad at Dumbledore. What Im trying to say is there are lots of ways to justify or explain, the what and the why of divergence from cannon, well thats my opinion Harry is just that little bit older and the outside world is showing its and affecting him more aswell.
