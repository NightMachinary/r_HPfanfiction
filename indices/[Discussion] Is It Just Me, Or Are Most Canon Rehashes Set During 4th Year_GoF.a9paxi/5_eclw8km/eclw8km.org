Year 4 is where romance starts happening for a lot of students (True long-term relationships start around Year 6, but those usually aren't as... "exciting" since relationships become more of a background interest at that point). The fact that the Yule Ball is there enhances this further (Fics set in different eras tend to get around this by introducing their own Ball for similar reasons -- several Marauder-era fics have Slughorn's Christmas Party take its place, for example). Considering how shipping is basically the most common reason people write fanfics, and there you go.
