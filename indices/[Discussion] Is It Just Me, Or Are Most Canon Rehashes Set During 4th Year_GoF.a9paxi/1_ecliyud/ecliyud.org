In addition to what others have said, I think it also has a lot to do with when the original books were released.

Harry Potter sold pretty well, but book 3/4 is really when it hit widespread exposure. So back in the early days, when the fanfic tropes and cliches were first being written, there was a huge explosion of fanfic that took place right around then, because the budding authors consumed the first few books in a weekend and just plain ran out of canon. So they just started writing from the end of canon.
