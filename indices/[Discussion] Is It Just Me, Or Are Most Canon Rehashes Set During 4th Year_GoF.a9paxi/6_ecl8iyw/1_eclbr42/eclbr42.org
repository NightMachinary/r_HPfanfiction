PoA and GoF are also the easiest set-ups for romance since the relevant plot events don't take up too much time. Compare three tournament tasks and the Yule Ball to, lets say Umbridge or the continuous investigations into Malfoy (CoS/HBP) or the Philosopher's stone and Snape.

And Harry's isolation after being chosen is as good as introductions for a love interest get. She stood with Harry when no one else did and voila, romance. And the later books are really bad for romance because Harry should be worrying about Voldemort and not trying to score a buxom blonde. The only valid romances are Hermione or whoever gets taken along for the hunt (Fleur or Tonks, Ginny and Luna are underage and therefore unable to cast spells).

It's actually quite difficult to fit a romance into books 6 and 7.
