It not even that most are set in 4 in my experience.

Books 1-3 are pretty basic fare as far as staple childrens and YA novels go. (Their meta being another thing altogether.)

But 4 is the first Rowling treats the fans to a proper introduction to epic style fantasy storytelling.

Goblet of Fire is simply the cemetery of good but not really that great fan-authors.
