Agreed, the series really opens up in Goblet. We get so much confirmation and new info on magical life in Wizarding Britain as a whole and in the wider Wizarding community, one of my favorite aspects and something the later books didnt do as well IMHO. Hallows wouldve been great if they explored Magical Europe

I think Order isnt as popular a launching point because a lot of fan authors think Harry is just "emo" or whatever and dont understand he is (justifiably) suffering from PTSD, and that's hard to write for someone, probably, in their teens or 20s.
