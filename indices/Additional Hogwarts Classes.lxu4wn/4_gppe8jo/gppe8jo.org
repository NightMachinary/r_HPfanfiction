First year Mandatory Writing and Composition Class. Teaches you how to write essays properly, write with a Quill (as Muggleborn would be used to pens) and teaches you to follow the instructions on essay length, and basically having the teachers stop marking after the assigned length. (Totally imagining a scene with Hermione in horror after she gets a P on a bit of Homework because she wordvomits)
