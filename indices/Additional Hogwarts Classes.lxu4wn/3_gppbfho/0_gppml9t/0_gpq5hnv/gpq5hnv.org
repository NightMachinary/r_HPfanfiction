I know that Arthur's (and a lot of other wizards too) ignorance of the Muggle world is played as a jock, but to be fair, it's not like he "/needed/" to really know about them.

Before being promoted during the war, Arthur worked for the "Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office", and despite his ignorance, he was perfectly able to do his job.\\
To do his job, Arthur never needed to understand how a computers works, or what electricity is, or even to learn Muggle economy. He just needed to identify what Muggle Item were jinxed, to deal with them and then to find the culprit. You don't need to be able to build a telephone by yourself to understand that it is not supposed to get sentiance.

In the same way, Arthur probably never had to use something like the subway, because he mastered the freaking teleportation. And I'm not even mad about the clothes some wizards wear, because if looking like a weirdo was the proof that someone was a wizard, you can easily cross tens of them daily while living in a big city.
