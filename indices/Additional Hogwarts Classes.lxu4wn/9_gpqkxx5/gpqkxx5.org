I really liked NoahPhantom's idea of introducing innovative magical practices in the curriculum. I also like it when fics explore the nooks and crannies of Alchemy... it's a subject so obscure and hard to define because it's actually based on real practices but it involves some of the three core topics in magic, namely charms, transfigurations and potions. I am honestly not a big fan of Arithmancy because a lot of people just treat like a programming language for spell creation (probably due to the Arithmancer) but in fact it's just based on what we know as numerology. However I like it when it's actually used to predict or understand magical impact of the natural phenomena using numbers.

Edit: I would also like to see more wandlore. Not exploring obscure topics such as the sentience of wands but I would like to see people gain some knowledge of how the wood interacts with the core and how some of the aspects influence the wandmaking process.
