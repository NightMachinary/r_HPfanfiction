While I like the idea of additional classes, I can't really recall any fic adding ones where they would be interesting (basically anyone does anything interesting with fanoned-runes or arithmancy already). Taure baited us recently with some potentially interesting ones, but then had Victoria only choose Latin from the new stuff.\\
Still, for my own (fairly AU) fic, I'm doing some alterations to the Hogwarts school program.

- I'm adding metaphysics - this is basically a magical theory class (interesting note, the list of books for the first year has a generic Magical Theory textbook), but with more focus on how the world works from the wizarding perspective. It's also the only obligatory class if you decide to continue your studies into NEWTs.
- Flying is made into a class for the first two years. But you can be excused from it if you show sufficient proficiency (like we saw with Harry no longer attending it after the whole rememberball situation).
- And similarly to you, I'm adding Latin for the first two years. However, just like with Latin you can be excused, based on the test that's given at the beginning of each year. That's because children in magical families are usually taught it already.
- There is a magiozoology class again for the two years that's a prelude of sorts to CoMC, and the part of Defense that's dealing with handling dangerous creatures but this is almost purely theoretical.
- Runes get changed into glyphology and are a practical class instead of language one. Arithmancy is expanded into the full numerology.
- There is a musical class somewhere, I may make it NEWT-only and tie it to numerology, not sure yet. I'm torn between calling it harmonautics and something referencing Orpheus.
- Also NEWT only is the alchemy class that JKR mentioned on Pottermore.
- The last but not least, and kinda a key part of my AU, is yet unnamed class that's xianxia inspired, but using primarily various western esoteric techniques as an inspiration instead of Daoism like xianxia does. For those unfamiliar with xianxia, consider it a set of methods of attaining higher spiritual levels. It also touches on so beloved in fanfiction mental arts, but not occlumency per se.
