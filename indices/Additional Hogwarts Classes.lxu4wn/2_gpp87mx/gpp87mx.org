I'd love to read about classes where they do not only learn foreign languages but also about how magic in other countries work and maybe learn some exemplaric stuff. Also I'd love a voluntary class where music theory is combined with magic and can be used for example in sung incantations as some form of more uncommon magic. And also, I'd enjoy extracurricular art classes where interested students could learn to draw magical paintings or learn instruments and stuff. And some other sports than quidditch would be nice, maybe broom aerobatics or something like that.
