I like when wizards are learning maths, and maybe even some science, in Astronomy. It seems daft to me that wizards are completely ignorant of everything that muggles have learnt unless they do Muggle Studies.

Why not have "here is what we know about Venus thanks to divination and the tales that Merlin brought back from his tour of the solar system, here are some pretty pictures that the muggles took when they sent cameras into space, and this is the chemical composition of the atmosphere, and here are our charts of its motion through the sky and its effect on the Earth"?

When everything useful is in the electives, it stretches my disbelief. In fanfiction, too often, /not/ taking Runes and Arithmancy is basically choosing to not learn magic properly, which is silly. Didn't /Percy/ take Muggle Studies and Divination (and another one, can't remember)? He wasn't going to have sabotaged his learning by choosing duff options!
