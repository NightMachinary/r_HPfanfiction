I've added in a 'Beings Studies' class that's basically anthropology but for merpeople, centaurs, goblins, etc.

I also toyed around with an ancient languages class, but I think I decided to go with Magical Theory/Spellcraft instead. My hc is that Latin being the majority language of spells is a class thing, and that any language can (and should!) be used. Although I do quite like that JKR mostly went with Greek for the healing spells
