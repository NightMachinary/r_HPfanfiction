Art, music, theater, choir (though there is a choir, there is no explanation of how it works at all LOL). Quidditch itself would be an extracurricular, but maybe some other sports or physical activities. Languages would be very interesting as well, and I feel like it could be grouped together with Ancient Runes as well, as that in itself is a whole type of language.

To me, Muggle Studies should be mandatory for at least a year. It doesn't matter how much the student insists they won't go out into the Muggle world, there's many changes in technology and innovation over the years and to not at least be aware of simple things like how money works or the common fashion can be a huge issue, especially if there could be a need for people to flee into the muggle world for some reason or another. If you go running into the public wearing a witch's hat, someone shows up and asks if anyone saw someone wearing a witch's hat, that's very noticeable.
