One I haven't seen is a Physical Health type class taught by Hooch to second years. It would be the basics of keeping healthy and fit but add in some spells or potions to keep it magical. In a similar vein I think Pomfrey could teach some puberty/sex ed.

My favourite is “Advanced Enchantments”, I know that the first years get a pineapple to dance so later years can probably do more complex creations in Charms, but I think it would be cool if there was an elective that really focuses on layering spells and crafting magical objects. Like not much is explained about how the Twins make all their stuff. Maybe the class would focus on experimentation.

I like “magical” languages, especially foreign ones. Like if you have Indian/Desi!Harry he would want to learn about his dads language and culture.
