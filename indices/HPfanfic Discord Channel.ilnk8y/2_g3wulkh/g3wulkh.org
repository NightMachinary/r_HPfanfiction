It's ultra left wing. It got too much even for me and I am generally a moderate.

If you disagree with them you will be mobbed and (possibly) evicted. There's even been a case of screenshots from another server altogether being used as justification to ban an "undesirable" just recently despite the guy not being guilty of anything on that server in particular.

I personally haven't been banned there because I was inactive most of the time, but I cannot stand to enter this place anymore. it's gotten suffocating.
