Harry is 14, 15, and 16 during the entire fic. Magic is about skill, experience, and years of study and research. So Harry could never hope to actually match Voldemort without a stupid BS powerup like wandless magic or being the descedant of Merlin (you know the usual drivel).

Even with two years of training, partly at Dumbledore's hands and the Order members, Harry cannot realistically defeat Voldemort himself. The reason he succeeds in here is complicated and a spoiler, but it at least makes more sense than a lot of fics.
