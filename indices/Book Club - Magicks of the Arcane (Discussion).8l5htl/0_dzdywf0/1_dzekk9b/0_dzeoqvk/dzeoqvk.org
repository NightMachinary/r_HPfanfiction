I stand by what I said too. If a fic were written just about Dumbledore and Harry taking a year off from Hogwarts to go around the world, it could be one of the best fics in the fandom. Works like By the Divining Light and The Mind Arts touch on this sort of mentor-student relationship, but there are very few I can name that show Dumbledore as a teacher rather than a guardian.

The worst part is one of the A/N mentions plans for visiting several other locations and their adventures, but cut them because "summer was ending" and we had to go back to the done-to-death plot of kill Voldemort.
