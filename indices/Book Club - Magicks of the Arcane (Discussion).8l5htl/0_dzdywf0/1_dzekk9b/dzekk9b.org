I agree with basically everything you said. I think it brought a lot of nuance and fun to the idea of a mentor Dumbledore, but it was heavily overshadowed by the authors clear lack of direction in the story. I really wanted to like this Harry, and I really wanted to learn more about these Ancient Magicks but instead of tying it all into one grand story, it felt like 3 stories just mashed together with no real cohesive purpose.
