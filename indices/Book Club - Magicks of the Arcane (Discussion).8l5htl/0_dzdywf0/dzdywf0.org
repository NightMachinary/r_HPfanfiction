I'm on the fence about this fic.

On the one hand, this fic does a good (maybe great even) job at creating an adventure feel. Even if some of the beats are the same during the first dozen chapters, tidbits of uniqueness stand out: the fight with the bicorn, the artifacts in Dumbledore's office, and all the duels feel exciting (more than I can say for some others). After the 4th year ends, the real highlight of the story appears: Dumbledore and Harry's adventures around the world. Scenes from this just stand out in my mind, but I would recommend reading the fic just for the chapters 12-19. If this fic were made just about the two of them doing this sort of wandering around, it would end up being one of my favorite stories, fanmade or otherwise. And the magic. While not the best depictions of magic I have seen, the author clearly went above the norm to put it on display. Interesting concepts are delved into, and I actually like the idea of Ancient Magick, even if it does come with some of the baggage of the idea of "power" being energy like (though thankfully never devolves into magical cores). And Harry, despite his forced growth and obvious talent in the story, is clearly shown to inferior to people like Dumbledore and Voldemort (and a few other OC characters).

On the other hand...this fic is all over the place story-wise. For one, Harry's character is really inconsistent, especially at the beginning. He seems to have done a 180 in terms of character overnight, and not in an altogether believable manner. And the sexualization in the story gets pretty out of hand, especially in the first half of the story. Also a lot of characters and plot lines are introduced in fair detail, yet never go anywhere or seem to be forgotten.

The verdict? The author appears to have not really known where this story was going to go, something that the A/N reflect, while they were writing. It seems that what the author wanted to write was Harry becoming magically talented and learning/adventuring with Dumbledore. When the story focuses on that, and the magic or action or world-building aspects, its great. When it tries to focus back on the "main story" (i.e. defeat Voldemort), it is only slightly above average or worse.

Read it if you want to see interesting magic, action, Mentor!Dumbledore, and exploration/adventure stories.
