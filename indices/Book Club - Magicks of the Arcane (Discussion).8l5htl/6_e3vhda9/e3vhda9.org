At the moment, I'm about 10% of the way through and I keep putting it down and stopping. So far most of the writing seems a bit under par, but the dialogue just feels so clunkly that it really takes me out of the story.

I've never been a fan of the whole uber-formal or Victorian language bullshit with the pureblood culture. But it's okay in general, provided there is a lead up to it, or characters are introduced talking that way. But it brothers me when the story starts out with Harry being basically completely cannon and then he switches to effecting this new dialect/mannerisms immediately in all aspects almost overnight story-wise. Too much too fast. Maybe if I keep reading I'll get used to it, but just the same I'll get used to bad dialogue in a story if I'm interested in the plot.
