I've already finished the next months book club so im just gonna go back in time until I cant reply anymore because they're archived.

God I hate this story. I could actually like the premise and the general story but I hate it because of the constant sexual shit. It starts pretty good but its just painful by where i am at chapter 6 and Ive just decided to drop it at this point. Its fucking frustrating cause I want to enjoy it so bad.
