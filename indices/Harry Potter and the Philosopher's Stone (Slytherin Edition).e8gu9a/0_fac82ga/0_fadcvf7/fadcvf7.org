The first book follows the cannon plot points with different details and conversations etc. I thought that the fact that the philosopher stone was there wouldn't change and Harry's reactions would still be sort of similar throughout the story. Though his friends are different and the situations they end up in is different too. Im writing the second book now and it diverges much more. I feel like the more time passes the more it will diverge from the original. But the same sort of plots will remain that is outside of their control of course
