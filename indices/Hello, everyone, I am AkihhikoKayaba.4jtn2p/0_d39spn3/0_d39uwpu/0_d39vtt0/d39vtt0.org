Then go to police. Online stalking and harassment is no different than in person harassment. The fact that the school tried to deal with it internally only helps your case.Keep records of which officers you speak to and if it's legal where you live, record your conversations with them. If the police won't deal with it, go to a lawyer. Almost every lawyer will at least hear your case for free, and in this type of case they may take it for free entirely, especially if you kept records. The lawyer or you can even take it to the media. They love any story factual or exaggerated that they can play up as a sob story or inducing fear.

The most important thing is that doing nothing is not the answer.

Also for the record, making a post tying your two accounts defeats the purpose. A quick Google search and you're back to square one.
