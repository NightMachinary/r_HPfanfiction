Doesn't help that most of this particular's ship greatest works are on LiveJournal, and a bunch of them are expired/deleted/friendlocked.

OT: Have you come across Fairy Boy or any other works by Auburn Crimson/Mieko Belle by any chance? She declared her works an embarrassment or something like that and deleted her FF.net/FictionAlley account. I can't seem to find a mirror anywhere else either...
