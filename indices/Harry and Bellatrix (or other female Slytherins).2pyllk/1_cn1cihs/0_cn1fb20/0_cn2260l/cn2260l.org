/Super/ OOC Harry. Like, to the point where he's unrecognizable. Harry/Bellatrix is pretty much a minefield. You either make Harry completely OOC (/Only Enemies/), or Bellatrix (/Earl of the North/), or both (/Passageways/).

/Delenda Est/ is remarkable simply because it manages to make a reasonably in-character Harry/Bellatrix work: Harry is always a little idealistic, though he gravitates towards a more pragmatic approach, and Bellatrix is always pretty hard and mercenary, though she gravitates towards Harry's side. It makes it work, and the double time-travel thing is pretty much the only way to do it.
