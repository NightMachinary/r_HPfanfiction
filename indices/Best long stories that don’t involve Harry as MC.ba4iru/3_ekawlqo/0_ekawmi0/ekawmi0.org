  If Harry Potter could alter the past, he isn't sure what he'd change, but he knows he'd change something. If Severus Snape could hold history in his hands, he knows exactly what shape he would mold it into. Albus Dumbledore might flatter himself enough to think he would walk away from such power. But Delphi Riddle isn't here to serve any of them. (Rating for some really prolific cursing and very little else.)

  As the Battle of Hogwarts draws to a close, Remus Lupin finds that dying isn't as quick and easy as they'd promised Harry. Even still, he probably shouldn't have gotten sarcastic with an all-powerful force beyond his comprehension unless he wanted to find himself five years in the past, having undone both Voldemort's defeat and his own son's birth. In progress.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
