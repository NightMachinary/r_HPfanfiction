I just found "Hermione Granger: Demonologist" last month. It's short and funny, and surprisingly well fleshed out.

And I read Harry Potter and the Natural Twenty last year. The main character is a young wizard from dungeons and dragons who brings D&D rules into the Harry Potter universe. Also surprisingly satisfying!
