I've only read DH once and it's my least favorite book not counting CC. I had to read it quickly before I went back to work at a summer camp where there would be spoilers galore, but, even so, I felt the biggest drawback was the frantic pace of the plot. Though chronologically takes the same amount of time as every other book stylisticly it is the climax of the arc begun in HBP. I think this is one of the reasons there is very little prep for the trip or build up to the events before the wedding. Honestly, it is why many fanfics I read are alternate book 6 or 7, I like a lot of the ideas JKR used in those books but don't love how they were written. I also remember actually having to wait for the books and in some ways, the fandom and speculation was more fun, that lasted longer than reading the new book for me.
