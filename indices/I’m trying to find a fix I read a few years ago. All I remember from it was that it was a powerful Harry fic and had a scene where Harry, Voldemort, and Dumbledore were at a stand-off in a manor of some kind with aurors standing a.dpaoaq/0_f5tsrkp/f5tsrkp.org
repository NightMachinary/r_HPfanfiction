That sounds very similar to a scene that's been stuck in my head for a long time ago. All I remember is that there was a showdown, just like the one you're describing, except I think this one was just a memory of it in a pensieve, and it wasn't against Voldemort, but against Grindelwald. All I remember is that, like in your description, there were a bunch of aurors standing in a circle around the duelers, and at the beginning of the duel there was a power blast, and everyone standing in the vicinity was instantly vaporized. Only one person survived and it was because she/he was standing behind Dumbledore at the time. I've been trying to find out where I read it for years but, for the life of me, I haven't been able to remember.
