Yeah, in yours you said that it takes place in a manor, but in mine I think it was in the open streets of a city. But for the rest, it sounded so similar that it triggered the memory of the scene into my mind again. That's the problem with reading dozens of very long fics. I can't re-read them all looking for that particular scene. Ain't nobody got time for that.
