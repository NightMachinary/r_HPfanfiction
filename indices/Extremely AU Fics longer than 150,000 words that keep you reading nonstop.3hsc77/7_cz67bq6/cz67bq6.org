This was the very 1st AU fics that I ever came across when I first started reading fanfiction back in 2009. And to this day, it still remains one of the greatest fanfics that I've ever read. It is currently being redone, and posted up on the HPFF site now. But I started out reading/reviewing this story years ago when it was posted up elsewhere, and then over time I actually became pretty close friends with the author. He is such an amazing and passionate writer, and this story definitely deserves WAY more love & attention than what it is getting on HPFF right now... So please read and show this wonderful author some much-needed love!! <3

  While Luna simply smiled and nodded, Harry couldn't seem to wipe the expression of shock and disbelief from his face. Finally, he spoke. "And...if this plan goes wrong, and we all end up dead?" Michael rubbed the back of his neck. "Well, there's worse things you can be in life than a cautionary tale."
