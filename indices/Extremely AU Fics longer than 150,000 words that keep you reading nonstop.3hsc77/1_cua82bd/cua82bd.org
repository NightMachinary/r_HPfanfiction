linkffn(It Falls To The Young)

Warning: Has young!Snape as protagonist. Though it's so wildly, wildly AU (much of it was jossed by HBP) that he might as well be an OC that just happens to have Snape's snark, dark and weird angst. It's just shy of 150k words.

Edit: You seem to like stories with savvy!Harry as the lead, but I think this fic makes up for that lack with fairly interesting original magic and premises.
