I think the story is something like this: it's a fic that is more interested in certain tropes (OP, Master of Death, Immortal Harry) than anything you'd normally judge a good piece of writing by--e.g., character development, world building, etc. Which sounds like a bit of an insult, but I don't intend it that way; I think it's a fairly interesting, easily digestible story, and I definitely enjoyed it, particularly the dynamics of Turais' relationship with Sirius and Regulus. But if you're looking for /depth/, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.
