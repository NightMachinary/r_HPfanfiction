Huh. I gotta be honest, - I totally thought /Time to put your Galleons Where Your Mouth is/ was an abandoned fic. I think it's because I abandoned reading it. Just read the last few chapters now.

The title alone sort of puts me off. It's one of those 'unnecessarily wizardized sayings' done for the sake of it. The saying uses money, not dollars, pounds, or euros.

Harry was weirdly powered. He should have been basically a god. Yet he didn't quite know if he wanted to just live a normal life, or change the course of everything. Time travelling Hermiones or Harrys, under 30 year old, clean up the whole situation better than a Harry who was literally older than he could remember. Especially given he didn't even like the family he was born into.
