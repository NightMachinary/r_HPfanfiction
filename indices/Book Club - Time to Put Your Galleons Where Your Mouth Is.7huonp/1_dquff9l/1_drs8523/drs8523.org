Harry did explain it...He wanted to be an active and protective older brother for Regulas and Sirius. I'm pretty sure the whole point was Harry never even came close to a time period near his family. He's lived countless lives without being able to see his family, and he gets it for this life. He's a god that now has personal feelings. Sirius was his only real attachment to a dead family while he was Harry Potter, and now he gets to see him, protect him, and basically guide him in life. Family was more important than going off to find and destroy the horcruxs, until Sirius has a hissy fit about it. Harry literally describes why he did what he did.
