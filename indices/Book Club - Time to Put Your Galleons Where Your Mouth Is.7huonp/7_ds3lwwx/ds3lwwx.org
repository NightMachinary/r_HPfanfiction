This one was a bit of a struggle for me; it took several re-reads before I could get past the first couple of chapters. Even then, I wasn't fully engaged in the story.

The main problem is the same one that I have with most "canon characters reborn as X" fics: the too-quick pace leads to a barely-there sense of connection between Harry and his new family. It reads like an outline to a much longer story, one without any real conflict or sense of urgency.

For a fic set during Voldemort's first war, that's a death sentence for any attention I might've paid it.
