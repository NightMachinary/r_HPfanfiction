It was well written, but the main conflict was...kind of absent? Like Turais just went through the motions of being a person until someone said he should be more proactive, and then he just ganked Voldemort in a couple chapters. They were mostly told from other people's perspectives, even.

He wasn't terribly clever about it either. He didn't predict that he might want to do something about Voldemort. He didn't reason that he could de-fang Voldemort (like taking away his magic, or even the mundane solution of Draught of the Living Death, or removing his eyes and tongue and limbs and having a house-elf keep him alive) and /then/ worry about horcruxes.

The implications of him having experienced many prior lives are pretty much ignored.

He's short on personality.
