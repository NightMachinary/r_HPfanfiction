I didn't like it to be honest. All the characters, especially Harry, were wooden and bland. There was no conflict or a sense that something interesting was going to happen since it was just Turais solving the world's problems. For me, there's not much to enjoy in a story if I don't care for the plot or the characters.

But it's short so it's good for a quick read and a bit of fluff. The technical writing is good. I imagine people who are into OP Harry and wish-fulfillment will like it.
