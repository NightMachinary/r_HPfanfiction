It's a weird fic. I thought it was all right, but I wish Sirius and Regulus were fleshed out more. The story is told from almost a bystander's perspective, and it suffers from it. The author needs to work more on showing, not telling. I wanted to see more interactions between Turais and his brothers throughout their childhood that demonstrated that his little brothers were more than just "Turais' little brothers."

I really liked the premise, the plot was fine for the most part, but ultimately I always felt that the fic could so easily be /just that little bit/ better if the author was slightly better.

The good news is that all the criticisms I have with it are fixable, and if the author chose to rewrite it, I'd eagerly sit down and read the new version.
