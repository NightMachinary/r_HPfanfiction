I agree that the description of the houses are often very poorly done in fanfiction and often not thought through. Since I identify with being a Ravenclaw myself, the "rule abiding and strict" clich√© annoys me the most. I perceive Ravenclaw as the house that is the most curious, the one that asks the most question, the one that likes to perceive and think instead of judge. In all history of mankind those are the characteristics of people that rebel. Questioning the system leads to revolution. I would love a story that describes Ravenclaw like that that.
