Personally, I quite like the characterisation of Ravenclaw in linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King), they are presented as not the ones with the most knowledge but as the ones with the most curiosity, hence a bigger proportion of muggleborns in it than other houses.

Of course, this is said by a Ravenclaw prefect at the Welcoming Feast so it is biased.

As for Hufflepuff... sorry but I can't recall any fic with a nice characterisation outside of the basic "work hard and be nice"...
