In the few interactions we see him have with people other than Death Eaters, he is addressed to as Voldemort/Lord Voldemort/Dark Lord/Tom (by Dumbledore and Harry). Anyways, in his later years, the only way a conversation with him would usually end with the other person either becoming his servant (willingly or unwillingly) or end up dead.

Edit: the only circumstance I can think where someone not in his service (or wishing to enter his service) would care about how they approach Voldemort, it would be if a relatively equally powerful wizard or witch would like to build an alliance, case in which I would go with "Lord Voldemort" in order to show proper respect to his title but also to show that I'm not afraid of using his name.

The other case would be if the Ministry was trying to reach a truce with the Death Eaters, in which case I think Voldemort (if dealing with a powerful negotiator of course) would try to charm his way to get the best out of the truce agreement, in which case he would not really care how he's called, although he would still likely be addressed to as 'Lord Voldemort'.
