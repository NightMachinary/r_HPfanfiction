The Dark Lord. That's the only real option.

That's what Death Eaters and other sympathizers call him when they're not in his presence and saying 'My Lord' to him directly.

Possibly, only possibly, Lord Voldemort.

A long time ago, in his early days, I can see someone politely referring to him by this moniker. After all, his name had to spread before everyone became afraid of it. However, once it became culturally taboo, speaking his name began to be considered an act of defiance against him, and that would contradict being respectful. Definitely could be interpreted either way depending on the era and the context. If you'd rather be safe and not take any risks, you're gonna call him The Dark Lord.
