One of the main reasons fanfic exists is because we couldn't get enough of canon. So if a fic is entertaining, the characters and world continue to grow, and the plot still has momentum, I say the longer the better.

But those are big ifs, and some fics definitely drag on too long. I am personally putting this to the test with my own fic, which is almost as long as canon (books 1-7) and not nearly finished.

That kind of pacing would be completely unacceptable in a conventional novel (my story can't even be divided into smaller fics), but fanfic is a unique medium, and I'm having fun with the lack of constraints.

In answer to OP, I prefer long fics and seldom read anything shorter than 60K words.
