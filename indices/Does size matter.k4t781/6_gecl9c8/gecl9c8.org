All in all I don't really think it matters how long a fanfic is but if the pacing and storytelling is right. I enjoy oneshots from time to time. I usually read fanfics between 50k-150k words. But I hardly ever read fanfics over 200k. Most of the time, if an author isn't able to tell his story with less than 200k words, the story has a to slow pacing or stretches plotlines unnecessary. There are some very well written exceptions and in those occasions I also read storys with over a million words. But in my opinion most of the time really long fanfics are the result of the inabilty to cut/shorten when it would have been necessary for story telling reasons.
