I feel like incomplete-feeling oneshots are a lesser evil then a proper length fic that's tagged as "completed" but was actually abandoned just as stuff started getting good.

Seriously, you'd think authors would burn out /after/ the interesting parts, on filler stuff. I've seen way too many fics abandoned right at the point the whole fic was building up to.
