In my eyes, there are three sorts of perfect fic length (well, four if you include oneshots) - around 60k for a single-year fic, between 200-300k for a heavy AU fic or 800k+ words for a /full AU/ series, such as the Denarian series.

However, I find that the majority of long-ass fics are simply horribly bloated for no real reason - they're good fics in general, with an interesting plot and decent writing, but it feels like you could cut out a good third of the fic without losing anything of value - for example, Prince of Slytherin, or a more extreme example in Harry Crow whose actual, story-related content could fit in roughly 10% of its total length. Not to say that long-ass fics can't be good either - for example, Benefits of old laws, while not a conventional-type fic (a slice of life about Voldemort reintegrating into society, mostly politics and family interactions, with minor drama thrown in), doesn't feel bloated at all.

All in all, it's less about the length and more about the sort of content you write - it's better to write 60k words of original ideas then do a 400k word length canon rehash using the same combination of cliches that thousands of other fics have.
