People will tell you "size doesn't matter, it's what you do with it that counts" but we all know size does matter... and that goes both ways. Some people like it short and in small doses and that's alright while some others, like me, who prefer it bigger so that you can enjoy it longer. But, that doesn't mean we like it dry with nothing going on.
