Theres the promises series by robin4 linkffn(1248431)

I wouldn't say it's exceptionally well written but it's readable. Basically Sirius doesn't switch secret keepers and [[/spoiler][peter is a death eater but comes over to the good side. Also it was originally written pre ootp so like arabella fig and mundungus are completely different also no horcruxes iirc]]
