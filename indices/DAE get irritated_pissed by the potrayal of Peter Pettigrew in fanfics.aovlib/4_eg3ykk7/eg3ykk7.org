I do! I can't think of any off the top of my head, but there are several time-travel fics back to the Marauder's Era where the MC attempts to get preemptive justice by bullying or killing him or whatnot. I /understand/ if the character is doing that to other people like Snape and Malfoy and whoever, but I don't /approve/ of it either way. It's against my moral code to punish someone for something they won't do for years to come---especially if it's a "screw the timeline!" fic where Pettigrew ccould've been pushed to become better and not make that choice in the first place.

In the end, I've got to agree with Achille-Talon; Pettigrew was probably a great friend who broke under the stress of war. It does not make his actions forgivable by any means, and I must agree with Sirius' statement of "he should've died rather than betray them" or however it went. But there was a period of time where Pettigrew was /Peter/, and Peter loved and cared for his friends just as much as the next bloke.

And while we're on the subject, does anyone have any fics where Peter doesn't betray the Potter family? I feel like that might make an interesting read, so long as it's well-written...
