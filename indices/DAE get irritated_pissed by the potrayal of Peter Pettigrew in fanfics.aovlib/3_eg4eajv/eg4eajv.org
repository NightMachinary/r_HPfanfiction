There are so many Harry goes to Gringots to read his parents wills scenes, where the parents have literally written "If we died, it means Peter Pettigrew is a snivelling traitorous scum who should be butchered at the street corner"

Like jeez, if you didn't trust him, then why make him your secret keeper? If that's how you treated him, then no wonder he switched sides.

Imagine a scene where Peter didn't actually betray them and Lily and James Potter get killed while they were taking a walk outside due to cabin fever.

Imagine how that hypothetical Peter must feel like later on at the reading of the wills.
