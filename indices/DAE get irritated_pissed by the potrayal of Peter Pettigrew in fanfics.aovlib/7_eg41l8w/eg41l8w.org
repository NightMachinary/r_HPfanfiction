yeah, usually he's all cowardly, pathetic, unskilled, bad with girls and socially awkward all the time. Like, they are supposed to be friends, right? If he behaved like that, there should be some people at least who believed he was a coward and traitor, and not his loyal friend Sirius?

I personally haven't read a good fanfic except one that explored his betrayal, the reasons and his role as a friend (can't remember the title tho, somehow he told James he was a death eater and turned spy? and he worked in the ministry and Harry and co were kinda young, if I remember it right) he should've had SOME good qualities. Like, I get it, you don't like Peter for what he has done, but at least portray him as a friend... not the odd one out all the time
