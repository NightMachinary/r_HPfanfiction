All the time!

It particularly annoys me because the plot makes no sense with him being stupid and weak. However much Sirius distrusted Remus, he'd never put someone who he thought was stupid and weak, and therefore more likely to crumble, forward to be James' secret keeper. So he must have been convincing enough as a friend to be able to be trusted by James and Sirius in 1981, and, therefore, intelligent enough to hide his switching of sides.

Also, he's able to turn into an Animagus. Yes, it's canon that he had significant help with that, but it's still very much said to be something most wizards can't manage even with help.

My personal head canon of a personality for Peter is that he's intelligent, good at schemes and has tendencies towards being manipulative, but really does love his friends. But, ultimately, he wants to save himself, as well, so he ties himself up in knots and eventually joins the Death Eaters because he's convinced himself it's the best outcome for everyone, somehow, that the Dark Lord will leave Remus and Sirius alone, and at least only one of them will have to die.

It's my theory, anyway.
