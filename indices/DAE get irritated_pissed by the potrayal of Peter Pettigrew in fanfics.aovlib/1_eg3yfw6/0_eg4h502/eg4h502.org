  he'd never put someone who he thought was stupid and weak, and therefore more likely to crumble, forward to be James' secret keeper.

And yet Sirius himself described Pettigrew that way. Hang on, let me find the exact quote - it's in the Shrieking Shack scene, after Sirius comments that Peter was only chosen as Secret-Keeper at Sirius's behest.

*"I thought it was the perfect plan...a bluff...Voldemort would be sure to come after me, would never dream they'd use /a weak, talentless thing like you/..."*

^{Ch.19, /The Servant of Lord Voldemort/}

Mind you, talentless compared to Sirius and James, who were exceptionally bright, doesn't necessarily mean he was /completely/ inept. But it's clear already that Sirius had a low opinion of Peter's magical abilities.

That said, he certainly wasn't completely stupid, as Iniga mentioned below.
