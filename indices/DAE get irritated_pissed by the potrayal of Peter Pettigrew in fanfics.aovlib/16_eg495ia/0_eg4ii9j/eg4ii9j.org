Not that I don't agree that Azkaban is not a merciful option but Harry also didn't show any mercy when Lucius Malfoy went to Azkaban or when he cast cruciatus and especially when he successfully cast it on one of the Carrow twins. Failing to deliver justice isn't mercy. It is not sacrificing someone for your own gain when that someone is a murderer of over a dozen people and has caused an innocent man to live the horrors you think Harry shouldn't bestow upon him.

On the other hand, I like your first idea. It has potential.
