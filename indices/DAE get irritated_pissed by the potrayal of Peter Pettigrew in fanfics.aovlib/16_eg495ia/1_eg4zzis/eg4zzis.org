There is mercy and then there's justice. Asking Harry to forgive everyone who wronged him is a stretch. Harry spared his soul out of mercy but Peter still needed to atone for his actions in Azkaban. It was the right thing to do. That it eventually led to Voldemort's return is not of importance. Those weren't things you could know beforehand. But, Harry was merciful in sparing Peter the Dementor's Kiss.
