I don't read as many Harry Potter fics as I used to, so I couldn't say. I did get horribly irritated with the ones that have Peter captured and (under Veritaserum) go 'yup, I'm an unrepentant Death Eater, rape and murder woo-hoo!'. And the ones where the 'heroes' just murder or torture him for his supposed death-eater-iness.

Come to think of it, seeing as Voldemort is an expert at Legilimency, and Imperius, and False Memory Charms and who-knows-what-other mind manipulations (LF Voldemort doses Peter with a love potion), why do people assume that Peter wilfully betrayed the Potters at all?

Welp, now I have two ideas in mind.

One is that James & Lily /knew/ that Peter was under duress by the Dark Lord (between various mind-altering magics and intimidation and such) but that he was also succeeding in withstanding Voldemort's attempts to brainwash him via a combination of paranoia and strong will (and a Pensive to double-check his memories).\\
Given the choice between choosing someone who had beaten all of Voldemort's mind-manipulating tricks before (up to that point, probably only Peter and Alastor Moody), or anyone else who they couldn't be sure could stand up to Voldemort's magic (everyone else, keeping in mind that there was already a willing-or-unwilling spy within the Order of the Phoenix), they chose Peter Pettigrew.\\
It's just ill-fortune that a year after being chosen as the Secret Keeper, Voldemort finally found a way to capture and break Peter, leaving him a terrified, obedient shell of his former self and having gained the Secret of the Potters' location.

The other thing that occurs to me is that sparing or killing Peter/sending him to Azkaban has serious consequences for Harry himself; Harry's power to defeat Voldemort lies in his ability to love and to sacrifice himself (see; making everyone Voldemort-proof at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts) and his ability to forgive is a big part of that (note the students he sacrificed his life to help are the same ones who shunned/abused him on various occasions over the years, up to saving Draco's life personally despite his many misdeeds).\\
If Harry chose to let Peter be killed, or succeeded in sending him to Azkaban (which he should well know is just as bad, given his (and Hagrid's) first-hand knowledge of dementors), that decision to reject mercy and throw away someone else's life would resonate through his later years, hardening his heart when dealing with others and withering his all-important power to love; that in turn could fatally weaken his will on several later occasions, being possessed by Voldemort, facing the locket Horcrux, and sacrificing himself at the Battle of Hogwarts. In fact, I'd say Harry failed the test of his ability to love in PoA; he chose to send Peter Pettigrew to Azkaban, though he aimed to clear Sirius's name as well. If Harry had succeeded in delivering Peter to the Ministry, Harry's soul would be stained by his decision to sacrifice another for his own gain. Even though he failed, and Peter escaped, his decision meant that Peter had no choice but to return to Voldemort, initiating the events of the next four books (to quote Voldemort; "Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go.").\\
Even if Harry had stood aside and let Sirius and Lupin kill Peter, his soul would still have been tainted by his refusal to show mercy; though Voldemort's return would have been delayed (with no Peter to help him rescue Crouch Jr. and orchestrate the Triwizard kidnapping), the fact that his horcruxes and their defences were intact (case in point, the Ring definitely cut Dumbledore's life short) meant that his return would still be inevitable, and Harry would still be worse off for it.\\
The best path for Harry at that point would have been to spare and forgive Peter (he kept the peace for years as a rat, after all), even if it meant Sirius's name wouldn't be cleared; this test of his resolve and choosing mercy over wrath would strengthen Harry and delay Voldemort (since if Peter doesn't need to flee, he doesn't need to serve Voldemort).
