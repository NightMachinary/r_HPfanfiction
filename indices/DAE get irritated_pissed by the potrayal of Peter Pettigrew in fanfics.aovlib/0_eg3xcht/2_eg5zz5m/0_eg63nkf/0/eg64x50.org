  Remus, always the underdog's friend, was kind to short and *rather slow Peter Pettigrew*, a fellow Gryffindor,

wormtail also can't remember how to identify a werewolf during SWM. nothing suggests he was slow relative to them, as opposed to being slow or bad at school in general. if he was bad at school, he'd obviously also be slow compared to them. we don't know what he contributed to the map. he needed all the help he could get for the animagus. and to be frank, the actual process seems more tedious than difficult. we know that there are students who accomplish it younger than the marauders in other parts of the world

also, i don't see that lupin was especially talented

sirius told snape how to get past the willow, betraying lupin's trust. during the war, sirius and lupin, suspected each other during the war. sirius was, objectively, not a good friend. he'd still die for lupin

snape would do anything to keep lily alive. /anything/. snape was also a horrible friend

  Also, if Pettigrew had always been disloyal and an utter coward

this is my point. posts like this see only two extremes: either he was an obvious traitor, or the perfect friend. everything we see of wormtail suggests he's cowardly, sycophantic, annoying, and selfish. that's how he comes off in SWM. the key isn't to portray him as a good friend, but to portray his foibles as minor enough to allow the friendship to trudge on in context. maybe he did break under pressure from filch to some misdeed sometime

  Let's also not forget the whole "went through the trouble of learning how to become an Animagus just so Remus wouldn't be lonely" thing.

james and sirius were doing it. he trusted them to protect him, and can't very well refuse lest he be kicked out
