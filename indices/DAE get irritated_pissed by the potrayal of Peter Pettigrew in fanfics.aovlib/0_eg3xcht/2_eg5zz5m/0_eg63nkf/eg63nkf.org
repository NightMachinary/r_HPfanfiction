  he wasn't described as less bold and skilled than the marauders, though, he was described as 'slow' in general.

Sure, but in context that /means/ he was slow/er/ than the other three. Having such talented friends made him look worse for comparison, but Pettigrew consistently manages rather difficult magics throughout the series --- the Animagus Transformation, of course; contributing to the creation of the Marauder's Map; that spur-of-the-moment spell to blow up the Muggle street and cut his finger, /while/ performing the Transformation at the same time; casting a Killing Curse with another man's wand...

  you have no proof for this

...If nothing else, there's perhaps the fact that everyone, including Dumbledore, trusted him? Enough to make him the Secret-Keeper, enough for him to be a part of the Order of the Phoenix.

/Also/, if Pettigrew had always been disloyal and an utter coward, I don't think he'd have gone his whole school life without blabbing to Filch or some other authority figure about the Marauders, or, indeed, continued to participate in their reckless rule-breaking.

Let's also not forget the whole "went through the trouble of learning how to become an Animagus just so Remus wouldn't be lonely" thing.
