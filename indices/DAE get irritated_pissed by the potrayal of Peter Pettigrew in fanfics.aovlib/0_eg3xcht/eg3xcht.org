Yep. Me. "Less bold and skilled than the other Marauders" doesn't have to mean "irredeemably shlop", especially considering he still managed to become an Animagus at such a young age. And he was also not already showing signs of untrustworthiness and underlying evil as a kid; there's every reason to believe he was a good and loyal friend for most of his life, and only broke during the war because he just couldn't take the pressure of the constant Damocles sword. His betrayal loses most of its narrative and emotional weight if he was always a weaselly little coward ready to sell out his friends for anything.
