He's the weakest out of the Marauders, but hell he was able to become a Animagus; which is no easy feat. He had help; but was still able to do it.

He's able to trick James, Lily and Sirius, with no one being the wiser.

He's able to frame Sirius for James and Lily, and the 12 Muggles murder.

And he's able to escape, faking his own death and living life as a rat for years.

He's also able to bring Voldemort back.

Pretty damn awesome for the "weakest or dumbest Marauder" as so many people like to write him as.

Though I think a lot of it has to do with how Rowling ended up writing Pettigrew as well. Seeing him cower against Voldemort and the like.
