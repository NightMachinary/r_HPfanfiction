Yes, I was just saying this in the Sirius thread the other day.

Peter managed to complete the animagus transformation at 15/16. Yes, he had help. He still did it. He then proceeded to outmaneuver James, Lily, Remus, and Sirius simultaneously when he betrayed the Order, and then outmaneuvered Sirius again to get him sent to prison. Then, after a decade-plus as a rat, he brewed the potion needed for Voldemort's resurrection.

During the big confrontation in the Shrieking Shack, Sirius explicitly says that the rest of them would have died for Peter. That line has always had a particular ring of truth for me.

More than anything else that we haven't already learned from canon-supplemental material, I'd like to know a bit about Peter's backstory and what drew the other Marauders to him when they were kids.

I don't know that I rise to the level of getting pissed when Peter is written as a weak cartoon (since that is mostly how we see him act in canon) but I do have a lot of praise for a writer who is able to avoid that trope.
