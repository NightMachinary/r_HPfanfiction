True, but I was thinking more of his behavior in the SWM flashback. I remember being so disappointed the first time I read it because I was hoping for a window into a complex Judas-figure and instead we got Peter not able to name the signs of a werewolf on his exam (!) and so slavishly cheerleading James that Sirius tells James to stop before Peter wets himself.

Now maybe Peter was just the type to freak out during exams and forget everything he knows, which was frustrating to Sirius who was clearly the type to be so confident that he'd be in the mindset to guess correctly where he didn't know. And maybe coming down off the stress of the exams had him more in awe of, and unequal to, James than normal.

But it was still too much of a mirror of the Shrieking Shack in POA for me: Peter says idiotic things, Sirius doesn't bother to hide his disdain.
