I generally ignore him because I rarely see him written as anything more than a plot device to resurrect old Voldy, but I do remember one story where he had somehow been tricked into everything, he'd had some inkling of what was going on but he was as much a coward as he was clever, but later in the story he was very penitent about everything, and Harry had forgiven him for what happened and strong-armed Sirius and Remus into reluctantly forgiving him as well. I think he'd been under Voldy's imperius or something.

But yeah, it does get annoying when an author goes out of their way to write him as a buffoon.

How would you feel about him being written as clever enough to hide his being clever behind a dullard's fa√ßade? Maybe playing at being the good friend and gopher of the marauders (supplying snacks and supplies for prank planning sessions), while judging them and their pranks with hints and suggestions?
