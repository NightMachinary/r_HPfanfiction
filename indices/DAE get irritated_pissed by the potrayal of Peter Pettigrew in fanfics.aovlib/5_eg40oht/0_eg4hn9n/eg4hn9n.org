Well, now, Snape and Wormtail aren't exactly comparable when their motives for turning traitor were completely different. One did it out of love, however twisted that love may be and he kept at it even after his love's death just to repent for his sins. That's not to say his actions can be repented and the man himself doubts it, apparent by the shame he feels when he makes Dumbledore's swear he won't tell a soul.

Wormtail, in the other hand, turns out of fear. Though it is understandable for him to break under the pressure of war, it is his search of Voldemort after escaping from the Shack and his part in bringing that horror back when he could have just as easily disappeared into obscurity.

But you are right in that Wormtail proves himself to be a danger. Hell, he proved more dangerous that Lucius Malfoy at the height of the peacock's power. Would I call him the most dangerous Marauder? Perhaps not, but I don't think he was lesser than them.
