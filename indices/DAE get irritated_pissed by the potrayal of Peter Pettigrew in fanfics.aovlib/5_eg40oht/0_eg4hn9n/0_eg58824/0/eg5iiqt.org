  Wormtail says he did in the Shrieking Shack, but of course he would try to play into Sirius's perceptions.

Everyone always takes that conversation at face value, when it's obvious that Pettigrew just tried to bullshit his way out. What else could he say when it was revealed he was a Death Eater? That he joined Voldemort of his own free will to indulde his baser instincts and score one over his more talented, popular and successful friends who had always underestimated him? Instead, he tried to portray himself as a victim to avoid being killed on the spot and escape. A good strategy, seeing that it worked.
