In the Last Mage series, Voldemort notes that he can rely on Peter far more than most of his other followers because Peter knows /when/ to exit stage left, meaning that once the dust has settled, Peter is available to assist Voldie in resurrecting once again for another try.

Peter may not be a front-line combatant like most of Voldie's minions, but he's something far more valuable than just another minion, he's a safety net.
