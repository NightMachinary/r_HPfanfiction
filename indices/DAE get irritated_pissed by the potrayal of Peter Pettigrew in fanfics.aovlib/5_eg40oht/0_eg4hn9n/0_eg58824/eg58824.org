  Wormtail, in the other hand, turns out of fear.

Does he, though? Everyone else /says/ he did, but everyone else has already been proven wrong about Wormtail multiple times. Wormtail says he did in the Shrieking Shack, but of course he would try to play into Sirius's perceptions. Maybe Wormtail himself believes he did it out of fear and because he had no other options -- he tells himself this to assuage his guilt over his betrayal. But.. Wormtail's actions are entirely incongruous with the perception that he is a coward. He joined the Order /and/ the Death Eaters -- both highly dangerous organisations. He /chose/ to turn spy against the Order and successfully spied on them for more than a year -- a spy, the most gutsy profession there can possibly be! He lobs off his own body parts with impunity where most people would balk, he argues with Voldemort regarding the morals of killing, he /wants/ to be put in dangerous (and important) missions by Voldemort, he has been breaking rules ever since he joined school and became friends with the Marauders.

So I don't believe Peter is or was ever a coward. Normally cautious and perpetually nervous, maybe. Coward, no. Peter always chose to associate himself with the biggest bullies in town. For security, perhaps, but also for self-importance, and for satisfying his baser urges for violence. He is described in the pensieve scene to be watching James and Sirius bully Snape eagerly and delightfully egging them on. But post-Hogwarts James and Sirius are no longer the big bad bullies on top of the world -- that's Voldemort. Even with the Marauders he probably resented that he was a bit of a hanger-on and seen as seen as weak and unintelligent -- perhaps that is why he is initially /offended/ that Voldemort chooses Barty Crouch over him in GoF. Wormtail probably saw joining the death Eaters as a super grand and cool thing, a place where he would finally be appreciated. Alas, Voldemort seems to bear as much disdain for him as his now former friends.

So I doubt Wormatil's motive for turning against his friends was something as simple as fear. It may have been part of it -- insofar as being part of the winning side appealed to him, but it just doesn't add up on its own -- and Wormtail shows other motivations in the series that make more sense imo.
