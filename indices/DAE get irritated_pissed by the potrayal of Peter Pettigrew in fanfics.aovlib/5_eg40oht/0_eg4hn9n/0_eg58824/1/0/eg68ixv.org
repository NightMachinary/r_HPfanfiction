  everything suggests he's weak, and a coward.
#+end_quote

no, there's pretty much /nothing/ that suggests he's weak or cowardly, quite the opposite. Infact, that's the whole thesis -- "he cannot possibly have been a coward, so let's look for other motives"

#+begin_quote
  nothing suggests he's power hungry or resents his friends.
#+end_quote

Not exactly wording I would have chosen, but both of those things can well be argued. As I have.

  also, voldemort can read minds. he knows why wormtail is on his side, which is why he treats him like dirt, despite being his most useful DE
#+end_quote

Wormtail obviously knows occlumency. He's a fucking spy, and he's been playing at pretence most of his life. Volemort would be a fool to trust his legilimemcy.
