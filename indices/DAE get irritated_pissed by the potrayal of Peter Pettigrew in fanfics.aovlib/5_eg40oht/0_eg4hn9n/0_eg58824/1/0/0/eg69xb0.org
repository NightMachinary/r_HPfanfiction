except everything does, lol. he joins the order because james and sirius do, and with a war on, he thinks he's safest closest to them. either voldemort gets to him or he thinks voldemort is winning, so he defects. both actions are in line with him as a coward, but a specific type of coward- he thinks he's safest only with stronger people. as for 'baser instincts'- he eggs james and sirius on because he's their sycophant, and it's snape, who probably talked shit about him, or hexed him. wormtail prioritises his own safety above all. also, if he wants power or respect, aligning himself with people treat him like dirt, which james, sirius and voldemort all do, isn't exacty the way to go. he lobs his hands off because again, he thinks he's safest with voldemort

  Wormtail obviously knows occlumency. He's a fucking spy,

that's...not obvious at all, or canon. being a spy doesn't mean you know occlumency. nor was he playing at pretense most of his life. he was an anxious, slow kid, and learned to act within that perception of himself, but he can't really change that perception
