I always got the feeling that Peter really was hanging onto the group and not a real best friend in some ways. Sure he stuck around with them and they had mutual affection for him, but would he have been friends with any of them had he not been in Gryffindor? He did seem relatively weak and talentless compared to most.

Cunning doesn't have to mean smart. I know plenty of people who are clever and cunning in a viscous sense without being smart.

The animagus argument holds little water in my eyes when you've got two incredibly talented people carrying you most of the way. All you've got to be is not entirely shit.
