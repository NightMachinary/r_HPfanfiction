There was that kind of sweet peice from Hbp where fred dabbed the antidote for one of his inventions on hermione's eye, besides that I personally like the pairing for Hermione because the two are good opposites of each other. No hate on ron, but him and Hermione are bad opposites. Fred can bring hermione back to earth and have fun but also can match Hermione intellectually and challenge her.
