honestly, they do make sense to me. they clash early on because of disregard for rules and poor work ethic by the only metric she knew to measure by at the time (grades).

but fred/george, despite their grades, are probably more 'studious' than anybody except hermione herself. they regularly start with an idea, and then research and experiment tirelessly until its completed (which i think she begins to realize when she tries the daydream charm).

if hermione can get past the joking mindset (and her views on rules definitely relaxes over the series), i think they'd be kindred spirits as intellectuals and magical researchers.
