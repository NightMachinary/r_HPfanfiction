From what I remember, it was revealed in an interview at one point that Mr. Weasley was originally going to die in OotP but she saved him. Around the same time she was considering killing off one of the trio - and it probably would've been Ron. Because of these two deaths not following through, Rowling knew she wanted at least one Weasley to die - so a twin it would be. After Ron and Ginny, we only really get to know the twins compared to the rest.

Because of this, many people assumed that had Fred not died and Ron been sacrificed- Hermione would've ended up with another Weasley. And it was decided on Fred. Probably because he's the one that died. Who knows.

In reality I think that if Rowling has decided to kill Ron- we would've gotten Harmony. And I would probably have burned my books. But what can you do?
