Well.......to be honest, I find that a rather inappropriate question and it would be some kind of media suicide for him to even try to answer it. Something would get misunderstood and suddenly he's either a "homophobe" or "sexual deviant who swings both ways" (or he thinks Harry Potter is one or the other).

You always have to consider,when asking these questions, that Daniel Radcliffe (and others) are /very/ public figures and anything they say can easily be twisted if they're not careful.

I also find it a bit silly to basically say that all hp fanfiction is just slash, because there is a tremendous amount of fanfiction without pairings or hetero pairings (Hermione/Harry, Hermione/Draco, Ginny/Harry, Hermione/Ron, Ginny/Draco, etc).

Basically, in my mind, asking Dan Radcliffe this question is the equivalent to asking Alan Rickman how he would feel about re-making the HP series with a sexual relationship between Snape and Hermione.

Sorry...but it's just not appropriate. *IF* you had just asked how he felt about fanfiction in particular and what he thought was the funniest pairing he heard of, then that's great. But, unfortunately, I feel you crossed a line and it felt uncomfortable.

Sorry if I came off as rude; I'm just honestly stating my thoughts on this.
