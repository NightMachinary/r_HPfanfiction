I was just giving my honest thought about it. If you had merely discussed slash in general, it would have been interesting, but I felt that it went a bit too far. Especially seeing that Harry Potter is actually a series for children. Like they say in Firefly, "we try not to (overly) sexualize (them)" in public because children read the books.

Also, just because it's on reddit doesn't mean it stays on reddit. When Robert Downey Jr did his AMA, he confirmed they were working on a new Sherlock film. The next day, five news articles from different sites announced the same thing, misquoting or jumping to conclusions. Same with any other celebrity AMA, you have people scouring them for details that could make an interesting article.

And just because they've done a sexual performance in another genre/show doesn't mean that they feel comfortable answering a question.

Rowling confirmed the sexuality of characters, she didn't go into detail saying Harry should have various underage and explicitly sexual relationships with other characters in every chapter. That's one huge thing: Harry Potter is underage throughout the series (except for DH). The only books they might be willing to do would be HBP and DH, and, to put sex and sexual relationships at the front of the series undermines the rest of it. Also, if they did do the earlier ones the focus on the main character's storyline would be taken away by simply having an 11-year-old engaging in a lot of sex (hetero or homo). I think that this point, especially, needed to be clarified in your question. Because, like I said, Harry is underage for the majority of the series.

A a fanfiction perspective, it's a neat concept. However, realistically speaking, I don't even think JK Rowling would have answered it. I just don't think it was appropriate or something he (Dan) wanted to answer. Or perhaps Victoria thought it was inappropriate and didn't read it to him (depending on the way they did it). Would I like to have known an answer? Perhaps. But, I don't think it was appropriate in the context that Harry Potter was a children's book, starring underage youth.

All I did was provide my opinion and I'm sorry if I offended you but I, personally, thought it was an inappropriate question.

Like I said, maybe if it was a more general slash question, he might have answered. But, in my opinion, I didn't feel it was very appropriate.

Again, I apologise if I have offended you. It's just my opinion. I have nothing against homosexual relationships or sex in fanfics (I have written my fair share of oneshots and sex scenes), but I think that the wording, what it suggested, and the omission of discussing Harry being underage, made it sound inappropriate (to me).

Sorry if I came off as rude or offensive.
