I am fully aware of this, which is why I said they /may/ include HBP. But for 5 out of the 7 books, he is /under/ 16. However, there is an addition to this law, stipulating that it is illegal for an individual over 18 who is considered in a "position of trust" to have sexual relations with anyone under 18 (Section 47 of the Sexual Offences Act, 2003). So that would definitely complicate things depending on the relationships.

I think that the idea you have would have worked best in the last two books, and perhaps as a pre-epilogue, post-final battle series. But it wouldn't work for the first 5 books at all, as it is pretty inappropriate (and most likely illegal) to sexualize anyone under the age of consent.

We just have to consider that just because explicit sexual relationships work in certain shows/contexts (e.g. Skins or True Blood), it doesn't mean it would work in the Harry Potter series. /Could/ it work? Possibly, but it would mean completely reworking a lot of the series, especially the ages of the characters, and possibly undermining the real story that JK Rowling created.
