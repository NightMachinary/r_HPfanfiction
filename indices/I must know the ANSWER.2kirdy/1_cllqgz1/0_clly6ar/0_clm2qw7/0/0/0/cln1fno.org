Anyway, the AMA is over and he didn't answer the question so I'm done with this but personally I think its more important to remain true to life than it is to be politically correct. The mode average age in America since the 1920's to lose your virginity has been 12 (as in adults late in life were asked what age they lost their virginity). Personally, I started a sexual relationship with my best friend when I was 11. Characters can have sexual relationships without anything explicit being shown on screen. Heck, [Harry rolls over in bed and smiles at Ron drooling on the pillow beside him. He rubs his hand on Ron's arm and Ron's eyes flutter open. "Morning." Ron says with a yawn before smacking his lips and give a contented smile, his hair entirely a mess. "Good morning, you were amazing last night." The boys kiss briefly. "You too. I guess we ought to get dressed before someone sees us in bed together. (he nuzzles Harry's neck) We wouldn't want that would we?"]

Seriously, not hard. It was a joking question, not serious, but it WOULD have been nice if there'd been an openly gay student somewhere in the books. I mean really, give the Weasley's a younger effeminate male cousin. Heck, show how cool the magical community is where being gay has never been a problem. Make it one of Voldemort's rallying cries about how inferior muggles are, that they'd abandon their own children for loving someone because of the way they were born.
