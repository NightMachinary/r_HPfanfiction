First of all, the actual series already has a million hetero pairings. The only homo pairing is only alluded to in the very vaguest of terms, so much so that Rowling had to actually have a press conference to announce it for anyone to actually realize it was there. And it has a spectacularly UNhappy ending.

Second of all, Daniel Radcliffe has already one film where he has an EXTREMELY explicit sex scene with a man, and I believe Rupert Grint did as well in Cherry bomb. Besides that he's gone fully nude on stage in front of a live audience.

Third I'm fairly certain he's already discussed who he'd like to do a male on male sex scene on a late night british talk show

Fourth, the previous show I mentioned "Skins" is the iconic british teen television show, and the amount of shagging that goes on between people of ever gender on that show is ridiculous. I doubt most people in the UK would care and considering the gay sex in his recent film has done nothing to tarnish the American love for Daniel Radcliffe, I doubt that a question on Reddit is going to destroy his image.

Fifth, seeing how recent Rowling's interview was, its a relevant question.
