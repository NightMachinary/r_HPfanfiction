I love Hermione/Snape, so that is what these are. If that's not your cup of tea, well....

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=15865][Back in Black]] is a story that involved Umbridge running the country and Hermione, Snape, the Weasley Twins, and Ginny as the resistance.

Also, [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/3553046][Spellcaster by SGCBearcub]] is the trio at their best- the story involved marriage-law, book binding, resistance, and the coming together (somewhat) or purebloods, half-bloods, and muggles-born girls. I had to hunt to find this link, since the author has pulled their fics off of ff.n.
