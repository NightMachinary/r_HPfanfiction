Wizard currency is sort of a parody of the old British pre-decimal currency -- the type of British currency that was in use up until the 1970s. If you think wizard currency makes no sense, it has NOTHING on what British Muggles used;

Two farthings make a ha'penny, two ha'pennies make a penny, four pence make a groat, six pence make a sixpence, two sixpence make a shilling, two shilling makes a florin, two and a half shilling (or five sixpence) make a half-crown, two half-crowns make a crown, four crowns make a sovereign or a pound.... and then there was the guinea, which was twenty-one shillings... I've probably forgotten some.

Course, all this was long before my time, but I've read enough old English kids' books to know how confusing the system was... and yet, and this is kind of funny, when the UK went on the much more logical and easily-grasped decimal system (you know, 100 pence in one pound and done), a lot of people complained because the new system MADE NO SENSE and the old system was so much EASIER....

Which just goes to show that if you're used to something you don't realize how absurd it looks to people on the outside.
