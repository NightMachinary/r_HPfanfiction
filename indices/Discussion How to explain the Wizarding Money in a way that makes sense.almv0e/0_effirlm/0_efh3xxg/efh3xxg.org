I would imagine the gold, silver, and copper scheme ultimately trace back to goblins. I do wonder how significant the roles of goblins are in other magical societies. Maybe they're just native to Britain? They do seem to play a significant role in the magical history without mention of other lands.

Also, I think an area where money would have a significant value would definitely be buying land. You can just enchant areas to be bigger with an extension charm, but I don't know if that applies to open spaces.
