It's very simple: wizards use money mostly because it makes running their society easier, but fundamentally, they don't need it. Money buys /conveniences/, but a competent sorcerer could live in luxury without a penny to his name. With enough Transfiguration and Space-Extension Charms you can create a palace out of a shack.

As such, their economy doesn't /need/ to make sense. If the Wizarding Economy crashed overnight (as it surely has in the past), the material consequences would amount to having to delay buying that new broomstick or wand you wanted for a few weeks (long enough, perhaps for the Ministry to imprison/bribe whoever's actons caused it to crash in the first place), after which Minister Fudge will just make a speech about how Galleons are once again worth whatever they were worth before, and everything goes back to normal.

And with what little contact they have with the Muggle world, it /certainly/ doesn't need to correlate with Muggle money in a very solid way. The Goblins and Ministry dictate an exchange rate for the purpose of Muggle-Borns who are starting out in the Wizarding World, but it's probably not particularly significant or representative of the money's actual value (insofar as it has one).

The only one who understand any of it properly are the Goblins of Gringotts, and possibly, /possibly/ some underpaid Ministry clerk somewhere.

  Would the Wizarding money be different; from say Britain, to America, to France; et cetra? Or would it stay the same?

I think different Wizarding Nations mint their own coins (they /certainly/ have different names), but probably keep the same gold-silver-copper scheme. So presumably Wizard Americans pay in "Magical Dollars" or "Simoleons" or whatever, but but when you actually weigh the gold coins they call that, they're more or less equivalent to Galleons.
