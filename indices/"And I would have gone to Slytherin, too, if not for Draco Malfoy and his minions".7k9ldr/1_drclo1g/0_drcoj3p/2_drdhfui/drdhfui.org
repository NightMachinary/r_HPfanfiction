That said, I will point out that if Draco wasn't being a little piece of shit (I know, it would make the story very AU), then Harry might have gotten enough info about Slytherin, info framed in good colours, from Draco to not have to ask Hagrid about it. Then, again if he wasn't being a little piece of shit, he could have actually met Harry properly in the compartment without giving him a negative impression about himself and thus also Slytherin after he got sorted. And the sorting had also sings “You'll make your real friends” about Slytherin, which is something he could have followed on instead of the latter line if he valued whatever relationship he had with Draco (again, would require Draco to not be a little piece of shit).

As such, I do believe that while Draco being friendly to Harry does not automatically mean that Harry would go to Slytherin, it definitely was a possibility, however low, and Draco did squash that by being himself.
