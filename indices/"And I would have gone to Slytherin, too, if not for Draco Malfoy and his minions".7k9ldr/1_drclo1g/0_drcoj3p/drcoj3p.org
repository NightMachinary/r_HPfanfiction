In order:

1. Draco mentions Slytherin at Madam Malkin's. We get no impression about what Harry thinks about this.
2. Harry asks Hagrid about Slytherin. Hagrid says that there isn't a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. (I guess Sirius Black doesn't count.)
3. Ron implies that his parents would be gravely disappointed in him, or worse, if he were in Slytherin.
4. The Sorting Hat says that Slytherins use "any means" to achieve their goals.
5. Harry observes that Slytherins tend to look like an unpleasant lot.
6. Harry asks the Hat not to sort him into Slytherin.
7. The Hat says that Slytherin would help him become great.

So it's not a want-of-a-nail sort of thing; from what Harry can see, if he goes into Slytherin, everyone will hate him and think he's evil. And he'll have to deal with people who aren't good at looking pleasant. Remember, kids, ugly on the outside means ugly on the inside!
