Unless I'm confusing canon with fanon, I think Ron also said something on the train bashing slytherin shortly after he and Harry became friends. I think that that would have made more of a difference to Harry's choice than Draco being a jerk. If only because we are led to believe that Harry didn't have many friends when he lived at the Dursley's.
