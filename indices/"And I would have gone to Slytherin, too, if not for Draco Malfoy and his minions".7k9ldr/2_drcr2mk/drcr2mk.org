I think Draco did factor into the decision. He didn't much like him, not because of his beliefs or dogma, but more his resemblance in character to Dudley. Harry also notes the "thuggish, and brutish" appearance of the Slytherin table. Combine that with Ron's comments (about You-Know-Who), Malfoy and Co. moving to Slytherin, you get Harry against joining said house.
