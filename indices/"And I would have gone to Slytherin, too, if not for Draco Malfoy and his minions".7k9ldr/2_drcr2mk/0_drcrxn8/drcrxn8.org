Did the Slytherin table really look that bad, or did Harry see them as thuggish because he had been primed to do so by others? Not a conspiracy theory here, just an observation that humans tend to see what's been pointed out to them by people they are inclined to like.

Also, Ron could be a prejudiced little git nearly as much as Draco could, but Harry had already fallen in with Ron and so absorbed some of his prejudices as truth.
