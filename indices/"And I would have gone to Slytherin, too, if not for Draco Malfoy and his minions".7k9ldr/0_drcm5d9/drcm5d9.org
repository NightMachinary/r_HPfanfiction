I wonder, however, if Malfoy had been friendly to him when they met in Diagon Alley, would Harry had more of an inclination to Slytherin? Because Harry associated Slytherin with Malfoy's rudeness (Malfoy had mentioned wanting to be sorted into Slytherin), and was probably influenced further with Ron's comment against Slytherins.

I imagine he wouldn't have been so receptive to Ron had Draco been friendlier.
