It's not just Malfoy's rudeness, though that was one of the many contributing factors.

Hagrid also tells Harry that not only was Voldemort in Slytherin, but every witch or wizard who went bad as well. Biased Hagrid is biased, but at that point Harry trusts him implicitly because he is Harry's only source of information.

Harry also notices in the Great Hall that he likes the look of Slytherin table less than the others, a first hand observation on top of Ron and everyone else except Malfoy hating on the house.

Pile all that together and I don't think it would have mattered what Malfoy did. I can only imagine how much Harry would have been turned off if he shared a compartment with Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle regardless of how slick Draco managed to be.
