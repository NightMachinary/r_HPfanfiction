Ron wanted to stand out from his - arguably brilliant - brothers, and I suppose Ravenclaw has a better reputation than Hufflepuff and Slytherin. Also, he's /11/, and being home-schooled, he probably had no idea about the workload that awaited them.

That's at least far from the "anti-Slytherin vitriol" that he's supposedly said.
