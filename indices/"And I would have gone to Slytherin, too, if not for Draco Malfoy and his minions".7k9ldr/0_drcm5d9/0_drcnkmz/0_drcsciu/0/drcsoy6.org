  "Mum and Dad were in [Gryffindor] too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw /would/ be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin."

You're kind of right, but I read that as pretty negative toward Slytherin specifically and worried about others for family reasons.

Also, not sure how Ron thought Ravenclaw would be an option for him.
