Canon, the Sorting Hat basically offered Harry /three/ choices†: "Plenty of courage ... not a bad mind ... and a nice thirst to prove yourself...", and Harry responded /Not Slytherin, not Slytherin./ The Sorting Hat then simply suggested some reasons why Slytherin might be a good choice, but didn't put up much of a fight about it.

I'm sure Hagrid, Ron, and Draco all played a part in Harry's not wanting to go to Slytherin, so it's fine with me if fanfics want to be slightly AU about it.

† Apparently the Sorting Hat saw nothing about hard work or loyalty...
