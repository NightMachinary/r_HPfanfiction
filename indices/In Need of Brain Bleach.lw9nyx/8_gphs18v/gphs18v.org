There have been a few pairings I won't stand behind. Most of them involve professors with their students. I am still recovering from the Lupin/Hermione smut I read back a decade ago. The author didn't warn for it, just hit chapter x and it was Lupin taking advantage of his position as a professor and forcing himself onto Hermione... who was worried that she was failing his class...

And that was when I made the decision to never read a Lupin story that wasn't set in the Marauders Era.
