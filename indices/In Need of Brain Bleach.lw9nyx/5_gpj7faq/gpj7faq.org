There is some truly sick shit on A03...worse than that.

But I actually think a crack fic with Snape/Vernon could be kind of funny. Now I'm picturing a story where Snape is still lusting after Lily but worried since he knows he sent Voldemort after her (while not giving a shit about poor Harry and James). He goes to a bar, gets drunk to forget everything, and randomly meets and falls in bed with Vernon. They have a low key FWB hate sex situation (with Snape now worried that Voldy will find out he told Dumbledore & is banging a muggle)...and then Petunia finds out. Petunia freaks and somehow finds a way to contact Lily (maybe by phone) and Lily and James decide to take her in (despite the nasty past)...but Godric's Hollow is too small for the three of them plus Harry plus Dudley. They go off and find another place to live...meanwhile, Dumbledore kills Voldemort.

Ten years later, Harry goes to Hogwarts and Snape is still a bastard to him...but Harry snarks right back and tells everyone "he's a homewrecker who ruined my aunt's marriage", coughs and goes "professor slut, oops, i mean snape", etc. (not to promote slut shaming, but the idea of kid harry slut shaming Snape would be the vibe).
