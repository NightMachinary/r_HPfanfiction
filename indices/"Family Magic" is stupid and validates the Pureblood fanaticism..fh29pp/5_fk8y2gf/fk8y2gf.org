I also dislike how it sometimes is portrayed as like, if you leave family that's betrayal of family so the magic will be like you're out, but it seems to give no shits about about abusive relatives, which I'd argue is a worse betrayal because children can't defend themselves. And I guess some of them just give me weird vibes about how blood family is strong, who cares about chosen family.
