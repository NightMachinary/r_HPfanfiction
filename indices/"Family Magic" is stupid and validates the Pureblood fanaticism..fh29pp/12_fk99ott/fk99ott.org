Of course Family Magic and Lordship does credit the pureblood agenda it is only logical. The only bad side of the pureblood agenda is genocide in this case. But if there is equality without Lordship and family magic the pureblood agenda has only the statute of secrecy preservation as valid point and the inherent consequences for Mudbloods that create a delay in their education from those raised in the magical world. Yes Hermione is a counter example but she is just that an exception towards a general rule. But if there is the elements of Family Magic and Lordship the pureblood have more valid points that their counterparts. That is why the middle ground in this case would be to raise all magical children in the magical world without exception. And create a way for the Muggleborns to gain in social status maybe some new patents of nobility ?
