I believe I read one where the 'powerup' actually made sense. I believe it was Family Magicks or something where Merlin basically gifted some magic to the founding families. Which normally just shows up on oaths, to signify it. However, this fanfiction plays it beautifully(IMO) and says the reason Harry can use it so well is due to his power, magically. It would make sense, seeing as the two power rivals, Voldemort and Dumbledore, wouldn't be able to use a method of such. Voldemort is a bastard heir, so not really considered one by Magic, which is sentient. Dumbledore's family didn't contribute to founding the wizarding council and such, so his family wasn't gifted a totem. This gives a special element for Harry, without it being too overpowered as it is not able to do everything.
