Yeah, parseltongue is probably where the trope comes from in fanfiction (though it derailed a bit).

I actually think it has a lot of creative potential, but I wish more writers would treat that kind of magic like canon does. Like, purebloods insisting family magic proves pureblood superiority, but then you have Tom Riddle and Harry Potter, both half-blood parselmouths, making the argument null or at least arguable.
