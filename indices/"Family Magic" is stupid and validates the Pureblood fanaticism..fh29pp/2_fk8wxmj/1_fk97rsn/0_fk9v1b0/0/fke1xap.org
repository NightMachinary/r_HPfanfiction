Yeah I agree. Metamorphmagi, Potter's' weird hair-growing ability, Parseltongue, etc are neat examples of magical abilities passed down genetically, but from a single "mutation" in their family line from a magical ancestor.

Kind of like their magic has a very specific quirk which operates 100% of the time all the time. It's code, in a sense: "If hair != x then HarryHair(1);" or whatever. Maybe magical peoples have some weird DNA editing ribosomes that, in certain families, prefer to turn DNA into proteins that just go bonkers and give these unique qualities. People think magic is dying out but it's really just a case of people being more concerned with maintaining the status quo, being safe, raising families, having opportunities, etc rather than embarking on crazy experiments or massive ritualistic community projects that reshape the entire landscape.

This kind of ties into how magical the world "used" to be in the times of Merlin and the Founders etc, which I like to just chalk down to people being far more patient and less reliant on wands. They got shit done because they decided to do a project and everyone committed. Need to seclude a district in London from the Muggles? Yeah, I agree, let's all work together to hide it with runestones and come up with a plan and some rituals etc. People just had patience whereas now everything is mastery of wand work (a prevalence I'd attribute to the Tales of Beedle the Bard) and so all that old magic shit just seems really "powerful" when it was just the way things worked in the past.
