... Parseltongue is canon family magic, though? Another example for me is Harry's patronus being so similar to his parents'. Whether inherently in the blood or a subconscious desire to be closer to their family, someone's magic (perhaps as an extension of their personal identity) is influenced by their family. A muggleborn's magic would also be influenced by their family, but their family is nonmagical so the effects could perhaps be more subtle. For example, Hermione being drawn to more structured magical arts could be due to her parents' careers.

It could be a combination of natural predisposition and a body of knowledge passed down from previous generations.
