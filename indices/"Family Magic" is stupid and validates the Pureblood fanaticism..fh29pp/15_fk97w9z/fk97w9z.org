I read one fanfic that I felt did the family magic right and that one had it if you were brought into the family the older members of said family cod use as a port key/apperation endpo8nt in a similar way to the dark mark if you were in danger which did make sense to me. As nearly all the time people were killed it was either in hogwarts where no one can apprrate or portkey into or it was the family elders or hit and run (apprrate in though a bunch of killing curses and apprrate out) attacks so no one could respond.
