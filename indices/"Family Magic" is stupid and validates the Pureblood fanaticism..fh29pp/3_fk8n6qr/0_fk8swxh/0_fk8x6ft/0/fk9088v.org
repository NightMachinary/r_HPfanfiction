That's the point, though. Having superior abilities that are passed down through the generations means the pureblood fanatics and bigots are actually right. If you nerf it through time, they're even more right, since obviously muggle blood has diluted it.

The exact opposite is true in canon - Andromeda black, the first one to have a child with a muggleborn in generations, has a child who is also the first metamorph in generations. That metamorph's child is even more powerful than she is.

While that would be an example of "family magic", it's not as all-encompassing as family magic or what you described tends to be. For instance, I bet a skilled wizard could pull off the same trick, and essentially "learn" to be a metamorph through a few years of training, until they can basically wandlessly transfigure their own body. This is even better than being a natural metamorph, because all that practise will mean you're going to become a master at transfiguration in the process.
