yea but it could be played upon. for example some family having the ability to mind read. someone was like well eff them and their spying I'll just figure out how to do it too. so they create legillimens (sorry I don't know spelling) and teach people so the family isn't unique any longer. maybe there's some family that were natural animagus (ie an equivalent of metamorph). someone said that's so cool I wanna do it, and dedicated their entire lives to creating the spell/potion wtvr to replicate it. this now shows purebloods are wrong they aren't special or unique anymore. with hardwork and dedication you could get the exact same "unique" trait and make it so anyone gets it. In fact maybe because of this the family lost all notoriety and now nobody knows of the family. just lost to history because someone did it better. sort of like someone creating a cheaper easier alternative to big pharmacy company expensive drugs but the magic equivalent.

a kind of eff you to the purebloods. you think you're so cool because only your family can talk to snakes? well I just created a spell that allows me to talk to all reptiles not just snakes. and if you consider Grimoire and how those are often the written down accounts of spells and potions etcetera it's just someone figuring out that without having the recipe. Fullmetal alchemist's alchemy would be a way to sort or run with it I think.
