I admire how much thought some authors put into their original mythologies, trying to explain what exactly magic is and where it comes from, and what is really going on with blood purity, muggleborns, Squibs, and rare magical talents. One of the worst "purebloods really are better" stories I've read was both interesting and frustrating to read. I think there is room in the fandom for some of these stories, if they are done well, but I agree that they can be bad examples of lazy writing.

Are Parselmouths descended from Naga, and Metamorphmagi from some kind of shapeshifters? Where did those creatures come from? Were these actually latent Potter/Black family talents, which were somehow brought out by the mix of muggle genes from Lily and Ted's parents? Or were Lily and Ted actually fairy changelings, and these talents really came from them? (I love this idea) Are muggleborns descended from Squibs, or does their magic spontaneously appear? Why doesn't the number of muggleborns seem to mimic the population explosion of muggles (or does it, and only a small fraction of them are actually invited to Hogwarts)?

There is so much in the books that is never fully explained, and so many plot holes and inconsistencies that leave room for fanfiction writers to fill in the gaps. When one person comes up with a new idea, and their story becomes popular, it will inevitably spawn a host of copycats who do it badly, until this idea becomes a reviled trope.
