Nasuverse Magic is a good example of it done well in my opinion. Each family of dedicated Mages build up their knowledge of magic and develop certain spells and techniques of doing things and the older the family the richer and more powerful the mage, because they would have more access to things that an ordinary mage wouldn't. Check out the nasuverse wiki if you want to know more, I'm still a bit of a novice. And I agree as well with your final point, â€˜Phoenix Force bullshit' is indeed annoying.
