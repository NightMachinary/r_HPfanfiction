Open up two family grimoires and they're 90% the same. Some small variations in how the spells are cast, but functionally they cover the same needs, so they are the same. Wife brings some of her childhood spells into the household upon marriage, they get added to the family grimoire. Brother teaches brother a potion he learned from his father-in-law, it's now in three grimoires.\\
In the end there are maybe one or two spells found in a family grimoire not found in any other one.
