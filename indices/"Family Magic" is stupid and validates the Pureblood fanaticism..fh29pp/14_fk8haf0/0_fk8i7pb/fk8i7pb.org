It's not that it doesn't agree with my ideals, it's the fact that in most fics where this is featured the entire Family Magic system is basically built around it growing in power as it's family does. And instead of doing something cool with it like say, making the pureblood fanaticism come from them misunderstanding how family magic works, which in this case would be it growing stronger over the generations with each new magical added to said family. They misunderstand it as "If we keep it in our bloodline it gets stronger and those darn muggles can't steal it from us"

their are many ways to keep it interesting and do the idea well, but most authors use it as again, a power up or phoenix force style bullshit where it has it's own mind and gets stronger as a plot device. they don't explain it in world and they ignore it when the plot needs them to ignore it.

Their are plenty of cool fic ideas you can do with Family Magic as a sentient concept, but most authors don't, they just think "Oh it'd be kill if harry's magic was sentient and the shape of a lion and could fuckin kill people who wrong his family" and that's about as far as the line of thinking goes, they don't think past the cool ascetic of the powers and ignore the world building implications of said powers.

a good example is how does family magic form? Why don't Muggleborns have their own though weak form of family magic? Why is it that in most fics the Weasely's or Malfoy's have some weak spaghetti family magic while say the Greengrasses, Longbottom's and Potter's get some uber strong family magic? why doesn't Voldemort get his own Slytherin Family Magic?

it's questions like these that are unanswered that cause alot of fics to fall flat on their face and just fall into the rule of cool and anime style power up bullshit that they like to fall into. Don't get me wrong, when you want to read something just to read something and be entertained that's fine, and I still enjoy some fics like this, but reading a fic that you want to read because the plot and story look interesting and will draw you in, only to be hit by "and then harry summoned his family magic and bitch slapped voldemort" isn't fun, it's frustrating.
