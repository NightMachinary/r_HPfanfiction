You're right. It doesn't have to be fair. There is no difference between the comparison between a wizard born into a family with strong family magic and a muggle born as there is between a wizard and a muggle, or a wealthy heiress and a poverty stricken waif.

Just because someone has an advantage given to them by chance of birth doesn't mean that they are better than those that don't have that advantage. It sucks for those that don't and in the world of Harry Potter the pureblood are sure to try to treat it as proof that they are better than muggleborn, but that doesn't make it truth.
