AKA "This doesn't align with my ideals, so it shouldn't exist. And if you don't agree with me, you are a racist!" This is the house elf bullshit all over again...

This isn't constructive criticism, nor is it a discussion. It's Us vs Them mentality.

  but unless said Muggleborns are adopted into the family they don't get access to the super power magic juice, they just get normal magic...

Which would make sense, since FAMILY MAGIC is literally magic that has developed over the generations. You make it sound like their family will NEVER have access to a magic like that. Welcome to real life, where some people are born with better circumstances.

  That's what family magic should be, not some Phoenix Force sentient bullshit

Okay, now that is constructive criticism and discussion-worthy. I agree with this one.
