I remember the Santi's HP and the Boy Who Lived had a pretty interesting take on Family Magic.

Rather than it being just a specific set of spells that only a certain family could do, it was that certain families had predispositions to certain types of magic, but they also had certain types of aversions to other types of magic. So certain families that were really good with transfiguration would marry into other families with good transfiguration predispositions so that their kids could do amazing things in transfiguration, but at the cost of having their kids being practically useless in charms.

The muggleborns were like the true neutral of magicals, no real predispositions towards or against certain magic types, so they could never really excel at a particular field, but they could also be well rounded magicals unlike the pureblood families who decided to specialize. A system of family magic like that could reinforce both the idea of pureblood supremacy to those who were trying to have their families specialize in certain fields, but also the idea that all of those specialized families would eventually be seriously inbred.
