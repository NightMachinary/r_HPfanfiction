Having Family Magic dosent have to be all upsides, The advantage of Being a Muggleborn is that you are a Blank slate and can learn any magic you want. Were as a person with Family magic might have more difficulty learning magic outside of their Familys magical affinities.

Think of the magic like a Bit of cloth the Muggelborn start out with a Clean bit of cloth outside of a few Drop of colour from were their accidental magic started to dye it.

Were as a someone with Family magic gets a Cloth that is partially or almost completely pre Dyed. and the Older/Stronger the Family magic the Stronger the Dye and the more of the cloth is pre dyed and the harder it is to Overright it its.
