I really like this idea, but it's not what Op is really talking about - they're complaining about the sort of family magic that makes Harry into a Gary Stu - he's the descendent of Merlin and all the founders, so he has innate abilities that let him steam roll the universe, is immune to curses, instinctively good at all magic, etc etc.
