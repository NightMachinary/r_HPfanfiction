There's three schools of thought on family magic, each can be written well, but the first is the one that's usually written badly.

1. Family magic = super powers

In this case, each family has some kind of spell or ability that either only family members can use, or is a family secret/grimmoire. This is the one OP is (justly) complaining about, since it flies in the face of 99% of canon. That 1% being hereditary abilities like the ability to speak Parceltongue, metamorphmagery, and the Potter Hair. One way to write this well is to include the fact that Muggleborns ALSO have a family super power, they just have to discover it. This lends itself to the propaganda that pure bloods favour - muggleborns are stealing the magic! Panic! A caveat to this is that Family Magic shouldn't make Harry a god or all stakes are gone, and it ends up being a power wank.

1. Family magic = the sum knowledge of those who came before.

This one makes the most sense with canon set up - it's literally just tips, tricks, and spells that family members have found and contributed to the family's store of knowledge. Not really flashy or amazing, but gives pure bloods a bit of a leg up when it comes to learning magic (if they put in the effort). This ones pretty easy to write well, as long as there's no long-lost “turn a person who has made horcruxes into a squib while destroying all their horcruxes at once” spell hidden away in some Potter journal.

1. Family magic = families specialize in branches of magic

Another that can make sense, if given proper context and pretty easy to write well. This idea is that a family's magic starts to “prefer” casting certain branches of magic. For example, the Finnegans might be predisposed to fire spells, making any spells that deal with combustion easier, while everything else is a bit of a struggle. In this example, muggleborns would basically be Jack-of-all-trades types, where a pureblood in a long line of pure bloods might be AMAZING at transfiguration, but absolute pants at charms. A really interesting twist on this would be if certain pureblood families that specialize in dark magic are losing their ability to cast all other types of magic, since they never introduce any “new blood” that would reset some of their specialization.

My two cents, but there you are
