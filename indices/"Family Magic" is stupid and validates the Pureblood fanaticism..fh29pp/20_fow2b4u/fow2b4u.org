I think that family magic is a pretty cool concept, up to a point, and not imposible to start anew.

If the family magic makes it so that you are super powerful, unkillable and able to do the impossible easily the it's shit.

But, if family magic pushes it's own to a certain way of acting, gives the family a bit more talent or affinity to certain subjets etc, then it would be awesome.

Yes, in a way it validates the movement, but no more than good genes make a good athlete with training, or a family of scientist have a better chance of getting a smart kid. It is still shit if you don0t give others the oportunity to grow, but for purebloods to have some kind of advantage would make sense, more so in magic.

I think having magic with it's own rules is pretty neat, swearing on your magic causes magic to fuck with you if you break it makes sense if the world's magic works like that and the punishments are consistent.

A et peeve of mine is about things ike the goblet of fire, it would be a great assassination tool, just covertly start a faux tournament, and put the names of your enemies in it without informing them, they will lose their magic beqcause it is so, no intent, no need to do it yourself.

One of the things I love about most magics is will, if someone can make a contract for you and have it affect you without your consent, family or not, I hate it.
