I'm not a fan of family magic either. However, there may be a kernel of canon truth to it. Some of these families have been around a long time, dabbled in all sort of magics, accumulated books and artefacts, know of magical places probably only they can access.

And it is canon that certain magical traits are hereditary. It is likely that some families would marry strategically to chance the most powerful and gifted offspring.

In that sense yes - "family magic" makes sense. However I'd like to see well built premise and reasoned backstory. Not because magic simply chose or otherwise sanctified one family over the other.
