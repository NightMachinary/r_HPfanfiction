The problem, is as always, bad writing not bad subject matter. I personally don't think that there is anything inherently wrong with the idea of powerful family magic that is passed down through blood. It certainly doesn't validate blood purism any more than the fact that magic is generally passed down through blood means that witches and wizards are better than muggles.

Yeah, witches and wizards live completely different lives than muggles, and have powers that muggles don't, but that doesn't mean that they magical supremacist ideals such as those of Grindelwald are correct.

It's the same thing. (Family magic -> muggleborn with no family magic) as (magic -> muggle with no magic)

It's actually a really valid opportunity to examine a different world with even more handicaps for muggleborn. One where muggleborns have to face the fact that they don't have these family magics, but convince the pureblood that do that they aren't worse than them. That being said I have never seen anyone write family magic like that super well, it's either not a major point, it's done super poorly like in your examples, or it never explores the consequences on the world.

I'd like to see a fic where muggleborn are almost envied for the control they have over their family magics. Pureblood families have strong magic that has grown over the years, but it grows along the path set by their ancestors, while muggleborn are the first of their lines and able to forge a new path for their lines. A tradeoff between strength and flexibility.
