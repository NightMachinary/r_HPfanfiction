I mainly read HP/GOT so here goes.

Linkffn(A Song of Ice, Fire and Lightning by Zero Rewind)

Awesome battle scenes, interesting additions to the world of magic. You don't need to read the previous story you can hop right in.

Linkffn(The Road to Hell by seagate)

All of Hogwarts appears in the North. Good Worldbuilding, fic focuses on Harry setting up shop and becoming a power player in Westeros.

Linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by DisobedienceWriter)

One of the better crossovers I've read. Harry systematically dismantles Westeros by planting trees. Very good characterizations. Highly recommend.

Linkffn(The Last Lion of House Reyne by joen1801)

Harry discovers his magic in Westeros, he doesn't universe travel. Tywin Lannister tries to destroy the Reynes, but Harry as a baby apparates them out to safety. Harry/OC, which is well done. Not your average take over the world crossover, its solid.

My personal favourite HP/GOT. Harry becomes king beyond the wall and establishes an empire. Literally the best world building I've read other than The Star Empire. This is a great read. Good establishment of a city and anticipating what problems occur with it.

Linkffn(The Black Prince by cxjenious)

Don't remember this one, but I know it was good. Sorry.

I am currently writing a HP/IC that focuses more on messing around than any pesky plot. Feel free and check it out, (shameless self promotion)
