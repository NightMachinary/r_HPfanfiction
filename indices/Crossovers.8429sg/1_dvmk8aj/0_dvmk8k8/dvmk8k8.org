  My reward for beating the Demon Emperor and sending him back to hell? Finding myself in an unknown land, hounded by heralds of ice and fire, as well as the idiotic peoples of the lands in this... Westeros. Is it possible to find a way home? I don't know. Eventual Harry/Daenerys. As in way, way later. Stop asking when :P

  Thrown into Alagaësia, Harry encounters a blue stone, visits Ellesméra, and tries to seduce an elven princess. Perhaps even in a strange world he can find rest. Or will he take up his wand and stand against evil yet gain? Either way with a dragon at his side he is bound to get himself into some adventures! Elements of a CRACK fic.

#+begin_quote
  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.
