I don't know. I read until around chapter 19 and it was still eh. Pretty generic and boring. The only reason I managed to read that far to the fic is because it might've been Haphne pairing. (I know it's as generic as the fic but hey, I didn't choose to love it) but instead it looked like it was just a random OC. Until chapter 19 I can say pretty confidently that it's just any WBWL ever. That's at about the end of year one I think, and I saw that year two is waaaay longer, so maybe the characters develop into something more interesting that the typical Slytherin group and It becomes more of its own thing rather than being Slytherin smartass Harry doing the canon stuff. AOC is like the 4th Slytherin Harry that I've read that just follows its brother to go get the stone instead of just doing some new fun plot for the first year. It probably doesn't change, don't read it unless you want a Harry/random OC that isn't mentioned for like 50k words until the author decides they need to start bonding a bit more.
