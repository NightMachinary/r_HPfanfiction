I remember enjoying Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux quite a bit, I don't remember if it was good since I read it like 2 years ago but it does change a bit more the stuff, still not completely new plot but the idea behind is just so much more interesting. Not WBWL though, and I'm pretty sure it had slash correct me if I'm wrong, but it wasn't really romance Harry just was manipulating the guy, I don't think they even kissed. If you want a more unique Slytherin!Harry try that, I'm sure I have read better stories that fit more with what you're looking for, but that's all that comes to my mind right now.
