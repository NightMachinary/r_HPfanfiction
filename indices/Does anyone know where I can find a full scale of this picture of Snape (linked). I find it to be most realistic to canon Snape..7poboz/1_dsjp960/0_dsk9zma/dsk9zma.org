Vizen's "she," not "he." Not a dude. The image was created for the Bring Back the Bastard fest hosted by the Deeply Horrible community, also run by not-a-dude. It was a fairly short-lived community created in reaction to the excess of fluffy, romantic Snapes in fandom. The goal was to encourage fanworks of canon Snape in all his malicious, bitter, grudge-holding, Dark-Arts-loving glory, and Vizen, who is a well-known Snape fan artist, contributed the banner.
