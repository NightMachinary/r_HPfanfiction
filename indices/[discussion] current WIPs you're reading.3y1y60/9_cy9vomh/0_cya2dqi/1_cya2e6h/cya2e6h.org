  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  (5/7) It is a dark time for Harry Potter. Voldemort is secretly amassing power, and only Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix opposes him. Abandoned, libeled, loathed and reviled, Harry has few allies and fewer options. Harry must learn to control his powerful and mysterious emerald trance; if he cannot, Harry will be consumed by darkness. (AU Slytherin!Harry)

  What if Harry were a Slytherin? What if everyone thought his twin brother was the BWL? What if someone tried to do something creative and innovative with the two most overused cliches in HP fanfic? AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Also, basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys.
