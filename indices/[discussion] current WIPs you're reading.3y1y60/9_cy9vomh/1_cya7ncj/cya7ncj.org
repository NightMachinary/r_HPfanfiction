Thanks for all the story recs, wow thats a loooot! I dont read naruto, maybe i'll have a look i just cant really fathom a crossover. I read the manga when i was younger, but I'm not as interested in it anymore.

Also I'm fairly certain you need to press the enter key twice for 1 line break, just fyi.
