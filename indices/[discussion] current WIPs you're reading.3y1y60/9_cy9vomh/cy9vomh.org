oh good lord.. you have opened a can of worms my friend. Okay Ill start with the Non HP fics since there are only three of those. linkffn(8211184),linkffn(10332343),linkffn(9854207) They are all Naruto and each are fabulously written. The First is OutFoxed, which is the only Harem Naruto Fic I can read, the next is Shinobi Rising, a cross over between Naruto and young justice. Finally is the sequel to Legacy by Cr4zypt, The Eternal Guardians. Legacy was the second fan fiction I ever read and I am proud to say I read each update when it occurred. Cr4zypt is an amazingly good writer, who's sequel has characters from both the bleach and Harry Potter worlds. (as of the most recent update of the Eternal Guardians) now for the Harry Potter fan fictions linkffn(11191235),linkffn(11446957),linkffn(10298096) Now I am also following Rent-A-Hero, and I am waiting for the next book of A Reluctant Champion series which will be out sometime in the new year. Of the three, A Cadmean Victory is probably the best written story, featuring a Harry who is decisive (This is the best adjective) The other two, (Harry Potter and the Emerald Trance, and Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) both feature an extremely Slytherin trouped Harry Potter. all have been updated within the last week. EDITS I attempted to fix the whole issue with paragraphing. Reddit just does not seem to want to do what I want it to. I am sorry.
