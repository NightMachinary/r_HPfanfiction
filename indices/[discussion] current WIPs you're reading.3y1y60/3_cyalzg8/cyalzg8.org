linkffn(A Marauder's Plan) is a story about Sirius sticking around after fleeing Hogwarts instead of going... wherever he went in canon. Planned to cover all of forth year, currently it's just after the second task if memory serves. Some details will probably set off individual pet peeves ("Pronglet", "so mote it be"), but the overarching story is very well plotted, with good dialogue, character development, and mystery.
