linkffn(Grow Young With Me) I actually just read this last week and it hasn't updated since then but it was only published in March and updates often, last time was a month ago. This is the fic I'm most excited about updating. It's instantly become one of my favorites. It's amazingly well written. The OC is fantastic, and it does a great job allowing the reader to understand how Harry is feeling.

linkffn(0800-Rent-A-Hero) Another of my favorites. Updates every 2 weeks, missed this weekend but it's the holiday so that is expected. Its a dimensional hop, great interaction between Harry and Iris.

linkffn(The Black Prince) HP x Game of Thrones. Just updated yesterday. It's an all around incredible fic.

linkffn(A Fallen God) Loki Odinsson, God of Mischief and Lies, ends up in Harry's head. Humorous and action filled. Just a lot of fun to read.
