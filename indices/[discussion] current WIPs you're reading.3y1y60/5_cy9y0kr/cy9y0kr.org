linkffn(Harry Potter Without Harry Potter) - a AU in which Harry did not survive that Halloween night when he was a baby. Great world building in this one.

linkffn(Identity). This one is the third in a series of AU stories. An sequal to one of those "Sirius escapes earlier and raises Harry"-stories with a little extra AU twist.

Not updated since September, but one of my favourites and I trust not abandoned: linkffn(Weasley Girl: Secrets of the Past). Another sequal to an AU story. PoD in this is the existence of Veronica (Ronnie) Weasley instead of Ron.

... Basically, I like AU stories with a canon feel.
