I'm closely following Brennus' new story *Abraxas*, linkffn(11580650). It looks very promising, and should contain lots of sex and violence. In another good development, the author finally stops his usual Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing. [[/spoiler][The story begins with the horcrux in Harry making a deal with Harry, after figuring out that it's going to end up in hell no matter who wins. The resulting Harry inherits all Voldemort's memory up to 1981, and becomes more ambitious, cunning, and ruthless. The story is in early stage as they just got to the second day of their 6th year]]
