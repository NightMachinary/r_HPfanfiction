- linkffn(brilliant magic), a slytherin!Hermione paired with the Weasley twins.
- linkffn(lady Archimedes) I think everyone will know this one, but just in case, it's the sequel to The Arithmancer.
- linkffn(misplaced moony) was updating regularly, but the author got into another story that is now finished, and then into another story again. I'm really hoping she'll pick this one back up as I really like it. It's a remione with a Remus of her age from an alternate universe
