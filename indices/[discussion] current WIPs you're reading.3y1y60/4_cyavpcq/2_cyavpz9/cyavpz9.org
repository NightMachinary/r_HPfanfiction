  "Naturally," he said, examining his nails. They were long and pointed and painted a deep maroon. It took Harry a moment to realize that Corvus wasn't wearing robes, but a beat up leather jacket and torn, faded jeans. "I always seek out my alternate self when I hop to another dimension. Don't you?" Two Harry's, Dark!Ravenclaw!Harry, Canon!Gryffindor!Harry, dimension travel, wolfstar

  What if Harry were a Slytherin? What if everyone thought his twin brother was the BWL? What if someone tried to do something creative and innovative with the two most overused cliches in HP fanfic? AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Also, basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys.

  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.
