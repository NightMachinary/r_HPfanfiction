#+begin_quote
  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take "no" for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead - but will he learn from Light wizards or pure-blood friends? Smart!Harry, Manipulative!Dumbledore. New chapter twice weekly! Part 2 of "Perfectly Normal".

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
