  What could be worse than a nightmare? Waking up to discover that it was reality, of course. But after finding out Bellatrix was his mother, discovering that the Death Eater who fathered him was Severus Snape almost came as a relief. Deciding to take up his real identity was easy enough ... actually living it, not so much. AU: After fifth year. Sevitus with a twist.

  As far as Harry's concerned, he's woken from a weirdly deep sleep the day after the Battle of Hogwarts. It's his friends who tell him that it's ten years later, that he's an Auror who got cursed while chasing a Dark wizard---and that his memory isn't going to come back. Updated every Saturday.

      This is going to be a heavily angsty fic, as you can see from the summary and warnings\. There isn’t going to be a cure for Harry’s amnesia, either\. Keep that in mind before you read\.
