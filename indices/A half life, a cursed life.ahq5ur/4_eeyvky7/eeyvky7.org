IIRC, somewhere Voldy mentions that he occasionally possessed animals - snakes ideally - but that his possession shortened their lifespan drastically and, I assume, eventually killed them.

Infering based on that, I assumed that likewise Voldemort's extended possession of Quirrel(lasting for months, if not years) was causing gradual damage to his body that would have killed him, and the unicorn blood was as much about keeping the host living as it was about sustaining Voldemort.

That might not quite fit with dialogue in /Philosopher's Stone/ though, but it's been years since I read it so I'm not sure.
