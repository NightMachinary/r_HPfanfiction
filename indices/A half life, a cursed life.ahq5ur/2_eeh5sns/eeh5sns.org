Unicorn Blood seems rather like a "dark" version of the Elixir of Life, and the point of both is to keep the body alive when nothing else could. As such, Unicorn Blood sustained Voldemort's possession of Quirrell's body, allowing the hybrid to more or less function as a living being --- though Quirrell was still rotting from the inside, to the point that as soon as Voldemort left his body he dropped dead. But though it was used to sustain Voldemort, its effects were on the body he was using at the time, and that was Quirrell's.
