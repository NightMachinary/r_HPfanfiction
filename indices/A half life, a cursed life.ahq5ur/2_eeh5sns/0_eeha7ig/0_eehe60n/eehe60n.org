Good idea --- though it would be an ingredient for the /Philosopher's Stone/, I think, not the Elixir, which seems to be simple to create once you have the Stone (Voldemort and Quirrell certainly seem to think that getting the Stone is the hard part, rather than plan for a complicated process to get from Stone to Elixir). But I recall a story where the Stone was made of crystallized Angel's blood, so there is a precedent of sorts.
