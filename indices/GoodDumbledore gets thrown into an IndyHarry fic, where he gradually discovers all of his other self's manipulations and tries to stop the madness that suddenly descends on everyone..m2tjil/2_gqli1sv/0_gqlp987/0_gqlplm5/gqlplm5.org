I saved your comment to read it later because I'm about to leave and be driving, but do you have any where dumbledore is manipulative, but in Harry's favor? Like where dumbledore is manipulative, but everything he does is actually for Harry's bennifit, not to his detriment? Also interested in fics where dumbledore actually teaches harry how to fight instead of leaving him as a lamb for slaughter
