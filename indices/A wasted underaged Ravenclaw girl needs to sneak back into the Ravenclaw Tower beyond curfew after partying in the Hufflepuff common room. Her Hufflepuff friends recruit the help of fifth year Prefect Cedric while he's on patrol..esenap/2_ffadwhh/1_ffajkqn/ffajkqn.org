It's certainly canon the prefects /tell/ the firsties this on their first night.

But whether it's true or not is another matter. I take the line it's complete BS, to keep the firsties on their toes and give them an idea just how much trouble they'd be in if they allowed somebody from another house into their common room.

Getting into Hufflepuff is so straightforward that, never mind 1000 years, the Weasley Twins would likely have known how it's done within their first month.
