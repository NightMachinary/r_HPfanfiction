haha yeah, and it is safe to say the the Twins know where the entrance is since it's basically right next the the kitchens. however, how to get into it is a a different matter since I believe it's the only common room that doesn't show up on the marauders map. (which would probably make them want to get in even more since it would be something their ideals never did)
