Also who says Cedric or the others have to actually enter the Ravenclaw tower? The Ravenclaw could have one or more friends waiting in the common room who just don't realize that she needs help getting back, or maybe there's a prefect who was about to leave for a patrol when they finally get the door open (or who even opens it after they've been failing for a half hour) and decides to show leniency and just help her get into bed instead of punishing her.
