I don't have anything specific in mind, but it should involve Cedric and Cho trying to solve the riddle to get in to the tower and failing hilariously. Cho, because she's wasted; and Cedric because he doesn't have any experience with those riddles, and he can't concentrate because of the wasted Cho.
