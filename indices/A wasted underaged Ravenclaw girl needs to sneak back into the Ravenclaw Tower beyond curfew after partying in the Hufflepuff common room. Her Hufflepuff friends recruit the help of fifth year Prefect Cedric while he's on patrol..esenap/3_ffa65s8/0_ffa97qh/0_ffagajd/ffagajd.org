No its not satire.

I could see a real story about it. Cho doesnt have a birth day, either does cedric so your age claims are a wild guess at best. I mean she didnt sound like she was from the british isles at all, doesnt even really matter did they talk about her origins at all in the book or other cannon places? My thought that shes a long term exchange student from china as a hidden princess or lady of the chang dynasty hidden away to be sold off or contracted out as her family decides is just as valid as shes from manchester because she said once she likes a quidditch team. She hardly has any backstory or hard cannon history.

At least not enough to warrent massive downvotes im getting for a off the wall idea.
