Pretty sure that in the movies (and I consider that close enough to cannon myself) she has like a Scottish accent (was it Irish? It may have been Irish but I think I was Scottish - I'm not native English speaker so yeah).

Regardless, I dont remember any indications that she was an Exchange student, not even English at all. She could easily be second or third generation in the country, but that would still mean that she was British either way.

In regards of Cedric taking advantage of her, what are you on about? He's 17 and she is what, 15-16? This is not at all a great age difference, specially not considering teenage boys on average are less mentally developed than teenage girls are.
