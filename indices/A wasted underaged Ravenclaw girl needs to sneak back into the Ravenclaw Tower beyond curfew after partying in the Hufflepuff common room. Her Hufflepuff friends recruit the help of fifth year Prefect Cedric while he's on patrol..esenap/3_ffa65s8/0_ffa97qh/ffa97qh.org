Not sure if that's supposed to be satire but you do realize Cho is only one year below Cedric, just like Harry is a year younger than her. In fact considering Harry was one of the youngest in his year, Cedric and Cho are probably closer ages than Harry and Cho. Also, there's nothing at all to suggest Cho is a foreign exchange student, she's at Hogwarts for multiple years, in the books it says she was a fan of the Tutshill Tornadoes - a team in England - since she was six and if you're considering the films canon, she's clearly Scottish based on the accent.
