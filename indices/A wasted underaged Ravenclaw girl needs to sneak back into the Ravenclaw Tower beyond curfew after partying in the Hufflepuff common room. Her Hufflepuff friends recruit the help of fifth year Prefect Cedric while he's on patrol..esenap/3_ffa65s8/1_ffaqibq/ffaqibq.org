I'm sorry you have so many down votes, because I thought your comment was pretty hilarious. Even though you meant it seriously, I think it would be a really funny crack!fic, especially if Cho is secretly a princess.

I think the main reason you got downvoted is because assuming that an Asian girl is from China and/or is a dynastic princess, is just seen as cliche and racist.
