Might I also point out that it is */the/* gold standard for Dark!Manipulative!Harry?\\
Evil never looks evil, laughs maniacly and murders left right and center for shits and giggles. And Harry in this fic was definitly not a good person... He ends up murdering the head auror so he can advance his own position. \\
The parts about James's rather sick requirements for her body, is just more fuel for the fire. Harry is not a good person. She had no choice since she was born, forced to be the perfect trophy wife, or else. Harry ruthlessly took advantage of the fact.\\
And? She never really had a choice. She ends up with him, not because she loves him, but rather because she has to. Because it his her /duty/ as a pureblood heiress to marry power. It read like a tragedy for me.\\
Daphne was born in a cage. A cage that was encrusted with Jewels, but a cage nontheless.
