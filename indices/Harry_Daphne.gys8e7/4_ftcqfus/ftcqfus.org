I'll recommend a few. Firstly linkffn(Honour Thy Blood by TheBlack'sResurgence) which is an incredible successful fic, and is very good. The author is currently rewriting it as well

Next, linkffn(A Champion's New Hope by Rocag) which I also really enjoyed

Finally, a fic that I did not anticipate liking. linkffn(Black coffee, with sugar by Jem Doe). This is a post war fic and has themes of adultery, which I personally find abhorrent, but I could not put this down. I read it all in one go late at night when I should have been sleeping
