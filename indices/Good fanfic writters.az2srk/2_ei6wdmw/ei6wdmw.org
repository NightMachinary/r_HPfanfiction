Silver Pard is my go-to underappreciated ficwriter to recommend. Mostly short stories, but they're so good. One of the few writers I come back to regularly. Lots in other fandoms too, which is how I first found them, but a few excellent HP ones well worth the time imho. I loved linkffn(insurgere by silver pard)

​

I also really enjoy Jalen Strix - another one with lots of shorts, though these are collected by character into sets that go together. I think my fabotirte^{\}sic]) is linkffn(Quirrell drabbles and short fiction by jalen strix)
