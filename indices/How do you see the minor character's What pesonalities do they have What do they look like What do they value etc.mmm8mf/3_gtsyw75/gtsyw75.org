I imagine that Theo Nott is a very silent person, but when you get to know him, you realize that he has a very dry and sarcastic (and sometimes dark) sense of humour. He witnessed his mother's death at the wand of his father when he was only a child, and as he is the only heir to the Nott family, he's spent most of his childhood studying to take over the household when he becomes of age. He found solace from his father's abuse in tinkering with magical objects and spells he found in an old workshop in his family's manor, and it was sometimes the only thing holding his head over water when his father forced him to get the Dark Mark. After the war, he's looked down upon as a Death Eater and the job he wanted to get as an Unspeakable suddenly became unreachable. Time-turners were confiscated from the Ministry, most of them were destroyed, so he delved into the depths of his family's library and created his own time-turner.

I imagine Theo to be wiry with dark brown hair and silver-blue eyes.

This all my own headcanon and more or less the basis I've created for the Theo Nott in my own story.

For Blaise Zabini, I imagine him to be a very outgoing person with a good sense of humour. He's kind of a joker and a massive flirt. He can charm the pants off any girl he sees --- and sometimes even the boys. He's collected a wide variety of skills from the numerous step-fathers he's had over the years but the best skills he learned from his mother --- the infamous Black Widow. He's well-versed in appearing unassuming but he knows numerous ways to incapacitate a person --- over half of them without the use of a wand.

Blaise is described to be a tall black boy with "haughty" features, and I imagine him to have green or dark brown eyes. I kind of imagine him to be mixed-race with a white (ish) Italian mother, though I have no problem with him being not mixed race. My depiction of him often changes depending on what suits my needs.

I personally see Astoria Greengrass as a joker, witty, and with a somewhat childish sense of wonder. Physically, she changes, though I typically imagine her to be dirty blonde with blue or dark brown eyes. Intellectually, I imagine her to be very intelligent and gifted with Arithmancy and Ancient Runes. I also imagine that she took Muggle Studies due to her curiosity, though that's just a personal opinion. In a fic that I may or may not write in the future, she's an Unspeakable who works with spells and deconstructs ancient ones.

Daphne, I imagine to be physically similar to Astoria, and I imagine her be a relatively quiet person. She was raised by her father, Lord Greengrass and law wizard, to be the new head of the family because her mother died when she was a child and she has no brothers. She knows how to wheedle information from unsuspecting individuals and she has a calculating side to her where she deems a person's use. She was still old enough to watch as her mother's health deteriorated physically while Astoria was not, which I imagine is why she's more of a joker than Daphne. Her best friend is Tracey Davis, a half-blood.

Tracey Davis, I imagine having dark brown hair and dark brown or grey/hazel eyes. Her mother is the half-blood or Muggleborn while her father is the pureblood. I imagine Tracey to be relatively average in most pursuits, though she's certainly intelligent, and her passion is (creative) writing and history. I imagine that she took Ancient Studies at Hogwarts, which offered a historical point-of-view for ancient wizarding practices, focusing especially on Egyptian and Roman/Greek societies.

Dean Thomas, in my mind, is not a Muggleborn but a half-blood. His father, the heir to the Shafiq family, had an affair with his Muggle mother during the first war and he was killed by Death Eaters or Death Eater sympathizers for favouring Muggles and-or refusing to join the "dark side." He's talented in art and I imagine that he might have an interest in creating a wizarding version of comic books in the future. He favours charcoal above all else, though his second favourite mediums are oil paint and clay.

I could do some others if you want, this is just what I came up with on the top of my head.
