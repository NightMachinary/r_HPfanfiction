Theo Nott: Like someone else said in this thread, I see him as very quiet and serious seeming until you get to know him. Good sense of humor, also intelligent; I can see him as being very curious, a little eccentric, like a more grounded Luna. Sometimes I see him and Daphne as the nerds in Slytherin. I picture him with black hair and green eyes. I can see him as being an Unspeakable or curse-breaker or gentleman inventor if I'm not writing him as wanting a specific job.

Blaise Zabini: Massive trust issues due to his mother being a prolific serial-killer. (Mrs. Zabini depending on the tone of the fic, I would either write more like Mrs. White from Clue (if going more for comedy) or inspired by Mads Mikklesen's Hannibal Lector if it's a serious fic.) Fluent in English and Italian. Unlike some of the others, I see him as living off his money rather than having a job; if he does anything, maybe a vineyard owner or something like that.

Angelina Johnson: I picture her as becoming a quidditch player like Oliver and Ginny, or doing something related to quidditch. She, Lee, and George stuck together after Fred's death; she and Lee were the first people George let in.

Lee Jordan: Professional quidditch commenter and still close to George and Angelina. Probably a godfather to one of their children.

Astoria and Daphne Greengrass: I also see both of them as brunettes, as well as having blue eyes. I also see Daphne as sarcastic, but Astoria I actually picture as the more extroverted or at least the one who's more of a people person. They can drive each other mad/pick on each other (Astoria probably liked annoying Daphne as the younger sister), but are genuinely close siblings. I see Daphne as being very protective of Astoria (and others she cares about) from a young age as some people probably learned the hard way; however, Astoria can also be protective of Daphne, which probably shocked more people the first time it happened. I can see Daphne as being a good aunt to Scorpious (or other kids Astoria has if not with Draco) and vise versa if Daphne has kids.

If I'm giving them jobs, I tend to think of Astoria as either a potioneer who eventually gets a mastery in it or a healer. Daphne I tend to see as either an Unspeakable or curse-breaker, though recently I've gotten into the idea of her being good with magical creatures and doing something with that such as a dragonologist or magizoologist.
