I think out of the Creevey brothers, Dennis would be more of a realist/down-to-earth (based entirely on one line where he points out the Beauxbatons carriage is being flown by horses while the rest of his year is freaking out). Very excitable still, but more pessimistic than Colin, though it's still considered decently positive by normal standards. Also slightly more reckless and willing to break/bend the rules, though this also comes from being younger too.

Colin I feel like is similar to Luna in some aspects, in a bit of a "they're weirder than most people" way. He matures as he gets older, but he's still pretty optimistic and sometimes speaks without thinking, especially with things he's passionate about. I'd say creative as well and likes looking at things from different angles, and I think he'd bond with Luna about off-the-wall theories and such. Has a little bit of a big brother streak, but Dennis and him have their separate friend groups while still spending a lot of time together. I'd like to say he's close with Ginny, but probably not in canon at least in later years, though they definitely bond over defending Harry against Umbridge in OOtP.
