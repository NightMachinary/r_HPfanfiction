I'm tired of the rich, neutral faction “Ice Queen” Daphne Greengrass characterization, so I'm changing it up in in the fic that I'm planning now. I'm making the Greengrass family poor because over the years, the various generations have been spent their wealth trying to find a way to break the blood curse that plagues their family. Daphne's going to be a quiet, unassuming brunette with average looks whose greatest ambition is to find a cure to the blood malediction her sister suffers from. Draco and Pansy look down on her for her lack of wealth and secondhand robes, and she mostly keeps to herself.
