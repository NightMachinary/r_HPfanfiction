Daphne Greengrass is a power hungry sociopath like the rest of her family. They all thrist for power and high standing and will do anything to achieve it, no matter what or how immoral it may be. Astoria is desperate to escape her toxic family.

Blaise Zabini is an extremely entitled spoiled brat. He envisions himself as the most popular boy in Hogwarts and has several intense (and completely and utterly one-sided on his end) rivalries with boys he sees as competition.

Theodore Nott is an extreme Pureblood bigot but is too cowardly and weak-willed to be open about it. When Crabbe and Goyle are bullying a Muggleborn first year, he's watching from a nearby staircase with a grin on his face.

Tracey Davis despises being a Slytherin and spends almost all of her time with her Ravenclaw classmates, even sleeping in their dorm most nights.

Susan Bones is a honourable and kind girl, secretly cracking under the pressure of having to continue the Bones family legacy.

Michael Corner is the result of a one night between a wizard and a Muggle woman. He is friendly and social but has pretty bad issues in regards to trust and attachment. He also has a thick Sheffield accent.

Terry Boot is the dad friend. That is all.

Justin Finch-Fletchley savours every bit of the freedom Hogwarts offers him, since outside of school, he is in a suffocating environment as the son of a major politician and a building tycoon.

Padma Patil is snarky with a heart of gold. She is a closet theatre fanatic. She and her sister have London accents with slight Indian undertone.

Hannah Abbott is actually one of the best students in the year when not being in an exam. She can't cope with pressure at all.

Cormac McLaggen and Zacharias Smith exist solely to be the butt of jokes. Sorry guys.

Alicia Smith is every bit as fanatical about Quidditch as Oliver is, she's just more quiet about it. She even arranged to have her wedding held on the Hogwarts pitch.
