Daphne Greengrass- quite a cold and composed young woman, secretly loving romantic books and sweets. She is very ambitious and would like to achieve a very high rank in the Ministry in the future, she would do it even by walking over the corpses, she is willing to do anything for it. In the future, she would become the Cabinet of the Law Compliance Department, and later the Minister's Undersecretary.

Astoria Greengrass- Contrary to her sister, she does not guard her feelings deeply and often expresses them, she likes to surround herself with a group of her friends who mainly include Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws and a few Gryffindors. Her greatest ambition is to become a Spell Mistress and then become a teacher at Hogwarts or Beauxbatons.

Blaise Zabini - He's quite a dangerous man. Raised mainly by his mother and a few stepfathers who, as soon as his mother was upset, were mysteriously killed, he learned caution and suspicion from an early age. At Hogwarts, he tried to stay hidden, however, he was on good terms with Draco Malfoy and supported blood purism, but at the same time he had no intention of joining the Dark Lord and his dislike for Muggle-borns was not as evident as in his House mates. He later became a Potions Master after breaking free from the toxic relationship with his family. He has taught at Hogwarts since 2010.

Theodore Nott- He was taught from an early age that the Dark Lord's propaganda was right. It is hard to imagine that he would not support her at school because of this upbringing. He saw that Muggle-borns are also people like him only before the Battle of Hogwarts, where he decided to fight. He was forced to kill his own cousin and severely mutilate his grandfather, but nevertheless found happiness shortly thereafter in the form of a relationship with Alicia Spinnet, where nine years after their relationship began, they were married. They never had children because Theodore was sterile, and instead adopted a girl from a magical orphanage. He was a Hit-Wizard.

Susan Bones- After her aunt died, she became very distant and cold, and the news that her death was the result of a Death Eater attack fueled the fire of her hatred for the Death Eaters and Voldemort. During the war, she organized a small group of people who, under her leadership, attacked various important places for the Death Eaters. She had never hesitated to torture or kill the Knights of the Dark Lord. After the war, she never returned for an eighth year and instead accepted an offer to become an Auror. She never had a long-term relationship with anyone, but the result of her one night with Blaise Zabini was the birth of Daniel Bones, whom she loved very much. She never informed Blaise that it was his son.

Hannah Abott- She was a very friendly and kind soul. With the news that Voldemort was taking over the Ministry, she fled with her family to the States, where she began her training and career as the Master of Ancient Runes. When she turned twenty-nine, she began teaching the Ancient Runes at Ilvermony. She never returned to England, and in the United States she started a family consisting of her Muggle husband and three children.
