I see Theodore Nott as like a very quiet person that comes off really serious but if you know him really well, he's actually very funny. I have no idea why this is in my head. Daphne I see with black hair even though she is often depicted as blonde but Astoria I see as blonde, probably because she becomes a Malfoy.
