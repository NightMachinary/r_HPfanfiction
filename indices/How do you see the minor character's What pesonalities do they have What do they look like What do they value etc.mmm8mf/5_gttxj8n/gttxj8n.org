Theodore Nott is a bit of a crackhead in my fic. He's more of a central character, with brown curly hair that he insists on leaving long (because the girls will think it's cool!) that nicely complements his hazel-brown eyes. He's quite tall during his first few years, but his height tops out at around 5'9 (much to his disappointment). He's heavily inspired by the best friend that is fading from my life, giving the MC the same energy that my friend gave me.

He's very smart, and very bold. He could have passed for a Gryffindor. This abundance of energy combined with the sarcastic energy of being in Slytherin makes him one of the funniest in the year. He tends to drift from social group to social group, managing to find home in all of them.

His attention has been captured by Luna Lovegood since the moment he laid eyes on her. She was whimsical, calm, pretty much everything that he was not. He's like James chasing after his Lily, and once she accepts him, he's shamelessly whipped. Sometimes he camps out in the Ravenclaw common room, but he would never admit that he isn't nearly as fond of Slytherin as the rest of his family.

After the war, when the time turners are destroyed, he spends nearly a year making another one with Draco to go back to September first , 1991, in hopes that pulling a few strings would save infinitely many people (like focing the hat to make Draco a Hufflepuff, and leaving the MC in slytherin so that they wouldn't remain friends and cause a lot of the problems that they caused. The sorting hat can't be swayed. It says that he was placed in Slytherin not because of the person he is, but the person they would help him become.

Further post-hogwarts, he marries Luna and lives off his extensive fortune (his death-eater father died in the second wizarding war).
