I really like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900][Rose Petal Red]]. It has an overpowered protagonist and is tropy but I think the tropes work (most seen to exist for a story reason) and that it's well written. The beginning suffers a bit from canon following but things do off these rails come POA
