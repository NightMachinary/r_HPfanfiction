another one I enjoy is [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/better-living-through-magic-harry-potter-si.756754/page-72#post-62771068][Better Living Through Magic]]

#+begin_quote
  SI is dropped in front of Dumbledore in the 1960s (before Marauders are 11) as a 11year old version of himself, timeskip 4 years of schooling where he has researched stuff and is kinda an OP artificer.

and a third one I follow would be [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wizarding-works-a-harry-potter-si.57804/page-42#post-13360168][Wizarding Works]]

#+begin_quote
  SI is dropped in front of a orphanage, befriends Harry&co at Hogwarts, 'gets' potions, Animals like him and he takes care of Fluffy.
