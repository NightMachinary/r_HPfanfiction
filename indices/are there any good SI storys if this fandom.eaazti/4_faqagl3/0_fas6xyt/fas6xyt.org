I disagree. I think the issue is people who write this kind of fic tend to suffer from a surprising lack of imagination.

To address some of the critiques of the genre I've seen here and there. A lot of SI fics are fix fics, but it doesn't really have to be. They are fix fics because people choos to write them this way. It can't be that difficult to introduce new threats, or have the SI or someone else fuck something up and send the whole plot in a completely different direction from canon.

Most SI tend to be Mary Sues, but how hard is it to give flaws to the character? Especially when you write about yourself. Everyone has flaws.

Concerning your SI proficiency at magic, I see two possiblities. A 20 or 30 something inserted in Hogwarts is going to be poweerful as a wizard provided he puts some effort into it. This is because magic depends in huge part on knowledge, understanding and practice, and there's just no way someone like this is going to be beaten by most eleven year olds in terms of study habits, attention span, or simply experience to draw from. the alternative way would be to have your protag be an extremely lazy person who just doesn't want to put in more than minimal effort.

The most unoriginal, lazy, and boring fix fic is always one fuck up away from a very interresting story, at least in terms of plot.
