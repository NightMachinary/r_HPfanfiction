I knew the Potters were an ancient family going back to the Peverells, I just didn't think the Peverells were a noble house. It always struck me as weird because while the Potters do have a seat in the Wizengamot or at least they did when Henry “Harry” Potter was alive, and They were also on the list of “sacred” pure blood families until they weren't, it never stated they were a noble house. As for the Noble and Ancient house thing, I assumed that was part of the HP lore because of how Victorian-era wizarding society was. I mean they have the social elected as the government body and they wear robes which haven't been worn in a long time.
