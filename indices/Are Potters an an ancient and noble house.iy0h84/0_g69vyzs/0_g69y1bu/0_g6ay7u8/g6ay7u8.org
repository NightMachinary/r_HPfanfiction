  while the Potters do have a seat in the Wizengamot or at least they did when Henry “Harry” Potter was alive
#+end_quote

Seats on the Wizengamot are not family owned. I don't remember the details but basically, every time a seat is "free" (either because its owner chose to leave it or died), the other members will "elect" a member of the society to take his place (it reminds me a lot of how the French Academy works with its "Immortals").\\
It's not "The Potters had a family seat", it's "Mr Henry Potter was elected during his life".

The term "Sacred twenty-eight" comes from "The Pureblood Directory", a book published anonymously during the 1930's. It doesn't have any legal power, and the book can't show any research to prove its claims. It's basically just a man (though to be Cantakerus Nott) that say who he thinks is Pure, and who he thinks isn't. Families like the Potters should have been included into this list (they were Pure at that time), and were purposefully ignored because of Henry Potter too outspoken Pro Muggles ideas and their name (though to be of Muggle origin). It's just a piece of propaganda for Blood Supremacist.

It's also wrong to say that Magical Britain is stuck in the Vitcorian-Era. Regardless of their fashion trends, the "Wizangamot robes" is just a piece of traditions (similar to how some "Muggle officials" like British judge wear these old wigs), and their habit to use old items comes from Magic (magic can make an item work better than a muggle one and last forever, so why change it).\\
It's probably better to consider Magical Britain as a foreign society that, while it can be seen as quite behind in some aspect (House Elves are basically slaves), can also be very progressist into others (gender equality as been around since centuries by the time Harry entered that world).
