It may be worth noting that everything about the Sacred Twenty-Eight and almost everything we know about the Wizengamot are somewhat dubiously canon. Almost everything we know about them comes from Pottermore and other comments from Rowling, which some may not consider canon, or may at least have an easy time ignoring because they want to do something different in their story.

I think that all we know about the Wizengamot from the books is that they have some sort of judicial function, Dumbledore was the Chief Warlock, and the identities of a few of its members.
