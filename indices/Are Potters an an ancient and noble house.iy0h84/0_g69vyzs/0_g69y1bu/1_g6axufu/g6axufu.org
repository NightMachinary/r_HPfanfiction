Robes aren't Victorian, though. The /movies/ gave a Victorian vibe to the Wizarding World, but in the books it's much less present; it actually diverged from Muggle Britain around the /Renaissance/, and is more of a case of independent development since the Middle-Ages than of being "stuck" in any particular /past/ era. There is at any rate absolutely no support in canon for there being inherited seats on the Wizengamot --- it is pointed out that Lucius Malfoy is /not/ a member of the Wizengamot, and shouldn't be allowed to attend its meetings, he just keeps sneaking into the Ministry anyway due to his personal acquaintance with Fudge.
