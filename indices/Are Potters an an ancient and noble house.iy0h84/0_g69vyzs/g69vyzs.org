It must be noted that "Ancient and Noble House" is probably not any kind of official term in the books, but rather, at best something /the Blacks specifically/ styled themselves as. Nor does there seem to be any /actual/ nobility in the Wizarding World. Bigoted purebloods see themselves as "noble" by /virtue/ of being purebloods, but there's nothing more to it.

All that being said, the question can still parse as: were the Potters an "old family" in the same way as the Blacks and the Malfoys, albeit not blood-purists? Judging by more recent Pottermore canon, it doesn't seem they were ever the types of snobs who'd own Manors and specially-enchanted London houses and so on. But even that acknowledges a long line of wizard ancestors. And they do have a Gringotts Vault filled with a significant family fortune. In addition, the Potters are descended drectly from the Peverells, and retain a certain magical heirlooms from them. So /that/'s certainly a point in favour of the Potters being an "ancient" family of warlocks. Just not a "Noble and Ancient" one!
