Linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) has my favorite Voldemort. He feels very human, a person instead of the evil faceless villain who only likes to torture people for no reason (why would anyone follow him when all he does is inspire fear into people and torture everyone?). The society that he built after he won even tends to work fairly well, most people have perfectly normal happy lives and he makes a decent leader and revolutionary that you can understand people following.

He is still a psychopath with no sense of morality, but also a lot more and it makes perfect sense in the fic for Harry to continue to be his friend/protege/student even though Harry is still entirely good. It's not finished, but there are 6 completed books in this series which do have a lot resolved story arcs even if a few main ones are incomplete.

No slash. There is a very minor OC background gay couple, but they are very rarely mentioned.
