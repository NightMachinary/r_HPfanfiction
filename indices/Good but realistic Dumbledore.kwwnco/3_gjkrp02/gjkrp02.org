Dumbledore is fairly proactive, but in a Slytherin way rather than Gryffindor, in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised). The information Snape brought back from the future allows him to plot Voldemort's downfall more effectively than canon, but so long as they can keep Voldemort ignorant of it, they can afford to take their time and seek out the Horcruxes quietly. Even when Dumbledore takes to the field, it's a carefully calculated move.

On the other hand, in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), there are no Horcruxes and Tom Riddle is a politician rather than a terrorist, so there's no (violent) war. Dumbledore is mostly trying to keep the pro-muggle faction organised enough to stop Riddle from pushing further discriminatory reforms such as anti-miscegenation laws.
