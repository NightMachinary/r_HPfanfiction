Oof.

Just binge-read Muggle-Raised Champion and it /barely/ qualifies. At best, Charlie gave Harry a nudge and Harry did the rest. It also can't seem to shake off Manipulative!Dumbledore, the characters suffer a tad from speaking the same personality and it ditches an exploration into values and culture shock plot point I personally would have loved to see expanded.

I would say there are better fics to read and binge, but if you're starved for literally anything then I guess its worth a shot. I did it, after all.
