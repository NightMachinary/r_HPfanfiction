Yeah haha I think there's a few very very early ones that had some sort of glitch like that happen to them on FanFiction.Net. If I recall this one was started either just before or just after the 5th book was released. I wanna say after because I think a major catalyst for a lot of the stuff that happens early on in it was Sirus's death and Harry feeling manipulated by Dumbledore. Manipulative Dumbledore is another trope from this one. Not sure if it was the first to do it, but if it wasn't it was one of the first few since that all mostly started around the release of Order of the Phoenix... writing this has made me realize that I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for a very long time.
