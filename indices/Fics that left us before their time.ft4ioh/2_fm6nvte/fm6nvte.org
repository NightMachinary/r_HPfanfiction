Super old school with this one. The Power of Time. It's the origin of like half the tropes in Harry Potter fanfiction, everything from pre-school shopping spree, family vaults, spare wands, a huge multi-compartment trunk he can live in, moving out of the Dursley's and getting his own place after getting emancipated, etc. It was just getting good and into the big action that had been teased through the entire plot and the author just stopped writing it. It's a little cringe to read now, because it's like reading of a fic where the author just took every overused trope and crammed them all into one and only did a semi ok job of it. But it was the first to do most of those so back when it was being written is was kind of mind blowing. Author is Rosswrock or something like that.
