Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, which left us just before things would heat up, as it was in the middle of the Tri-wizard Tournament and Harry was really getting into the very dark, fucked up stuff, like sacrificial magic and inferi creation.

+ Even though it's seemingly not the case, there's still the possibility that Calypso actually changed something in his mind (when he dropped all of his mental shields so that she could briefly make him believe he's actually 17, not 14, and can therefore walk past the age line because he took a ageing potion and he BELIEVES that he's the right age) and it will come up later.

I'm so mad, really.
