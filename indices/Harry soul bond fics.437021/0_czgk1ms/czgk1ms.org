Most Harry soul bond fics have Ginny as the target, and generally as a result of the CoS incident. These stories usually emphasize how much they are in love and how great the bond is for their lives, but things really get repetitive after a few times.

*The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond*, linkffn(9818387), offers a new take on the soul bond, and it's a really fun read, especially when the girl was having her period.
