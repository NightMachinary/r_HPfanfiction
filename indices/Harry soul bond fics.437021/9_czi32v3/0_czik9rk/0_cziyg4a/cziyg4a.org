Know one without Ginny, /or/ Hermione? I always disliked the out of nowhere fangirl Ginny pairing, but after getting into FanFiction I read entirely too much H/Hermione. Now I'm sick of both pairings, now I'm a fan of more fresh and esoteric pairings, like Harry/OC or Fluer/Tonks/Daphne. And no gay Harry lol.
