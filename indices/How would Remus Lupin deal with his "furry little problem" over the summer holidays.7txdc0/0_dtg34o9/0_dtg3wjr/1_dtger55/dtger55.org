Unless someone was actively watching Lupin and noting down the dates, I think it could work way longer. For his dormmates his regular disappearances would be hard to miss, for most others, it wouldn't have been as regular. For example, if the full moon fell on a weekend, there's no need for an excuse for everyone but his friends and dormmates. Maybe not every house had classes together each day, so one month the Ravenclaws don't notice he's missing classes, the next month no Hufflepuff notices etc.

Most children raised in the magical world would know about werewolves only as these ravenous beasts that roam the forests on full moon nights. Nobody would expect a quiet and sickly first year to be a werewolf, especially if there are no new rumours about a werewolf near Hogwarts.
