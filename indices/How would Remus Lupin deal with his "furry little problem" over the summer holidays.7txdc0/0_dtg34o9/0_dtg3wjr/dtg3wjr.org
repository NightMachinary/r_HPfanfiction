That might have flown in school, but Lupin was just "sick" during the main series, so I don't think that would fly.

I find it more surprising that everybody didn't immediately figure it out. I mean, you live in a world with werewolves, you know they get strange in the days preceding and succeeding the full moon; if you meet a guy who "gets sick" on those dates like clockwork, you're going to know he's a werewolf.

Every student that was a half-blood or pure-blood should have been certain he was a werewolf before November.
