Hogwarts has (if we go by the picture that was painted by canon) a few hundred students. (Or ~1000 if we go by one of those numbers JKR pulled out of her arse) Chances are, one or two of those are always gonna be ill at any time, so unless you cared about Lupin, he'd just disappear into the masses.

To me, lycanthropy seems more like one of those hush-hush topics that people simply don't speak about. Most children probably know they are dangerous under the full moon, but how many know how to recognise the pre/post full moon symptoms? Also, noone /expects/ to find a were in Hogwarts.

Snape probably knew, though, since he did "care" about Lupin quite a lot.
