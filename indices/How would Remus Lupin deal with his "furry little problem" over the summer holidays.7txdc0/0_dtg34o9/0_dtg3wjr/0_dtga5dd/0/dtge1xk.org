  Snape probably knew, though, since he did "care" about Lupin quite a lot.

Snape didn't know, else Sirius' prank wouldn't have worked. He was curious about Lupin but didn't figure it out, Sirius told him how to get past the Whomping Willow and James rescued him before he actually met Lupin as a Werewolf.

He might have suspected, but if he knew he wouldn't have been stupid enough to try to get to a werewolf on a full moon night.
