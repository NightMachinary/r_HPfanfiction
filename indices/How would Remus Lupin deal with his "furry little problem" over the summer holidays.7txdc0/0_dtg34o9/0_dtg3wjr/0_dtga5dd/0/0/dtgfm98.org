The bloke knew some nasty dark curses though; he might have already invented Sectumsempra by then, and nobody would have faulted him for killing a transformed werewolf in "self-defence."

It's the same guy who begged /Voldemort/ of all people to spare the life of Lily Potter. Reckless isn't really out-of-character for him.

He would be stupid if he /didn't/ connect the dots by then, considering how obsessed he was with those Gryffindors. (I've pegged it at spring 1976, a few months before he called Lily a Mudblood.)
