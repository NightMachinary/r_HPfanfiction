Backward with Purpose is a masterpiece and one of the best fanfics EVER written: linkffn(4101650).

Erasing the Future while not finished yet is still getting sporadic updates and if you can handle that then its also on the list of one of the best: linkffn(2833136).

Harry Potter and the Time Mage is about the same quality as Magical Time except older if that makes sense: linkffn(2114097).

Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past while not finished is worth the read because what is there is good: linkffn(2636963).

If you are looking for something VERY long there is the Amulet of Time series by Luna the Moonmonster that starts with The Age of the Founders. linkffn(844334).
