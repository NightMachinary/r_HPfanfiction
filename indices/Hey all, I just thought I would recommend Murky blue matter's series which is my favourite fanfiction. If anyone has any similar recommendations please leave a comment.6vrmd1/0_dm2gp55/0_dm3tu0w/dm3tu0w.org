A few things about it that I particularly enjoy are; the pure blood society aspects, the lower alleys and how a whole new 'world' is explored within the series with worldly characters and I enjoyed the academic progression behind the potions. It's not so much pairings or any particular desire for fem Harry rather than a well written story with intriguing plot, well thought out characters and a story that makes you want to stay up all night reading it!
