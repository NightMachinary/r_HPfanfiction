Another thing to remember is that George and Fred had been selling their products for at least a year at school before opening the store. They had enough money to make a big bet with Bagman, they had all the products they were selling before Umbridge drove them out. The 1000 galleons put them over the top but it may have been just enough for first and last months lease and enough capital to get product into the store. They weren't likely to have purchased the store-front in Diagon Alley, would've needed way more than that.
