I think that was just J.K. Rolling being bad at math again

The Weasleys won 700 Galleons just 300 less than the 1000 Galleons got for winning the Triwizard tournament that harry gave the twins and considering what the twins were able to do with that 1000 Galleons it just doesn't add up.

Unless Arthur and Molly were in Debt and they used most of the 700 Galleons to pay off the Debt with out telling the kids about it while using the holiday as an excuse for why the money was used up so quickly.
