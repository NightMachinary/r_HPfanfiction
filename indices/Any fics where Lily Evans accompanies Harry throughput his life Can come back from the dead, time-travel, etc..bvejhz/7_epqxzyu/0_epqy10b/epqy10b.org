  When Lily Potter died to save her son, she didn't crossover, instead she was spiritually bonded with her son, with some unexpected side-effects. As he grows up to become a new Dark Lord of the Wizarding World, over time she will change with him. WARNING: This is a dark/evil story. Any who don't like this, PLEASE STOP READING!
