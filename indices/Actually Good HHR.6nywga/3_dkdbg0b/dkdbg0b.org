I recommend linkffn(With Malice Aforethought by SP Smith) way too much---somebody's got to, it's still under 100 reviews after 10+ years---but it's a good fit for this request. It's very old, so it doesn't work with elements from the last two books at all, but it aims for the canon tone and does a pretty good job of reaching it. (The seventh-year sequel was abandoned, though...)
