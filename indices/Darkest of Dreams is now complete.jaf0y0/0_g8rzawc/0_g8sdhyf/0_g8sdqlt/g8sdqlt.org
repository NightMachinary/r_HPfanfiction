You're good, if it still isn't achieving the results you want, you can try taking it down and reuploading it over a period of time. Every time you update a story to a wordcount over one of the search limits you're going to get a new influx of people who search for stories over that wordcount.

As yours is only 16k, I don't expect it would matter that much. It is food for thought though.
