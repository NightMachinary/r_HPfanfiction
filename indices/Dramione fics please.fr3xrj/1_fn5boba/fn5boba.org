I've been reading Dramione for a longish time (4? 5? years-ish) so here is my master list!

- Isolation by Bex-Chan, Rated M, Complete. FFN (This is a Dramione CLASSIC and a must-read!)
- What the Room Requires by Alydia Rackham, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- Bathroom Scene Redux by logicallylivid, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- I Spy by gnrkrystle, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Silencio by Akashathekitty, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Five Days by RavieSnake, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- And We All Fall Down by Rumaan, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- The Fallout by everythursday, Rated M (?), Complete, I will attach below a link to a google drive folder of all of her amazing works (Check out Parade of the Sun as well) because it is not currently on any sites!
- Eight and Eighth by Marmalade Fever, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- The Eagle's Nest by HeartofAspen, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- Covered in Crimson by cklls, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Only a Pretense by galfoy (Now WickedlyAwesomeMe on FFN, I guess she changed her username) , Rated T, Complete, FFN
- The Boy in the Hammock by galfoy (This one is by galfoy? I'm not quite sure about the whole username thing...), Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Static by galfoy, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Turncoat by elizaye, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- We Learned the Sea by luckei1, Rated T, Complete, FFN

- Abyss by zarah joyce, K, Complete, FFN
- After the Battle by WaitTilMyFatherHearsAboutThis, M, Complete, FFN
- Amortentia by oliviebleak, Rating depends on Chapter, FFN (This is a collection of one-shots and multi chapters, you have to go chapter by chapter to choose which chapter you want because not all are dramione. I would recommend The Real World:Hogwarts (Series) and Epilogue:Drunk Rewrite (Oneshot) because both of these are hilarious!)

Anyways, this was very long but I didn't even begin to cover the beauty that is Dramione fanfics. These are just some of my favorites. If none of these seem to be what you're looking for, I would suggest heading over to dramioneasks on Tumblr or dramioneficindex on Tumblr (you don't need an account) and either asking or searching through tags or on dramioneficindex, hitting ctrl F and plugging in a key phrase! Hope this helped :D
