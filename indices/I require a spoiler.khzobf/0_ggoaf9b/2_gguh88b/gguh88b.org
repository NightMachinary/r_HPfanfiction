Woah .. where did you get this? others answered who/what exactly 'the fucker' is in the fic but only thing I recall about mind healing in this specific fic is that Riddlebottom poses as a mind healer who is taking care of Neville's father .. where did your part about technique to remove emotions come from? is this from some other fic you read? if so, I am interested to know what that is.
