It's straight from the text of A Black Comedy. Chapter 31.

The explanation starts with the line "Tom put on a mask of a deadly serious Scholar.......I attempted to remove negative emotions like rage and jealousy.......I actually separated those pieces of wrong and evil, but in an attempt to remove them they attached to a piece of my soul, wrenched it free, and formed a separate entity from myself......This evil twin spiraled way beyond my control.
