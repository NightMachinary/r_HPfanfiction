You could simply read the last chapter to find out üòÅ

However while Harry and Sirius have mentioned "that fucker" (lower case) and mean Lucius Malfoy the one you are looking for is "That Fucker" who Voldemort is Hunting.

And the answer is Tom Riddle

It seems Tom was trying a mind healing technique to eliminate/remove negative emotions like rage, jealousy, etc. Problem is he f'd up and those emotions latched onto part of his soul and formed his evil twin Voldemort. So good Tom created an alternate identity and did his best to stop Voldemort. He interfered enough that Voldemort started referring to him as "That Fucker".

Note: tried to hide some of the text but it didn't work. Figured that since the main post mentioned spoilers folks were warned.
