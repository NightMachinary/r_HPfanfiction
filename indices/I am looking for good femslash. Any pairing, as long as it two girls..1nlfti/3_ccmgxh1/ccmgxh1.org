I'd suggest the collected works of [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1039923/fembuck][fembuck]] though her stuff is generally short and gets racy in almost every story.

Here's a C2 for you as well: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/All_Things_Femmeslash/60640][All things femmeslash]]

...and in case you've never heard of it- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]]. It's Holly/Hermione, later Holly/Tonks. It's a bit twisted.
