Try [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][A Butterfly Effect]] by SlyGoddess. It's like 90% femHarry/Ginny. I remain a staunch supporter of this fic despite its ungodly slow updates and severe bouts of melodrama. The product as a whole is both gripping and satisfyingly mushy, not to mention well-written.
