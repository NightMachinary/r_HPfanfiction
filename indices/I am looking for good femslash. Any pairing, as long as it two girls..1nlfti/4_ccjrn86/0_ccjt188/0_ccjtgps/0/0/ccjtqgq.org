Ah, well In The Long Run is rated T. I think the others all have some explicit scenes, but they're not the focus. I stop reading pretty quickly if stories are too smut heavy, I'm far more interested in plot.

I found this in my bookmarks though, I forgot to include it before: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5784918/1/Bound_With_Silver_Threads][Bound With Silver Threads]]. It's LLP/OFC and rated T. [[http://www.dreiser.org/miscfic/crazy.htm][This]] is a HG/LL fic, but it's been a couple years since I read it, don't really remember much about it.

And [[http://www.fanfiction.net/community/A-Woman-s-Love-Femslash/90503/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][here's]] a femslash C2.
