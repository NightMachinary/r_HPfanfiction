While I do agree with the larger point, that people are overly harsh on Dumbledore, I think that most of your explanations aren't that well thought out.

1. He could've done so much more. Like, not leave Harry on the doorstep. Like explaining to the Dursleys in person. Maybe some subtle treats of what'll happen if he's mistreated. Regular visits. According to the 6th book, Pretty much all interaction (2 or 3 times!) happened through letters until that point. So that likely means that the Dursleys didn't even get legal documentation for the adoption of Harry. At the very least, this demonstrates a gross negligence on Dumbledore's part. But let's disregard that for a moment. I forget which book it was, but he also said that he knew how Harry would be treated. So, unless he was lying, or didn't know the full extent, he was condoning child abuse. Is child abuse OK, if it means the child will survive? I personally don't think so.\\
2. I'm going to assume that Dumbledore didn't know about the switch. But he was the head of Wizengamot, the criminal court, and probably the legislative body as well. It was his responsibility to uphold justice. His responsibility to oversee that everyone got a fair trial. Which Sirius didn't. To add insult to injury, Sirius was part of Dumbledore's private militia. To further add insult to injury, he did vouch for Snape, a known death eater. So, he has saved someone who most likely committed horrible crimes from Azkaban, someone who wasn't even dedicated in the beginning, but doesn't do the same for Sirius, an innocent man who fought against Death Eaters for much longer. Again, gross negligence at the very least. And lets not even go into the fact that so many Death Eaters walked free while he was the leader of the wizengamot.\\
3. I agree with the overall point, but I think he could've done so, so much more. Better background and security checks for new personel at the very least. Maybe a demonstration lesson. An interview under veritasium to check if the teacher means harm to the students or staff, or unbreakable vows that staff would prevent serious injury and death at the best of their capacities at the extreme end. This would've caught Quirell, Lockhart and fake Moody. Again, this shows legligence on Dumbledore's part. Sensing a theme here?
4. I agree with it, but could also argue against it. In the first book, Dumbledore says that Harry's scar might become useful, which could hint that he knew it was a Horcrux. But that's flimsy at best.
5. I don't fully agree. I agree that he's manipulative, but clearly not to the level as some stories portray. But at the same time, not so little as you imply.

But that's not even all of the criticism. His final plan to get rid of the Horcruxes is atrocious. He leaves it to 3 (admittedly, extraordinary) teenagers to find them without any support system. It relied on them actually able to find them and get to the locations. To overcome traps that one of the worst dark lords designed. That they wouldn't get killed in the war. Harry's survival further depended on D's theories about mythical objects. He personally observed all 3, but he doesn't know what'll happen if they get united. It also relies on the fact that Harry was the master of voldemort's wand. A chain of events that was overly convoluted. Something simple as Voldemort noticing that the wand wasn't responding any better compared to his normal wand would've foiled that.

The story was exciting, yes. The plan was monumentally stupid. At any point, he could've taken unbreakable vows with trusted OotP members so that they wouldn't reveal what he was about to say, and then reveal the existence of horcruxes. Why in the world would you let the downfall of Voldemort hang on such a stupid plan?

Furthermore, he never curbed Snape's behaviour. He employed Argus Filch, who, may i remind you, was gleeful at the prospect of physical punishment of teenagers. His rule over hogwarts was so lax that bullying from James & co was allowed to go so far that Snape almost died. He made vague references that Voldemort wasn't fully dead yet. So vague that people didn't even believe him when Voldemort was really back. He allowed a spy within the ranks of OotP, which veritasium and/or unbreakable vows could've easily prevented.

So yeah, Dumbledore has been painted as a very negligent or very incompetent character in the books. It doesn't help that JK threw in convenient magical concepts just to further the plot without thinking about the implications of her past writing. I like to think he's just very overworked. He had 3 jobs; Head of the ICW, Hogwarts and the Wizengamot. All of them sound like full time jobs. I do think that the bashing is mostly overdone. I generally attribute bad things to human error, so I already predisposed against the manipulative angle. But that's where most writers fail imo. They point out all the flaws without good reasons why they're allowed to happen, and it gets old fast. I could think of a couple solutions. Throw roadblocks in Dumbledore's path. Show how overworked he is. Show how he gets restricted from his various jobs. Maybe being head of the Wizengamot is largely a ceremonial title. Maybe he doesn't really have a say in how Hogwarts gets run, that the board does most of the job. Stuff like that.
