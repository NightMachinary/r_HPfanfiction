When it comes to the points about official power (I'll only note on the other ones that I think Dumbledore does not deserve much of the criticism), I'd note that his action to place Harry with the Dursleys was entirely above board with magical law. People always seem to forget that the ministry knew where Harry was and entirely preferred it. Fudge got worried when Harry didn't seem to want to go back to Privet Drive. Sirius would have been convicted if he had gotten a trial and I don't recall an instance that shows that Dumbledore had the power to force a trial. It was the ministry that decided to forgo a trial.
