  The only other real critism that Dumbledore should recieve is for conceiling the prophecy from Harry until it was too late. Atleast after Voldemort came back, Dumbledore should have told Harry of the prophecy.

Yes, Dumbledore should have and he didn't, which is why there is one full chapter in OotP where Dumbledore explains almost everything to Harry and apologizes ("/I should have told you, but I loved you too much and wanted to wait . . ./").

One of my favourite point about Dumbledore is that he could easily recognize his mistakes, and tried to make amends.

For the rest, I agree with pretty much everything you have said.
