1) "Right at their doorstep". Focus on that. He could have just as easily left Harry inside, where it was warm. Or, you know, knocked on the door. Since He didn't want to give the Dursleys the choice to refuse, he didn't knock. The supposed Blood wards were too important for him to risk(wards that were supposedly built from love), or the idea of them. Whichever works. Also, Albus needed Harry at Hogwarts. So his home life needed to be bad in comparison.

2) Mishandling Sirius can be excused. The marauders fooled a lot of people while in School. However, the moment The Longbottoms were attacked, Albus should have gone to interrogate Sirius. It stands to reason that their Spy would be the one to tell the Death Eaters how to break/bypass the wards protecting certain homes. This so that Albus can warn the others in the order to try and prevent another attack like it.

3) He put the philosopher's stone at Hogwarts, a School. Full of children. While knowing full well there was someone after it. Thus putting every single one of those kids in danger. The fact that Quirrel only use the one troll, just that one time, is a small miracle. It could have been so much worse(there's a basilisk below the school Quirrel didn't use). Another blatant example is HBP. He knew Draco was trying to kill him, and instead of keeping an eye on the idiot, albus let him execute whatever idiotic plans came up to him. Instead of, say, have a house elf follow him around(like harry did, eventually). Both Katie's and Ron's near death experiences could have been prevented if anyone had noticed Rosmerta's odd behaviour around(or just after meeting) Draco.

4) It's entirely possible he did just this. Only he didn't know he was looking for Horcruxes until Harry dropped the Diary on his desk. Keeping that info all to himself until he was Dying tho, that was pretty stupid. If nothing else, he could have asked Sirius to help him research on how to identify or track the things when Grimmauld place was re-opened.

5) Someone already mentione how hard it is for abuse victims to simply walk away. Go read that reply.
