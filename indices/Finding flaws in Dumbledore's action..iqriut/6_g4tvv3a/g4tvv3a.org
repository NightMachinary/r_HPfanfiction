I agree with you on most points but I still think that he should not have left harry with the dursleys, like he came into the situation knowing that they were shitty people and even taking out the dursleys dislike of magic he probably knew that they were as Minerva puts it "the worst kind of muggle" and Im sorry if someone gives you that kind of warning after watching the dursleys for either a week or a day then I would probably listen to your trusted friend, while I understand the need for the blood wards it doesn't matter because if he got raised with someone else couldn't you just put strong wards on the place and or even bring harry to Hogwarts and raise him there.

Ok for your third point, there is no doubt that he put Hogwarts in danger, first year what if instead of being sneaky about everything Voldemort just decided to systematically kill everyone starting with Dumbledore when Dumbledore is like walking down the hall or something like I get Dumbledore's good but is he so good as to avoid a killing curse to the back unexpected probably not then he would move on to snape mcgonagall, ect, ect and then just stole the stone or something before Dumbledore put it in the mirror or just get someone else to get the stone. Second year there's a mother fucking basilisk running around petrifying people (everyone especially the dude who saw the basilisk through nearly headless nick got really fucking lucky with that one) and your telling me that you don't shut the school down and like send everyone home until they found the chamber and killed the monster while yes it does take a parceltounge to open the chamber I think I saw it on the wiki that apparently Dumbledore can either understand it or speak it and it shouldn't be to hard to find someone who either knows a parceltounge or speaks it especially with the connections that Albus Fucking Dumbledore has after defeating grindlewald. And killing the basilisk may be hard but rooster or like Dumbledore just does his thing and fucks shit up.

Third year there's a fucking serial killer on the loose who wants to fuckung kill one or more of your students. End of argument. Send them back home where they will be safer make good use of those blood wards.

Forth year nothing to bad happenes until the end of the tournament so no worries there.

Fifth year not too much to say here with the ministry being a cuck. And Voldemort is back so lock down Hogwarts and make that shit a fortress

Sixth nothing to bad here except for when he dies and everything goes to shit so I guess don't fucking die. Also keep Hogwarts in fortress mode.
