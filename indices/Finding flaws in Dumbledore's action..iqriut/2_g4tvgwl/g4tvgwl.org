For your first point, you're basically arguing what they argue, only you're saying it's a good thing while they believe that letting a child be abused at home to further their affection for the Wizarding World is somewhat wrong.

And well, blood protection against Voldemort? Not really all that useful unless you know the man is up and walking about. Doesn't stop a Death Eater entering and killing him, or if it does, it doesn't stop them hiring some random bruiser type to enter the property and kill him, or kidnapping him on his way to school, or whatever else. A fortified sanctuary is only really useful if you don't leave or if you can get back there quickly/easily. If Dedalus Diggle can wander up and bow to him in a shop, any idiot could find him and grab him.

The second one isn't bad because it's immoral. It's bad because it's stupid. Imagine you're Dumbledore. You're head of a basically secret vigilante group operating during a war against a racist, extremely powerful terrorist that you know will be absolutely terrible against anyone who stands against him.

Then, you find out there's a spy in your group. His friends agree it's him, the evidence agrees it's him, you have no doubt whatsoever that this man is guilty.

Fine. Makes sense you'd agree, they know the man better than you and the aurors can at least sort of do their jobs well enough that the evidence works.

Not going and interrogating him to find out what else he told the enemy is utterly stupid. Especially given the fact that there are a significant number of Death Eaters still free, both on the run and in your frickin' government. Any of these people could decide to turn on your fellow vigilantes at any moment, if your spy had told them about it.

Thus, leaving Sirius to rot is a massive mistake - not because leaving him there if he's innocent is the worst, but because leaving him there if he's guilty IS.

I agree with four completely, and can't really come up with a good Devil's Advocate argument otherwise, and I would also add that I'm pretty sure nobody but Voldemort had ever really made more than one before. I vaguely recall something about that in Rowling's Extras, but I admit I'm not 100% certain of that.

Five is... well, yeah. Technically true. I could also argue that, just because the option to leave was there, doesn't mean he hadn't convinced them not to take it. That's how abuse and manipulation work. Victims of domestic violence know they can technically make the decision to leave, they just also believe that leaving would be worse than staying. Manipulation works on a deeper level than just controlling choice, it influences the things within you that you use to make choices. If you want to take that lens to the arrangement, Dumbledore used Snape's guilt and grief over Lily to bring him into the fold, and used Harry's passive suicidal ideation to get his sacrifice. It's not a hard argument to create some logic to support.

So, yeah. Basically all of Dumbledore's issues can be summarised pretty simply - he didn't act when people think he should've. Like every set of ideas aggregating from a large group of people, some of it makes sense, some of it doesn't.

Don't get me wrong, I like Dumbledore, I think he's the most complex character Rowling wrote, but some of the arguments for him fucking up are definitely understandable, even if they're not Word of God from Rowling.
