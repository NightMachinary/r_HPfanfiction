I think JK purposely made Dumbledores character flawed to show that no ones perfect and even the people we look up to the most (which Harry definitely did) have their own agenda and can make mistakes. Whilst I don't think he is evil like some fans believe, I do think his need for the greater good came at the expense of Harry's own happiness and wellbeing . I mean the fact he “raised him like a pig for slaughter” -thank you snape- shows that he manipulated Harry from maybe second year onwards once he'd figured out about the horcruxes and he fully intended on Harry not surviving the war which is more than enough for fans to dislike him.
