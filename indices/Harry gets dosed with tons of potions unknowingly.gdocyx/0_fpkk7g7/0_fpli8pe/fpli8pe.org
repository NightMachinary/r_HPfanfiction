IKR right? Usually, Hermione's there to say “X [usually Ginny, Molly, and/or Dumbledore] has been slipping you potions?!?!? Listen Harry, how about I now fuck you senseless while we realise all along we were meant for each other before you pop into Gringotts to soul-bond me and formalise our titles with the über-friendly goblins as Lord and Lady Gryffindor-Hufflepuff-Ravenclaw-Slytherin-Pendragon-Merlin-Le Fey-Gaunt-Riddle-Peverell-Black-Potter. Sound like a plan?”

I agree, this is something that sounds interesting.
