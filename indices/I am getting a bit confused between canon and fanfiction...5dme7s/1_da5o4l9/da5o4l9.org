There's a common fanon trope that has the narrator castigate Dumbledore, McGonagall et al for never telling Harry more about his parents. Yet the truth is in canon Harry just doesn't seem all that interested in the details of their lives. He never really asks anyone about them, and if he doesn't ask, why should people assume he wants to know?
