People rarely like to think of their loved ones as dead, instead prefering to remember them as they were when they were alive. Harry, having not remembered his parents much, seeked stories and anecdotes from those who knew them, wishing to see them as they were in life. To someone like that, flesh and bones hold little meaning.

So no. He didn't give their graves much thought. Not just because he had more pressing matters to focus on, but also because it fits his character.
