We're told right from the beginning of the first book that for Harry, one of the rules for a peaceful life with the Dursley's is to not ask questions.

Whether he ever wondered or not, who knows. But it does seem a move toward self-preservation not to dwell on things if you can't imagine that you're ever going to get any answers. By the time the answers would have been available to him, the questions had been quite far put out of his mind and replaced by ... well, other more immediate needs of self-preservation.
