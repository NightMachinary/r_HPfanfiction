Dementors aren't strictly speaking alive (I think they're classified as 'amortal') so they won't be killed by the Gaze. I also like whoever pointed out below that they don't have eyes, so they can't see the Gaze anyway. The Basilisk will probably feel sad, though. (can snakes cry? Magical properties of Basilisk tears, anyone?)

I know that poltergeists are not ghosts, but I suspect that Peeves would be affected similarly to Sir Nick. If not, I suspect he would be temporarily destroyed before reforming, since Peeves seems to have come into being from the castle and its students.

As for a boggart... my headcanon is that a boggart is small fry compared to a Big Bad Basilisk(tm) and so would run and hide, making itself as small as possible.
