  my headcanon is that a boggart is small fry compared to a Big Bad Basilisk(tm) and so would run and hide, making itself as small as possible.

Fair enough (heh, I do wonder what the Basilisk's greatest fear would look like, though), but what if you /did/ lock the Boggart and Basilisk in a room with no place for either to go and hide? What then?
