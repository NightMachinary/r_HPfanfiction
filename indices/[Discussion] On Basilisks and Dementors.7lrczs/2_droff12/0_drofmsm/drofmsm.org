  Head Canon: poltergeist is a pissed off ghost
#+end_quote

I'm afraid this goes rather beyond a normal 'headcanon', and into blatant /contradiction/ of canon. It's implied in the first book that the ghosts don't consider Peeves one of their own in any capacity ("he's not even properly a ghost!"), and Rowling confirmed her intention was that Poltergeists are spirits of chaos who naturally spawn in places of magic and mischief, not the remains of someone who once lived.

  a Boggart would be unaffected as it won't transform cause the basilisk has no soul/magic.
#+end_quote

What does the fact that it won't transform have to do with anything? Moreover: the Basilisk's Gaze is pretty ostentatiously a magical ability, so yes, Basilisk have magic; and I see no reason why a Basilisk wouldn't have a soul --- but either way, why would the former be necessary for a Boggart to transform? We know for a fact that Boggarts can and do transform in front of Muggles, after all.
