If I recall correctly, the molten-film thing was an addition of the movie; it looked good on-screen but didn't mesh too well with the way the Gaze seems to work in the books, and I wouldn't put too much stock on it when trying to determine the true mechanics.

Here's another question. Can /Portraits/ be Petrified? They clearly see, albeit through a magical process that is probably the same one as how ghosts do it.
