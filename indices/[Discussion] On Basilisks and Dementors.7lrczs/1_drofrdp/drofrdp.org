Mm...I did write a very silly mini-fic ages ago ("Pasta of Death"), which had a Basilisk!Harry accidentally looking at a Dementor. The accompanying sound effect was 'fwoomph'.

But yeah, if dementors can't actually see, in an optical sense...hmm...I guess a basilisk's gaze wouldn't be effective against dementors. That said though, it's curious how ghosts can be petrified, seeing as they can see, and perceive, but don't actually have eyes as an organ, just the ectoplasmic representation of such.

...Actually, you know what else is strange? The basilisk's gaze destroyed Colin's film of it. How could it do that, without destroying anything else that it lays gaze upon (except for killing anything that meets its gaze back)? Could it be that the actual image of the basilisk's eyes is cursed (cursing images/words/etc isn't unprecedented, see the Taboo and Unplottability), such that it shatters anything it's depicted upon (human sight, camera image, etc)? But then why would the basilisk not die to its own reflection, or shatter every mirror that shows the image of its eyes as it passes?
