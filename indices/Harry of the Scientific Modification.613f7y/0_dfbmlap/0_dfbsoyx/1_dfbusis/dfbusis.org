yeah but it's the best kind of terrible steamrolling. the kind where the steamrolling actually almost makes sense and imo it's way better than harry potter and the methods of +rationality+ shortsighted bitching.

its like if harry potter was the master of death but like a naruto jinchuriki so while he can manipulate death he has the deathly hallows and a voice in his head driving him insane, that could be a great story albeit with a hella steamrolling.

or even if he was like gandalf or the PotUS

also tbh it was less about everybody sucking and more about harry being god and a reaper and a prothean and gandalf and a supercomputer and thats what this thread is for and honestly Vulpine Wizard had harry being less overpowered but was still worse than HP:G.

tldr: Harry is god but in an */interesting/* way
