I'd just like to add that i really, really liked Vitam Paramus. I think the tone you set fit very well with the tragedy at the beginning. It was all very depressing, not in the 'sad' sense but in the way that you could kind of feel what Gabby was feeling, just some kind of emptiness that she didn't really know how to fill-

I don't think I'm explaining this very well but suffice it to say that i love your writing and you're awesome!
