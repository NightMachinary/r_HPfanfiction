The problem with Quidditch fics is that they're Quidditch fics. They tend to be suuuuuuuper boring as most authors don't have the whimsical flair that JKR had when writing those scenes. The action itself tends to be boring, and the goings-on surrounding the game (such as trades, sponsors, practice camp, etc) usually falls flat.

For example, take a look at Vitam Paramus. The story is like 25 chapters long, and pretty much nothing happened into the story until the author decided to add an epilogue a few years after the story had been marked as complete. Just tons and tons of Quidditch filler with no meaningful character interactions. And that's pretty much the best long Quidditch fic.
