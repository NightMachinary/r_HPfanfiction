I think the best explanation for food and animals is that to transfigure or conjure something you need to know every relevant detail, but you can make up for inaccuracies with magic. So unless you are really really good at biology and know the DNA and cellular structure of the animal you want to create by heart, you can't make a real animal - you can only make something that looks and behaves like the animal, but needs magic to function, like an animated statue.

Because of that, eating anything transfigured would be a terrible idea as the contents would be different from real food.

If you knew the molecular structure of carbohydrates, fats, amini acids and all vitamins, you might be able to make something edible, but It probably wouldn't taste good.

Making more food if you already have some on the other hand is relatively easy since you're taking existing molecules as templates, so you can copy them without having to spend years studying nutrition science, chemistry and molecular biology.

That theory also explains why conjured animals don't really behave like real ones, as they are constructs running on magic, so unless the caster knows neurology they're unlikely to have real brains that could function without magic.

Animagi probably require a lot of magic to keep their animal bodies running and sane, since there are probably a ton of details off even after studying their animals for years.
