Gamps law describes how something can be transfigured, food is one of the exemptions to it since it's too complicated to properly do.

Linkffn(The Arithmancer) has a bit more on transfiguration theory, including the discovery of the sixth exemption (radioactive materials) and later on the seventh (antimatter). There's also a bit on spells to rearrange molecules without residual magic, for example charcoal to diamond.
