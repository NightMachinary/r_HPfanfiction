Harry-ness is a spectrum, and the point where any reader stops considering him as Harry depends on what it takes to break their suspension of disbelief.

For some people, it's when the Harry of fanfiction isn't the son of Lily Evans and James Potter, of Number Four, Privet Drive. For others, it's when Harry stops being humble, regular old "Just Harry", and acts like an angry little attentionwhore who wants to wreck Dumbles. And for some people, it's when Harry changes his name to Hadrian Peverell or Harrison Evans.

The line is always going to differ from person to person, but writers can keep the story "realistic" by changing one thing, like Harry's name, but keeping the other traits that make Harry who he is, like his personality and snarkiness, internal voice and manner of speech, or his motivations and skills. Or giving him skills like animagus abilities or Master of Death powers, and keeping his determination, power of love and forgiveness, and loyalty/friendship. It depends on the writing and pacing, really.
