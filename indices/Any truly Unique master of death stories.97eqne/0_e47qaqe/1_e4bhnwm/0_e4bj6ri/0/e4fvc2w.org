I mean that's kind of the whole point of having a Master of Death fic, the idea that there's something special about it.

I could see one being written about this though

  Harry's journey into accepting death.

If you have a fic where the Hallows are merely powerful artifacts, then it's just like canon and most fanfics. The vast majority of fics feature 'mundane' Hallows, following how they were in canon. It's just that they don't present themselves as MoD fics. So I don't really see how it would be unique - pick any fic at random and chances are that that's what you'll get.
