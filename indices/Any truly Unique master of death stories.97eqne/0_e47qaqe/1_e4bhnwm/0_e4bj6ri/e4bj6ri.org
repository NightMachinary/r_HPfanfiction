No, there a lot of fics that take it literally, where it gives him godlike powers, immortality, supermagic, time travel abilities, etc. That seems to be what generally gets associated with "Master of Death" Harry in particular. It's far less common to see an MoD story that either treats the artifacts as just that or mimics Harry's journey into accepting death.

A lot of people also (mis)interpret canon to mean that Harry survived Voldemort's second killing curse because he had the Hallows- my interpretation is that it's largely due to Voldemort using Harry's blood for the ritual, and maybe the existence of the Horcrux/Harry's willing sacrifice. Harry being the master of the Elder Wand allows him to defeat Voldemort at the end of book 7, but his revival specifically doesn't have anything to do with the Hallows. I like Dumbledore's explanation that the Hallows were merely powerful magical artifacts created by three talented wizards. I think a lot of people/fanfics either misintepret canon or actively choose to go in a different direction by making the Hallows Harry's route to immortality.
