The only traitor-James fic I know of is The Odds Were Never In My Favour, but Harry was raised at the Dursley's and was a Fem!Harry. Not sure if it is your thing, but you might enjoy it.

Is the fic you're looking for one you've read before, and do you remember when you read it/what site it was on?
