I liked the paranoid world being manipulated, personally. I admit, it seemed to get a bit big too quickly - it really was a paranoid 'world' - but it worked well for me. I just got caught up in real life and haven't had the time to read it again. :)

Big, shadowy, manipulated world is definitely an under-utilised trope though, I absolutely agree. I'd love a few more Magical Illuminati stories. :)
