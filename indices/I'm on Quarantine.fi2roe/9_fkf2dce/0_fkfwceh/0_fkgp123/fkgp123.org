It about a 40 year old Harry who has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

It is a great "who-dune-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists. There is a huge side order of slash and the main pairing can be off-putting (I did not read it for almost a decade bc I said "oh, no way!") , but the plot gets you through this.
