linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is always one of my go-tos; also here's a mix of a wide variety of fics: linkffn(The Granger Principle by Starfox5; The Augurey by La-Matrona; Forbidden by Savageland; The Young Adventurer's Club by artemisgirl; The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi; Swung by Serafim by flamethrower; The King's Indian Attack by Nectere). I'm going to plug my own series as well, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).
