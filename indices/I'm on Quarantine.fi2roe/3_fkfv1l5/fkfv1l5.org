Well full disclaimer this is my fic but According to the comments I've gotten it makes people laugh, so I figure if you are stuck in Quarantine for a while, you might need a little Humor sometimes. Just fair warning, his story is pure Crack .

Here is the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22273192/chapters/53191642]]

If you don't enjoy the fic I recommend

A Black Comedy, It's always good for a laugh. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/31/A-Black-Comedy]]

And if neither of these fic work try check out the Terry Pratchett discworld novels, Going Postal is Hilarious.
