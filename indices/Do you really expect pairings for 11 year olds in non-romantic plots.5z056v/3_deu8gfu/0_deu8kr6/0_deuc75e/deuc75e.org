Because if I start reading a story and after 150k words the author decides to make it slash or ship some pairing I don't like I will drop the story. So before starting any story that has no clear pairing I ask because that way I can prevent wasting my time on something not enjoyable for me.

It is less about the situation at the current point of the plot and more about the future.
