It's just par for the course for fanfiction. A large part of reviews I get at FFN ask me to pair Harry with a certain girl, or express dismay that he's not paired with the "right" one. It doesn't bother me much because when I started reading fanfiction years ago, I was specifically looking for a H/Hr fix, so I understand where they're coming from.
