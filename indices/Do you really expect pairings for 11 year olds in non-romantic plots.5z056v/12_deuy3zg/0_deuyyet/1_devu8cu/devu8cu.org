Yea thats a very close minded view. A FICTION story is a FICTION story, and plenty of best sellers have teenage romance in them (even as young as 12-13). Plenty of movies deal with this. Plenty of TV shows have it. Oh and lets not forget its COMMON IN REAL LIFE.

Are you that closed off from the world that you cant see that?

No one is saying it has to be graphic or anything. Thats up to the author. But if you are an author (not saying you personally) and are ignoring any sort of pairings or romance in your story because of the excuse that the kids are underage... well lets just say thats the stupidest excuse ever.
