Yeah, the key thing here is that the reviewers aren't asking for anything in terms of sexual relationships or even romance at this point. All they want is an assurance that a certain pairing will happen in the future, at the discretion of the author. That's not too much to ask for, and it's good to be planning that far in advance (assuming you do intend romance to blossom at all).

Is writing about sexually active kids bad? Well, that's subject to debate, but generally speaking, as long as there is no actual intercourse below a reasonable age (~ 16/17 or so seems to be the line for most people), you shouldn't run into much trouble. Go over that and yeah, you can get the fic removed. That's not, however, what the people appear to be asking for.
