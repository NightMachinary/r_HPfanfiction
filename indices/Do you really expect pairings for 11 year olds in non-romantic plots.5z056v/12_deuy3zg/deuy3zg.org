So a couple things to point out.

--------------

OK so... scientifically:

Puberty begins for most kids between 9 and 12. Masturbation begins, and group dating often starts between 11-12 with even some sexual sharing happening (kissing, petting, body exploration). By 13, many begin to pair off (first boyfriends/girlfriends). By 14-15 sexual intercourse comes into play, or at least oral or manual stimulation. So...while 11 and 12 might seem a bit young, some kids are even sexually active by that age (at least in terms of manual acts). 11-15 is an era of HUGE change in terms of sexual awakening.

This information is not interpretation or invention, but direct scientifically proven information based on data about the human body, physiological studies, and polls/interviews.

It does of course depend upon how quickly the child is maturing, but it has been shown that children in a dangerous world (such as one filled with war) are actually MORE LIKELY to be pairing up and sexually active.

--------------

In terms of the Harry Potter universe itself, I want to point out a couple things.

First... I always go back to the point that its implied the Wizarding world is sorta stuck somewhat in the past, and a bit old fashioned and that marriages, pairings, and romances began at MUCH younger ages in the past. So it would kinda make sense already for pairing up to be encouraged, or at least accepted.

Secondly, the wizarding world in HP has been asailed by several dark lords and wars. It would make sense if children felt the need to find significant others earlier and earlier, based upon such an environment.

Finally, the actual magical aspect of the world make romances or sex much more interesting. Think about things such as protective charms and similar things, likely meaning that having a child early on is much less likely, and the overall experience being much more fluid and easy. Or the ability to bond oneself with another. Or love potions. And so on and so fourth.

--------------

At the end of the day, Harry Potter isnt the real world, and the objections to early pairings or interest in pairings are somewhat silly, especially because even IN the real world, that is an age of sexual awakening and pairing up.

But to each author their own, and if the author doesnt want to pair them up, or is waiting on pairings thats perfectly fine. Just expect the idea to be debated and asked about because people get curious and everyone has their pairing preferences.

I know I have read amazing stories and then been dismayed at the eventual pairings and it somewhat ruined the complete experience for me, and made me wish i knew the eventual pairing/s from the start so i wouldnt get my hopes up.

One of these stories is the Harry Potter Series by JK Rowling.

Just saying...
