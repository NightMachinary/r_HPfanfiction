I agree with this. Looking back, when I was 10/11 was when my friends and I first started having "boyfriend and girlfriends" that were at most holding each others hand on the way to school and sitting with each other on the bus. I see nothing wrong with something that innocent for first and second years at school.

In fact, I consider it odd if there isn't something as chaste going on.
