I'm writing a trilogy, and the first story takes place when Harry is 6 years old.

Every single person who's read the first story has asked me about eventual pairings. I'm writing about a kid learning to read, and they're asking about his love life. Wtf.

In their defense, maybe they're reading your work but they don't want to get too invested because they're afraid of being disappointed by any eventual pairings?
