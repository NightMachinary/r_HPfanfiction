I don't see the issue. Why get invested in a story if you're going to hate the eventual pairing? They aren't asking for 11 or even 6 year old Harry to have an adult sexual relationship /right now/. They are asking "/will/ this be pairing x" so eventually, in the /future/. Also if a romance is age appropriate what's wrong with it? Draco's Boy starts out as children but leads to romance in their teens. Everything in that story is very age appropriate. A large part of Fanfiction is pairings. Get over it.
