Personally, there are some fairly popular pairings that I just can't stand. If your story currently is taking place when they're 11 years old, then there's a very good chance that it will run through all the Hogwarts years and span hundreds of thousands of words. I'd rather not read 300k words only to be massively disappointed by your choice of pairing come 5th year. If you're going to have /any/ romance in your story then I think it's good manners to reveal the pairing at the start.
