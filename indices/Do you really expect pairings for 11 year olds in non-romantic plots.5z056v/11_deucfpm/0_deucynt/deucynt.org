But I don't KNOW the pairings for an 11 year old. It doesn't even make sense that I would unless I was writing with that end in mind. Take my favorite pairing, Harry/Ginny. I have a feeling its just not going to work in any of my stories, because of the direction I'm taking Ginny and Harry's characters in. So I can't declare that at the start, because if I just shoe horn that in after adding a lot of character development that would indicate otherwise, I'd be sabotaging my own story.
