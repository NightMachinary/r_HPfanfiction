In response, I would simply say: Don't read unfinished stories if you might not like the way the plot develops.

You also have no right to expect an author to ship a certain way, or at all in fact. You have the right to not read any story you want, and on FFN there are 800k other stories to choose from (including crossovers).

Authors owe you nothing. It is good manners to take what you're offered, and if you don't enjoy it, don't ask for it again. I liken it to eating greenbean casserole at Thanksgiving. No one WANTS it, but some relative seems to make it every year.
