Judging by my own experiences, I really don't expect dating until people turn 14 at the earliest, and I expect plenty of people who haven't dated by the time they graduate from Hogwarts. I expect people to take their relationships very slowly at the younger ages.

A term I've heard is "Disney-ship". In linkffn(The Long Game by inwardtransience), I Disney-shipped Charissa and Hermione. I wanted them to have a cute relationship where they hugged and held hands and tentatively kissed and were generally cute at each other. It didn't seem appropriate to portray them going much further. The author disagreed there, but what can you do?
