Seeing 11 year olds outfight threats that couldn't be stopped often feels contrived. Either the kid comes over as implausibly good, or the threat looks incompetent. It works when used in small doses, but generally, more serious stories involving violence would do better to start at a point here the characters are a bit more grown up - aka "old enough for romance".
