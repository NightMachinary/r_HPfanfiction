The sad thing is that fucked up things happen in the world, and with enough desperation and a touch of sociopath-ism [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_use_of_children][child soldiers]] happen. And I think we can see both in the Potterverse.

In the end it's the decision of the author on how he takes on the world. While it's morally wrong to use child soldiers I find some things in your fics morally wrong, too. One example is the liberal use of Veritaserum in the first few chapters of "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution" - I think this is a huge deal, especially after a while and upon students. If you can't protect the leader from students and have to resort to Veritaserum you have other problems. However, that is your decision and your story, so you can decide that it is that way. Just because something is wrong it doesn't mean you can't write about it.

We actually have a different take on the whole world in Harry Potter, especially on the status of Muggleborns between 1945 and 1970 and 1980-1995 - I think that the purebloods have some advantages, but muggleborn are the ones innovating and getting away with it - which is what made the purebloods angry in the first place (People need a reason to be mad, and seeing someone 'inferior' do well would be enough to mobilize)

Anyways, child soldiers happen in the real world, so I can't see why there can't be an AU where the adults are desperate enough to train Harry. I mean look at how helpless the ministry was when confronted with Voldemort.

And depending on when Harry starts training he'd definitely suck it up, he always considers his life worth less than that of others (See: He goes through the flames in PS, was willing to die for Ginny in CS, goes back to the Dementor Lake in PoA, ...) - he'd definitely be up for it.
