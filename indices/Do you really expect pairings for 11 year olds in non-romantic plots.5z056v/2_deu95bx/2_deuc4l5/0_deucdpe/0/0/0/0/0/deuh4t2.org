Sure it's fucked up, I never disagreed with that! I haven't been a child soldier so I can't tell if it's ridiculous to say that somebody is trained to fight, but doesn't feel old enough to kiss. And I'm not really comfortable with looking for studies if it happens, as I wouldn't write such a story. I'm just white-knighting for an author who does.

I'm sorry to say that I actually didn't read your story to the end. I'm not sure what it is, because it's quality writing, actually has plot and raises moral questions - all of which I usually like, and I recognize you're a talented author in that regard.
