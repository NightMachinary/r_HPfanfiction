The characters in "Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution" were fucked up child soldiers. That kind of reaction is what you get when you send kids to war - every problem ends up looking like a target. The two only realised how messed up they were when they heard about Neville being asked to run as Minister, and their first thought was "should we kill him?"

I simply find the idea that kids shouldn't kiss, but should train for war fucked up.
