Until a later time in the series Harry isn't even really a combatant. The thing with Quirrel was a fluke. The thing with the basilisk and Tom's shade was a fluke. The thing with the dementors was ... something, definitely not a sign of him being a soldier yet. The graveyard scene? Yeah, likewise, a fluke.
