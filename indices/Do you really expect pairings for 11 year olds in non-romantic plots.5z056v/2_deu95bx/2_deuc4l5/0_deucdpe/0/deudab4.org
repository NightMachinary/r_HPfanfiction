Because we want a story.

Other than that: You know what Harry would do with a Bodyguard? Ditch him whenever he really "needs" to get in danger.

For example, take canon CoS. Harry is clearly instructed to "Stay in the common room", but he goes into the CoS to rescue Ginny. Do you really think Harry wouldn't go just because he had a bodyguard? He'd try to save Ginny anyways.

And Harry is rather crafty - a few hours later he frees Dobby, and thus out-slytherins Lucious Malfoy.
