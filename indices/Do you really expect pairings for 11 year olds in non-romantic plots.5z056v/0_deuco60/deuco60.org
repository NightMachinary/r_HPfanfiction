First of all, if you have an opportunity to strap an AA gun to a dragon in your story, I recommend you do it.

But more importantly, I've never expected an 11 year old Harry to get paired up with anyone. I'm not sure how much of it is people actually wanting Harry to get paired up at 11, or if it's people wanting to know what pairing will happen in the future. If someone hates H/G, like hates it with a passion, then I think they might want to know if that's what they're putting effort into reading. Either that, or they really love a specific pairing and finding out that's in the story might make them more interested.

Sidenote, could you PM me the links to those stories, cause they both sound amazing.
