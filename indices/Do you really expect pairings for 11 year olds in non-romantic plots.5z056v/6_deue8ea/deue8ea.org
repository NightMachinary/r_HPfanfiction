maybe you are taking way too serious? I think about 12~13 is when boys start liking girls and girls tend to mature earlier than boys. It doesn't mean that they need to start declaring their eternal love and making up in a broom cupboard.

I had my first "girlfriend" at age 11 we didn't get pass holding hands or a peck in the cheek

It would be interesting to read about a cute innocent romance at that age, no need to make it super serious [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove][check this out]]

of course these people probably aren't asking for an innocent paring
