No, I wouldn't expect it and tbh I wouldn't enjoy reading about a hook up or "romance" between 2 11 year olds. I know times have changed but I was playing manhunt with boys at 11, not kissing them.

That being said, I also don't understand the obsession with pairings. Those who said they'd stop reading a fic if they didn't like the pairing, would you have stopped reading canon if that were the case? That would be insane.

Then again, I read fics for the plot and couldn't care less who is boinking who or even if there is no boinking at all.

Edit: grammar
