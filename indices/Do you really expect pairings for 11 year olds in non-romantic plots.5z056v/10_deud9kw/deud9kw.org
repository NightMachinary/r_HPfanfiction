I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I don't like reading fics where I don't know the pairings. While I don't demand my ship to be featured like the commenters you mention, I do check out what other stories the author have written and faved. If I see a lot of Draco/Harry, Harry/Hermione, or other non-canon pairings, I'll end up not reading the story. Fics rarely stay gen, especially those that cover all seven years, and I don't want to read a fic and become invested if I end up quitting it halfway through when the characters are older. Non-canon ships ruins an otherwise good story for me, even if the story isn't about romance.

So to sum it up: I don't want to see Harry (or his friends) paired with anyone at 11, but I want to know who he'll end up with so I know whether to bother with the fic or not.
