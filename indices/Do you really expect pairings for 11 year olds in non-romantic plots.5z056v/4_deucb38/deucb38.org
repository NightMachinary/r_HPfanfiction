Its true that a large part of the story is completely unrelated to the romance or arrangement or whatever. It should be about what happens next in this scenario thats important.

But, after reading tons of fanfics, people form strong opinions about things, specially characters. So while an author would not want to give the pairing away, or the fic may not be about romance(Harry could be incapable of love after all) but if they don't want to risk committing to a story, reading thousands of words and then finding that a character they detest is a major pairing or a major fixture i the story. I wouldn't want to read, lets say...your first story, and find out 250,000 words in that Harry is paired with Hermione, because I wont be able to continue reading further, which would mean that all the investment i made in the story would be a waste. Because regardless of the excellent premise, that particular issue would be a deal breaker.

Of course the above is why I would imagine a pairing declaration to be important, can't say what goes on in the minds of all the teenage slash shipping fans out there.

Also, for a lot of the Pureblood fics, considering the point that Magical Britain as a whole is described as antiquated and ...ahem...barbaric, it is entirely possible that families arrange marriages for their children for political purposes.
