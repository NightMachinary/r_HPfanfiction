It's a wbwl fic that's heavily influenced by the 2 most prominent wbwl fics, Prince of Slytherin and Sarcasm and Slytherin. It uses readers familiarity with those fics to subvert the tropes/plot points of them, while taking things like certain spells and worldbuilding stuff. Also has a Fem Voldemort named Emily Riddle, and says it will be taking inspiration from Limpieza de sangre, which is an amazing fic. Also Harry doesn't befriend Hermione, and his brother isn't a complete asshole.
