Some of my thoughts were, of course, repairing things and fresh, clean water. Also although food cannot be conjured it can be duplicated. Items can also be duplicated for trading. They could create containers that can keep food fresh, cold/warm and from spoiling and sell them.

Perhaps there are even spells or wards that cleanse or repel radiation? Charms against fast moving objects(spears, arrows, bullets). Spells for making animals docile for herding, butchering or as guards. Enchantments(Fanon!Wards) to keep away people without magic or who wish to harm those under them. Also those that repel beasts and pests. This could allow the witch/wizard to create true safe havens for themselves and possibly others.

Main weakness I think of a witch/wizard in Fallout would be their wand. Wandless magic /is/ possible but they use wands for a reason. If their wand gets broken then they are going to be a lot less effective. Hell it wouldn't be a leap for some bad/jealous guys to figure out their wand is important when they see them using and they would try to destroy or steal it.
