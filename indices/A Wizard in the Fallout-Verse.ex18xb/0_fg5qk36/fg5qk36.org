Putting aside combat spells for a minute. The basic book(s) of spells, household spells, and some transfiguration would set them up for an economic cheat.

- Non-irradiated water costs how many caps? AUGAMENTI!

Muggleborn, half-blood, or Muggle-raised would succeed. Purebloods most likely not. They would die of culture-shock.
