Slytherin's focus though I think is mainly ambition and cleverness/being cunning. Manipulation is more of a side product of this (and how many Slytherins that we see really are manipulative apart from the somewhat clever ones) Not that I think that Albus wouldn't have been one of them. Generally I think (young) Dumbledore would've been put there for his ambition .
