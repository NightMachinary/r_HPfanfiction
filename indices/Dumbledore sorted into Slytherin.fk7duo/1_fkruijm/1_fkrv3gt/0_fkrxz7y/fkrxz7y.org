I always thought he was more of a Ravenclaw but I can see hwo he would be put in Gryffindor by the hat in hindsight. It took a lot of courage to meet everyone in school eye to eye at eleven with the whispers about his father who was in Azkaban for cursing two Muggle boys and so. I think it was more of a choice of /little/ Albus to end up in Gryffindor. I think he wouldn't want to be put in Slytherin to fuel the rumours around his family anymore and it might have been the choice - wanting to be brave that had him end in Gryffindor. He was a couragous individiual as an adult because even while he might have been hesitant/cowardly at times he always chose to be courageous in the end. I think though that Slytherin and Ravenclaw might have fit him better but as Dumbledore himself said; it is our choices that define who we are
