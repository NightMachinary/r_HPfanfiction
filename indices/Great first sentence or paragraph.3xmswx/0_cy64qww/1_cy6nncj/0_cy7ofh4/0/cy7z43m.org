There's not much of a difference between Flashbacks and scenes in a chapter/prologue, other than Flashbacks allow you to stat the story when it actually starts. Inserting the information piecemeal often comes off as infodumping, or constructed. You don't really casually refer to your past that often in talks, or not in the details that are often needed.
