As a reader I think flashbacks and lengthy expositions about altered events that interrupt the narrative are very annoying. Maybe I'm just not a fan of infodump. I prefer it to come at me piecemeal, as the characters casually reference things in the past. But that's probably my fondness for the structure of the original books, where information was given in little bits until it formed a complete picture at the end.
