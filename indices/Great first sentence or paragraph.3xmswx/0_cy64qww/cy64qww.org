The few books on writing I've read all stressed the importance of "hooking" the readers with the very first paragraph. Perhaps it's more important for writers of commercial fiction, but still.

I don't expect such high standards from fanfiction though - if I did, there wouldn't be enough passable stories to read.

It's something I've thought about when working on my own fic, and it seems really hard. Imagine an AU story with a differently-acting Harry, where most of the stuff happens in 4th year onward. I still need to go through years 1-3 to explain the differences, introduce the OCs, etc. How do I make 3 years worth of canon rehash interesting? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
