I've not seen this (or remember if I did), but I wouldn't mind a simple prologue in a detatched, clinical, non-narrative manner that highlights the changes between canon and the AU story to come. Bullet points like

- Harry didn't meet Draco at Madam Malkins, or Ron on the Hogwarts Express, and therefore gets sorted into Slytherin

- Harry still saved Hermione from the Troll, having left the Halloween feast early himself.

- Harry befriends [Bones/Bullstrode/Greengrass/Zamboni] /at such time/ when /reasons/

If you're gonna give me an infodump, don't pretend it's narrative or interesting. Just give me the information quickly and painlessly instead of a "telling not showing" rushed chapter describing years of events and actions.
