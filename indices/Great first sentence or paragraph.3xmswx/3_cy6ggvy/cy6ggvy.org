From fanfiction, nah, I mainly want a first chapter to tell me how it differs from canon. If it's AU, explain the whole background. Just set it up.

I've read some first chapters where it's canon rehash with only minor differences. It takes a really excellent summary to keep me reading through that. And first chapters or prologues where you get a "mysterious scene" of people sneaking around and no names used are just annoying in fanfiction, whereas I quite like them in regular books.

The only thing that's essential in a first chapter is good grammar and spelling. I'll forgive an obvious typo or two, or if the author has one recurring grammar mistake that plagues them, but too much wrong with the writing and I will nope out of there so fast.
