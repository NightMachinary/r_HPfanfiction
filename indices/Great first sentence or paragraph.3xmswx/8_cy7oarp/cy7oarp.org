To capture my attention, I need to read a summary with a premise I'd be interested to explore. So the summary must include the premise. If its just a quote, or something then I just scroll right past, usually. I really like timeline references in the summary too. Such as "DH compatible" or "EWE?" Or "6th year" or something to that effect. It helps me get into the zone of the story, I guess.

Then yes. There needs to be a hook. The first line is important, but no more important than the first several paragraphs. There are few authors in fanfiction writing that can pull off a, how should I put this...? "Mid-action jump in". By that I mean going directly into the narrative without any exposition. I usually hate it because I like stories to feel like they could stand on their own, and doing a poorly executed mid-action jump in feels abrupt. Like a bad paste job.
