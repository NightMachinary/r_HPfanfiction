I think the major difference between commercial fiction and fan fiction is that a fanfic is never actually "book 1" of a series. You don't really have to hook in readers the same way that a commercial author's new series would. We all derp on over to FFN and click on Harry Potter because we /already/ want to read something at least sort of like the fic in question.

I expect the first *chapter* to hook me into the story, but not the opening line necessarily. If I'm reading that first chapter it's because the story summary already got me interested enough to investigate.

That said... any pet peeves like poor spelling etc being present in that first paragraph can easily drive me right back /out/ of a story.
