Not the first sentence, or the first paragraph, perhaps. But when it comes to seeing the first chapter of something and saying to yourself, holy shit, this is going to be amazing... You can't beat Backwards with Purpose. I know /I/ was pulled in hook, line and sinker by that first chapter, and I know a couple of other people who were absolutely sucked in by this, too. I still remember the sheer feels when I read the last few paragraphs of the first chapter.
