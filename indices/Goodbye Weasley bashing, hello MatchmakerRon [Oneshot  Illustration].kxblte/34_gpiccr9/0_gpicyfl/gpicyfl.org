since this was a silly crack fic meant to subvert the "evil ron" trope, the "this is why romione would never work" argument was /also/ intended to subvert a trope: the common thinking that Hermione deserved better than Ron and that's the only reason it wouldn't work. I tried to show that actually there are ways /Ron/ might have deserved better than Hermione and keep it balanced without pissing both Hermione and Ron stans off

It doesn't seem to have worked considering I now have multiple stalkers who claim I hate Ron and want me to stop writing and mention this fic every chance they can to shit on it. Oh, well.

Glad you liked it anyway :)
