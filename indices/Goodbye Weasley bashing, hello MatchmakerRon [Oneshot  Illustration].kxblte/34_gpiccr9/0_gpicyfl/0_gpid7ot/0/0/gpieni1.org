Agreed that when it comes to a crack fics and tags warning of bashing, it's your own fault for getting burned. And generally, even if it comes out of nowhere, the best course is to simply close the fic and move on.

Not sure I agree so much about those people having to expect anti-shipping lectures when a fic that has no indication it's going to bash something you like does so. A Romione fic doesn't require you to break down why Harmony doesn't work, and vice versa. Same with any ship. I don't need to dedicate a chapter of a Link/Zelda fic to breaking down why Link/Malon is a bad ship. It's not something someone should expect just because they're reading a fic about a pairing.

A tag indicating there is a particular relationship tells you two things: 1) That relationship is happening and 2) other relationships involving those characters are not happening. It does not, however, say anything about the story also coming with a lecture criticizing other pairings that those two characters might be involved in.

The only time it comes off as natural is when that failed relationship gave it a go and there's emotion catharsis between those two characters who realized they don't belong together. Here, this is a crackfick, but a lot of stories do have this scene where it just comes out of nowhere. It doesn't feel like readers consuming a story at that point. It feels like an author lecturing fans of that specific ship.

Anyway, I don't want to get into a whole discourse over the thing. It didn't particularly upset me, anyway, it just sorta broke the immersion of the fic, which is why I made my comment.
