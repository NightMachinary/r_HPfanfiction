Which is why romione fans /really/ shouldn't go into a fic not tagged as romione and complain about scenes being anti romione. (Especially not a crack fic and go looking for serious arguments!) I'm sure there are plenty of fics out there that invalidate harmony as a pairing, but I don't go under those fics screaming "how dare you!" Tags are there for a reason.

Lmao, it's fine. I just realized after this that it's damned if you do damned if you don't when it comes to Ron. Some ppl criticized me for /not/ bashing him; some ppl criticized me /for/ bashing him. All in the same fic.

At least I gained some loyal stalkers...uh, fans after this üëè
