I love Ron and the Weasley's, and hate when authors bash them, just to get Harry and Hermione together. So this is fun. Also to the haters: Why comment on something you obviously hate? Hermione and Ron are one upping each other, as friends often do. It's meant for comedy, it's not necessarily bashing the pairing.

I personally love Ron and Hermione, I can see them working together if given the appropriate chance. But, I don't believe the author was bashing Ron/Hermione, merely pointing out the irony of Ron/Hermione haters.
