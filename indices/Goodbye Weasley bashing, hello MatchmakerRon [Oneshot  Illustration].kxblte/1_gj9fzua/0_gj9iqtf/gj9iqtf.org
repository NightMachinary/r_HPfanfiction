  That right there is the bet. Now let's talk about the bet. Can we talk about the bet, please, guys? I've been dying to talk about the bet with you all day, OK? "Harry and Hermione," this bet keeps coming up over and over again. Every day the bet's going around the school. Harry and Hermione! Harry and Hermione! I look in the ballot, and this whole box is Harry and Hermione! So I say to myself, "I gotta find out what this bet is all about! I gotta go up to Dumbledore's office and put this ballot in his goddamn hands! Otherwise, I'm never gonna know what this is all about and I'm going to keep seeing all these ballots about Harry and Hermione." So I go up to Dumbledore's office and what do I find out, guys? What do I find out?! There is no Harry and Hermione yet. The two haven't got together yet, okay? So I decide, "Oh shit, buddy, I gotta dig a little deeper." There's no Harry and Hermione? You gotta be kidding me! I got boxes full of Harry and Hermione! All right. So I start marchin' my way down to the Common Room and I knock on Fred and George's door and I say, "Fred! George! I gotta talk to you about Harry and Hermione." And when I open the door what do I find? They're in on it, guys. Half the students - half the teachers - in this school have made bets on you guys getting together. This school is a goddamn casino.
