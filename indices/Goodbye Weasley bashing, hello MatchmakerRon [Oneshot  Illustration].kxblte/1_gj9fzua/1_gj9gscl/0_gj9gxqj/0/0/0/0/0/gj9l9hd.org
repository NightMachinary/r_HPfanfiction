"Ron! What happened?" Harry asked, concern on his face as he stared at his best friend who had just woken up screaming at the top of his lungs.

"A bloody nightmare, that's what!" Ron's face was pale and he sat upright in his dormitory bed, shaking uncontrollably.

"You!" Ron pointed a finger at Harry. "Stay away from my sister!"

"And you!" He screamed at Dean Thomas who was still bleary eyed and seemed to have no clue what was going on. "Stay away from Hermione!"

The dormitory room was silent.

"Understand!?"

"Yes, Ron." Neville said in a pleasant tone. "We understand. Now go back to bed."

"Bed...that sounds nice...." Ron murmured and lied back down, falling asleep in seconds.

Everyone let out a sigh of relief.

Only Seamus shook his head and groaned to himself. "This bet is going to turn us all mental and it's barely been a year!"
