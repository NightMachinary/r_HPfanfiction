Naw just add a chapter where Harry is actually getting married to Ginny but Ron is just ignoring him and trying to connect dots that aren't there between Harry/Hermione it'd be funny for a nice crack chapter

"Ok. Ron I'm going to stop you right there, not only is Hermione married to Dean Thomas but I am literally getting married to your sister in ten minutes and you're here looking like a drunk hobo"

Edit: and then have ron wake up and realize that it was all a bad nightmare and Operation Get Hermione and Harry together is still a go
