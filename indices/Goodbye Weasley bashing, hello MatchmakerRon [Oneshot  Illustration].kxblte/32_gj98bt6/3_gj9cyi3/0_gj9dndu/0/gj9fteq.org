  Everyone has their ships, stop hating on others and read your own ships.

Same thing should apply to Romione shippers, yet they're reading this fic and hating on it.

Also, I find it hilarious that Romione shippers are bringing Romione bashing into this discussion when the fic is literally about a supportive Ron. I interpreted that exchange as two friends just joking with each other as they thought about what it would be like to date.

Haven't you ever been in that scenario where you're like, "Yikes, I wouldn't want to date you." and your friend replies with something worse because at that point you both are just exaggerating and trying to one-up the other.

As OP said... it's a light-hearted fic meant to be fun. Stop trying to bring bashing into it when there's literally none.
