Do you really use a dump account just to find all of these posts and comment insults under them? Because that's just sad and pathetic.

This is your first comment. No posts and 1 comment which is this. Stop seeking us out for petty reasons. I'm not going to argue about this but again, stop commenting insults on other's OTPs.
