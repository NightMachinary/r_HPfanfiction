So didn't comment on the artwork, or the rest of the story. You didn't just say "well done" or "nice work" or something polite. You couldn't even be asked to just suck it up, say nothing and just move on with your day. You just had to cherry pick the one part of this whole endeavour you personally disagree with and throw a fit over it.

Why? You knew what you were getting into when you clicked. If you didn't like it, just go literally anywhere else on this subreddit, and you'll find plenty of threads praising your favourite pairing and disparaging everything else. This is fucking fanfiction subreddit, and you're complaining about someone's taste in shipping. That's like walking into a Macdonalds and complaining that they have mayonnaise. Just fucking shut up for once and move on.
