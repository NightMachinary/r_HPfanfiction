LOL. You live for crawling through post history and reviews! And I don't have to crawl through yours because you basically comment on every pro-Harmony discussion for reasons I can't quite fathom.

Also LOL at you being 'perfectly chill' while everyone else is sweating, screaming insults, blah blah blah. I honestly don't know what you would spend your time doing if you couldn't whinge about Ron bashing on a daily basis.

I mean, the comment you quoted wasn't even directed your way but you still felt the need to reply. Why are you triggered and sweating my dude? Why can't you follow your own advice?
