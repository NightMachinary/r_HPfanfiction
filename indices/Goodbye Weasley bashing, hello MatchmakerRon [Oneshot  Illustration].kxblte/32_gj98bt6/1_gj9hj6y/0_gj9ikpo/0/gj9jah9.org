/Always feel/

Not every story...in fact most stories...don't feel the need to 'take a dig' at Romione. And even if they did, why on earth do you care? Why are you reading this story?

This is fanfiction. I am sure there are a million Romione stories that trod over the same tropes and story beats. I'm not a fan of over the top Ron bashing either so I avoid those stories.

I legit don't understand why people can't live and let live.
