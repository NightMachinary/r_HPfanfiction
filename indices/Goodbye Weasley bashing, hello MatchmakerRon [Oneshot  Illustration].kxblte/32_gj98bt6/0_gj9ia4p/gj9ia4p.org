No... I "seriously just wrote this" intending to write crack...granted, it's my first time trying that kind of humor so who knows how it came across.

While writing it, I thought it would be fun to reverse tropes that I see all the time. Like the fics that go on and on about how Hermione deserves "better" than Ron and how she would be miserable with him; here I tried to show both sides, how /Hermione/ can be pretty awful to Ron too and he deserves better.

That's /my/ personal opinion. You don't have to agree with it. But maybe /don't go into a Harmony crack fic and complain about it not being pro Romione./

This was a fic I wrote hoping it could get a chuckle or smile out of someone, not to start arguments. If it's not your cup of tea, by all means, move on instead of starting a ship war in the comment section. Thanks.
