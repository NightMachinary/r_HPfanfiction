Yeah, same. I tend to stay away from fics that have heavy bashing, I know some people might actually utilize it in a good way. But If it is actually well-reasoned bashing I don't see the need to write 'bashing of x character' in the tags at all! I would consider it as the normal exposition of a character's flaw.
