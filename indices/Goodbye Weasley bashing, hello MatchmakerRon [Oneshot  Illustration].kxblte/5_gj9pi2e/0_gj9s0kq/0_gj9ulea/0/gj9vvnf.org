Agreed 100%. I'm fine with real character criticism and exploration of characters. For example, pointing out Dumbledore's failings of never checking up on Harry's well being at the Dursleys should be considered criticism and not bashing. There's also the chance that characters can learn, change, and grow when flaws are acknowledged and there is valid criticism, while in bashing only fics they remain stagnant and flaws are only brought up to be exaggerated.
