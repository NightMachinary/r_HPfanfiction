the author to that story focuses on very long chapters. It feels more like a chore to read them than to enjoy the story.. If you feel the same i can't recommend you keep reading story's from that author, I tried almost all of them but can't seem to read to the end chapters.

About what happens to hogwarts: [[/spoiler][The whole castle is full of dementors, Harry charges in to destroy them with patronus charged golems etc.. He finds a seal that holds alot of house elves in stasis and wakes them up. Also some angst where harry is mad at the adult wizards etc.]]
