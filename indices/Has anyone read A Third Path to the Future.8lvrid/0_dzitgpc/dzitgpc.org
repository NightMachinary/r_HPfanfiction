It's been a while since I dropped off, but here goes.

The biggest problem I have with that fic is the pacing. It's tortuously slow. It has the same vibe as a kathryn518 fic such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/1/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]]. Funnily enough, she's a beta for Vimesenthusiast. Huh. Anyways, it does get better in my opinion, but you'll need to push through the initial phases of the fic before it takes off. The romance always felt a bit off though - like Storm was just wayyy too cool about a multi relationship, among other oddities.

As for what happens at Hogwarts... [[/spoiler][If I remember correctly, it got taken over by a bunch of like... zombie spirits? Or something similar, could've been creatures too. There was a very long siege and everybody ended up dying. There's a very dramatic scene of Harry burying the bodies of children. For some reason the house elves survived. Harry proceeds to turn them and the castle into a factory of some sort to supply potions and other wizard items to the new world. Can't really remember more details sorry :L]]
