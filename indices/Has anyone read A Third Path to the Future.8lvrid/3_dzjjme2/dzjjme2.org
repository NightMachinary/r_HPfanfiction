I'm current with the fic, and I have to say I really like it. But then again, I like long wordy stories so Vimesenthusiast and Kathrine518 work well for when I just want to get lost in a non - action packed fic. As for Hogwarts, he turns it into a Mutant and Mutant family rescue house. After dealing with the previously mentioned Dementors.
