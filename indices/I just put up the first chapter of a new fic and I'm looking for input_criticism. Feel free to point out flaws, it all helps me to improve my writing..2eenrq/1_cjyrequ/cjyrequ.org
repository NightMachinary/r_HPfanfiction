I like the idea I'm getting so far, although you'll have to be careful to keep it unique. And I hope it doesn't turn into another super Harry story.

Not very many grammar errors but there are definitely a few; "Whatever force held the other two in misery, keeping him in his own dreams", for example.

+One thing I'm pretty sure you got wrong is /Rennervate/, which canonically is /Ennervate/.+ - Huh, nevermind.

Let me know if you want a beta.
