This won't be the best organized input. I'll just write as I read here.

- I would remove the (secondary idea) parentheses. Stylistically, it could work in some aspects, but I feel it's off when written in a third person POV

- "Piss off, Malfoy" was Ron's eloquent reply.

I would rephrase. Grammatically it could work, but I would simplify it and just go with: "Piss off, Malfoy," said Ron.

There's some other areas where you miss the punctuation in terms of dialogue. Look up tags and when to use the comma and when to use the period. Either way, there should always be some form of punctuation on a dialogue tag. Also, try to avoid the temptation of Draco sneering all the time :)

Overall, some good passages of writing there. I don't know if it's your first ever fanfic, but if it is, it's a good start. My first story was much worse. Work on some of the grammar and dialogue tags. That was your weakest point. Speaking more of the story, I think you need a stronger first chapter. I liked the in media res introduction. You did well not to just have exposition dumps all over the place. I always emphasize a strong first chapter as it is difficult to keep the readers for long if the story isn't interesting. That's not to say you need a lot of action or anything else like that, but you do need a hook. I can sense where it's going, but it didn't really draw me in immediately.

Keep on writing!
