We see a decent amount of Draco Malfoy, and it's not good. We see less of Lucius Malfoy, and that's also not good. My complaints are not solely that they are missing appropriate behavior, but that they are committing acts that are unbecoming of their station.

It is possible that Draco Malfoy is a model pureblood future politician, suave and persuasive and cunning, every second he's not being observed by Harry Potter. It's possible, but it doesn't seem terribly likely.
