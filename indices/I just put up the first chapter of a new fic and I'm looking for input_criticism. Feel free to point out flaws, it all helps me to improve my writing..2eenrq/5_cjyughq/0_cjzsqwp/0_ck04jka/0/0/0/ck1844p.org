Draco is a spoiled little shit, but then again a lot of children from influential families are and end up in positions of power and know how to handle them. We only know how he acts around Harry though. The same with Sirius, Snape, and especially Dumbledore.

Dumbledore for instance flat out lied to Harry in PS/SS, but ensured Harry would never think well of Snape... yet seems so nice and understanding. I didn't even think about the consequences of that lie until my second read through (Snape hated James because James saved his life??! Is there a way to make Snape sound worse to an eleven year old?). We can see that as already planning for Voldemort's return with ruthless opportunism, or a bumbling lie because he was caught off guard. This is just a hint of how things are different behind the scenes than they are from canon perspective.

Sirius and Remus for instance lie or twist the truth (Snape was jealous of James because of quidditch, hung out with Bellatrix at school, etc), act irresponsibly (Sirius goading Harry to break rules, Remus putting students at risk by not disclosing facts about Sirius who was a suspected mass murdering death eater), yet seem so awesome. Snape on the other hand is a foul git at all times, yet is Dumbledore's confidant far more than expected (the reveal of their interactions during the Prince's Tale).

Draco does not get this much attention, and we don't see his other sides nearly as much. Lucius even less. Narcissa is rather awesome from what we see of her (using Bellatrix to improve her negotiating position with Snape to save Draco), but again we do not see her enough to make an opinion as to who she actually is. Therefore they are prime real-estate for development ;)
