I agree that JKR could have done more with the Malfoys, but Harry never got a chance to see that side of them. Just like we didn't get to see Snape's covert ops, the Order's skirmishes, and so on. As far as we know, all of the Order of the Phoenix do is just sit down and enjoy Molly's cooking and /plot/, come to where Snape tells them, and treat Snape like a pariah. Harry's perspective skews a lot of the perceptions of canon.
