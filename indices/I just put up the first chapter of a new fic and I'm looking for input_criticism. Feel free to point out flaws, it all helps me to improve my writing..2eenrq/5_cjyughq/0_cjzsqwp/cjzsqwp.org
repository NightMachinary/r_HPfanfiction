Canon Draco is one of the characters that gets the harshest treatment by JKR.

It's not bashing when it comes to him - it's his canon character. He's an arrogant, racist, entitled, and overall spoiled little shit. Only Snape (Jew who metaphorically killed Jesus and feasts on the blood of children), Crabbe and Goyle (dumb and dumber) get treated worse. Even Bellatrix Lestrange and Voldemort get more credit from JKR.

Draco doesn't get much redemption (as opposed to Snape, who dedicated his life to Dumbledore's plan, and Crabbe and Goyle who got none). He tried to stop Crabbe and Goyle from killing Harry, didn't identify Harry to Bellatrix (purposefully? or was Hermione just that good?) and was not able to bring himself to murder Dumbledore. People tend to forgive him because of the many parallels to James Potter and Sirius Black, but there is no evidence he has any of their good features. As opposed to them, he treats his friends as minions (CoS), yet has more restraint as he doesn't "hex people for fun" (quoting Remus Lupin) but rather tries to get his victims in trouble.

That being said, a lot of fan fiction shows him to actually be a decent guy. It's possible. But still, giving him the JKR treatment can't be seen as bashing, because that's the JKR treatment. He serves an important point in the books: the "lesser evil".
