It seems like a good start so far. I'd like to warn you about a common failing: we're dealing with children here. You're dangerously close to writing the characters far more self-aware than any thirteen year old is. For instance: Ron could already pinpoint the source of his inferiority complex and describe it. He's thirteen, it would more likely be "god I hate this! stupid $@#$ing brothers!" - not morose contemplation.

Also, the tone of the first chapter is decidedly dark in nature - the descriptions of the weather at the end give it a very cold feel. That's quite a risky opening gambit for a story, most ones start with a more neutral vibe.

Other than that, the other comments covered just about everything.
