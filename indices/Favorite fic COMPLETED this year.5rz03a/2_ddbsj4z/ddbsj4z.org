So I just looked through my favorites and considered everything that was updated in 2016. My personal top 3 are

Nr.1: linkffn(8295633) Harry/Tonks fluff which starts as a friendship and then slowly evolves.

Nr.2: linkffn(12296750) A fifth year Harmony romance set during the winter holidays with well written Grangers.

Nr.3: linkffn(11637611) FemHarry/Susan Bones, over the top violence and slightly crack. It is a comedy where everyone is lesbian. Despite this, the author has some rather unique and interesting plot points (especially in the sequel).This story has one of the best Lunas I have read so far. The sequel is currently being written.

Honorary mention of short stories:

linkffn(12175262) Harry/Luna after the Malfoy encounter during the Slug Christmas party. It depicts Harry and Luna's emotional state rather well and still is unique in both pacing and general plot. The second chapter is a smutty continuation of a one-shot but still has the same style.

linkffn(11950994) Harry/Tonks Hurt/comfort one-shot during the fifth year summer

linkffn(12307978) The hogwarts stuff is grading fanfiction. A parody of the current state of fanfiction. Also great guide for writers, rather hilarious and still has its own plot.
