Thanks! The summary wasn't too helpful, and I couldn't tell from the website name if it was a site dedicated to a certain genre of fanfiction - and if so, I couldn't see anything on the Alex Mack wiki page about Hellmouths, but eventually I realised what was going on.

I'm surprisingly enjoying the story, despite having never seen/read Buffy, Angels, James Bond (yes, really), or Alex Mack. Given that apparently James Potter was 007 at one point, apparently it's set inside that world?
