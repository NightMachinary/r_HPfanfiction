HG&tBWL is a standalone story, dw. From what I can work out (not read any of the other stories) the first story is about a group of YA heroines (HG, Buffy etc) being assembled from various universes to save the world or something. The primary universe is that of Alex Mack, who seems to be a 90s Nickelodeon show about a teen girl who is also a spy. HG&tBWL is set in her universe, starring that universe's version of the Hogwarts crew. It's a bit dumb (as an Englishman, all the aristocracy stuff is pretty risable) but fun.

TL;DR: Its basically a Hermionecentric non-magical AU with some mad science and super-spy shenanigans. No knowledge of anythign other than HP is needed.
