I liked linkffn(Exile by bennybear). Draco runs away to the muggle world after he is sentenced to live without magic for a few years. Follows him as he fumbles through trying to understand and integrate himself in the muggle world as a competely clueless wizard with no understanding of basic muggle things like phones or street lights.
