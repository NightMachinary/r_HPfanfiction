Oh, the devastation.

I'm not offended, just pointing out the hypocrisy in holding one commenter up as a Saint when they went personal when all I did was mock an act. I said nothing about them as a person, and only criticized the comment structure. And honestly, if criticizing /that/ comment is random, I'm not sure to what extent someone would have to destroy English for you to take note.
