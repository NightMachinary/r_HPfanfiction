And, again, they were entirely negative in their first post and then proceeded to attack me personally in response to two sentences mocking their grammar. So, frankly, no. If what I said offers even the slightest chance they'll not use Penguin of Doom speak next time they comment, something which their post history shows they're fully capable of doing, then I'm content with what I said. Of course, my mother abuses me, my father is disappointed in me, and I was just broken up with while simultaneously getting fired so I'm just so goddamn mean and not a decent, normal person.
