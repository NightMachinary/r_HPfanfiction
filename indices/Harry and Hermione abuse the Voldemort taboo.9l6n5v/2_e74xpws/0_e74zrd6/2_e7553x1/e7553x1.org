Can't you try being a decent, normal human being and resist your urge to be mean and petty and mocking to somebody just because of how they express themselves and behave, when NONE OF IT EVER HURTS YOU? How goddamn fucking hard is it to just NOT SAY ANYTHING? TO NOT BE RUDE AND CRUEL? HOW HARD IS THAT FOR YOU?! What the fuck is even going on in your life that you just had to stop and do that? Seriously WHY? Did you get fired at work, did your partner break up with you? Is your mother abusing you, did your father say he was disappointed in you? What the HELL IS IT that makes you so goddamn mean inside that you just can't NOT DO IT?
