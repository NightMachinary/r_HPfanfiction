I'm reading and loving "The Mirror of Ecidyrue" series.

"The problem" serie and "The secret language of plants" serie are cool too.

A fun little one shot is this: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16416197]]

PS. I found the problem series in a post on reddit for another person, so there are others people who can benefit of your "joking" post. Writing this you actually made a post where people who read fics on Malfoy can easily find others fics to read. So... joke's on you. You are letting them spread. No reason to stop.
