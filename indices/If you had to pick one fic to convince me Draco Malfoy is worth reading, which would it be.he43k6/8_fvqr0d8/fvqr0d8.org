Dethryl's "They Shook Hands" series is what originally got me into accepting Draco Malfoy as a character, back in like 2002. Obviously an AU, I believe it was the original slytherin!Harry fic simply because I can't recall seeing one before it. Draco there is very much similar to canon, just with some slight changes to make him a bit more likeable.

Linking the first book of the rewritten series (it was done to catch it up with new canon that came out over time, such as Blaise being a dude etc.) linkffn(They Shook Hands : Year 1 (New Version))
