Well, although I do quite like his character arc in the Innocent series, he's very different from canon (for good in-story reasons), and his older brother more or less takes his place as the designated Slytherin jerk. So it might not be the best example, even though it's a great series.

Perhaps a better option for your request would be linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions), which is good for a laugh regardless.
