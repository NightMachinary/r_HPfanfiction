I recall enjoying Draco's characterization in Escape.

linkffn(11916243)

It is at the end. The fic features a more 'light' Snape (he is being a got to non Slytherins because he know the dark lord is coming back, and thus needs to keep up his cover.

Anyway Draco basically... Fails to cut it at being a murdering psychotic terrorist. He isn't a better person, but it turns out genocide wasn't his thing.

Snape sees this and, when he starts to back out in a way that would get him killed, brings him to the good guy side and asks them to hide him. They do it for Snape, not for Draco.

Basically, they went with "he is a bad person, but not an evil murderer". That always felt close to canon and isn't done all that often.

I also recall a fic Harry/Draco have a hidden friendship/riverly. Draco wants to make Harry his minion, but Harry wants to give him an out. It was a slow redemption, thus didn't feel like whitewashing the character. That one involved Greg turning to the light (although not being bright enough to realize it) and having a relationship with Luna.
