Before I get the usual replies regarding any soulmate au fics, I should clarify. Soulmates in this fic are not instantly in a perfect relationship. It just shows compatibility, but it doesn't guarantee that they will even become friends.

Draco, in this fic, starts off exactly like his canon counterpart. Bigoted, arrogant, overall a pretty garbage person. But thankfully he gets a positive influence in his life - Harry - in his second year, before he can make any irredeemable choices.
