Waste of space and in need of a good beating :( - sorry, but at 11 I didn't do everything my parents told me anymore (I had my own oppinions, too and they seldom lined up 100% with my parent's oppinions!) and Duddley really has no excuse for treating Harry like the dirt on his shoes!

ps: I'd rather see Bellatrix Lestrange change sides (maybe because Voldemort wants her dead after that screw-up in the ministry that revealed him to the public, too!) than Duddley see the light in fanfiction (especially "You are a wizard" storylines are lame, especially if he's suddenly Harry's friend just because he has magic, too (note: I'd love his parents hating him for having magic, but that wouldn't make Harry his friend - reluctant ally maybe, but not friend, not after years and years of shitty treatment!))
