I see him forgiving Dudley. That's it. Harry would probably recognize that Dudley has been raised specifically with only negative views of Harry. His parents that loved him didn't like Harry so that's how he's raised. It's be much harder to forgive Dudley if his parents also didn't like him. I think most people exaggerate Harry's childhood a lot. Really Dudley to me in canon is just a local school yard bully, not a sadistic little shit. Of course bullying is bad, but it's exceptionally popular in kids and has different levels of shitheadiness. Harry has lived through a ritual bringing a powerful dark motherfucking voldemort using his own blood and seen a classmate die by his parents batrayer. Harry thinks very little of the attempts to humiliate him by his relatives after that. I'd say it's pretty easy for him to move on. And he does.
