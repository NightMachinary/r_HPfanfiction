  I think most people exaggerate Harry's childhood a lot.

His childhood was full of violence. I am not gonna argue here, at least not now, but Dudley's and his friends' favorite pastime was Harry Hunting.

A.K.A finding and beating up Harry. There is a lot more abuse I could point out, but I hope I don't have to.
