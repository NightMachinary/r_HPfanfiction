I never said there isn't any abuse, just that it's exaggerated because people forget what the books say between every single fanfiction saying the same thing about his abuse. I 100% agree emotional abuse can be worse. My problem is everyone takes what is said in the books and multiplies it by 50. I think my counterpoint to that, is that he was only told to do chores for the masons, which he's doing the garden, and I believe Dudley is told to do cleanup inside.And I the cupboard sucks add, but to be fair, its a big add cupboard that's describes in the books. Like I said, there's no question of trauma from a childhood like that. It's the constant exaggeration that people start saying is canon that bothers me.
