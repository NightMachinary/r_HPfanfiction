Maybe his childhood wasn't "full of violence" (although it was definitely present) but it was definitely /full of abuse; Both physically and especially psychologically, which can be just as -if not more damaging./ He was treated as a house elf in his own home; not given love, money, or even clothes the fit. He had to tend the garden and cook but when guests came over he was hidden away in his room - which he only even got because they were frightened of McGonagall's letters addressed to "the cupboard under the stairs" - and they literally locked him in there and put bars on his window. I could go on but I won't.

*The point is, these actions were not physically violent, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't abuse.*
