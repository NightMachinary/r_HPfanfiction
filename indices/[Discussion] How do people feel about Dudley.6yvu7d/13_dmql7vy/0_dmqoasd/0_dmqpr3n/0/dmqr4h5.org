Full of violence? If that's not a hyperbole I don't know what is. The books never say they beat him up. The most violence we see is that frying pan seen. Which yes is definitely obviously bad, but never was there something like that again, I believe Vernon grabbed Harry by his collar in PoA after he threatened to tell Marge about Hogwarts I think. I think they probably pushed him on the ground and grabbed his glasses. Which is a typical school yard bully act, not to proceed to punch and kick at him.
