Sure, except he wasn't starved. He got three meals a day. He didn't need to survive from his friends. The ENTIRE family was on diet. That includes who? Dudley, Vernon, and Petunia. He didn't need that food to survive, he wanted it because the food they were all eating was crap. You'd notice that for being sent "life saving" food, it was completely sweets, no nutritional value at all. You'd think if he actually needed food to survive they'd give him something that actually helps him survive right?
