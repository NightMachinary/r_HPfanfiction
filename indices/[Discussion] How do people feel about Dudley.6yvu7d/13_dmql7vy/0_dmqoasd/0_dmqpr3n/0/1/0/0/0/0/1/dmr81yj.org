True enough, I always thought Hermione recognized Harry's treatment. My impression was always that they were closer and Hermione knows how emotionally stunted he is. I might be talking out of my ass, I haven't read after the Goblet of Fire for a while now. But i think if Harry was actually starving he'd write a letter that meant it to Hermione, not one of them "I'm starving, help" lines that he would probably send in his sarcastic lovable way.
