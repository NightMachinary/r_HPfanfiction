Personally I'm a total sucker for a Dudley redemption arc and him and Harry being on good terms as adults. Dudley as wizard doesn't really do it for me, but Dudley having magical kids is one of my bigger headcanons.\\
(I know it conflicts with canon, which technically might not make it a headcanon but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)
