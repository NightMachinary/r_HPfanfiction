You stop being "the product of your upbringing" at some point and start forming your own oppinions (and that's before age 11 IMHO, I myself remember becoming more and more independent at that age and even disagreeing with my parents on policy and even on politics (I was always kind of fascinated by politics, even as a small child)) and while you might not be legally held accountable, you are still morally responsible for shit you pull and shitty parents aren't a great justification IMHO!
