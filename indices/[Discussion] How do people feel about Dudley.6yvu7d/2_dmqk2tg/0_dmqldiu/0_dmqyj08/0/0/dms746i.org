Shitty parents aren't justification, they are a reason. Dudley is described as a rather dim and spoiled child, who has been raised according to certain values and got away with everything, so he literally didn't know better. Was Dudley an arsehole? certainly and i would have hated if i was in a school with someone like him, but from an outside perspective i can't really blame him, because with a background like that he couldn't be anything else.

Becoming independent and forming your own opinions does not mean you just pull those options from thin air, you must have access to different ideas to even realise that there are other options to form. It speaks well of you that you could make your own opinions at 11, but did your parents raise you in the same way as Dursleys raised Dudley?

And like i said, Dudley does show remorse later in canon, when he realises that Harry isn't some horrible freak that his parents claimed he was.

Of course do keep in mind i never said that Dudleys bullying victims and the such should just get over it and forgive him because of it, because yes the fact that he was never taught better, does not justify his actions, it merely explains them. And it does mean it is possible for him to be redeemed so that he becomes a decent person in the future.

And damn this got long
