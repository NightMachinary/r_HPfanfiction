Dudley is a character I actually find to have a lot of fanfic potential, especially if he is allowed a bit of growth and development -- because he's so extremely underdeveloped in canon.

The problem with canon Dudley is that he's inconsistent, especially in the first couple of books -- and this is because he's always portrayed as the negative contrast to Harry. Basically, he has the traits and personality that would make him come off as worst compared to Harry depending on the scene. Sometimes it even shifts in the scene itself, just so the narrative can beat over our heads how fat, mean, spoiled, stupid and utterly pathetic he is, and how much better Harry is than him in every way.

And that's pretty interesting, because even though Dudley is SUPPOSED to be the bully who gets his comeuppance, as the story is written he's so pathetic and such a failure in everything that he actually comes across as the underdog compared to Harry. Sure, the narrative insists that he's a bully, but it never shows him successfully bullying anyone, it only shows him being the victim when faced with magic. I think Rowling eventually caught on, because the last two books do show Dudley in a more sympathetic light and hint that there is hope for him to grow and change -- unlike his parents.

There's definitely a lot of potential with Dudley, potential that a good fic writer can expand upon. I'm not saying he should turn into a figure of sweetness and light, or become Harry's best friend or anything, but I'm all for Dudley becoming more than the walking fat joke that canon all too often treated him as.
