I agree with you - they should. But in real life that still won't warrant a jail sentence. Harry was usually fed and always clothed, he had a roof above his head and received an education. The only physical abuse was at the hands of Dudley who was a shit kid because his parents set a horrible example. Parents like this lose their custody, they don't go to jail. And at least Dudley somewhat redeemed himself.
