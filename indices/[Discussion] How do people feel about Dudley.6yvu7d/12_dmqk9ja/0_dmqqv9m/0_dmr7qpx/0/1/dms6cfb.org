that is actually not true.

The dursley's were guilty of creating an unstable and violent home for an orphan. In fact, under british, and US law, Vernon and Petunia are responsible for Dudley's physical abuse of Harry. They are also guilty of neglect. They also did emotionally, and mentally abuse him. Recently, both of those areas were covered in cases in which the child was found to be in an abusive home, and those cases were not to the extreme that Harry's was.

IRL, if the Dursely's did what they did in the novels, and what we can see from the books, Vernon and Petunia would be in prison, and Dudley would be under watch in foster care. That doesn't count the fact that Vernon and Petunia allowed a dog, to repeatedly bite a child, and tree that same child, and allowed both the dog's owner and the dog to be in the same house as the child for an extended period. (Prisoner of Azkaban, first couple chapters mention how much Ripper and Harry Get along). That is actual assault of a minor, and any good lawyer can get Vernon and Petunia on conspiracy to assault a minor. If not, compliance with the action which is the same as being an accomplice to a crime in the United States.

Dudley may not be the worst of the Dursely's and he may have a redemption possible, but if I was Harry, I would never ever want to see him again.
