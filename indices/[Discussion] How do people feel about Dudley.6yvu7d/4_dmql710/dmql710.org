I feel like there could be more moderate characterizations. It's either asshole or completely redeemed. It might not completely be Dudley's fault that he grew up the way he did, but that doesn't mean he didn't know what he was doing, especially as he grew older. I would like to see someone write him as somewhat better than he used to be, but still kind of an asshole.
