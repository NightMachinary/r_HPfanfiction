I have to admit, I don't really find Dudley-centric fics or even Dudley-has-a-role fics very interesting - especially given that in my experience, it's almost always the Dudley who's lost all this weight and is now big and muscled and is suddenly an acceptable love interest for someone or other because he's actually kind...

Like, no.

I have a lot of fondness for some of the most flawed characters in the universe, especially Rita Skeeter, Peter Pettigrew and the Malfoys because they all have their own goals while just coming across as absolutely terrible people, you know? With Dudley, I think it's almost more tragic than that - Dudley's been raised with neither goals nor direction in mind, because everything's been given to him, and in order to fill up all his time he just bullies kids and as he grows up, realizes that doesn't satisfy him.

Dudley as a wizard, definitely not. Dudley having a position in the wizarding world, again, no.

But I think Dudley could reach for a redemption arc - how big it would be, one has to wonder. It's very easy to give into the want to just suddenly make a Muggle or squib character magical in order for them to have a semblance of importance, but that isn't necessary; part of Dudley's fear and bitterness toward Harry is an intentional parallel with Petunia and Lily's relationship. Outside of a complete AU, Dudley /shouldn't/ have magic, because it takes away from his character as whole.

I see what you mean about it being distracting though, OP - characters like Dudley are super complex in that even if their intentions might become good, they have a lot of flaws, and you'd really have to lavish a lot of attention on a redeeming plotline in order for it to be convincing, so it would need to be a primary plot.
