That actually makes sense in its own way. I recall ... something about it, but it's really vague because I'm not a ship/beach/sea/whatever kind of person. That said, if it feels right then I feel that is all the reason one needs, it doesn't hurt anyone in any way so that's it (and I could see Ollivander going on a rant about it if that hypothetically were true; just imagining it is kind of hilarious).
