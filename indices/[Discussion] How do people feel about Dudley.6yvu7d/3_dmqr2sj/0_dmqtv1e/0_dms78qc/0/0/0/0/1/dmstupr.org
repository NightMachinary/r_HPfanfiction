That one I can easily answer, it's /a sad layer/ (the thing where the cake doesn't care about your baking efforts). For all its faults, and for all it feels like Madame Rowling didn't know what to do because she wrote herself into a corner, the final fight could have still been a cake of sorts: the whole series gives us hints that the one chance Harry has at defeating him is to reach for the ancient magic, the magic that comes from emotions and cannot be controlled, the magic that Tom scoffs at and never cared to understand. It could have been epic in a very emotional way, instead we got “Graveyard Duel MK II” with Harry getting boost from the elder wand which had not been foreshadowed sufficiently.

I guess it's mostly up to the fact that I really like stories that play with emotions, and this one just didn't deliver. Still, the seventh book was /readable/, so that's that.

And yes, what I meant with the hyphened title was CC; it wasn't written by Madame Rowling and got adopted into canon on her say-so despite contradicting certain things that were up at the time and still are up, so ... yeah, I'm not going to get onto anyone's case for treating it as canon, but you won't see me use it as such for anything because really.
