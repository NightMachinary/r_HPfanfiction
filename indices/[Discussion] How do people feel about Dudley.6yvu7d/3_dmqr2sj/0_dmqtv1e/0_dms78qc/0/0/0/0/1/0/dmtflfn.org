He did not get a boost. He based his plan on one line he heard the Wand Maker say in his first year. Apparently, the wand was sentient enough to decide that HP was her master, so she killer LV. Yes, I'm calling the Elder Wand she. Deal with it. So truthfully HP did not kill LV, The Elder Wand decided to do the job herself.
