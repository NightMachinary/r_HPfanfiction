Yes, I know, and I feel it safe to say that this problem of hers is common knowledge here.

Personally I take the main books first, other books after that, then whatever else she wrote/said personally for as long as it does not contradict the stuff in the books, movies not at all (waving your wand like a chipmunk with some nerve disease does not count as proper casting) and officially-adopted fanfics not at all either (yes, that one is about you-know-what). I am annoyed with some of the nonsense in the seventh book, but for the sake of my sanity I'm not going to think too much about it for as long as it doesn't matter to something.
