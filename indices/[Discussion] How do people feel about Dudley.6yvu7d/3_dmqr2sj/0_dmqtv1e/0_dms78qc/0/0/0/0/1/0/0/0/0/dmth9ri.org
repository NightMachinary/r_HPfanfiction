I know, and I don't “don't like it”. I'm just not particularly enthused about people throwing something random out and telling me to “deal with it”, it makes me feel as if being defensive was the default position when talking to me which ... doesn't really feel good. Don't mind it, it's just a personal ... I don't know, quirk? Annoyance? Whatever, really.

Personally I never though about wands as sapient creatures and anything more than quasi-sentient items with no actual identity, so for me it's a non-issue, but if for you they are alive-like enough to have genders (or however that works) then that's your choice and that's it for me really, at least for as long as you don't try to crusade for it like a lunatic with no proof (because it's just sad when people do it, and a tad annoying; for an example, see some of the less ... sensible, yes, arguments for certain pairings, which are just pitiful).
