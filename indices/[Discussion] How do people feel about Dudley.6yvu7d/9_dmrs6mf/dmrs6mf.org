Dudley was as much a victim of his parents as Harry, just in a different way.

I do not want to imagine what life altering change it must've been to him when he had to take responsibility for anything the first time. Children like Dudley are defacto unable to live in a society without a serious reprogramming of pretty much everything they know. Or they become sociopaths if they find some way to support their delusions that nothing is their fault.

I feel like Dudley is a prime candidate for a redemption arc. However, I don't mind if he just remains the dumb bully that gets to be the punching bag in the end.
