My Dudley is a copper. He and Harry collaborate on investigations from time to time. They are on cordial terms but not close. Neither is particularly comfortable around the other.

As an aside, I recall several kids from my own youth who were absolute little shits but who have grown up to be perfectly decent human beings. Age is a great leveller. I think Dudley would have turned out okay in the end.
