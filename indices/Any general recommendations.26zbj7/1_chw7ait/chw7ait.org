#+begin_quote
  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
#+end_quote

Note: I really hesitated before picking this one up. It's Ender's Game meets Harry Potter, and it might seem a bit weird. Just go with it. It's actually quite good.

  If two people are deliberately created to be together, how will the challenges in a world of magic and Dark Lords be dealt with? What would it mean for two people to truly become one? A re-imagination of first year.
#+end_quote

Note: This is the best soul bond fic I've ever read, bar none. Just get past the first 3 chapters. They're rather cringe worthy. Trust me though, it's worth it. Seriously.

#+begin_quote
  Ten years ago, Voldemort created his kingdom. Now a confused young wizard stumbles into it, and carves out a destiny. AU. Nondark Harry.
#+end_quote

Note: Pretty much the best fanfiction I've ever had the pleasure to read. Yes, there are serious spelling, grammar, and punctuation problems. Yes, the author fucks up his tenses often (especially the early chapters). Just...Just get through it. Seriously. You've gotta trust me here. It's worth it. The best characterization of Voldemort I've ever read. Probably the best Harry I've ever read as well. It reaches out and grabs you in a way you don't expect, and before you know it, you're a million words in.

#+begin_quote
  A tale of rage and revenge, of loss beyond what any person should have to bear . . . and a tale of love, Harry's only hope out of the darkness.
#+end_quote

Note: Probably the best Harry/Fleur story out there. First 5 chapters are average, chapter 6 and beyond have a gigantic leap in quality.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus][Vitam Paramus]]

#+begin_quote
  After tragic losses, Quidditch star Harry Potter is forced to pick up the pieces of those who have vanished; while he finds himself also taking care of another lost soul.
#+end_quote

Note: This is something...different from what I'm used to. It's a romance, but it starts with a tragedy. It deals with everyday issues, and some not-so-everyday issues. It's the only good Harry/Gabriel fic I've ever read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]]

#+begin_quote
  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
#+end_quote

Note: The quintessential Powerful/Independent!Harry story, only good. Seriously, this is the fic all those other powerful fics /wish/ they were. It's well written, clever, and very funny. You'll laugh constantly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause]]

#+begin_quote
  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks
#+end_quote

Note: Best Harry/Tonks story ever. Legit beats every single other one, then takes them all out back behind the shed to finish the job. Mystery! Love! Excitement! I could go on and on. It's that good. Probably the second or third best fic I've ever read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
#+end_quote

Note: If you like Harry/Bella, give it a shot, because it's the only one that's ever been even semi believable. That said, it's long, and it has a ton of hang time in the middle. If you don't mind that, give it a shot. Personally, I enjoyed it, but the middle 50k words were boring as fuck, and I nearly abandoned it because of that. The sequel is trash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters][Letters]]

#+begin_quote
  Students are required to write to a pen pal in the spirit of 'International Cooperation.' New friendships and a new romance arise going into the fourth year at Hogwarts.
#+end_quote

Note: Another one of those elusive good Harry/Fleur stories. Like other fics, get through the first chapter, and you'll like it. Personally, I didn't find the first chapter /too/ off putting, but it was a bit awkward.

#+begin_quote
  Daphne Greengrass always had a plan. She liked being organized. But the Dark Lord's return at the end of her fifth year derailed everything, and now she must decide who will best help her find the life she always wanted.
#+end_quote

Note: It's a cute love story written around Daphne Greengrass, an essentially blank page from the HP world. This is one of those fics that could be your average romance novel if the protagonists were Tarry and Naphne. That said, I enjoyed it for what it was.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter & The Last Avatar]]

#+begin_quote
  Why is Harry Potter considered the worst firebender in Gryffindor? Why doesn't he want to be noticed? Probably the same reason he dreams of drowning every night.
#+end_quote

Note: A really good HP/Avatar crossover. It combines the best parts of both series, and brings them together in a world all it's own. Unfortunately it's not updated very often, but a really enjoyable read none the less.

#+begin_quote
  In his quest to stop Malfoy in his sixth year, Harry turns to an old friend for help. Along the way he finds new allies, a Horcrux, & someone to stand by his side. Alternate view of HBP. Rating for language & violence.
#+end_quote

Note: Another really good HP/Tonks fic. Very similar to the next fic I'm about to post, but more fleshed out. Unfortunately it hasn't been updated in forever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6740130/1/The-Rebel-and-The-Chosen][The Rebel & The Chosen]]

#+begin_quote
  When Tonks & Harry meet, they quickly become friends. When tragedy brings them together again, it develops into more. Age, school, & war are only some of the obstacles in their way. Mix of canon & A/U. Rating mostly for language.
#+end_quote

Note: It's completed, and it's well done. Harry/Tonks. I'd pretty much recommend anything by the author. Out of the maybe 5 good Harry/Tonks fics, this is definitely in the top 3.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/The-Merging][The Merging]]

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. In a body that once housed two souls, only one remains, and it's not exactly what began either. With no understanding of what has happened to him, what else can he do but keep moving forwards, forced by a fate he never wanted, fighting for a life he never got to live. And fight he will. Post GoF.
#+end_quote

Note: This is a fic that does Powerful!Harry right. It feels realistic, and I never really saw where it was leading. It seems to be fairly regularly updated.

#+begin_quote
  As per the Hat's decision, Harry gets Sorted into Slytherin upon his arrival in Hogwarts - and suddenly, the future isn't what it used to be. Spoilers for all books.
#+end_quote

Note: The quintessential Slytherin!Harry fic. Best one out there, without a doubt. It's not updated regularly, but supposedly it /will/ be finished eventually.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince That Was Promised]]

#+begin_quote
  He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.
#+end_quote

Note: This is a /Game Of Thrones//HP crossover, not a ASOIF/HP. It follows the shows timeline. That said, it's pretty much the best one out there. The writing is superb, and the story is very well thought out. The author regularly posts updates to DLP early. I've re-read it about 10 times in the last month, if that tells you anything.

So, wow. That's a list. I'm sure I have more, that's just what I grabbed from the first of 10 folders I have in my bookmarks for fanfics. If you want more, feel free to ask.
