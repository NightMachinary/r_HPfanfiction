[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus]]: Really good Slytherin!Hermione fic. Hasn't been updated since February, unfortunately.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2095661/1/Behind-Blue-Eyes][Behind Blue Eyes]]: HP/OC, a 'Harry runs away from the magical world' fic that doesn't devolve into a power fantasy where Harry learns kung fu and teaches Dumbledore a lesson.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3728284/1/In-the-Words-of-Ginevra-Molly-Potter][In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter]]: A retelling from Ginny's perspective.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God, Not Again!]]: Parody of time travel fics, the best comedy fic I've read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/18/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]: Slytherin!Harry. Some power creep, but not too bad. Hasn't been updated since November.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned]]: HP/DG, Noir-ish mystery. Definitely worth reading.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7539141/1/Incorruptible-The-Dementor-s-Stigma][Incorruptible: The Dementors' Stigma]]: Harry Potter in the zombie apocalypse, plus dementors.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][The Perils of Innocence]]: Harry, Hermione and some of the other muggleborns end up in an institute together before receiving their Hogwarts letters. Doesn't update very often, unfortunately.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2531438/1/A-Better-Man][A Better Man]]: Vernon Dursley is given a second chance.

A few of my favorite Dramione fics:\\
