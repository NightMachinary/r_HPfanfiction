A lot of HHr has Harry hating Ron, but he doesn't grow into it so much as realise it during chapter 1 (with accompanying exposition). Since he's such a magnanimous guy, he gives Ron a chance all the way until chaper 3 before blowing up at him (with accompanying exposition) and Hermione realises Harry is wonderful and Ron is a dunderhead and cue the slow role to an incomplete WIP.
