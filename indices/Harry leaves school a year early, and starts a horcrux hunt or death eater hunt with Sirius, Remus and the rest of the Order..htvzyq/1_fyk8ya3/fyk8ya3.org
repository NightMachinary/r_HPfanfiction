One question was Why did Dumbledore not bring Bill Weasley into the Horcrux "group"? Bill was a cursebreaker, raiding tombs in Egypt, and the Horcrux is dark magic that originated in Egypt. Which means there is a good chance that he has encountered horcruxes before and had ways to find, identify, and remove them. I always wondered why Bill wasn't used in the hunt more.
