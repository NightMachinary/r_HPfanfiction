That would be quite a lot of guessing/making things up as the books don't show Bill having much to do with the horcruxes. Don't you think that Dumbledore would mention to Harry that he should talk to Bill instead of Harry on his "own" if Dumbledore had brought Bill into the knowledge of the Horcruxes.
