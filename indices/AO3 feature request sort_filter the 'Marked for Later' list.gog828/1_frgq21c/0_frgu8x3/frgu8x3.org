Thanks! Unfortunately it looks like they don't have any postings open for coder volunteers at the moment, and even then I'm sure they'd have specific coding tasks assigned. I wish it was open source, I'd happily dive in and see if I could figure this out myself. I guess the best I can do in this case is find an email address to send in my suggestion.
