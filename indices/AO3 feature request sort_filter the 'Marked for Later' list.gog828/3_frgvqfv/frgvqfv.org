The only place I can think of for suggestions is the [[https://archiveofourown.org/support][support and feedback form]]. I second what the other user said about the donating your time if you have the willingness and capabilities to do so.

Personally, I use the bookmark feature (on private) instead of marked for later since there is a sort option for those. If you're already using bookmarks to save read fics that are your favorites for rereads then simply add "unread" under the "your tags" option when bookmarking and then you can filter it in when looking for an unread fic to read. Plus, you can import fics into bookmarks from outside of ao3 so all of your to read list is in one spot.
