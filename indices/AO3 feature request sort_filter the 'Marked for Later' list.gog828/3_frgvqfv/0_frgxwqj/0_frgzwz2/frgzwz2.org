There's an option for "private bookmark" at the bottom of the form so it should be easy enough to do either option.

And yeah, I feel you on the admin front. I started reading on ffnet so I still have a massive list of fics bookmarked in Chrome. I was importing them into ao3 but then figured I should make sure I still want to read them (as my tastes have changed) before doing all that work and here I am years later, still unorganized. At least my ao3 fics are in one easy spot.

I'd love to see a place to save searches, right now I do that in Chrome but it would be so handy to have that within the website!
