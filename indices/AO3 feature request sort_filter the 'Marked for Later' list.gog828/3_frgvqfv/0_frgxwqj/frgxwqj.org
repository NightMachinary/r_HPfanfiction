That's a really smart work around, I think I'll start doing that. Do you happen to know if I can keep some bookmarks public and others private?

Shifting the list of them all to bookmarks is going to take some doing, though! I never knew getting into fan fiction would bring so much admin into my life. :D

And thanks for the link to the feedback form, I'll send it in now.
