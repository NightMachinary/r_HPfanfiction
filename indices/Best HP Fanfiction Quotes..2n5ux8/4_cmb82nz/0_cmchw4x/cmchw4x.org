  Yeah. Getting hauls of XP, magic items, and gold, and thus making your character more powerful, or developed. Character development.\\

  "And then I will find you -- there's magic that will let me do it instantly -- and then I will kill you. Slowly. And then I will rip out your soul and trap it in a shiny rock, which I will then hide on a moon -- which moon, orbiting which planet, orbiting which star, in which galaxy, I will leave to your imagination -- so you can never be brought back."\\

  "Nope, it was a hiccup. What would an eleven year old girl be doing laughing evilly? I hiccupped. I even covered my mouth and everything."\\

  "Love," Milo said flatly. "You-Know-Who was brought down by the Power of Love. Maybe instead of learning magic, we should be putting flowers in our hair and frolicking in the forest like those pointy-eared pansies and singing around campfires. Voldy would be powerless to resist our Flower Power."\\

  *Hermione*: Hold up. How do we know you're really you this time? For all we know, you're another doppelganger."\\
  *Milo*: Another doppelganger? I didn't realize you had those here as well. And I won't be able to cast True Seeing for, like, five levels!\\
  *Hermione*: Okay, nevermind.

  "We're going to find Quirrell and stop him. But to do that, we're going to need to get out of this manor. Again."

  "And why are we going to do that?" Mordenkainen pressed.

  "Because..." Images flashed into Milo's head. Images of Voldemort, all cloaked in black with glowing red eyes, torturing Harry and Ron and Hermione. And... and Hannah. "Because..." Of Voldemort, walking unopposed into the Potters' house eleven years ago and murdering Harry's parents. Of him committing acts so foul that, not only did nobody mention them to this day, but that caused fully trained, battle-hardened wizards to fear to even speak his name. Quirrell wanted to unleash him again on this absurd, pathetic, broken, confused, third-party, inconsistent, beautiful Plane. "Because he'll hurt my friends. Because it's the right thing to do." It should have felt more profound, more impressive, changing one's alignment. Milo felt vaguely cheated.

  "Go forth and kick ass, my master."
