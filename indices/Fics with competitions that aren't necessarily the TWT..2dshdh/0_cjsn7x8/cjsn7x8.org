The Lie I've Lived by JBern.\\
Temporal Beacon by willyolioleo (wip) heavy HHr though.\\
Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs (wip) multi pairings are a major plot point.\\
pretty sure Partially Kissed Hero by Perfect Lionheart (abd) has one but it's been a while. also it's HHrLL.\\
Honestly Harry Series by Captain Compass is just getting into year four but I think his TWT is going to be new or at least I hope. it's HHrGW.

most of those are ship focused unfortunately. JBern will be you best bet.
