Well since you're here, allow me a moment to continue the praise!\\
Hallows and Pathos was one of the first Master of Death fics that I really enjoyed and actually kicked me off on opening up a bookmark folder specifically for them.\\
I giggled and laughed my ass off throughout India, Life of Brian, and Anagram.\\
I bought the first three Dresden Files books the last time I was in the US, but they got packed away when I got deployed the first time and haven't come back out. Once I get around to picking them up, I'm looking forward to reading Lost Soul. I could probably read it without the background, but I'd rather be able to appreciate all the references I'd miss without it, so that's sitting in my To Read folder for now.

But yeah, I love your work. Keep it up!
