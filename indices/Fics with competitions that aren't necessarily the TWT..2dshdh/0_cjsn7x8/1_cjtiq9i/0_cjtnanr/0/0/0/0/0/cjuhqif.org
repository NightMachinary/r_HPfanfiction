I'm very flattered to hear that you enjoyed my stories. Some of the ones you mention are some of my less read (though most favorite) pieces.

/Anagram/ was actually the result of a bet (I forget with whom--probably jbern, nonjon, or SomeGuyFawkes).

While I have a couple of fanfiction stories on the back burner (a sequel to /Whispers/ that's nearly complete; also, I have a novella length HP + Hunger Games/Battle Royale fusion that's nearly complete--were it posted, it'd be topical for this thread as well), most of my writing time of late is being spent on original fiction and watching my novels languish in slush piles and agents' Inboxes. I will get back to it though.

Edit: sentence got cut off. oops.
