I just finished reading this amazing fanfic called hunted by bex-chan. It's amazing. It's a dramione story and I usually don't read dramione but this one was fantastic. It's about how Hermione and Draco try to solve mysterious deaths of their old classmates. It's not only a good romance story but also an amazing criminal. The author has also written the most popular story in fanfiction.net called isolation. You should definitely read them if you haven't already.
