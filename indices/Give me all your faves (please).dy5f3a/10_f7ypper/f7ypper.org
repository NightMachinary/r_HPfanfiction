Redeemed Dudley, Harry is a good parent and much Snape history needs to be researched.

Snape makes friends with a portrait in the Slytherin Common room, and the rest is history. Also because of unconventional means of time travel. The story has slash on it, but that's not the main point of interest about it. Instead, it has an extremely well-researched history from the times of Founders and a very bad arse defence against the dark arts professor.
