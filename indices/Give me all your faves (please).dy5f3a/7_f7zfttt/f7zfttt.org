Some of my recent favourites:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817/chapters/36799368][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] linkao3(15809817) Remus/Sirius, post-Deathly Hallows, AU where they both survive the War. A really interesting take on their relationship and how the wizarding world dealt with the aftermath of a brutal war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running on Air]] linkao3(3171550) Harry/Draco, post-Deathly Hallows. Draco has gone missing, and Harry is the Auror assigned to find him. Probably the most beautiful slow burn I've ever read. As a result of this fic I can't help myself staring at my husband's wrists when he drives?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6246406/chapters/14311300][Not From Others]] linkao3(6246406) the events of Deathly Hallows from Ginny's point of view, canon-compliant. I normally go for AUs/alternate takes, but this is where I go for a canon-compliant fix. I recommend the author's one-shots and missing Hogwarts moments too!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16405130/chapters/38403062][Grow Young with Me]] linkao3(16405130) not completed, but recently updated! Harry/OC, post-Deathly Hallows. I love stories with original muggle characters, and this is by far my favourite. The most recent chapter made my heart SING.
