I think the mods should consider putting up a sticky called "Favorite Fics of HPFANFICTION".

--------------

For this type of requests, I like to link the [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/htmlview?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app][list of most recommended fics]] on this sub from 2011 to 2018, and [[https://hpffrec.hackesta.org/][the HPFanfiction Recommender]] that lets you search for more recent popular fics and authors.

Among the Top 20, my personal favorites are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is obviously the most popular one by a wide margin. This â€˜Harry' thinks he's Voldemort, acts like Voldemort, has the power of Voldemort, but he only wants to teach DADA forever.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is my favorite postwar fic. Harry and his friends finally had it enough and declared war on the incorrigible Ministry and Wizengamot. They began with vigilante killings of Death Eaters who got off again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is a dark war epic set in an extreme AU. It's one of the very few fics that has Harry raised by his own parents, but he actually turns out to be a lot more vicious than in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855), is Harry time travel to 1975. He teams up with Bellatrix and changes a lot of things. This Harry is war hardened veteran, and Bellatrix, despite following Harry, is by no means a paragon of virtue. But it's fun watching her in action.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994), is another long war epic. This Hermione forms her own guerrilla group and becomes a very effective killer of rank and file Death Eaters. But Harry and Ron are not slacking off either, as they will come into their roles later in the story.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]], linkffn(6892925), is a dimensional travel. Here, badly traumatized Harry, Hermione, Luna, and Neville are thrown into a new world where things have become very different. They are not particularly dark, but they kill Death Eaters without blinking their eyes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is a major AU in which Harry was raised by Sirius in France. He went to Beauxbaton along with Neville and the Weasleys, and was personally taught by Dumbledore there. In 1999, Ron volunteers to go spying in Britain, where he meets a loyal Malfoy enforcer, Hermione.

Here are some newer fics, finished after 2017 and thus not making it to the top 20:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13133746/1/Daphne-Greengrass-and-the-Importance-of-Intent][Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent]], linkffn(13133746): One of the best Harry/Daphne fics, no bashing, no power fantasies, great characterizations, and a very adorable Astoria.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12407442/1/Luna-Lovegood-and-the-Dark-Lord-s-Diary][Luna Lovegood and the Dark Lord's Diary]], linkffn(12407442): Luna got the Diary.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13052802/1/Petunia-Evans-Tomb-Raider][Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider]], linkffn(13052802): Petunia is a squib and a BAMF archeologist. She, Sirius, Bill, and Fleur did the heavy lifting against Voldemort in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): Probably the best canon compliant postwar fic. It depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, and quite unique as it's narrated from their Muggle neighbor's POV.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11933512/1/The-House-of-Potter-Rebuilt][The House of Potter Rebuilt]], linkffn(11933512): An unique indy!Harry fic with a quite original plot. The "House" here actually means an actual building.
