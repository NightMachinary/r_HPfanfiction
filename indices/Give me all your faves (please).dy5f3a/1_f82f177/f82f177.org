Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux; Grow Young With Me; Renascentia; Negligentia; Black Luminary; The Merging; Prince of the Dark Kingdom; 11160991; 9666689) are all the ones I can think of off the top of my head. Completion statuses are as follows:

- Accidental Horcrux is complete with an abandoned sequel
- Grow Young With Me updates very slowly, but is always worth the wait
- Renascentia is complete, as, I believe, is its sequel *edit: turns out its sequel /isn't/ complete, after all*
- Negligentia is a long one shot with a pair of sequels that I honestly don't recommend
- I feel like Black Luminary hasn't updated in a while, but I also haven't been on the lookout, since I decided to wait for the third year to finish before going back to it
- The Merging is one chapter and two epilogues away from completion, but hasn't updated in over a year, but it's gone longer than that between updates before, so I'm not worried
- Prince of the Dark Kingdom is straight up dead, as is Rent a Hero
- A Beautiful Collision hasn't updated in years, but the author has said they might go back to it someday, and they're still active on the site.

Bonus anti recommendation even though no one asked: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is often praised for its worldbuilding, but because the writer is dreadful at writing organic exposition, it's presented by having characters talk unnaturally at each other about history and politics in way more detail than anybody ever gives in casual conversation.
