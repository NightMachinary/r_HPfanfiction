Top 5 Summaries:

1. Meaning of One is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now.
2. Before I read, Meaning of One, Nightmares of Futures Past was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.
3. Harry is a Dragon, was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco.
4. This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.
5. I love the concept of Forced Maturity. It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a couple things I take issue with like the whole age line thing and the fact it's abandoned after the end of CoS. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and the Hinny because I'm trash.
