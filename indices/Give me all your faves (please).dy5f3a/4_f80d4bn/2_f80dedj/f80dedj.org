  It was the year 2003 and Wizarding Britain was finally starting to heal from the wounds of the Second Wizarding War. However, a growing number of Dark wizarding activities across Europe and political impasse in the Wizengamot threatened to destroy the fragile society once and for all. But who was the enemy? Was it just the remnant supporters of Voldemort or was it the rise of a new Dark Lord? 23-year-old Deputy Head Auror Harry Potter tried to get to the bottom of this mystery but there was simply not enough time. There was simply nothing he could do to save the world at this point... Unless he could go back in time and stem the tides... This is a journey of family, of friendship, of self-discovery, and, as always with Harry Potter, a healthy dose of world-saving.(Master of Death Harry Potter/ Rebirth/ Time Travel Fix-It/ Marauders Era)Weekly to biweekly updates on Friday/ Saturday. Inspired by Tsume Yuki's "Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is" and with her expressed permission, this is the author's fiction re-imagined.Link: [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is]

  'Da Capo al Fine', an Italian musical term that means "from the beginning". Akira Kurusu returns home and awakens in the Velvet Room with an offer to sit at the board, to play the game not as a pawn, but as a player. To correct past wrongs, to move where before he had been frozen, to risk it all in order to win a better future for them all. "Sign me up."

  He gaped at the manager, “Potsu-san quit?” he blurted in shock. The man nodded, looking miffed, “What happened Kurusu? He was one of my best workers and today he just handed his uniform in and said he was leaving, wouldn't even offer an explanation. Did he say anything to you? You were working with him today.” He swallowed and shook his head in bewilderment. “He -- didn't say anything to me. We barely spoke, to be honest,” he explained faintly. Was this because of Morgana? He seemed unusually spooked when he saw him, was he maybe afraid of cats? No, Morgana said that sometimes Potsu fed him in the back alley when he was on break and the cat was stretching his legs. So what had set him off? He had seemed fine until -- until Morgana... ...Could he have heard Morgana speaking?

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.
