Keeping this short...

The Green Girl linkffn(11027125) is one of my favorites to reread. It's just plain fun!

The same goes for Harry Potter and the Connection Reversed linkffn(9132770).

And a really great atmospheric fic with a super interesting premise is Quoth the Raven, Nevermore linkffn(6652537).
