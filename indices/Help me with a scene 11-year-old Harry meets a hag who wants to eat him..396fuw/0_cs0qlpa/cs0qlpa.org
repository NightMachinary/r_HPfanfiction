Important questions...

Is Voldebook helpful in either the "no! I refuse to have a /hag/ do what my elder self wasn't able to... that would just be /embarrassing/" or the "No eating my host! mine! not yours!" sort of way?

Is Harry allowed to point out that he's incredibly skinny and that he has a fat muggle cousin who would make a much better meal? Can they be surprised when whatever magic they have shows him being truthful about happily handing over his cousin?

Why is Harry running in the first place? is Tom driving/manipulating him onward? Is Harry trying to get away from a meddlesome old coot that wants to remove Harry's friend from his head? Is Harry trying to protect his friends by putting distance between himself and the Basilisk before the next round of possession? ... Can Voldebook possess Harry at all given the nature of the blood protections in your story and what we know happens when Voldemort tries it in book 5?

You're aiming for funny... but what brand of humor? Harry has a sarcastic streak on occasion in the books if memory serves.

... Is voldebook at the point where he can create the shadowy projection version of teenaged Tom? or maybe a mental projection only Harry can see? there's some potential humor in conversations between Harry and Tom where the Hags can't see/hear Tom, while he and Harry argue about how useless and unhelpful the other is being right now. Or Tom leaning over the pot they plan to boil harry in and wrinkling his nose while tsk tsking the Hags about their poor cauldron cleaning habits.
