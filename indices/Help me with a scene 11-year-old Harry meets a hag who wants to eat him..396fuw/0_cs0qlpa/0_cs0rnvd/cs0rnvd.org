Definitely the "No eating my host, I was using him first!" variety of relationship. Harry can be possessed because the diary is sort of using a mental space that the soul fragment in his scar had hollowed out.

His main reason for running away is that Dumbledore thinks he's like Quirrell- his body too much changed by possession to survive without Voldemort- and consequently doesn't see any choice but to kill Harry to stop Voldemort.

Actually the bit about eating his fat cousin instead is brilliant and very appropriate in a "Billy-Goats-Gruff" type way. Definitely working it in there, thanks!

As for funny, any type of funny I can get, I'm trying to work on my humor (or, you know, /your/ humor ;D) as much as I can. At this point Harry is pretty innocent, though, so if the hag wanted to, for instance, imply something sexual it could be there, but would fly over Harry's head.
