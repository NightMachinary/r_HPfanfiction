  At this point Harry is pretty innocent, though, so if the hag wanted to, for instance, imply something sexual it could be there, but would fly over Harry's head.

But /not/ Tom's... Tom would understand what the Hag was implying. His response comes down to which version of Tom you're running. Has Tom's time as an abused boy in the orphanage, or as the byproduct of a love potion, put him off sex and physical contact etc entirely? Tom making retching noises in Harry's head at the Hag's implications. Or is he a teenage boy with all that usually entails? Was Bella a useful follower... or all that /and/ a good lay? Tom rolling his eyes at the Hag and using Harry's 12 year old voice to reply "I've had/seen/done/etc better" bringing the Hag up short. OR Harry replying to Tom out loud, "What do you mean we've had better? Better what?" or Tom says if he really wants to know what the Hag meant they can hire a hooker after they escape, but all the Hag hears is harry's reply of "What's a hooker?" (or whatever brits called them in the 40's if you want accuracy)

  Harry can be possessed because the diary is sort of using a mental space that the soul fragment in his scar had hollowed out.

But can Tom take direct control and forcibly move Harry against his will? Or is he limited to making suggestions that all appear oh so very reasonable at the time. ... Does the Hag know about Tom? or is it a shock when Harry/Tom trade off control and his posture shifts before Tom sets everything on fire?

  Definitely the "No eating my host, I was using him first!" variety of relationship. Harry can be possessed because the diary is sort of using a mental space that the soul fragment in his scar had hollowed out. His main reason for running away is that Dumbledore thinks he's like Quirrell- his body too much changed by possession to survive without Voldemort- and consequently doesn't see any choice but to kill Harry to stop Voldemort.

So Harry and Tom are a team in a way? A voice of experience and the Brat-Who-Can't-Seem-to-Just-Die-Already both relying on the other to see their existence make it to tomorrow. Harry trying to sell the Hag his cousin, while Tom's mental projection scoffs and rolls his eyes muttering about the Billy Goats Gruff. Then Tom's eyes widening when he sense's Harry's bafflement at the reference because Harry never heard the story while growing up in a /cupboard/ with /the muggles./ Tom never calls them the Dursleys, insisting names are for people, not insects.

This is fun, I should look into doing this more often.
