Yes you should, you're very good at it!

Tom would understand... what a teenage boy in the early 1940's would understand. It was a more decorous time, and between his classmates looking to him for leadership and getting glimpses of his dark side that showed them he wasn't someone to be crossed... I don't see him discussing things or joking around with his peers the way a normal teen would. And he's had to be very careful in Hogwarts to appear non-threatening. So if the reference was very modern or very shocking, he might very well not get it, or be shocked or disgusted by it.

Bella's much younger, 16-year-old Tom has never met her. Up 'til now he's directed most of his energy towards hate, revenge, learning dark magic, and learning all he can while keeping up perfect grades and manipulating everyone he can. He had physical urges, but he wasn't interested in any kind of a romantic relationship or entanglement because he wouldn't want to take anyone else's feelings into account. As a sociopath he might be very interested in if any power could be gained through sex, or learning what all the fuss is about, but he's not yet confident enough in his "obliviate" to seduce or rape a classmate and trust they won't remember anything later. Emotionally he's sort of stunted and a prude in the "girls are silly and illogical and have cooties" way that you actually see in many of the novels of the 1940's written by men.

Yeah, Harry and Tom are kind of stuck as a team. Tom is pretty up front that he doesn't care about Harry but will take care of him since he needs a host, and Harry is resigned to the fact that he doesn't really have a choice.

In this particular scene, Tom can't take over Harry. Sometimes he can, but it requires Harry to be either very calm (almost putting himself into a trance) or very weak (starved or hurt in some way). I want Harry to show some fighting/escaping ability of his own to build on later, though as a first year he doesn't know many useful spells, so accidental magic may be what gets him away in the end.
