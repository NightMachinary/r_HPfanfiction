I didn't mean that Tom would be familiar with Bella, just that some decisions affect how you play both Voldemort and Voldebook. Bella was the first example of a woman that would interact with Voldemort that came to mind.

  As a sociopath he might be very interested in if any power could be gained through sex, or learning what all the fuss is about, but he's not yet confident enough in his "obliviate" to seduce or rape a classmate and trust they won't remember anything later.

16 year old Tom was described as very charismatic... he doesn't really need to force himself on a willing participant. But yes, I imagine casual relations would interest him... and then a girl attempting to make a relationship out of it would just get a confused expression as a response.

If the Hag(s?) never bring it up then I doubt Tom would. Harry certainly wouldn't unless via accidental double-entendre or pun.

also. STRUMPET! always struck me as a funny word. might be how Tom describes them, causing Harry to giggle then ask "whats a strumpet?" inadvertently insulting the Hag.

--------------

If Tom can't control Harry directly, then he'd probably be... verbally displeased with this... in the background.

...speaking of verbal... this IS book 2. aka "the year Harry freaked everyone out with foreign language skills" Maybe the Hag has a snake? Having her pet snake start strangling her while he makes his escape would be within Harry's skill set. It'd be weird if the snake either was, or has met, the snake Harry freed from the zoo, but could lead to a number of various "what the hell are you/he talking about" conversations between Tom and Harry on the way out the door when the snake starts talking about repaying his debt.... in spanglish no less.

Also, when backed into a corner Harry has already established a knack for casual violence in burning Quirellmort to ash. Add Tom into the mix and set the oven to 'comedy', and his escape may as well involve Harry accidentally murdering the Hags in some spectacularly gruesome fashion that makes Tom uncomfortable, temporarily causing them to trade their traditional conversation roles.
