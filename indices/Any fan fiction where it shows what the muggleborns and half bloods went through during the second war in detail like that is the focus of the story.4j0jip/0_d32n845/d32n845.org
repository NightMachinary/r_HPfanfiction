Very little is written from their POVs of year 7, which, imho, is a huge gap in the fandom.

*Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994), is the first fic I found that focused on an organized resistance by Muggleborns. However, the story is AU and begins after year 4. Also, Hermione was the leader of the resistance.
