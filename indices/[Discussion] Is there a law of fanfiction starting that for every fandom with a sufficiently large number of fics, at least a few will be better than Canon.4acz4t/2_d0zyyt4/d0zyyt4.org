None of the fanfictions I've read comes even close in terms of characterization, creativity, world building, and writing quality of the original books.

But I have serious beef with some plot elements in the books. The most major one was that adults (Voldemort, Death Eaters, Dumbledore, OoTP, the Ministry) were INTENTIONALLY DUMBED DOWN so the kids could play heroes. The first two books, though fun to read, were the most guilty in that aspect. Later books were better, but JKR had already painted herself into a corner by then.

As a result, I found several fics that I enjoy more than the books. For example, [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/wholestory.php?no=30822&format=choose][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] has excellent characterization, writing, and world building. I would say its plot is significantly better than canon. The Dumbledore in that story is brilliant, and his struggles against Tom Riddle have been well explained.
