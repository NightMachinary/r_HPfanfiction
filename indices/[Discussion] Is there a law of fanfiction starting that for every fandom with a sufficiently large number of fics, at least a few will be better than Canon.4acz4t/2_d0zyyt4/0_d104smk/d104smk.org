  The most major one was that adults (Voldemort, Death Eaters, Dumbledore, OoTP, the Ministry) were INTENTIONALLY DUMBED DOWN so the kids could play heroes.

I agree with you. My least favorite part about the series is how a lot of the adults are either mindbogglingly incompetent or criminally negligent.
