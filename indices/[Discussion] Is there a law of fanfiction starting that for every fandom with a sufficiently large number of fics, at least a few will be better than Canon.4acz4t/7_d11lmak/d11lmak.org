Well, as you said, a great deal of it comes down to personal preference.

I, for example, like HP a fair bit, but enjoy fanfictions based on it much more than I enjoy the original work. I like in depth worldbuilding, I like competent and intelligent adults, I like creative and varied magic, I like fascinating characters with depth and moral shades (Shoutout to my man Snape, and probably Dumbledore too). Canon was interesting enough to read through once, but it lacked in too many areas that I personally find important.

However, the friend who introduced me to fanfiction loves HP canon, and there will never be a fanfic that surpasses canon for him.

In the end, the only thing you can say for sure is that we have enough fanfics in the HPfanfic-verse now, that for most people, there will be at least one fanfic they enjoyed more than canon.

Doesn't mean it's inherently better, but neither does it mean it's worse. (I get irrationally upset when people insist that nothing can be better than canon because it's canon.)
