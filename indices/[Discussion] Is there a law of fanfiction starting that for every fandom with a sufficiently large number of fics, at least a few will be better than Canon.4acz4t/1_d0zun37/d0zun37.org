A complicating factor is that Rowling's work isn't uniform in quality. Some of the books in the Harry Potter series are quite good (e.g. /Chamber of Secrets/) while others aren't, to put it gently (e.g. /Deathly Hallows/). If you want a fanfic which is better than the best of canon or canon as a whole then you have a much higher bar than if you're just looking for fanfic which is better than /some/ of canon.

Anyway, I'd suspect that a fair number of fanfics are better than the worst of Rowling's series while few if any match her best work.
