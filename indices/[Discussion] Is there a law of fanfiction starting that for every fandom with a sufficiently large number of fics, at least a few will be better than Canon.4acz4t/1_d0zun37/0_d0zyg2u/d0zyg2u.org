That part about some books being better than others comes down to opinions, though. Everyone has their own opinion on what book is the best (although I do agree with you about Deathly Hallows).

About the discussion itself: it comes down to too many factors to come up with a law like OP is suggesting. Writing a novel allows you an incredible amount of freedom, with infinite possibilities on how the story would go. So you've got an infinite set of possibilities for the original novel, and then you've got to take into account how varying the fanfictions about that story can be (another very large number).

In the end you would have a very dubious formula that would probably have an answer that's way too small to be taken seriously. It's just not feasible.
