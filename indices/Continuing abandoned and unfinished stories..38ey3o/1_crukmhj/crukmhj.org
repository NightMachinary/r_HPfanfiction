I'm still posting two stories [[https://youtu.be/1M8vei3L0L8?t=29s][because]]

First one, and probably the worst abandon ever (for me at least):

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2737363/13/Twists-of-Fate][Twists of Fate]]

The second is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10394662/11/Children-of-Azkaban][Children of Azkaban]] which is maybe abandoned, I don't really know. Maybe shes just updating reeeeeeeally slowly.

I'm a horrible ghost writer as I can't even follow my own style half of the time. So no, I won't participate. But I support the idea, greatly.
