This is nothing less than plagiarism. Taking someone's idea without their permission is not okay, neither morally nor legally. Silence is not consent; it's not enough to message and continue if you get no reply. Only explicit and publicly given permission will do.

There are three main reasons why it's morally wrong, where HP fanfiction is, in general, not:

1. JKR has given her explicit blanket permission for HP fanfic to be written, which these authors have not done.

2. JKR's version remains the authoritative version of Harry Potter, regardless of what fanfictions are written about it. Canon exists. This is not the case with fanfiction vs. fanfiction. By taking over someone else's fanfiction you rob them of creative control over their idea.

3. JKR's works were published in complete form, so you were never robbing her of the opportunity to publish her idea before the alternative versions got to be made. She didn't just have priority in terms of authority in the universe, she also had priority in time.

Essentially it comes down to whether or not you believe a person should retain creative control over their original ideas. And just because it's fanfiction, it doesn't mean it doesn't contain original ideas unique to that author. Fanfics are only partly derivative.

There have been painful examples of such plagiarism in the fandom in the past. The most glaring example is this:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2762511/1/A-Shattered-Prophecy][Original]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2913149/1/The-Darkness-Within][Take-over]]

Original has 1000 reviews, the take-over has 7000. The take-over was published before the original was finished, while it was on hiatus and the author temporarily MIA, and robbed the original of its readership. Most people now have never even heard of A Shattered Prophecy, whereas The Darkness Within is one of the better known fics in the fandom. Project Dark Overlord completely lost any kind of control over his idea, and he lost the opportunity to create his authoritative version before others stole it.
