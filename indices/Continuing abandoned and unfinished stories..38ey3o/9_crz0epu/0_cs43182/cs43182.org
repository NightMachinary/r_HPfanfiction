1. How about other works then? JKR might have given her express permission, but other authors have not. However, many take a silence on the matter as implicit permission. Whenever a work is forbidden (Anne Rice, Orson Scott Card, etc.), there are measures taken to alleviate the production and spread of such fanfiction. Hell, there have been some authors whose opinion on the matter (George R.R. Martin) has mostly been ignored. [On a side note, I think he changed his position, but he was firmly against fanfiction for a very long time].

2. Fanfiction that is spun off can still remain the authoritative version. All that is required is credit. This alone allows for the work to remain the "initial" idea. As long as it is clear, there is no problem. In the linked fanfiction "takeover," it is clearly mentioned in the disclaimer of each chapter that it is derivative. It could have also been included in the summary, but I'm of the opinion that it is sufficient.

3. No they were not. JKR's work was published over the course of seven books. This probably actually allowed for her work to become more popular fanfiction-wise, because the breaks between books were ripe periods of fanfiction. The wait between the Goblet of Fire and the Order of the Phoenix spawned a lot of fanfiction, and there are anecdotes of fake ebooks that fooled people into thinking some fanfiction was the Order of the Phoenix. People took it upon themselves to write alternate endings, alternate books, etc. She did not really have the priority in time, as many works sought to outpace her delve into parts of the world/timeline that she had not explored yet.

Your summary of your points (creative control over works) is a vast oversimplification and a strawman argument. Of course the author should be able to retain creative control over their works. But having derivative works isn't necessarily a loss of creative control, especially if these derivative works are not for profit and in the name of fandom. I don't feel we should encourage the pointless demonisation of derivative works, especially in a community which focuses around the enjoyment of a type of derivative works.
