Of course every attempt should be made to get the author's consent. I'm having a hard time understanding why this is a problem as long as they try to get author approval and give upfront and obvious credit. Isn't it just fanfiction of fanfiction? That lady made tons of money off 50 Shades which was a Twilight fanfiction, but these guys won't be making money off it and aren't even trying to pass it off as something original.
