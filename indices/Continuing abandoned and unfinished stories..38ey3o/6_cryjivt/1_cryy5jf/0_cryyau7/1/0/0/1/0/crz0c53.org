I don't see why the size of the fic's fanbase matters. If they've read the story, then they'll know it isn't the original author writing it and I don't think they'd even read it. If they did, it'd probably be too different in style for them to read anyway.

This is also a forum that's going to be seen by what, maybe 1000 people tops? It seems like they're only talking about it on [[/r/hpfanfiction]] (<5000 subscribers). To be honest, I expect it to fizzle out.
