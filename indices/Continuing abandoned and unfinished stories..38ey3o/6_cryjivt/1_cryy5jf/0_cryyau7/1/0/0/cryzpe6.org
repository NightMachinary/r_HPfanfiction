June 23rd would be an interesting day to try that one out! Hope you don't faint at the sight of blood, needles, or scary instruments.

I'm not trying to be malicious or anything and I'm not even participating in this. I just don't get where you're coming from. If someone found my ancient, abandoned Zelda fanfiction and wanted to continue it, I wouldn't give a hoot. Especially if they got permission and said "So and so wrote this story back in 2004 and you can find it at this site. They wrote chapters 1-12. They gave me permission to continue writing it but it does not reflect the ending they would have written."

To me, the fanfiction I was writing was derivative, so why should I care if they do the same to me? I would feel hypocritical if I didn't allow it. It would also be clearly stated who wrote what, so I wouldn't be worried about people mistaking it for my voice nor tarnished.

Obviously this isn't how everyone feels, which is why I asked for a clarification on your opinion.
