Personally speaking, and not the legal issues I already explained:

Half of my problem is that they're talking about stories my friends wrote, and I know my friends well enough to know they'd be very /very/ not okay with this.

The other half of my problem is that they don't /care/ about getting permission. If they receive silence into their PMs, if they even send them, they feel they have the right to go right ahead. The stories they're talking about have pre-existing (and often substantial) fanbases, it isn't your old abandoned Zelda fanfic.

Authors have copyright protections specifically because of this kind of predatory behavior. They're not doing it out of love of the stories, they're doing it because they can [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?p=822999][barely write]] themselves and want to piggyback on better stories.

A line is going to be drawn, and this behavior is going to be lumped in with the thinly veiled plagiarism it is.
