Think of a fanfiction as an unfinished painting, that begins with a specific vision. Now imagine you go on vacation and come back and a neighbor you don't even know has come into your house and smeared poop all over the canvas.

It's their canvas and their vision, and you haven't got a right to it whatsoever. Abandoned or not. The rights of the author trump the flighty desires of fans, and the mischievous intention of unoriginal authors who can't come up with their own material.
