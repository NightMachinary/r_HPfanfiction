Fanfiction is based on the very grounds of "finishing paintings." Fanfiction is at its most popular when series are unfinished/ongoing and the world still has much to explore. I'm not sure how you can be a consumer or writer of fanfiction and knock on derivative work.

As long as the derivative work is clearly marked as such and credits the original, there should be no issue. Of course, if the author explicitly forbids it, a la Anne Rice, their wishes should be respected. But we shouldn't foster a culture where writers of derivative works put their works on a status higher than that of the works they are deriving off of.
