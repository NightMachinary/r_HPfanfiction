Ron/Lavender started not because Ron liked her, but because Ginny made this big deal in the hall (or maybe it was the common room) about "Don't judge me for who /I'm/ kissing when /you've/ never kissed anybody!" So then Ron went, "Oh yeah?! I'll show you!"

On one hand, Poor Ron because Lavender was so clingy. On the other hand, Poor Lavender because Ron was only with her to prove a point. The "point" being that he had deep-seated sibling rivalry issues and was determined to out-snog Ginny no matter what.
