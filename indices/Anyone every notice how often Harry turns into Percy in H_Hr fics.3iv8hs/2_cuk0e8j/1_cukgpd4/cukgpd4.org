I'm not a harmony shipper, but what I don't get is that so many people on this sub have no problem sharing their insight that Harry/Hermione won't work based on a few lines in canon, while they're perfectly okay with canon pairings, even though Ron and Hermione have NO common interests whatsoever and aside from the last few pages in the book, all they do is fight pretty much (and no, that's not attraction). For them to work, one has to be massively OOC and from the epilogue, I think it's Hermione that's lost most of her personality and ambitions. Although to be fair, Hermione is a bit OOC in the last two books anyway.

Ah well, at least Rowling's admitted that they aren't a good pairing. Although I disagree that they need therapy, they need a divorce (or a rewrite).
