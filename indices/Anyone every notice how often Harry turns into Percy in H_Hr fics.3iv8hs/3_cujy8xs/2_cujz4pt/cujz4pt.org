  There's a little throwaway line in GoF about how only having Hermione as a friend means less fun and more time studying.

It was there to show that Ron was Harry's best friend and Harry preferred spending time with him to spending time with Hermione. It also shows H/Hr is impossible without significantly changing either Harry or Hermione's personality. Harry just doesn't find her fun the way he finds Ron and Ginny to be fun.
