Yeah, I've always said that all Harry/Hermione is inherently OOC. A pairing like Harry/Susan isn't inherently OOC because we don't know Susan well enough to say that she's a bad match for Harry. But with Hermione/Harry, we know full well that they're not a good match. So you can't write an IC Hermione/Harry, even if you pretend the Weasleys don't exist.

Of course, if you're writing an AU where Harry is raised by Remus and has a wildly different personality, maybe you can make it work. But Harry is still OOC relative to canon.
