So then the canon pairings are the only believable pairings that can be written? No one can write a believable Ron/Luna or Hermione/Neville or Harry/Fleur? We weren't talking about what /did/ happen, we were talking about the realm of possibility of what /could/ have believably happened. If we only looked at what did happen, then there wouldn't be any need for fanfiction, since canon's got everything you need. But hey, if you don't agree, that's your prerogative.
