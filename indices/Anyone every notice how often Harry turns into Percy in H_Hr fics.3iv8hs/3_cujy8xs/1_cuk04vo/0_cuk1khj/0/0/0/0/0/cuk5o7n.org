  So then the canon pairings are the only believable pairings that can be written? No one can write a believable Ron/Luna or Harry/Fleur?

Those pairings? IMO no. But yeah non-canon pairings can totally be believably done if you change situations or peoples personality. However, I don't believe that H/Hr could ever believably work without the later happening because in canon, with canon personalities they are incompatible.
