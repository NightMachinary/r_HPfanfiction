Oh yeah, I think I've read that one. I think Harry goes by Hobby to differentiate from the original?

Though, by "Magical Nonhuman" I meant VERY nonhuman, as in not based on humans in any way. To use canon terminology, in Fantastic Beasts (the book, not the movie), Newt talks in the introduction about Beasts - those capable of understanding and shaping Wizarding law - and Beings - unable to understand and/or shape law. House Elves classify as Beings, so not exactly what I was hoping for. Sorry, I should've been more clear.

Edit: Is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11782884/1/Not-even-a-first-chance]] the fic you were talking about?
