Well... I suggest you read the thing. It's not very long. Basically, Herpo was persecuted for being a Parselmouth, and created gigantic killer-snakes because he wanted something /intelligent/ to talk to that would double as a bodyguard unless his often very violent "bullies". As for the Horcrux, if I recall correctly it was again out of fear for his life at the hands of the locals.
