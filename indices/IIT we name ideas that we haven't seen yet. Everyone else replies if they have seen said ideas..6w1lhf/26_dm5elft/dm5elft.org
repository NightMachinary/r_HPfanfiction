Too much obliviation creates a split personality who can access all the locked memories, and most of Harry's childhood magic is so locked away. More is added to this split persona by Lockhart in year 2 before a close encounter with the Dementors breaks the partition and either switches which personality is in front or merges them. Could also result in a regular binary split personality which changes due to circumstance.
