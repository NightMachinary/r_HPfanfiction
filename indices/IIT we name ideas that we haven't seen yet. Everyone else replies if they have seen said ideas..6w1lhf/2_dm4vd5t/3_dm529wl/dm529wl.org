1 kind of happens in Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Harry shows Draco how far muggles have come, how they can heat and cool things, watch moving pictures, AND fly to the moon (the latter of which wizards haven't done, at least in that story). Draco first thinks muggles have found magic. When Harry explains technological advancement, Draco has a small existential crisis over it.
