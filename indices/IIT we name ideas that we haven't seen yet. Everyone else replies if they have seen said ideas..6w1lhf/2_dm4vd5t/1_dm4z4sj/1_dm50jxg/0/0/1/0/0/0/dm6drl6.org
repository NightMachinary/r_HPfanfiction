Realistically it would to im religious but i uswd to be an athiest and even hardcore christians would agree to using "lighter" forms of magic as long as it doesnt conflict with the faith. They could view the verse "suffer not a witch" as "dark" magic only not light magic. Humans are hypocrites afterall
