He hatches a basilisk, and the horcrux hunt starts early, but I'm not 100% Dash (the snake) actually destroys a horcrux.

BTW the story's good in the beginning but Harry doesn't really mature and it turns into a cuddle-fest and low-quality slash-romance fic as it gets on. It's very weird for me to say that having actual smut would be an /improvement/ for it (as it would necessitate a certain level of emotional maturity from Harry and Draco that they don't currently have).
