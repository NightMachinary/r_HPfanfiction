Wrong Boy who lived fic where Harry isn't somehow treated like trash, and ends up supporting his sibling or fight along side them.

Instead of the usual BS about his parent's spoiling the shit out of their child they treat them normally and are a fairly happy childhood.

Then when Voldemort revives himself of course Harry's going to fight.

Bonus points if someone refers to Harry as the Boy/Girl who lived right hand. Just to make the prophecy still match.
