Lily and James don't have just one child; they have 7 in one go, septuplets.

And when Voldemort comes to kill them all ('The seven with the power to vanquish the dark lord approach...'), Lily and James sacrifice themselves as normal, allowing all 7 of the Potter septuplets to live.

...And Sirius hires a fleet of motorbikes for Hagrid to deliver them to the Dursleys, Dumbledore takes extreme measures and arranges a big lottery win so that the Dursleys can move into a bigger house and hire babysitters, and the teachers at school wonder who these seven similar-looking children are and why do they all have mysterious scars?
