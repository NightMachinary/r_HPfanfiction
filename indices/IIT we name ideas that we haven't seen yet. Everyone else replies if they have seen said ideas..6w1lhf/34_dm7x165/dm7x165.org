- A story where the pranking isn't dickish.\\
- A long story about a student going into a different realm, or something similar. (Writing something like that right now, but it's short so far and idk if i'll finish it).\\
- A fic that explores the fact that the horcruxes are sentient, and are locked into objects without a body for many years. (This makes how sane the diary horcrux amazing)\\
- Diary!Tom Riddle gets a body somehow, and joins the school the next year as a student or a teacher.\\
- A fic that explores magic deeply, I was hoping methods of rationality would do this but it was mostly ranting for a while and then jumping to the answer.
- Where pureblood families all have some sort of magic that is for their line. Like Potters would have something to do with pottery, Bones would perhaps have something to do with necromancy or burials, etc.\\
- Voldemort manages to steal the philosophers stone.\\
- Dumbledore isn't the current headmaster, but after (or during) the war he decided to become minister instead.\\
- Harry Potter (or someone else) time travels to Riddles time and becomes friendly with Riddle but it doesn't turn into a relationship between them.\\
