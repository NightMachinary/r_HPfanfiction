Under Veritaserum, Sirius Black pleads his innocence, that he never betrayed the Potters and that Peter was the real Secret Keeper...but Peter Pettigrew under Veritaserum pleads /his/ innocence and claims Sirius (using the loophole that if a Secret Keeper dies, everyone they told the secret to becomes a Secret Keeper in turn) was the real traitor and forced Peter to tell Voldemort the secret or die so that Sirius could tell.
