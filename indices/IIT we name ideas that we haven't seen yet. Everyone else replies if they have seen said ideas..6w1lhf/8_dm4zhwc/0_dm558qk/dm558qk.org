Heh. It's not a Harry Potter fanfiction, but one of the episodes of Gargoyles, Season 2 Episode 5, has Puck granting Demona's wish to 'get rid of /that/ human', Elisa Maza, by turning Elisa into a /gargoyle/ (thus getting rid of the 'human')...and transforming every other human in New York City into gargoyles for good measure.
