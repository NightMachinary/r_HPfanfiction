Just had another though: Organic Transfiguration, aka Fleshcrafting. One could specialize in human transfigurations and act as a plastic surgeon for wizards, or one could mass produce transfigured animals, and since transfigured animals act as you mean them to, not as the animal naturally does, it's easy to make a loyal horde. Just get some raw materials and whip up an incubator. Longer and more complex, but much more highly tailored to your needs, and scales well.
