Whenever I think of Wormtail, I think of an angry, resentful, foul man who turned bitter when his world was moving forward. He was one of the best. He was an animagus at 15, a Marauder, and a member of the Order. Yet it was James, Sirius and Remus who got all the glory, all the fun, and... the family. James and Lily started a family. I think that is what sent Peter over the edge. He felt useless, powerless, like his acomplishments were worth nothing. Then he gets captured, and Voldemort sees into his mind. He sees the anger, the pain, the sadness at being left behind by his three friends... and then its over. Voldemort turns him.
