A humanising and logical Wormtail fic, where an untalented and unintelligent young man justifies his initial place in the Maurauders, is such good friends with the rest of the gang that they trust him more than Sirius and Lupin, and where there is a well justified reason for him turning to the dark side that is appropriately tragic.
