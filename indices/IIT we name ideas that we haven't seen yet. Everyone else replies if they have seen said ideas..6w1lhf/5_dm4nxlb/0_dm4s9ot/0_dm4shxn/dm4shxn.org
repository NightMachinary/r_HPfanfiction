What I really want to see is a well done Necromancer fic. Ripping souls out of the afterlife, imprisoning the souls of the freshly dead inside their own corpses, ghasts, ghouls, lichdom, the whole caboodle. Inferi, imo, are a poor man's necromancy. They're nothing but transfiguration-animated corpses with a few spells thrown in for durability.
