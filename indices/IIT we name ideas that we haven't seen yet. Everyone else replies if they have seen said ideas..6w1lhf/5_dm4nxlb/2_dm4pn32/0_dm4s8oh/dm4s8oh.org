Been a while since I read it, but there was a bone knife that was called a Death Focus, used to resonate with the magic released in ritual sacrificial murders. It radiated an unnatural aura, to the point where even looking at it, you could tell it was something evil.

Pretty much just most of the Voodoo magic in that fic. Pretty grisly at times.
