Hmm...what was that fic where Dumbledore and Harry went back in time together? 'Mysterious Thing, Time' by Blueowl I think.

There's a brief scene where Voldemort tries to create a horcrux with Nagini while he has Harry's blood in his veins (you know, from a certain resurrection ritual), and Harry's residual magic in that blood destroys the horcrux and Nagini while calling it an abomination or somesuch. I don't remember the specifics.

I can also vaguely remember some other fic where more magic was put in the world or something like that. The only bits I can remember were some people who tried to do something to a garden or castle being turned into statues, and that Kreacher along with other house-elves became taller and greener from the increase in magic.
