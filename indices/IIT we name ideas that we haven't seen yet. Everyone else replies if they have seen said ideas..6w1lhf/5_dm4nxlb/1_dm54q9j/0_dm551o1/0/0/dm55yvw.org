That reminds me of a fic. Can't remember what, but Voldemort summoned a demon and allowed it to possess his body, giving him immortality. Or something.

Horcruxes really do need a ramping up, though. As they are now they're just a fetch quest mcguffin. I prefer them as a type of personal immortality, but you really need to raise the consequences and general effects. It's literally a bleeding, ragged edge piece of your very soul. Being a piece of your soul, you would be compelled to place it in a significant spot and check up on it often, just to reassure yourself that it's still there and you're still safe. The horcrux itself would bleed into its surroundings the hatred and malice that created it; The Room of Requirements would become like a miniature haunted house where all the chairs and baubles came alive and tried to murder you. The cave would create the fear potion naturally, no trap installment needed, and you would walk across a frozen lake to get to it. Once the locket is taken, the inferi break through the ice and cut off your escape. The vault would have this giant dragon made out of gold with the chalice in its head or something.

Just needs /more/ for me to take it seriously. Although as it is now, to be fair, making a horcrux is basically taking a hammer and crucifying yourself to the living world with the souls of other people, which is pretty fucking metal when you think about it.

Ramping up the effects also emphasizes the fact that Voldemort is completely psychotic, because having one is taxing enough on the maker and the world around him. And Voldemort made /seven/.
