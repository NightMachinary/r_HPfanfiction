Linkffn(One World) Has Voldemort having used rituals to steal power from demons so he could be a match for Dumbledore, and he teaches Quirrel to do the same. He also has some to to his bidding, and discovers, to his dismay, that a Barbazu is vulnerable to a 9mm sidearm. (He knew the threat of guns, but it was still a shock to see something that freaked out the Flamels taken down by a muggle.)
