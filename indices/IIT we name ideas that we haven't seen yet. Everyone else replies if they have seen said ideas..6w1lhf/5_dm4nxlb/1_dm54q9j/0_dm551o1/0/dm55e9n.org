I once came up with the idea of a horcrux that, rather than just being 'split your soul so you live longer', was actually 'let a demon you summoned take your soul and put it in an object so /it/ can stay forever on the mortal plane (or until its horcrux is destroyed)'.

You know, just a tad more evil than murder-to-make-yourself-immortal; suicide-to-raise-a-super-powerful-insane-destructive-monstrosity.
