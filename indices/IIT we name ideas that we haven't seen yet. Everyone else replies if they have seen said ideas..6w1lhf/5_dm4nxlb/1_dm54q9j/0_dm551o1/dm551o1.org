The interesting thing about Voldemort's horcruxes is that they /are/ what I would call Black magic. He violently tore his soul into pieces to achieve the entirely unnatural effect of undeath. So Voldemort really is the baddest Dark wizard on the block, if we're going by the average Dark wizard. I just can't help but think there are others who have gone even further than he, because Voldemort isn't really a Black magic practitioner, just a Dark wizard who performed a Black ritual several times over.
