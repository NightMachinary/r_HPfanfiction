Oh definitely she is, it's basically canon. But I've read a few where she kinda.. takes it further? Either has a thing about murdering her one night stands and random muggle men in addition, or something. Don't ask me to link any, it's usually background noise in most of the stuff I've come across. Like a "Look, all of our parents are evil" kind of trope for Slytherin characters.
