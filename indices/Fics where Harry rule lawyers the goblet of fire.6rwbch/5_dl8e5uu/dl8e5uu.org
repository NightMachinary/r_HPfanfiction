Mm, I did see one like this once, but I don't remember enough unique stuff about it to google for it.

Um...I think it was one where Harry set up a wizarding tent during the First Task, using technicalities like the judges being forbidden to interfere with the task (lest they lose their magic, of course) but also that he couldn't leave until the task was complete or the tournament ended, but it was possible for the judges to declare the tournament over so they could all leave (but they didn't want to do that), and Harry secretly summoned Dobby to his tent to bring him food so he could stay for ages.

I don't remember it having a continuation, so it might be a one-shot or in a collection.
