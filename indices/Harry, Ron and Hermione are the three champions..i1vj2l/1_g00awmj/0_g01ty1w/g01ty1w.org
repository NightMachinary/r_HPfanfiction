I'm not so sure, the boggart is rather special in that it played on her fears while she was already extremely stressed, she handled the rest of the obstacle course fine, so I can't really see a grindylow getting her, she's beaten those under pressure before.

Maybe if it's something she hasn't seen before, but still unlikely.

Honestly all three of them would easily handle the second task if they found a way to breathe underwater and fail if they didn't.

Harry is fine of course, Dobby and the gillyweed will sort him, notably this happens late enough and with little enough that he certainly can't share (which he honestly might otherwise try if the other two didn't have methods).\\
Ron is pretty screwed, since I imagine he'd have as much luck finding anything for himself as he did fir Harry in the book and he's not got a disguised death eater and house elf to save him.\\
Hermione also failed to find anything in the book, but she might solve the egg sooner (funnily enough not because she's smarter, because she'd start trying sooner, she wanted Harry to solve it sooner but he procrastinated a lot) and therefore might find the book on bubble head charms that must surely be somewhere.\\
Though that brings up the possibility that none of them solve it, since they couldn't in the book. Again Harry dies fine because Crouch will find a way to cheat, he might tell he other two if they admit they don't know, he told Cedric about the dragon and he presumably likes Ron and Hermione a lot more than him.\\
Of course if they're all arguing then perhaps he doesn't.

Harry is going to win of course, mostly due to Crouch's cheating, which may well result in only him beating any task, because they really do seem beyond fourth years, he'd have failed them all without Crouch and that was with Ron and Hermione as allies rather than competition.
