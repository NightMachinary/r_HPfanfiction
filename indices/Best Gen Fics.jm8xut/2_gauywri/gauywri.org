Have you tried going through FFN? There are a lot of really excellent gen fics there that aren't mirrored on AO3. I'll list some you might like below.

The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks (complete, undertones of H/Hr iirc but pretty much nothing concrete at all)

Forging the Sword (abandoned, nothing IIRC)

Subversion (abandoned, some flirting, but not important to the story)

Victoria Potter (in progress, nothing so far)

Pureblood Pretense (in progress, nothing so far, IIRC)

Blood and Water (in progress, nothing so far)

Hogwarts Houses Divided (not Harry-centric, complete, nothing)

Lion, Eagle, Badger, Snake (not Harry-centric, complete, nothing)
