It's a bit hard to answer this question, since Harry being Sorted into Hufflepuff should change a lot of Canon events (did he still tried to get the Stone, did he save Ginny and killed by basilisk, did Sirius still attack Gryfindor's dorm or was Ron with him in Hufflepuff . . .).\\
But assuming nothing change outside of where Harry is Sorted, Harry should have a lot less problem with the House.

The main reason why the Hufflepuff were angry with Harry is because their House tend to be overlooked and for once, they were in the limelight before Harry came and stole their thunder.\\
If Harry was an Hufflepuff from the start, then not only did the House got a lot of attention during the previous years (thanks to Harry shenanigances), but him being the 4th Champion that the House gets even more attention.\\
So, while Harry should still have inter House troubles (people who still think he was the "Heir of Slytherin" 2 years ago, people who prefer Cedric, or Zacharias Smith who is an irredeemable ass . . .), it should be nowhere as heavy as it was in Canon.

Draco would probably still try to distribute his "Potter Stinks" badges, he did it to mess with Harry as an individual after all. I don't know if they would have as much success (Gryffindor would have less reason to be angry with Harry than Hufflepuff in canon after all). But even if they failed, I don't think any House (as a whole) would support Fleur or Cedric. It's a matter of school pride after all, no matter who the Champion is.

Also, Cedric would probably be even more helpful than in Canon. The boy was written as the perfect martyr, so imagine a kind big brother/ mentor for Harry, which would made his death even more devastating for him.
