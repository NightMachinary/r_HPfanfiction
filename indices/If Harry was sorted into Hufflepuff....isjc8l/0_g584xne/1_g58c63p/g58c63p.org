People are influenced by their surroundings. So a Hufflepuff Harry might develop into a very different person over the years since he is around different people. I'd say that Ron does not become Harry's best friend in a Hufflepuff scenario since they don't get to spend nearly as much time together. Hermione, should she survive the troll through accidental magic, would probably become cold, disillusioned, bitter/lonely and a lot less restrained than in canon. There is no fixed recipe on how to write this, but Harry would be vastly different than in canon since he would probably end up in less adventures without a friend who wants out of the shadow of his brothers and another one who can make almost everything happen.
