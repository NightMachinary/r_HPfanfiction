[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]] linkffn(3557725) - I really like how this fic used the idea of preliminary tasks to select a pool of entrants (the tournament stuff doesn't happen until chapter 13)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/918773][Games Almost Played]] linkao3(918773) is a bit of a strange fic, but I liked the alternate task it came up with.
