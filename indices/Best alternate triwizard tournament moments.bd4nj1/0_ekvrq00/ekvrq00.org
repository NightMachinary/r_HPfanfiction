If you want inspiration for different tasks for the champions to complete [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/][Patron]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]] have some good alternative tasks.

If you want canon tasks I have:

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and The Goblet of Fire]]

This one's on portkey, so make sure to download and view the html because the italics are broken on the site.
