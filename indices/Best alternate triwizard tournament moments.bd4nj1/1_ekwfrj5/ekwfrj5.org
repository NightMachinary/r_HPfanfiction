No links, but I remember a fic where Harry tried to boost himself with runes. Cue Tournament, where one of tasks contains some kind of rune(!) pillars that "generate" persons evil counterpart which a contestant needs to defeat.

Harrys twin is absolutely immoral and more clever, and uses his knowledge to hack his pillar, disabling its safeties, so while for other participants it was safe and (moderately) easy, for Harry it was a matter of life and death.
