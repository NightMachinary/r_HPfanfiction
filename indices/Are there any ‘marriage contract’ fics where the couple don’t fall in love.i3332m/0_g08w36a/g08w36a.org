I have found only one fic that's vehemently opposed to marriage contracts:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201691/1/Marriage-in-Mind][Marriage in Mind]], linkffn(5201691): Harry threatens Daphne with psychological torture if the Greengrasses decide to pull it through.

But against marriage laws, quite a few:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/Escape][Escape]], linkffn(11916243): Harry, Hermione, and the Grangers flee to America and direct the war behind the scene from there. McGonagall and Snape are very helpful.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2612901/1/There-s-Always-a-Way][There's Always a Way]], linkffn(2612901): Harry hires a super assassin SI to take out those responsible.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4960536/1/The-Obligatory-Marriage-Law-Fic][The Obligatory Marriage Law Fic]], linkffn(4960536): Harry takes out those responsible by himself.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13098429/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Marriage-Law][Harry Potter and the Marriage Law]], linkffn(13098429): Harry and his supporters stage a coup d'etat and kill those responsible in the Wizengamot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10595005/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Marriage-Law-Revolution][Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution]], linkffn(10595005): Harry and Hermione stage a coup d'etat, execute every supporter of the marriage law, along with every Ministry collaborator of the Voldemort's terror regime. But that's only the start...
