Will do! I've already got about 7,800 words done for the actual chapters with and additional 4,500 words in scenes that may or may not be added in. I've just got to finish the first chapter.

On the other hand, if you would like to check out my other work (shameless self-promo there), I have begun posting a fic where Harry and Theo (who are Auror partners) are sent back in time. I feel like I made it pretty different than a lot of time travel and fix-it fics so far. Let me know if you'd like to read it and I'll link it.
