You know, I did enjoy the play. I know there are so many quibbles with it and overall, I don't think it meshes too well with the established HP canon, but there was something /magical/ about having characters that I have loved for so long living and breathing right in front of me. When Jamie came out on that stage, I thought to myself, /"Harry!"/ and I was all in. My husband and I absolutely loved the Anthony Boyle as Scorpius and he pretty much steals the show. The stage effects were very well done and I still don't know how they managed a couple of them.

I deliberately kept myself ignorant of the story until I saw it, so it was all new to me and I really think that's the best way to do it. I never in my life thought I would get the opportunity to see a smash play with the original cast and by a complete stroke of luck, I was able to.

I loved being in London since the last time I was there was in 2003 with my BFF and that trip didn't go very well--we ended up not speaking for a year. We spent a day with a good friend just walking around. We went from our hotel (Montague on the Garden) down to Trafalgar Square, had coffee at St Martin In The Fields, went to the National Gallery where I got to see Van Gogh's Sunflowers and The Portrait of Arnolfini (my favorite ever) and I even tried to get up on one of Lord Nelson's lions. (Many embarrassing pics of my husband pushing my ass exist.) We went by the Charing Cross, down to the Horseguards, the Eye--just taking all of it in and I've been able to integrate some of those experiences into my writing.

On that trip we did 3 nights in Edinburgh and we have to go back and spend at least a whole week.
