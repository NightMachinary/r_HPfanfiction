I am on ao3 for a long time. I don't need to pay for anything and am actually a bit confused with your question, having never read/heard something like that.

I personally prefer ao3 over ff.net for a few reasons: you can search for tags, filter stuff out and in my opinion the people there are in general a lot nicer than people on ff.net (haven't seen death threats there).
