Exactly yeah. You won't have to pay to use AO3 but you can donate to the cause! AO3 and fan fics really helped me get through the pandemic this year, so I actually donated a few times. It is cool. The money goes toward keeping the servers running and paying the people who work hard to maintain the site. And...you get stickers/water bottles other swag when you donate.
