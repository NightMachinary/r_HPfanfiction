Yes. THAT is the word I wanted.

Any specific suggestions on writing Dumbledore correctly? My current rules are:

#+begin_example
  He doesn't lie, he just tells the truth from 'a certain point of view' when necessary
  He humblebrags/understates a lot, but with the intent of amusing his audience. (::Wears ridiculous robes:: "I daresay I'm somewhat memorable...")
  Will always know when Thomas is up to something, but not necessarily *what* he's up to.
