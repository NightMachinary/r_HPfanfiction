These are elements of Dumbledore I like and use:

His skill as a legilimancer is so practiced, he does it nonverbally by accident, characterized either by twinkling eyes(which is verging on cliché itself) or a hitch of a frown when he finds he's being lied to.

He has a temper, usually held in check but it is there and it is terrible to behold when he lets loose.

He is subtle and not willing to exercise his political power except when forced to. But when forced to, he can reveal he knows a great many secrets that people like Skeeter would commit horrid war crimes to know.

he's addicted to LSD(lemon sherbet drops).

And for those thinking 'well tropes and cliches are the same thing' that's not exactly true. A trope is a storytelling element commonly enough known that if I say "first girl wins" or "You have outlived your usefulness" you know what that means whereas ManipulativeOldBastard!Dumbledore is a cliché in that its an element of a story that is overused, usually by people who rarely know better. They read a story where MOB!Dumbledore is a 'cool' element of the story in an indy!Harry and they decide to write their own story and since they can't see a reason for Harry to be independent, they reuse that element.
