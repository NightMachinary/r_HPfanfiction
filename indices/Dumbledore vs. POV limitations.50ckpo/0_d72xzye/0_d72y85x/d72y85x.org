  Whatever you do please don't call him Thomas

But he's been Thomas for 9 chapters already

  It just reminds me of Thomas the Train Engine.

And now I'm sad about that...

The good news is that /Thomas/ considers himself completely separate from Voldemort//Tom/ so the properly murderous Riddle will remain /Tom/. Thomas see's Voldemort as being like the parent that abandoned him (leaving him trapped in the diary for 50 years) and the other horcruxes as his siblings. Harry's scar gets him added to the list of siblings and starts a tug-of-war with Dumbledore over custody.
