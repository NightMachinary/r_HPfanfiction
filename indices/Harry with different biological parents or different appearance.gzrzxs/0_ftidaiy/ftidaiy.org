Harry with different biological parents is my favourite trope, its disappointing that they are rare and usually abandoned.

linkffn(the best mistakes) Sirius finds out that Harry is his son. Complete.

linkffn(the black secret) is, unfortunately, abandoned. Harry's appearance changes, and he finds out that he is not a Potter.
