Some of my favorite golden trio fanfics I remember:

A lovely oneshot about Teddys first day in Hogwarts

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167)\\
After the war the ministry stays corrupt so Harry, Hermione and Ron start to fight it. One of my favorite "dark Harry" fanfics even if the ending feels a little bit rushed.

Ginny dies in the chamber, this changes Harry, Ron and Hermione. Sadly its incomplete.

Ron, Ginny and Harry travel back in time. It's some years ago that I read it, but I'm pretty sure Hermione joins them later.
