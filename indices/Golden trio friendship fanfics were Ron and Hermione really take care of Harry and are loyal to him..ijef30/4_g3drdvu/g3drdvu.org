[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11302568/1/][Renegade]] - The Trio (and Neville, but he isn't that important) are pretty close. Although it is a non-linear fic and Edgy!Gary Sue!Harry is a bit annoying.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12792189/1/][A Beautiful Lie]] - Ron and Hermione are significantly less featured, but their portrayal is very good. It really shines in the second arc, as the first arc is mainly about Dumbledore mentoring Harry and a burgeoning Harry/Fleur (with a bit of Harry/Daphne).

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8666085/1/][Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection]] - Specifically, book 4 and 5. I don't remember it very well, but I'm pretty sure Ron is one of Harry's close friends. One of the few Slytherin!Harry AU's which has Ron /and/ Hermione as Harry's friends.

The first and second fics in the series are extremely generic canon rehashes. You can skip them and still understand the rest, but there are a few (/very/ few) moments which foreshadow a major plot point of the fifth part.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9720211/1/][The Merging]] - The first 16-17 chapters have an excellent trio (plus a few extras) dynamic. It is mixed in well with a more complex plot and Harry's rapid growth. I didn't like the fic much after chapter 20-21, but the high school vibe in their fifth year is one of the best I've ever read.

Note: All these fics are low on Angst, Family and Hurt/Comfort, with focus mainly on Adventure and sometimes, Friendship. I don't read too many fics of the former genres, and forget the ones I do read quite quickly.
