You just have to tough it out. Your brain gets used to it in a few chapters. You walk downstairs and into the kitchen. You start making a sandwich: lightly spread butter, ham, seeded mustard, sliced tomatoes and a few lettuce leaves. All the good shit. You gobble it down and head back upstairs to read your favourite fanfiction. You load up the fanfic, put on some relaxing music with dramatic undertones. You are content and at the same time excited. You start reading. Something is different. It dawns on you. Your favourite fanfiction is written in second-person narrative. You look at other timeless classics - My Immortal and HPMOR. They are all written in second-person. You can't escape, you are forever doomed to read everything in second-person narrative. After a year of intolerable fanfiction reading you end it all with an AK to the temple.
