I honestly have no argument with you here. The point I'm trying to make, is that when a person is looking for a /specific/ pairing, don't go and say how bad or unrealistic that pairing is. It's a bit off putting.

Otherwise, like in your example with a more general "Hermione-centric story" request, then of course it should be open for debate/comment.
