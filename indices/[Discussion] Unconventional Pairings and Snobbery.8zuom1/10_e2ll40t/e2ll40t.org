I am going to argue the counterpoint here, even if it gets me downvoted to hell and back.

People read fanfics due to different reasons. Some are here for the ships, some are here for missing scenes, some are here for fluff or angst, some want "Harry growing a spine" or Weasley bashing. But there is a general consensus regarding fic quality. You won't find many recommendations of fics riddled with typos or bad formatting. People come here for quality over quantity, because otherwise, they'd simply be on FFN and sort by "new; 60k words+".

Over the years, most of us have developed strong feelings on certain ships. There are a couple guys hating Hermione like she is the second coming of Hitler. Some of us see the Death Eaters as nothing but human trash. Some people here hate the Weasleys, some love them... You get the picture.

No one is "stopping you from getting the stories you like". But if you ask for recommendations and the tread results in a discussion because someone brings forth a story and someone else says that it's trash due to X, Y and Z, then that is the whole purpose of this sub. If the pairing is something that ruined the story (like X being the love interest in a Hermione-centric fic and it came out of nowhere), then people should not be afraid to say so. If you ask for stories with a certain pairing fine, there should be no critique there because everyone is aware which rabbit hole they are going down, but if it is a general request "Good Hermione stories" and someone suggest a fic where Hermione is the sex slave of the +magical Waffen-SS+ Death Eaters because "that's everything those filthy +Jews+ Muggleborn are good for", then people can rightfully argue against recommending such a fic.

Tl;dr: We are here for opinions on fics, not just a list you could get through Scryer.
