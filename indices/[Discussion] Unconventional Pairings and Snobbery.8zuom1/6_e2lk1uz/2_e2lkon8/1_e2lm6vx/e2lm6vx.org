This response shows me that you don't read slash at all. Harry / Draco is an incredibly common pairing, and doesn't require much imagination to see why. They are very similar minds- and both athletes - handicapped by crap guardians that send them on very differing paths (Harry to inelegant bumbling, Draco to snobbish hubris). Put them together and they balance out each other's flaws. Harry develops his Slytherin instincts and Draco relaxes enough to show his humor and heart.

I don't have a list of faves but off the top of my head the Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Cranmer for Delinquent Wizards is a nice one, that is also I believe strictly PG 13. But it is AU. Harry never went to Hogwarts so Hermione, Neville, Luna, Draco and Ron hunt him down in (i think) their 7th year to fight Voldemort's threat .

Draco Malloy It's Your Lucky Day is a funny, shortish, well liked one that works with canon.
