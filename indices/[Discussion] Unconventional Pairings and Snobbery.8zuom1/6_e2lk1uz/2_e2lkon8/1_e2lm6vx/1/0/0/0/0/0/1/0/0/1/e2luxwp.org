- Hermione Granger

- Luna Lovegood

- Lily Evans

- Ginny Weasley (OotP characterisation)

- Nymphadora Tonks (OotP characterisation)

- Katie Bell

- Padma Patil (headcanon mostly)

- Lavender Brown (post Battle of Hogwarts)

- Lisa Turpin (based on "Call Me")

- Gabrielle Delacour (headcanon mostly)

- Astoria Greengrass (the forbidden fruit/to spite Malfoy)

- Susan Bones (headcanon, not the fanon version)

- Cho Chang (once she is past her grief)

- Demelza Robins (the "other girl" in HBP)

- Romilda Vane (creepy but hot, possessive streak might be written as cute much like "Adorable violence")
