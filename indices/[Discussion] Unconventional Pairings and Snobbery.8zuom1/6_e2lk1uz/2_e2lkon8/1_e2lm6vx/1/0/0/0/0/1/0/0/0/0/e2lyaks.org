It's not the age of consent bit in and of itself that bothers me, I mean I read GOT fics the only AoC there is whenever the girl menstruate and the boy can get it hard. Plus medieval world does not have morals or qualms like we do. As for the Wizarding age of consent thing, terrible excuse when characters grew up in the muggle world and would therefore view thing from that perspective.

You equalize torture with pedophilia? Torture can be a good character development point, not just erotica. Mind Control can be used for a lot of things like memory charms, and not just erotica. And please do not mention the god-forsaken Marriage-Law trope, if there's one subset of the fanfiction that I'll hate till it's dead it's that one. Why? Because 90% of those I see are literally young" goodgirl/older bad guy".
