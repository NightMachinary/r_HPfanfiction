I haven't read any Harry / Snape slash. But there is a good deal of torture , mind control, forced weddings etc etc in fanfic. Harry- Bellatrix is a thing, I mean , what can you say. Lots of erotica is boundary pushing fantasy /shrug/. But there are usually trigger warnings and / or some talk about wizard age of consent.
