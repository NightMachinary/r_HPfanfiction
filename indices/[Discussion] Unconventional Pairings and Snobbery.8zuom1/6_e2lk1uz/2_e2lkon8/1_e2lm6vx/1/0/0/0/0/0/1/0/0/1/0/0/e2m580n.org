I thought you asked about personal preferences.

As for Neville, I really came to hate him in fanfics because he usually falls into very cliche roles, and I find neither "substitute Ron nor" good pureblood" or "training montage - > powerhouse" interesting. And due to the train wreck called HBP, Demelza is pretty much a Ginny without the fanboy-ism and that fucked up "chest monster". Also no other Weasley. OotP Ginny was a nice character, but in HBP she was pretty much just "the sporty girl". Also, you can write pretty much any background for Robins, while Ginny is restricted to the Weasleys.
