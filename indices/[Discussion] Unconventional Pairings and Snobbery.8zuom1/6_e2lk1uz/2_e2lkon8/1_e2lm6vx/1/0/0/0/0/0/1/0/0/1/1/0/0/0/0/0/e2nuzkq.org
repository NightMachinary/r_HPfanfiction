The only way I can see a Bellatrix "redemption" happen is AU territory where she gets fed up with Voldemort while in Azkaban, and even then she'd still not be a nice person but rather an antihero, someone who slaughters Death Eaters for revenge while having a drinking problem. And neither Draco nor Snape give me the "ruthless murder streak" vibe. Also, Snape's werewolf expedition was such a fucking brainfart on his part (I think that there's a werewolf there, better check it out on a full moon night) that it makes Harry look like Sun Tzu.

The difference between an annoying pest like Malfoy and someone of Grindelwald's or Riddle's calibre is that they actually pose a threat. Grindelwald and Voldemort had significant power and were difficult to take down, Draco was pathetic in the bathroom fight (or any other encounter). He's a spoiled little shit, but unlike for example Joffrey "Baratheon", he poses very little threat.

The other nice thing about Bellatrix is that you can fit her past to your story without violating canon nearly as much as giving Snape or Malfoy a vastly different past because there is very little canon information on anything before ~1975.

Romilda is ok if you write their "romance" before she attempts to rape drug Harry because he is a teenager and she is hot. I'm not sure if you know how male teenagers work, but most of them would only think about it long enough to remember a condom. It wouldn't be a deep emotional connection, that's for sure, but I know a couple of relationships which grew from "We're horny, lets fuck" into something more meaningful.
