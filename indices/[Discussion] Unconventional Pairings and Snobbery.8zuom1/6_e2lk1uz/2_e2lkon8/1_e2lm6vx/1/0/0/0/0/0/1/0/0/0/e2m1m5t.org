  Do people not get that? Harry Potter has a very small list of women options. Hermione is practically perfect, she's brilliant and heroic . Ginny does not have a huge list of fans . Luna is really hard to write well . Patel twins, Lavender, Susan Bones, Millicent Bulstode... someone Greengrass?

I disagree very much. Only Movie Hermione was perfect, her book version exhibits significant flaws such as strong jealousy, close-mindedness, and stubbornness. Hermione made several glaring mistakes in the final 2 Books: not suspecting Malfoy, rejecting HBP potion book, physically assaulting Ron, rejecting the notion of Death Hallows, and ruling out a Horcrux at Hogwarts. These mistakes indeed cost them dearly.

Ginny has enough fans, as surveys on this sub and [[/r/harrypotter]] show. On FFN, she's the 5th most occurring main character (after Harry, Hermione, Draco, and Snape).

The others have enough appearances in the Books to give authors good framework to work with.

Astoria Greengrass didn't appear in the Books, but JKR mentioned her a few times in interviews and on Pottermore. That's good enough for me, at least far more so than that nobody Daphne.

You didn't mention Fleur and Tonks, who are actually very well characterized in the Books and (male) fan favorites. Fleur especially is one of my most favorite characters. Behind her somewhat snobbish appearance lurks a great and powerful woman. The fandom is really not doing her character justice by often reducing her to an object of male sexual gratification.

Lavender might appear a little silly during her Won-Won episode, but who can say they didn't do something stupid during their teenage years? Her breakup with Ron was quite humiliating and embarrassing for her, but she didn't hold a grudge against the Trio. In Year 7, she braved terror and torture, actively participated in the resistance, fought in the Final Battle, and possibly gave up her life. Lavender is a very admirable character for me, at least far more so than those bigoted, bullying, and cowardly Slytherin bitches.

Cho falls in the same category as Lavender for me: much maligned in the fandom over some less than favorable episode of hers. But consider this: her love was murdered, but the government lied and covered it up. How could she not be upset? How could anyone not be upset? Later, she stood by her traitor friend Marietta Edgecombe and was unceremoniously kicked out of DA. But in the end, despite out of Hogwarts already and the fact she could have kept herself out of trouble, she came back to fight, risking her life and limbs against overwhelming enemy odds. Oh, she even had to put up with Ginny's jealousy.

One of HP Series's great aspects is the abundance of interesting and strong female characters, unlike in so many other literary works.
