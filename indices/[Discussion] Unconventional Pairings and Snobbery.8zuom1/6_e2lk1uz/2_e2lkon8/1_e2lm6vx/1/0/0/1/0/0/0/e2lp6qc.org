Better, and I don't particularly care about Harry/Snape/Whatever if they're of age, and it doesn't make Snape seem like Jimmy Saville levels of creepy, and the pairing makes sense (It'd actually make more sense with Fem Harry, if she looked like Lily, and Snape resisting his urges til she was older and he wouldn't get shoved into Azkaban for doing it, but still) I just don't see how any 13 year old Harry x Adult Consensual wouldn't end up in "That character ends up in Azkaban" Harry being kidnapped and mindbroken by Voldemort would make a LOT more sense.

My point is Cliche phrases, rather than Tropes. It's not a slash thing at all, but I just dislike "Use your Brain" = Slytherin side because it implies that no other house can do it (Fred and George were cunning as fuck at times)

I dislike Bashing as well unless it's temporary and at times that make sense (McGonagall and the Dragon incident sending first years to the forest for detention when they're actively told the forest is dangerous and they only get Hagrid (who can't use Magic) and a crappy dog that runs from everything. at that point, McGonagall bashing would make some sense, because it's so drastically over the top.
