I too find him an interesting character. Why can't people find Snape and Malfoy interesting too? As it happens, we actually really don't know about canon Snape's reasons to join LV in the first war, so it's a bit contrived to say that he's only interested in genocide. (At least that's what I'm concluding from your statement that GG had ideas which were more refined than just genocide.) We also don't know what Snape's involvement was during that time. We know he spied on Dumbledore and relayed half of the prophecy. But on a day to day basis, we have no idea whether he murdered, raped and pillaged, or whether he just sat in a basement trying to come up with a potion that would make LV's eyes look less red and creepy.

Anywayyyyyyy... how about my other point about your description of Romilda's attempted rape as "cute"?
