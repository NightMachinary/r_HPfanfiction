He and Lavender have pretty much the same arc, yet one is revered in fanfiction while the other is seen as stupid, air-headed slut.

  Annoying background character -> war hero.

Neville has the tragic past, Lavender get's fucked up in the final battle (and possibly died, her fate is unconfirmed IIRC). One becomes a hero, the other becomes a footnote at best.

Postwar Lavender has so much potential, yet there are just two fics which aren't completely horrible (both bash pretty much every other character, the Hermione/Lavender one ends in futa sex, but at least the "hurt/comfort" moments are somewhat decent). And that's scrapping the barrel.
