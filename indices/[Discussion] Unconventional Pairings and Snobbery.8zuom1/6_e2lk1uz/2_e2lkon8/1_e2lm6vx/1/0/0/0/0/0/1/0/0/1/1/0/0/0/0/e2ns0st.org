So in your opinion it's not acceptable to find a character interesting because he was into the dark arts (fetish seems a strong word for an 11-year-old, and Sirius' claim was likely exaggerated) and because Lily didn't like his friends. Granted, his friends all turned out pretty terrible but at this point it's a bunch of 16-year-olds and James and Sirius did a lot of questionable shit at this point too.

Grindelwald is okay though because his ideas were more refined, and because he got shit done?

Romilda is okay because love potions are sold by the twins? Even if wizards find this stuff amusing, they do know it's not really acceptable and love potions are banned at Hogwarts. She certainly doesn't seem like the kind of girl to like Harry as a person, but rather for his fame, something he obviously detests.

"easiest way would be to get them together before that attempt happens"

Alright, so you're saying the only believable way for them to be together in fanfic is to ignore the one big contribution she made to the plot. She's basically just a super hot OC with a canon name.

When it comes to DEs in fanfic you seem to be against this kind of white washing. Actually not all DEs though, as I've seen you have arguments on here where you're defending Bellatrix as a redeemable character. You're merely picking characters you like - mostly just hot women - and you're generally being incredibly inconsistent and judgemental.
