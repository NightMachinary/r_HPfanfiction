It's women who usually read slash. And it's usually because male characters are complex and well developed and interesting ? Do people not get that? Harry Potter has a very small list of women options. Hermione is practically perfect, she's brilliant and heroic . Ginny does not have a huge list of fans . Luna is really hard to write well . Patel twins, Lavender, Susan Bones, Millicent Bulstode... someone Greengrass? Neville and Malfoy are both juicy characters that are fun to develop compared to making up a personality for a minor side character who happens to be female.
