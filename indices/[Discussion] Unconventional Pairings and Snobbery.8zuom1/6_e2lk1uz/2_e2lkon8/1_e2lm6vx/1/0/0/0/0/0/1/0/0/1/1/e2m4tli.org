Romilda Vane - I thought this sub was usually agreed that love potions are effectively rape? So attempted rape is merely creepy and "might be written as cute"... OK then.

Gellert Grindelwald - apparently he's okay because your headcanon makes him tragic. Yet no DE could possibly have a tragic or sad story in /someone else's/ headcanon. Clearly it's just your own opinion that counts here.
