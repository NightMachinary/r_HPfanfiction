Wow hostile ok. Most romance is going to have some cliche.... but I don't mind ‘Harry learns to be strategic and think ahead' so much .it works for his character .

And while I'm not into student / teacher pairings let's not EWWWW in a conversation specifically about making space for unusual pairings. My toddler's preschool has a saying ‘don't yuck someone else's yum' (meaning don't express disgust at other people's lunchbox contents) and I think it applies here too.
