"Develop his Slytherin Instincts" Seems Cliche to me. Only way to actively make that work without being "BAM" OOC snap changes rather than character development, would be for Lucius to be in Azkaban whilst Draco was young (His imperius bribe wasn't believed) so Draco can grow up with a non-bully personality. Harry hates bullies because of Dudley. You can't suddenly make Canon Draco change, unless he's forced to do something horrific by Voldemort that makes him crack and turn "Not Death Eatery" so you can lead him to Harry. The changes have to make sense. That's my point. IDGAF about the pairings as long as they're written in and not creepy AF ("3rd year Harry falls for snape and wants to sleep with him. Ewwww)
