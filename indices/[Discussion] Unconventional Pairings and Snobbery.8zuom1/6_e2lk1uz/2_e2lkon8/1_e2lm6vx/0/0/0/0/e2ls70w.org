Right, he couldn't be redeemed if there was nothing to redeem him from. We don't know the moment that Draco turned on V, but i never thought it was as purely selfish as ‘he was mean to my dad / threatened me' . He was on the wrong side, and trapped , and I think he was smart enough and had enough of a conscious to experience regret and revulsion about that.

One of my favorite scenes in the books is when Dudley tells Harry ‘I don't think you are a waste of space'. It is hardly a compliment, and it took him way too long to get there, but it is a spark of redemption, and hope for the future.
