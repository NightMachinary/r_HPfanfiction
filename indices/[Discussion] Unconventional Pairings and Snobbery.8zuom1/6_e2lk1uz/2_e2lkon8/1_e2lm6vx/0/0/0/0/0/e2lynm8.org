Honestly I think the biggest reason for Draco's turn was that one of his friend's (Whether you think they actually are or not is a different matter) just died an hour or two ago while performing their mission to retrieve/protect the diadem.

But it doesn't weigh up for me. One decent act doesn't outweigh a dozen terrible ones.
