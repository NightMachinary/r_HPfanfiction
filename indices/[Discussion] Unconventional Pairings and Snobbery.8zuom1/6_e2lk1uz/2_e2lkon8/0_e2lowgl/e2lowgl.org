  Hermione/Sorting Hat is just creepy,
#+end_quote

I beg to differ. Not /child/-Hermione/Sorting Hat, but while a bit out there, I wouldn't see anything /creepy/ about it if 40-something Minister Hermione (in an AU where she didn't marry Ron, obviously) fell in love with the Hat. It'd be /extremely weird/, but not in a creepy way, I don't think.
