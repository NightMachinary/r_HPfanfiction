Most of us aren't Anti-slash, just Anti-weird slash. Harry/Ron, Harry/Neville, Sirius/Remus pairings get a LOT less hate than Harry/Snape/Voldemort/Draco/Lucius sort of stories, as writing them without being Stockholm Syndrome fics where Harry is mindbroken into it with heavy noncon, it just seems weird. Harry "Wakes up one morning and finds he wants to bang Snape" is just creepy, as most of them are weird Grooming fics.

Hermione/Sorting Hat is just creepy, so it's a bad example, but if you want the "Unusual Pairings" as you call it (Harry/Cho is a fairly unusual pairing, even though in canon Harry wanted her at first) at least go for the well written ones, rather than making "BAM" changes, make the reason the pairing happen actually make sense. Though some people have "Guilty Pleasure" styles of fanfics (I like weird Triwizard Tournament Surprise motherfucker Harry is here out of nowhere summoned from x alternate or wherever the fuck he was fics) "Dumbledore/The Light are evil, Voldemort is misguided and Snape is a Sexgod" ficis are a bit of a stretch.
