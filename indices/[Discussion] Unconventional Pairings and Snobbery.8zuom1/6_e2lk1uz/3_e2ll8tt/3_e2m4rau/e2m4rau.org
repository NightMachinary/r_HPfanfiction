Most of [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/series/390301][astolat's]] works (all Harry/Draco) are pretty amazing. My favourites are Timeshare, Unseen and Slithering. I would highly recommend for you to just give one of them a try - I think their characterization is phenomenal and really makes Harry/Draco feel realistic. (I would skip Matched Set and Erosmancy though.)
