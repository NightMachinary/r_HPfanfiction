Finished? Maybe a dozen (and a couple more M/M/F with M/M scenes). Ditched before getting through the first chapter because the premise was horrible? Hundreds.

I find exactly three male characters in the entire HP universe interesting. Harry, Ted Tonks and Gellert Grindelwald (at least before fantastic beasts and also for the ideological and political implications of his character, not for the person he is). Ted is definitely not gay and his whole character arc relies on him having a heterosexual relationship. Throw in a couple of the Muggleborn background characters for good measure, but that does little to improve the shipping prospects.
