Well there's your problem then! If you don't like any male characters, of course you can't find any decent fics.

I've been reading Harry Potter fanfic since 2000 and man, have I read some horrifically bad fics... and a whole lot of amazing fics. I'd think the difference between us is that I read and enjoy fics about ALL characters and while I mostly prefer canon pairings, I have probably read pretty much ALL pairings at some point. Slash or not.
