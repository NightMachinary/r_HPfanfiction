That's quite an over-generalization. I'm not personally a fan of ships like Harry/Snape, Harry/Draco, or Harry/Voldemort, because I don't like Snape, Draco, or Voldemort, but there's plenty of popular slash and femslash ships like Harry/Ron, Harry/Neville, Ginny/Luna, Dean/Seamus, and Remus/Sirius that don't have statutory rape/abuse of power elements or "magic Nazi whitewashing".

Nor do I see much of a problem with "everyone is gay" AUs. For one thing, they're not necessarily AUs in the classic sense. For most characters, we can only infer sexuality from their canon relationships, and even if Harry only dates girls in canon, that doesn't preclude the possibility that he's bi. To take a [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Watsonian_vs._Doylist][Watsonian]] approach for a moment, he spends an awful lot of time thinking about how handsome Cedric and Bill are for a straight guy. ;) Additionally, it's extremely common for LGBT people to have a friends circle with a high percentage of LGBT people, even if the friendships were formed before any of them officially "came out", so if, for example, you're writing from the premise that Harry is bi, it would hardly be surprising if several of his friends also turned out to be LGBT of some variety.
