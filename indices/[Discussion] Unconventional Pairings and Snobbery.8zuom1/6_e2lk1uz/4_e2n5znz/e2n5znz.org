The thing is, a lot of slash is romance, by definition. Since this is a male-dominated forum, it's possible that they just don't like romances, though they're ok with adventure-with-a-side-romance-plot. When they run across a het romance, they just say, "boring plot, not enough action" and move on. But they lump all slash into that category, since a lot of slash tends to focus on the relationship.
