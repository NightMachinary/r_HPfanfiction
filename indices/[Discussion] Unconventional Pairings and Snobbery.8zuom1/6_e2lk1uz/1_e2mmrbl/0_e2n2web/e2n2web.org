I'm not gay and I only occasionally read slash fics. So on the whole I don't personally feel persecuted by some of the comments about this topic.

Objectively however I do find that those comments are often unwarranted and unnecessarily negative. I've seen posts asking for requests for something completely unrelated (say fics with indy!Harry, could be anything though) and there will be comments along the lines of "There's lots of slash fics with this trope, but no one would want to read that shit so if that's what you want I'm gonna nope out of this thread."

I've seen these sorts of things written as top level comments for no apparent reason and I think it's fair for people to feel vilified as a result of that. That sort of comment doesn't help anyone and just makes other people less likely to offer their recommendations or to write a post themselves.
