I would disagree. I've never been on a slash-exclusive community or even read slash as a main pairing, but it definitely gets harshed on here. Between that and the overall welcome of a HG/SS fan, I've seriously considered leaving this sub.

I get that not everyone likes what I like. And I get that I don't necessarily like what others like... But I DO get that I don't have to approve of someone else's reading preferences to not be a dick buiscut about it. I don't even have to downvote someone who reads a pairing I'm not into - a consideration that others have not allowed me.
