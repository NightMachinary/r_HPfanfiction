Discussion =/= downvoting any opinion that a person doesn't like, or coming out of the woodwork just to express a negative reaction any time a topic is mentioned.

It puts me in mind of the Bieber hate fad. Is Justin Bieber uniquely terrible to warrant such vocal opposition? No, there are plenty of other artists that are worse. The extreme negativity is a direct reaction to the perceived popularity. If Bieber didn't have a large fandom then no one would care enough to "bash" the topic. The same phenomenon applies here: extreme negativity is a response to the perceived popularity of certain fics/pairings/tropes.

Slash is definitely not unique in bringing on the downvote train; recommending any fic with Ron/Dumbledore "bashing" also gets the same treatment on this sub, as does any mention of HPMOR. There are a lot of friendly communities which follow the maxim 'personally, that's not my cup of tea, but there's nothing inherently wrong with it if it doesn't appeal to me.' It's a bit sad that this sub isn't one of them.
