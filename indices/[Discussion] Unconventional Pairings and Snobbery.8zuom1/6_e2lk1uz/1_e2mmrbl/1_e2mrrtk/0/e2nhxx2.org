  I would disagree. I've never been on a slash-exclusive community or even read slash as a main pairing, but it definitely gets harshed on here.

My point isn't that slash doesn't get bashed. My point is that /everything/ gets bashed, so slash isn't particularly special in that regard. It's just what happens when people with different preferences come together to discuss their opinions.
