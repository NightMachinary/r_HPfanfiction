  According to the subreddit survey, 40% of the sub reads slash.

I think more options relating to frequency or preference would have been helpful for that question, similar to the general HP fanfiction one or the Harry-centric one. As it is, the question is too broad and I'm sure many of that 40% are readers with opinions similar to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8v0v21/hpfanfiction_survey_2018_new_and_improved/e1kdrh5/][this]].

  Similarly, I imagine indy!Harry readers consider this sub anti-indy!Harry. But again, there are plenty of threads on the sub where people support indy!Harry ideas and make indy!Harry fic requests.

Sure. And yet how many slash request threads are upvoted nearly as much as those threads? I can barely remember any in the last few months. I also suspect there are more people who regularly downvote slash requests than indy Harry requests.
