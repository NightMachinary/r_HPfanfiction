According to the subreddit survey, 40% of the sub reads slash. I think the perception of the sub as "anti-slash" stems from the fact that a lot of slash readers are used to slash-exclusive communities, so anything less than full support feels like persecution.

Similarly, I imagine indy!Harry readers consider this sub anti-indy!Harry. But again, there are plenty of threads on the sub where people support indy!Harry ideas and make indy!Harry fic requests. It's just that there's an equal number of threads criticising those same ideas.

Ultimately, the sub is /diverse/. But people have a tendency to see diversity as being against their particular viewpoint - kinda like how IRL both the left and the right identify the BBC as biased against their end of the political spectrum.
