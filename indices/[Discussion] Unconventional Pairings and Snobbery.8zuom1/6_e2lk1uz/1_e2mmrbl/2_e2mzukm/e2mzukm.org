Just my 2 knuts, but that question to me felt a bit limited in responses. I, for example, would have to answer it as "reading slash", because there are good stories like linkffn(Again and Again by Athey) which contain slash which I read. However, I don't particularly enjoy reading slash and avoid most stories with it. Again and Again is good in spite of the slash, if anything.

(Then again, I didn't get to the survey in time to answer, so there's that.)
