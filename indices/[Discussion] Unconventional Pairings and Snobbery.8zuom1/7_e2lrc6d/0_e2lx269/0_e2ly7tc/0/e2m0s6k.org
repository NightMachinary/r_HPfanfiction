Then we should also be reporting OPs who start discussions in threads they have marked as request. If we didn't, then it would be unbalanced: a right to start arguments then get someone punished for engaging with the discussion you started.

The problem with doing this is that it results is massive "over modding" and forum drama. That's not the point of rule 8. The way it was intended and has been enforced is not as a blanket ban on discussion; it's there to give mods the discretion to stop discussions which cross the line into trolling.
