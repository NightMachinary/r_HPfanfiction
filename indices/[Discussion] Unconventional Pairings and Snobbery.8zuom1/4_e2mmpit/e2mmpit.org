This all comes back to the eternal problem with reddit: Anything that's slightly controversial will be downvoted enough to barely be visible and the few that see it will express their opposite opinion.

Reddit is just not a good platform for controversial matters and I have never seen the admins care about this problem even a little bit. Reddit is basically designed in a way which encourages echo chambers on a per subreddit basis (which seems to be the way all social networks and even news sites are going, people don't want to read about things they don't like). Luckily there's always some tolerance for differing opinions as long as they aren't too objectionable to the majority, but there's a reason you'll never see - for example - slash fics in a subreddit like this.

Maybe people who want to recommend Hermione/DeathEater type fics should create their own containment subreddit? Don't know if that's a good idea...
