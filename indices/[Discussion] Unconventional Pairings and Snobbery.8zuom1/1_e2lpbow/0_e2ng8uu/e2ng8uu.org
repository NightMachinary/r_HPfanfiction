I don't think it's about not being okay with slash because of homosexuality or the particular ship (though it does come into it) but rather that skepticism toward slash comes from accumulated experience of people seeing that slash in particular breeds a lot of poor fanffic wherein Harry is an emotionally weak waif. At least super!Harry lets him kick ass even if the fic is otherwise bad.
