I'm guilty of doing this very recently and almost feel like this thread is directed at me, so I'll respond:

Yes, you're ultimately correct. I shouldn't have chimed in on a request thread about how the pairing can't work. I didn't realize that was actually against the rules, but regardless my bad.

I will say in my defense that the OP requested a believable Draco/Ginny, and that's why I chimed in with why it can't work. Because I rejected the very premise. There have been many other threads asking for specific pairings (even Draco/Ginny) that I never added my opinion to on its validity, but because the request specifically asked for something that was believable, I thought it appropriate to engage on whether such a thing is even possible. Because the OP wanted that, and was going to get fics that are making that claim. And I just don't believe any fic can be believable.

On the larger point, anyone can like any pairing. If you want to see your two favorite characters get together, changing them enough to make that plausible is probably not a big deal to you. But one of the drawbacks of so much fanfiction is it makes us lose the actual characters. For example, Draco in canon is a coward who believes in blood supremacy and in the end wanted Voldemort to win. But in more fanfictions that I can count, his character is drastically changed to make the pairing work. And we forget his true nature, which overall hurts our understanding of the original work. And maybe it's just me but I simply don't understand the appeal of reading about a character when they have been changed so much as to not make them that character anymore. Of course any pairing can be done, and can make for an interesting story. But I stick by my assertion that certain pairings are not possible without changing fundamental aspects of the characters. They can't be done in a true-to-canon fashion.
