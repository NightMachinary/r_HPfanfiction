Honestly, it is and it isn't. It's not like you are alone in this, because I've been following this sub for...a year? I think?...and I've noticed a certain amount of negativity aimed at certain pairings. That post was just the unlucky tipping point. And it's possible I should have been more subtle about it; it's not fair to single anyone out, as it is undoubtedly a group thing.

Now, to your point: I actually understand where you're coming from. Many fics can alter characters to such an extent that they're practically unrecognizable. But I will posit that the problem with those stories isn't the change itself, but /how that change comes to be/.

If story A presents Draco Malfoy as a fearless leader, championing the likes of muggleborns, and /there is no explanation how or why he got there/, then yeah: it's absurd.

But if a story starts with something subtle, a little (or big) event that forces him to ponder matters of equality, leading to a slow rebellion against his parents' ideologies, which culminates in him switching sides...why not? Thing is, stories are built on /change/. Characters grow and evolve. And different stimuli can lead to different outcomes. Villains can become heroes, and heroes (Harvey Dent is my favorite example) can be torn down into villains.

So, my argument is that it's not about the change itself, it's about the journey that leads to it.
