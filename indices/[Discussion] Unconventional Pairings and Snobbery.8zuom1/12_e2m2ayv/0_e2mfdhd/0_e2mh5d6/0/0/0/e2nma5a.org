Well, you and I won't agree about Draco's motivations, but that's not a bad thing, as his feelings and intent are frequently not defined in canon; hence, they're open to interpretation. It's an element that we can discuss and agree to disagree. That's fine!

Regarding the story, however: it forces Malfoy to cooperate with Ginny specifically for his survival. The Malfoys were not held in high regard by Voldemort at the end of the war; the story plays on this and worsens the situation for Malfoy.

And, completely agreed about the conversation: I think we both came away with new thoughts!
