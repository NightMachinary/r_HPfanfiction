Good points.

My whole thing about canon is that I'm fine if you make the world AU. I like fics where Harry never went to Hogwarts, for example. But for me, the characters themselves need to be true to canon. So don't make Ginny demure, even-tempered and overly lovey-dovey with Harry. Don't make Hermione lazy or manipulative. And don't make Draco have a heart of gold or have him throw himself in front of a killing curse.

Specific to the example you gave in that fic, the problem is that in a world where Voldemort wins and Ginny is given to Draco, the whole point of Draco's character is that he would actually be ok with this. This would be the easier path for him and he would probably relish the fact he gets to have Ginny. Even when Draco was at his lowest point in canon, it was really about how to survive the situation in the easiest way; it was never about doing the right thing. In the Astronomy Tower, Draco was not brave. He was forced into a bad situation but went along with it, half-assing several attempts because he was torn about whether it was the best play for himself. He also couldn't kill, not because of some noble idea about murder, but he just didn't have the stomach for it. Keep in mind he had no qualms with others being murdered and when things were looking very good for him under the possibility of Voldemort's rule, he relished in the pain Voldemort and the Death Eaters caused.

Another example: at Malfoy Manor, when he fails to identify Harry, it's not because he wants to protect Harry. He could've just said it wasn't him if that was the case. He said maybe because he was a weak, shell of a boy who couldn't decide anymore which side he wanted to prevail. He was a coward even then because he couldn't make a choice.

Finally, during the final battle, Draco almost captures Harry while in the Room of Requirement. Even at this late hour, Draco was still trying to curry favor with Voldemort. He fully knew what Voldemort winning meant and because he thought in that moment that capturing Voldemort would gain his favor, Draco committed himself to Voldemort.

So even in a story where Voldemort wins, Draco doesn't do the right thing and rebel against his rule.

Finally, in order for this to work, Ginny needs to be attracted to Draco. Simply having them live and work together can't do it by itself; otherwise we'd all be hooking up with our coworkers left and right (ok that's a bit hyperbolic ;)). Ginny has to respect Draco and he needs to be brave and a leader for her to change her opinion. And again, it simply is not in Draco's core nature to be that way. I can buy that his bigoted views and aristocratic nature can be unlearned, but the cowardice and "follower" attitude is very much ingrained.

But regardless, this conversation is fantastic and what this sub is about. So cheers to that!
