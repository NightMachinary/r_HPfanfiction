That's a pretty solid argument, especially regarding their characters. It makes sense, and, honestly, I didn't even think about it like that. But I'd still claim there's plenty to work with to change them in a realistic way.

Take, for instance, some of Draco's negative traits: his spoiled nature, his brattishness, his bigotry. These are all learned behaviors. He acts that was because he was taught to act that way...meaning it can be unlearned with the proper stimulus.

Then, his cowardice. And, you're right, Draco often does act like a coward. But, the thing is, even cowards can do brave things. When he was standing on the top of the Astronomy tower, holding the most powerful of the world(?) at wandpoint, don't you think he was scared? He was, but he did it anyway. And I see that as act of both desperation, yes, but bravery too.

Finally, I'd like to point out that there a million different mechanisms to force them to work together. In the story I pointed out, for example, Ginny was forced to live with Draco via a Voldemort-induced marriage law...and she /hated/ it. She fought tooth and nail. But Harry was dead, and she was practically alone...and Draco wasn't in the best position in Voldemort's court either, which led to them working together. And cooperation -- even forced cooperation -- is a great prelude to respect, admiration, and, possibly, even love.

Obviously, that's not canon-consistent. But why stick to canon in fanfiction? I mean, sure, you can -- there's nothing wrong with that -- but there shouldn't be any reason to limit yourself either. There are a million different ideas, and if a story can take you from point A to point B with sound reasoning and logic, having the characters act in ways that are believable, then that story can be very realistic, even if the characters end up completely transformed.
