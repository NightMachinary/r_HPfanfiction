I didn't mind you calling my post out; you were right and it did violate the subs rules. And if my opinion can be interpreted as being condescending or rude to others who don't share my view, it should be called out and I need to own up to it. Since it wasn't my intention,, then I need to clarify my stance. So it's good you posted this.

So to clarify, my position is not that a person can't enjoy reading a pairing because it isn't realistic or believable. There are many great stories that include a pairing that is not believable based on canon. But since the OP was specifically asking for a believable fic, I responded that indeed it would be impossible, in my opinion. And as I stated, I do not comment on request threads where the OP is simply asking for a certain pairing with no caveats.

Regarding the rest of your post, on one hand, you are correct about how the story of someone changing for the better, and then the love interest falling for that new person who they originally hated, is a compelling story. And Draco could theoretically change in a way that might make Ginny fall for him. But this also requires Ginny to change a lot too, which is also possible.

My general issue with this type of story, specifically for Draco/Ginny, is that in order to buy into it, there has to be some drastic fundamental change to the core of who that character is. And if you are a fan of the character of Draco, that fundamental core characteristic is very unpleasant. Draco is a very unpleasant person, and someone who is incredibly unappealing to people like Ginny. Ginny in canon seems to be attracted heavily to bravery, and presumably would be very unattracted to cowardliness. Draco is a coward at his core. That's not something so easily changed about a person. Ginny is also fiercely opposed to literally every aspect of Draco's life and belief system. Ginny also is incredibly loyal, incredibly loyal to Harry, and in love with Harry, even in death. So the story needs to make Harry not worthy of that loyalty, because if Harry dies (as the way to get him out of the equation) Ginny would never be with Draco if for no other reason than out of loyalty and respect for Harry. Ultimately, for Ginny to ever want to be with Draco, Draco would need to change literally everything about his character, and Ginny would also need to change major parts of her character. Personally I just don't see the appeal since you are now reading a fic with two OCs. But sometimes people just want their favorite characters to be together, or they just appreciate a certain type of story, regardless of its consistency with canon characteristics. That is fair. But I still maintain that a believable, canon-consistent Draco/Ginny does not exist
