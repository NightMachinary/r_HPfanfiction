When people say "can't be done", usually they mean "can't be done well". And when it comes to Harry Potter fanfiction, that usually means that there isn't an enormouse departure made from canon in characters. Well, that's not completely true either, since it happens all the time and can be great... when it's done for the plot. If it's done just to set up an unlikely pairing then it just feels cheap, I'd say.

But I don't really bash on those requests, if you're looking for whatever, best of luck to you. But that doesn't mean I'm going to enjoy or be able to say that Harry/Bellatrix, or Harry/Lily is a reasonable pairing.
