I feel like that Harry would be wearing socks with sandals, often seen in flannel pants, usually also wearing his robe as both pajamas and daywear. Perhaps carrying around a sippycup full of vodka, or a chai latte and a reusable snack bag full of organic kale chips, while pondering the dangers of frizzy hair and desperately trying to convince Hermione to use a new organic hair product he invented in his bathtub. Sometimes to be discovered praising the benefits of putting bicycle pedals on his broom so one can pedal while flying to anyone who will listen. Occasionally found playing his acoustic guitar in a breakfast nook, or discussing the merits of their favorite obscure author, while quoting love sonnets to no one in particular.

I kinda want to read this now.
