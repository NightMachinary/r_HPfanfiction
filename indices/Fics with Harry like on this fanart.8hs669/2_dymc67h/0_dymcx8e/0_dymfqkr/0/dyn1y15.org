There must be wizards that go out hunting magical beings that terrorise muggle areas. Imagine a rogue dragon that has to be dealt with because it threatens a village in Russia.

Wendigos popping up out of nowhere because some guy is a cannibal and someone has to deal with it before the statute is threatened. Stuff like that. Could even port in some of the creatures from the witcher if you were so inclined.
