Now I kinda wanna read a fic about three wizards from the department of magical accidents that accidentally become the Ghostbusters as a cover for dealing with hauntings because the Obliviators get mean when you call them out at three AM on a Saturday and you end up filling in so much extra paperwork that literally faking a Ghosthunting Business is less hassle.
