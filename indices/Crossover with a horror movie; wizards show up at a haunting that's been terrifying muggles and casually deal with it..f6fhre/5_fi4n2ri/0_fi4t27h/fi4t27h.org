Unless there's something like a blanket confundus charm that some bureaucrat wizard instituted which is triggered by the general concept of an 'anomaly' and which affects muggles. Extra protection for the Statute! Muggles get confused by weird stuff, and chalk it up to indigestion! Brilliant!

Except it actually just makes muggles incapable of rational self-defense tactics in the presence of horror monsters. And it ends up making the Obliviation team's work that much harder. Instead of just dealing with rogue magical beasts, they've also got to protect the muggles who encounter them from their own stupidity.
