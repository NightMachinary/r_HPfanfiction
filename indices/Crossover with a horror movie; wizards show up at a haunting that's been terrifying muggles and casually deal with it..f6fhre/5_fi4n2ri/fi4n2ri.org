The issue with most horror movies is that a smart cast (not splitting up, not charging your devices, comically incompetent military) or weapons would solve the plot just as easily. Hell, often smartphones would do the trick.

You'd need to find something which does not tick those boxes (basically a movie where the "bad" wins on its own merit) and then have wizards fix that, otherwise the comedic effect won't be that great.
