Here's a snippet I wrote a while ago on the subject:

--------------

Hermione walked into the Department Head's office with the assurance of a job candidate who knows that she is guaranteed to be hired. The purging of Muggleborn employees during the Thicknesse administration and of Death Eater Walden Macnair and his band of butchers during the Shacklebolt administration had left the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures profoundly short-staffed, and even without her own role in the defeat of Voldemort and the attendant fame, she knew that her resum√© was second to none. The hardest part had been toning down the rhetoric on house-elf rights in her (admittedly overly long) cover letter.

The department head---an elderly wizard, a recent Shacklebolt promotee to replace Macnair---looked uncomfortable at best in his new position. He began, rather haltingly, "Miss Granger, I won't be giving away much by telling you that you are an exceptional candidate, and we would be happy to have you as an employee. But, well, I see on your cover letter that you are most interested in the treatment of house-elves..." He paused.

Hermione was not sure liked where this was going. "I am, Sir. In fact, my hope is to be involved in the drafting of the new regulations as ordered by Minister Shacklebolt."

"You are very well-informed, Miss Granger, and I am certain that you would be highly successful at this task. However, I believe that you may be better suited for a different posting in our department..."

Purebloods being obsequious to her, while not quite giving her what she wanted, was something she had encountered all too frequently since Voldemort's defeat. The annoyance must have shown in her body language, because the manager raised his hands in a placating gesture. "Please, hear me out. You may have, perhaps, heard of our Task Force on That Which Man Was Not Meant To Know?"

Hermione shook her head. "No, Sir, I am not familiar with that."

"Well, it's something that's not particularly secret, but not something we talk about either---not so much Unspeakable as Would-Really-Rather-Not-Speakable and You-Really-Don't-Want-To-Knowable. It's a task force in our department that deals with creatures left behind by ancient civilizations, cults seeking to summon or resurrect eldrich horrors whose mere sight shatters sanity, and similar nuisances."

Hermione frowned. "Shouldn't matters like that be handled by the Aurors or the Unspakables?"

"A very astute suggestion, Miss Granger, and one that we at DRCMC have made many times. However, as you might guess, Auror Office and the Department of Mysteries have a bit more prestige that we do. Every time it's come up, the Aurors insist that they have their hands full with Dark Wizards, and, well, the cultists in question tend to be Muggles. Obliviators refuse to get involved until the scene is secure, but Hitwizards aren't qualified to secure it. The Unspeakables, they hate the field work involved and consider what they call 'exorcism' beneath them. The policymakers, thus, see that it involves Magical Creatures of some sort and leave it on our humble doorstep, so to speak. Anyway, whether we like it or not, we do have to staff the task force, and I feel that your talents would be best used there."

"But Sir, I haven't even read about any of these cults or eldrich horrors," Hermione admitted with some reluctance.

"Nor would we expect you to have; the information is shared on the Crazy-Enough-to-Want-to-Know basis. Still, I have here a list of qualifications from the last head of the task force---the position was recently, and regrettably, vacated."

"Voldemort?" The department head shuddered at Hermione's casual use of the name.

The wizard squinted at the document. "It says 'Workplace accident'. Anyway, beyond a NEWT in Care of Magical Creatures to work here, of course, the task force needs a NEWT in Astronomy, because it's helpful to know 'when the stars are right', whatever that means; a NEWT in Ancient Runes to 'investigate cultic rituals and shrines and ruins of ancient civilizations'; and it also recommends at least an OWL in Defense Against the Dark Arts, though he crossed out 'Dark' and tried to write in something else, here, for some reason."

Hermione looked. It was an odd variant of Nacaal, but...

"In addition," the manager continued undaunted, "The task force also wants someone who can cast a corporeal Patronus, because it seems to 'provide some solace in this otherwise bleak and hopeless reality', and you seem to have that covered. The qualifications sheet asks for facility with field application of Memory Charms, though it's listed under First Aid skills, for some reason... Anyway, your Other Skills list says that you have some experience with that."

Hermione nodded, and the department head continued. "Now, then, basic Occlumency, that's not on your resume."

"I am familiar with the concept, Sir, but I didn't know anyone who could teach me properly."

"Yes, and I've signed you up for the quarterly workshop that the Unspeakables offer. It starts in two weeks. So, are you interested?"

"What about the house-elf regulations position?"

The DRCMC head gave a tired sigh, and took a moment to rub his eyes, before leaning forward and lowering his voice. "Miss Granger, if you take the position on the task force, then I will hire someone---anyone you want---to write the regulation. Find me someone, and I'll hire him. A Muggle, if that's what you want. Two people, if that's what it takes to write the regulations you want to see. We need to staff the task force properly, and it's very hard to find people both qualified and willing."

If Hermione takes the job and finds out that the task force comprises her and Luna, it could make for an excellent buddy-cop romp through the Lovecraft Mythos, I think.
