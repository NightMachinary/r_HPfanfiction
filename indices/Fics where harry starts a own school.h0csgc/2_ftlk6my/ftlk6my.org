Also Proud Parents by RobSt. He states outright that it's a reimagining of Knowledge is Power, so it is nearly identical at the beginning. linkffn(12879819)

There was a one-shot I read, can't remember the name, where McGonagall is sent to check out a new school that seems to be getting all the Muggleborn students and I think now is making inroads into the halfbloods also. Albus has been trying to get information on the school's administrators but has been stymied so he sends McG to try to learn enough to get some leverage against them. The teacher she meets with turns out to be Hermione. Harry is the Headmaster but I don't think she learns that. This is a "systemic pureblood prejudice" story where muggle-born have no place in society (but they don't tell them that when recruiting for Hogwarts).

I'm assuming you want schools that compete with Hogwarts. I also know a couple where Harry starts a primary school.
