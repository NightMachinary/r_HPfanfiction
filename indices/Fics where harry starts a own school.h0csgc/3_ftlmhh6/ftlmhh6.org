I believe the story Souls Abound by RobSt has the Granger Summer School of Magic.

And along with another commentor I swear I read a story where harry and hermione opened a school in direct competition with Hogwarts for the muggleborns which included mundane subjects as well. I also believe that they started them before 11. But for the life of me I can't find it.
