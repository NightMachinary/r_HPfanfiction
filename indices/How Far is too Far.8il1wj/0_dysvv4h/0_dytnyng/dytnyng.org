For me personally as a writer, I'm always trying to keep anything canon as much as I can, unless I HAVE to make a change somewhere to make something work in my story. And if I have to make a change here or there for my story, then I'll make those changes - but I won't go overboard, I hope. So yes, I try to keep things as canon as possible, unless it's necessary for the story to change something somewhere. Also I love worldbuilding and adding on and filling in the blanks of all those places and stuff we didn't see in canon, but that isn't CHANGING STUFF, just ADDING NEW STUFF that could have been there all along for all anyone knows. :)
