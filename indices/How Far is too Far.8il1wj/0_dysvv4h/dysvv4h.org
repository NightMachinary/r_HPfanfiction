As a reader I give a lot of leeway. I'll go crazy for an excellent story that manages to stick to canon in even the more obscure places, but that doesn't mean I can't love a thorough and self-declaired AU like /Core Threads/, or a "mostly canon but this and that are changed" like /The Arithmancer/ or /Lady Archimedes/.

As a writer though, or at least so far, I've made it part of the game to not only stick to canon, but to repurpose a bunch of background canon details into major elements of my plot. Jimmy Kiddell or Rufus Fudge as background characters, etc.
