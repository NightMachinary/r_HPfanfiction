Ah, that's a different problem all together, I read a quote about it once that fits, "In every first novel the hero is the author as Christ or Faust" - Oscar Wilde. Of course, it's not just first novel- some authors seem to have trouble making a character divergent from themselves- writing completely new concepts and characters is /hard/, that's part of the reason fanfiction is such a big thing- it's far easier to write with a bit of a template than without it.

But... I kind of like wish-fulfillment fics- even if I'm the first to admit they're largely, well, shit, from a literary prospective.
