It's not about okay or not okay. It's about character. If Harry smokes crack, he smokes crack. Smoking crack is part of him. The same as magical eye and constant vigilance are parts of Moody. If an author decides to not use this trait in his or her story it means he or she omits a part of Harry's true character.

The new hero is not the true Harry anymore.
