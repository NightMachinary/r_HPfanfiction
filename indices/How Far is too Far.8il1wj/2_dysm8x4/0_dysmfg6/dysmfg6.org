I think that it's good to have the AU tag upfront. But, at the same time, I think that changing the story too much can kind of take away from what it is, which is a Harry Potter fanfiction. I mean the ones that totally change Harry's character, even his core character traits, until he's totally unrecognizable. At that point it's not even Harry anymore!
