Personally I prefer closer to canon with HP. I read for more of the characters I've come to love through the books. If there's a major character change, it has to be set up reaaally good for me to continue reading.

I also read to see more of the wizard world. If this is more the focus, it doesn't really matter since there is so much that is still unexplored!
