There are three types of fics I read:

1. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][For Want of a Nail]] fics

2. Fics that follow canon up to a specific point (like ignoring everything in canon past, say, Goblet of Fire)

3. Fics that take place in another world (usually a crossover, but sometimes dimensional travel fits here) featuring one or more mostly canon characters

I'm not a huge fan of fics that go completely off the rails and/or don't feature Harry or his friends. I'm also not a huge fan of fics that follow canon /too/ closely.

EDIT: Wow, this post makes me sound awfully picky...
