I disliked the Fic greatly ever since I first read it through. I thought it had many tedious parts, it treated Wandless Magic like something it wasn't, etc... I liked the premise but the whole randomly turning Harry and Ron into edgy emos doesn't sit right with me. Harry went from two years of having no awareness of his surroundings to having superhuman awareness over the death of one person he couldn't save and barely knew. (Let's not even discuss Harry attempting to go all 'Wizards need to be told what Magic they can and can't use over a couple anecdotes', and not realizing that the problem with that is that forcing people into a Communist Magical Regime is no better than what Grindelwald or Voldemort wanted.)

I think that the fic had potential, though. And it still has it as it managed to get cancelled at an advantageous time in Harry's school year. But I doubt the fic will be updated. I'm honestly just looking forward to someone making a spiritual successor to the fic and using that potential.
