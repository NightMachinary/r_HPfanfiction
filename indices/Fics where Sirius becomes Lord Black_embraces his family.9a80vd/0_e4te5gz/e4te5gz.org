Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] by Karmic Acumen. The first couple of chapters I admit is quit boring but it picks up to be something of an epic later on. Also, Sirius does not become a prominent character until later on halfway through the story.
