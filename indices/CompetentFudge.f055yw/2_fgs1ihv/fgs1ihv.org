I can't remember the title but I remembered reading a fic where in Harry's meeting with all his dead relatives because he died somehow, he also meets Fudges badass grandfather who gives him a message fir Cornelius. Basically it gives him the kick up the arse to get that stick out his arse and be more like his grandfather who he strived to be as a kid and is why he ran for minister.
