It has adults being competent and helpful, giving Harry the kind of support and training that he should have had from the beginning. In spite of how much better things go, they still face challenges and threats (a big problem in a lot of fics that have things go better than in canon is that the good guys have it too easy). The victory at the end of the story feels /earned/, far more so than the /deus ex machina/ Rowling used in canon. While RobSt's plotting can (especially in his earlier fics) be a bit clumsy, there were several times in Harry Crow where I reached the end of a chapter with my heart pounding, and developing that level of tension with nothing but written prose is /not/ easy.
