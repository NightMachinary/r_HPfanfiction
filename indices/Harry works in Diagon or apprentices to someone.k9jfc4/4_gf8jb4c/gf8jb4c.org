Relief from Nightmares by Ariel Sakura- Harry eventually is in a relationship with Blaise, but it is really interesting because he has an apprenticeship with Madam Pomfrey. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9614855/chapters/21721490]]

This one might not be 100% what you are looking for, but Harry is very knowledgable about potions and works on it with snape as a mentor, but its not an apprenticeship. Perception is Everything by Kendra James. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5926514/5/Perception-is-Everything]]

A fic that I never see anyone recommend is Cafe by PleaseDial123. Be warned it is 28 chapters, but is not finished. It is a fic where harry creates his own cafe in an alley that is right next to Diagon Alley. It is a good story, but I am not a fan of how the author portrayed harry's relationships, some of the relationships that harry gets into raise red flags for me due to age gap, or consent isssues, it has been a while since I read the fic. I just remember reading the fic when I was younger and I really liked the plot and I had never read a story where he owns a cafe , but also was a necromancer.
