I recently found this and it is a darker tone fic but I thought it was interesting.

Here is another one, though the romance part doesn't come into play until later.

I barely remember this one but its on my favorite list so I must have liked it at one point

I know that this one isn't a 100k or any where a long fic, but on a personal recommendation of something short, sweet, wholesome, and worth a read. It probably be good to read after the darker tone of Blindness
