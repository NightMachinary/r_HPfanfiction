Can't believe this whole thread hasn't had a mention of Vox Corporis, one of the best H/Hr fics out there and the best “Summer at the Grangers” fic, it is pretty slow paced though. If you google it, you can find copies!

From Portkey, some of my fave long fics were Forever Knight, Lynney's Magic Never Dies, Vicarious Leigh's fics and anything by Lorien829 (who's also on FFN). Apart from Vicarious Leigh, the other fics are all HHr classics so Idk if you've read them. I could give more Portkey recs if desired lol. You could try [[/r/hpharmony][r/hpharmony]] for more suggestions.
