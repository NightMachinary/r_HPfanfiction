Thanks.

This fic is probably the closest fit that I've read, but it's still not quite there.

This Harry apparates to Azkaban more or less on a whim, without even having a wand, basically completely wings it, would've failed if not for Sirius, and doesn't have anywhere to take Sirius afterwards. He is a kind of competent, but it's a sort of.. bumbling competence.
