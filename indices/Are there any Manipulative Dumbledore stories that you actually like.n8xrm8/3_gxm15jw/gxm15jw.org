It just completed yesterday, and it is brilliant and canon-compliant, Dumbledore manipulating things for the betterment of the many at the expense of the few.

(Also has some Remus/Sirius and a bit of the fallout of the Prank and starts with a brilliant "James and Lily captured by Death Eaters" escape scene and just read it because it's /so good/)

(Also, it's not mine. I'm just the only person to comment on it and that's a TRAGEDY.)

*Edit:* I am no longer the only person to comment on it! :D
