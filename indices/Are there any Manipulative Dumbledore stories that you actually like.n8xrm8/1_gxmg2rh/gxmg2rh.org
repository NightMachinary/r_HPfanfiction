It is hard to write Dumbledore and walk the lines between the manipulative fanfic Dumbledore, the Dumbledore from the books, and the Dumbledore from the movies. He is such a complicated character that people can take in any (sometimes horrible) direction.

I have been /trying/ to write a well-written (manipulative? misguided? damaged?) Dumbledore for my fic; a more PTSD ridden and aging version of Dumbledore who is trying to stop the second war, and failing, totally making mistakes based on his fear and experiences from the first war. He's not manipulative, he's just been through some shit he doesn't want to live through a second time. I was hoping to hit a sweet spot with how I portrayed that, but IDK I think it's still a bit tropey. Oh well. He's in there now. Most of the chapters turned out ok, with the exception of one my drunk self wrote where Dumbledore sets fire to the Hogwarts Express in a fit of rage. Oops.
