I think we must first define Dark Magic, is it just by Ministry definition? All magic that causes harm? A specific list of spells that require hate to power it? Blood Magic? Rituals?

I just think people blanket calling anything that's not a stunner as Dark Magic, and 'Harry can't be Dark' incredibly diminishes the story scope.

I think like Revan, it all depends on intent.
