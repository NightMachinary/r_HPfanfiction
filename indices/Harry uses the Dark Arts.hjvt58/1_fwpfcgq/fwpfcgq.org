By my understanding dark arts is just the British name for magic whose practice is outlawed (even though books of DM being banned is not completely out of reality considering what we see of the ministry it was also never outright said in cannon, so it's completely possible that it's legal to learn about it), and because of this Dark Wizards/Witches are only their word for criminals who use this kind of magic (to separate from others like Mundungus Fletcher).
