I can't help you with that as that is not my cup of tea, but have you tried something like DLP's Scryer? ([[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/]]) It has an Index of ff stories (idk which pages it includes outside of ff.net if any) with a powerful search engine. If the author just changed their name or you only remember some shady details it can be very helpful in tracking fics down.

Good luck finding it again either way!
