linkffn(8233291) is probably the best fem!Harry fic I've ever seen, and by far my favorite fanfic series, ever. It's almost complete, the author only has a few chapters left, and the four-part series has over a million words total.

It's a Twin-Who-Lived fanfic has a fem!Harry as the sister to the Boy Who Lived, who thought a squib and given to the Dursleys. They abandoned her, and she ends up on the streets, and eventually in a brothel, until Sirius finds her. It has an absolutely fascinating take on magic, rituals, the dark/light division, etc, and quite frankly an astounding amount of worldbuilding. It even has BOTH the pairings you're looking for, having the MC at various times date both men and women. I HIGHLY recommend it.
