For the most part I liked the Silent World of Cassandra Evans, but I had to drop it.

I don't mind gay pairings, but come on! Everyone and their mother is gay in that fic! Even if the wizarding world had no problems with homosexuality (which would be surprising given the focus on bloodlines, but maybe magic has a way for homosexual people to have trueborn children?), my suspension of disbelief was outright shattered when like the 5th gay couple crawled out of the woodwork. Oh look, and they're all close personal friends/half-siblings with Cassandra.

And every last couple is, on the very first try, like some "it's like we're fated to be together" love for the ages. At twelve!
