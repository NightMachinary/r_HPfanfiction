I doubt you're interested but I'm writing a dark fem!Harry story. It does have a fem!Ron as well, an ooc Dudley, and currently still standing at one measly chapter. I've recently gotten back into writing it, though, because I now have time to focus on it, so, hopefully, I can get some sort of headway into this.

It's also rated T but that's only because this will be covering the first year. It will go up in rating later on in the series, though. And it does feature Weasleys. It won't be on them for much longer, maybe three or four chapters, except for Ron.
