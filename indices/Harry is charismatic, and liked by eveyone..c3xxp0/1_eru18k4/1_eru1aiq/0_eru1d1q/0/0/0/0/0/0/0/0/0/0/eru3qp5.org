Yeah it does. That's sorta one of the points of this website. Discussion, exchanging ideas, arguing about them.

I didn't say I'm not arguing with you, I said I'm not arguing with what you want.

I'm asking you to clarify, because what you're saying doesn't make sense to me.

You want Harry to directly deal with Dumbledore and break Sirius out of Azkaban. What does that mean? Duel Dumbledore to the death with magic he doesn't know, then somehow not get locked up for it? Why would he break someone out of prison when he has never even heard of them?
