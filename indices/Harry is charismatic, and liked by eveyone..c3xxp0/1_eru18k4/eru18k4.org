There's linkffn(The Tinkerer by wickwynn) - After a lot of hard work Harry kind of stumbles into becoming rich and famous in the muggle world, so he gets used to being something of a celebrity. Also the Dursleys treated him better as a result.

When he gets to Hogwarts and realizes his situation, he actively cultivates a positive reputation. This fic goes pretty deep into the too-smart-11-year-olds trope though.
