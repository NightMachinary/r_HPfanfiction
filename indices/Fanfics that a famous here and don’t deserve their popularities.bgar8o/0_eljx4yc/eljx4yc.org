I've tried to read linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches) several times now, since it kept getting recommended, but I always start cringing at Harry's overpoweredness by the 2nd or 3rd chapter and I've yet to make it past the point where the time-traveled 17 year old Harry in a 8 year old body hits on an actual 8 year old by planning out how they'll get married but he's GOT to have multiple women in his life and she'll have to be okay with that.
