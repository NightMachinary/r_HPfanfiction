Look the writing seems good, maybe even great, but as [[/u/jakky567]] said, it seems a bit forced. Harry is so far from a dark lord that you have to devise this perfect situation that will push him into it.

The premise requires so much convenience that it's like the opposite of canon, where instead of a pretty standard fantasy setup followed by a series of conveniences, instead it is this super convenient setup that causes it to play out in the way the author wants it to. I just don't buy it, and because of that it didn't grab me.

And to be clear, I don't hate it. Not in the least. I just don't like it.
