Not OP, but here's briefly why I'm unimpressed by it.

By the 19th time Harry mentions that 1) he doesn't want to but goddamn he'll be a Dark Lord cuz that what needs doing 2) he's not all Black but he's got the Black family cookoo, there's no more space in my skull to roll my eyes. "Slytherin-Gryffindor Dark Lord". Dark Lord being an official position, like Harry's reluctantly taking a post on the Shadow Cabinet or something. The timeskip skips over the interesting part of the story. Everything up until then seemed like a drawn out prologue to actual Dark Lordship, but then there's a timeskip to Harry Dark Lording over Britain. The author skipped the second half of the story, the ~100k words between "GGRRR burn it all" and Harry being the enthroned Dark Lord of Britain.

It's like Delenda Est if the author wrote the boring half first and then didn't write the cool half at all.

Everyone seemed to jump on the bandwagon very quickly. Not that post war Harry doesn't have the star power to just magnet people to himself, but I'd have liked at least a few bumps on that road.

I found it rather uneventful as a dark Harry story and unfinished as a Dark Lord Harry novel.
