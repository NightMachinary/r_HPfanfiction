I'll provide some reasons I love it:

- It's well written and engaging
- It's a compact story that doesn't really have a slow spot or deviation from the main plot, unlike most longer fics recommended here.
- It has a believable Dark Harry. He isn't a Machiavellian 11 year old and he doesn't intend to conquer the world - he just found a point he wasn't willing to bend on and is now an adult who can choose to break from societies rules if he's willing to pay the price.
- Public opinion turning further against werewolves post-DH fits perfectly with everything we learned about Wizarding Britain in canon.
- Harry gets a new signature spell, but not because he suddenly develops a knack for studying - he learns by practicing (and the fic doesn't slog through descriptions of it, thankfully), echoing how he learned in canon.
- No bashing of anyone in the trio, they're all good and prominent characters, and the side characters get fleshed out nicely.

Was there anything specific you disliked about it? Or did it just not hold your interest?
