Seventh Horcrux. To be fair, this would have worked if it was, say, four or five chapters. Instead it's 100k words that repeat the same joke over and over again.

Novocaine. Haven't seen this one recced on here for a while but it never should have been. Robotic characters spend their time talking accountancy and management. The only people who can really like this story are loss-adjusters.

And I'm afraid it's time to include The Mind Arts. A pity because it showed a lot of promise but I think the plot has started to meander and a lot of the conflict seems manufactured. It's not a bad story per se but I think it gets recced far more often than it deserves.
