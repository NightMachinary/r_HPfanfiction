That author frustrates me like no other, sometimes when I look for some more obscure pairings there is a moment of excitement when I find a story with a decent amount of of words only to be immediately extinguished when I see it is written by him. How he has managed to churn out a truly impressive amount of content over the years and somehow not get any better is beyond me. I find his smut genuinely terrible as well, there is no feelings or build up or anything, he may as well just be someone smacking 2 wooden dolls together for all the effect is has.
