I tried to read Grow Young With Me just because it is so popular, even though I find the idea of Harry as a romantic figure faintly laughable. I wouldn't call it trash but I did think it was a blatant self-insert with no discernible plot. And I do feel a plot is the number one requirement in any work of fiction.
