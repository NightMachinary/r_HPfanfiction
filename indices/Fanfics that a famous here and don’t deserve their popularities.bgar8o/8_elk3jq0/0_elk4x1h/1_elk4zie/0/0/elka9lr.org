To be honest, I'm not sure it's that difficult to pick holes in those two.

Grow Young With Me, if you're cynically minded, has many problems. It is overly saccharine in places and seems to delight in trying to enforce 'feels' upon the reader, often going out of its way to do so. This has knock on effects for the pacing, which is slowed by the need to beat the reader over the head with emotions. If you're the kind of person who hates Pixar for playing so brazenly with emotions, I imagine there's a lot to hate in Grow Young With Me.

That said, I'm the one who recced that story on DLP, so I'm probably not the right person to deliver a scathing review.

The Shadow of Angmar is much easier to pick apart, in my opinion. While the style is clearly a choice, it is not hard to see someone disliking the unwieldy sentence structure or word-choice.

The biggest issue, however, is the use of characters and places as disposable scenery. People come and go like they're on a tread-mill. The reader is never really able to build a relationship with any of the supporting characters, as they are all ephemeral.

This has knock-on effects, I suspect many readers do not see the point in becoming invested in new characters as they appear, as by now they've realised that the character will likely only appear for a couple of chapters before they are gone forever.

Now, all you really need to do is to take those points, add a few more complaints (Pick from: Harry isn't Harry, too many self-congratulatory A/Ns, Location-porn is utterly formulaic, all Harry does is steal other people's thunder, author's understanding of canon doesn't match mine... etc), wrap it up in an overly lengthy angry diatribe, and voila! They're trash.

Everything has issues. Whether those issues render a story unreadable are entirely down to taste.
