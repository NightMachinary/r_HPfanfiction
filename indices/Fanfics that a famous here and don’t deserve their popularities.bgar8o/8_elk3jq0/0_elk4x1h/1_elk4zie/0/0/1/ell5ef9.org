  To be honest, I'm not sure it's that difficult to pick holes in those two.

  That said, I'm the one who recced that story on DLP, so I'm probably not the right person to deliver a scathing review.

While I can pretty much agree with your other points, you shouldn't worry about this one overly much. Your ANs are some of the best in the fandom, and I often use them as examples for how to do them right.

Yeah perhaps you pat yourself on the back a bit more than is strictly necessarily, but it's largely well deserved. In any case, you manage to provide interesting ancillary information without using without relying on it as a crutch, while also building a rapport with your readers.
