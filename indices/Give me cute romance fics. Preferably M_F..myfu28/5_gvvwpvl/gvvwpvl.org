Shameless self-promo: I've got a bunch of post-war SSHG that I think qualify as cute romance, listed below in increasing wordcount order. In all of these, she's an adult and /not/ his student.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26580946][So You Think That's an Age Gap]](1900 words) is a one-shot slight-AU where everyone survived, inspired by a random thought about SSHG and RLNT going on a double-date.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27293059][Constellations Above the Bonfires]] (3300 words) immerses you in a 2-hour span of a Halloween celebration in Hogsmeade. Reviews describe it as "bewitching" and "sweet" and "warm."

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29359479/chapters/72119202][Letters by Candlelight]] (10k over 3 chapters) covers several months after the Battle of Hogwarts, when Snape and Hermione are both just looking for some privacy to sort themselves out. Also pokes fun at the SSHG cliches describing their eyes, as a sort of in-joke for anyone familiar with the ship. Final scene is smutty, but there's a warning so it's skippable.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28292328/chapters/69327945][Fridays I'm in Love]] (27k over 5 chapters) is a bit more /serious/ and digs into a few traumas for both of them, so mind the tags. Features a Healer!Snape who can barely speak after Nagini's attack. Reviews describe it as "unique" and "a cute story" and a "little gem" and I'd say this is by far my best HEA fic.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27063943/chapters/66078676][The Answer is No]] (37k across 4 chapters) is really just a smutty roleplay that my awesome RP partner agreed to publish with me. If you want to see the typical schoolgirl kink flipped on its head (I mean, seriously, it's about time someone put /him/ in detention for his behavior!) then this might be a good one :)
