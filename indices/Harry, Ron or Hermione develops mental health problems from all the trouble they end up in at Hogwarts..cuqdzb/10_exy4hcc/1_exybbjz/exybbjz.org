That's an excellent point. I don't know why you're being downvoted for having a differing opinion. In my case, I'd extend that to any kind of fiction or film. We don't need to be made aware of harsh realities through the medium of entertainment. Real life or, like you said, non-fiction is sufficient for that.

I've always found affluent people to be the main consumers of tragedy porn. They've themselves never faced the true meaning of grief, betrayal and never-ending struggle and thus have no problem in sitting through a depiction of such stuff while casually munching popcorn.

Yes, there's tragedy to be seen in the Harry Potter series - but there's a satisfaction at the end; there's an ending that gives meaning to all the sacrifices over the previous chapters and books. Compare that to something like the movie, Legends of the Fall, or even a classic like Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchaali. Both of them are incredibly beautiful movies - but, with both of them, you have to witness a family being completely destroyed and torn asunder for no reason other than the vagaries of life and then expect us to quietly accept this tragedy once the movie ends. Nope, not for me.
