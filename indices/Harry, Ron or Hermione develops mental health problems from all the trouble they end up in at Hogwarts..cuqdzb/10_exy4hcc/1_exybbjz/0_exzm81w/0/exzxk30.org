Oh, definitely. I never knew about Schizophrenia until I watched A Beautiful Mind in high school - and look at the kind of beautiful sensitivity the movie utilized to address the topic.

I personally find any plot-line dealing with a close family member's death very, very hard to digest, but that doesn't mean I've never found something that could keep me engaged in spite of that. I wept through both We Bought a Zoo as well as After Life. Both of them had some incredibly heart-breaking moments but at least there was some tiny sense of happiness at the end - and that made all that struggle worthwhile.
