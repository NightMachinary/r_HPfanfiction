I'd actually like to say, I personally find reading stories that talk about sensitive topics relieving. Both because it normalizes the topic a little more, which is important because a lot of shitty realities of life are seemingly ignored because it's uncomfortable. And because being able to relate to a character or reading a story about going through similar issues can be cathartic in a way.
