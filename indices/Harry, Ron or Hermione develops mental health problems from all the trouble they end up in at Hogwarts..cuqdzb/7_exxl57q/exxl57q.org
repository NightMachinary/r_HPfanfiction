linkffn(Saving Connor by Lightning On The Wave)

*VERY* long series, eventual gay relationship, lots and lots of emotional damage and struggle to heal and learn to open up to people along the way. Also goes very in depth to pureblood customs and courtesies. You'll either love it or hate it, I personally think it drastically improves in the second book so if you can power through the first one it's worth it.

Edit. Rest of the series is on the authors profile. Might take you months to read, each book takes up 1 year just like canon
