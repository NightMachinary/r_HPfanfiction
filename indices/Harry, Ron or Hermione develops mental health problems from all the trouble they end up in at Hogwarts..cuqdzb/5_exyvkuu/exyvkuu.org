Linkffn(The Arithmancer) has Hermione visit a psychotherapist after each year's crazyness, with somewhat edited muggle friendly versions of what happened. After year 7 there's a long talk about how things really happened and how to proceed with PTSD therapy after the huge battle of Hogwarts. It's only a small part of the story but one I liked very much.
