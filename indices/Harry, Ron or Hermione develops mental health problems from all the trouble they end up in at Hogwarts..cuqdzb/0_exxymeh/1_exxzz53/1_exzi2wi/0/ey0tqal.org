I mean this is reddit. With a 2 sentence story people will list all the mental illnesses the person in the story has.

OP: So we charged this guys credit card 18 times in a row by mistake and he came into the store afterwards and yelled at us for no reason. He was mad even after i politely informed him "not our problem asshole, get the fuck out of our store" then my manager got all mad as well for no reason.

Reddit: Oh he must have been angry because he has Bi Polar Disorder, OCD and Locked In Syndrome.

Its annoying because mental health is a serious subject but any jackass who has been on the internet thinks they can diagnose it.
