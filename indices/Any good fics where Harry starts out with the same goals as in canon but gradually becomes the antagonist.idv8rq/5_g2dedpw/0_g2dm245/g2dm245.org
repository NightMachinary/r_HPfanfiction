This has nothing to do with Harry Potter, but I once read a novel called Souls in the Great Machine that goes through a complete role reversal with two of the main characters. The primary protagonist becomes a clear antagonist, and one of the early antagonists becomes the main protagonist. Made for a very interesting read.
