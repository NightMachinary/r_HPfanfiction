Exactly, and this does happen on longer works.

Take Star Wars, Anakin goes from protagonist to antagonist in the movies. But in Darth Vader comics he is the Protagonist, despite being a villain.

Protagonist just mean they are the main character, Antagonist is someone who wants to hinder the Protagonist or go against them.
