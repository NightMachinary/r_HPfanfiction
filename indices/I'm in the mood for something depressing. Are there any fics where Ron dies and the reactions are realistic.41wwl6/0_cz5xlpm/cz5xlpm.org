*Stages of Hope*, linkffn(6892925). What Harry and Hermione went through was utterly traumatizing: [[/spoiler][Both Ron and Ginny were killed, as with most of the Weasley family. The level of affection Harry and Hermione showed each other was stronger than most Harmony shipping stories, but the author never brought them together]]

*Harry Potter's Promise*, linkffn(3974563). One shot, but very emotional story [[/spoiler][Before the final battle, Ron made Harry to promise to take care of Hermione if something happened to him. Ron died, and Ginny was slightly crippled. The promise must be full filled, what would Harry do?]]
