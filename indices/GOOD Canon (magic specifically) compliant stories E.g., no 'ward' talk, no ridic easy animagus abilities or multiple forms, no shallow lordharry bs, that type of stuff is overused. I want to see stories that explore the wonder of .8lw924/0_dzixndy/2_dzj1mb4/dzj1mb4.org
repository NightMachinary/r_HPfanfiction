What's you update rate, this seems like a story to keep my eye on. Also if possible do you have an estimate on when you'll complete, or at least get to OOTP year. Sorry, it's just I don't start reading stories that follow canon(as in first year Philisopher's stone, second Basalisk, third Sirius(unless freed earlier), and fourth GOF) until it gets past GOF. It's just before that he's still naive(a bit), and hasn't really gone through the hell that is Voldemort's resurrection(with the lead up in the earlier books).

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
