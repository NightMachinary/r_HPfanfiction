Wards are canon (under a different namel, but that aside I'm writing a story where Harry's introduction to magic as a young kid causes him to see it as intuitive. So the way he uses magic wandlessly isn't really about having an intellectual understanding of a spell he's trying to cast, but about figuring out in his head how he wants his magic to act. Warning: I'm only four chapters in so far.
