Wandless magic is not, outside of the Third movie, suggested to require an incantation. Otherwise accidental magic would be impossible! This Harry is only eight right now, he wouldn't have a wand.

Anyway, the Dolohov example really shows (I think) that Dolohov simply wasn't skilled enough with that curse to cast it full power without the incantation.
