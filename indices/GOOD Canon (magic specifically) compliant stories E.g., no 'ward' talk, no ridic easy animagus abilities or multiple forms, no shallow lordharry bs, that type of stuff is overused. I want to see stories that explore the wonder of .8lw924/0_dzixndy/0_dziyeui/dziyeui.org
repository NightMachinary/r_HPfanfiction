While that sounds interesting, that doesn't seem to fit the prompt. There's no canon basis for what you're developing. Even silent spells are show to be 'said' in the person's head, we've evidence of a curse that's supposed to be spoken aloud being weaker when silently cast in Dolohov's purple flame curse, and of course the whole 'leviOsa' business. The words are show to have power.
