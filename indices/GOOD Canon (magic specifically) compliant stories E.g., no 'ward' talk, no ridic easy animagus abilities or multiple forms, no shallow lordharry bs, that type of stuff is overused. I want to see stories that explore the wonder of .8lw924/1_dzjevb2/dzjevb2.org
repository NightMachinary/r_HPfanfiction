There's 2 that I know, and both are from the same author. linkffn(Brightest Witch and the Darkest House; Potter vs Paradox).

The author explores canon magic to a level where it doesn't even seem like it, but it is. He also explains where and why that's considered canon on some A/N, but its mostly from Pottermore, I think.
