I'm good with slash pairings. I just try to avoid what I feel to be potentially abusive relationships, where one party has been awful, hence the nixing of Draco, Severus, and Voldemort.

I just read All the Young Dudes, which rekindled my love of the HP fandom (and broke my heart), but I understand that fics of that caliber or rare.

Your recs are definitely going on the list. Thanks!
