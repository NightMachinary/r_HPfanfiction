Are you ok with other slash pairings? All my favourite stories are mostly plot and story based anyway but I highly recommend these..

​

linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down) -- 10/10. Harry ends up back in 1976 but doesn't find his parents. Instead ends up being dragged into the war on his own terms. Its fantastic. Theres mystery and Harry grows up and has to make choices and the characters are great and its funny and sad and terrifying at times. Couldn't recommend more.

​

linkao3(All The Young Dudes by MissKingBean89) -- 10/10. The OG Wolfstar story but its so much more. It follows a little carehome kid Remus from 1st year to OoTP. Fully canon compliant. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll fall in love with Grant and then cry some more. The side plots are great, the characters are great. Its all just great!

​

linkao3(Their Hiding Inside Me by TheDivineComedian) -- 10/10. Everything by TheDivineComedian is incredible you should read all their work. This one is an outside look on Sirius's family? But Regulus in it is just eugh, fantastic!!!

I have a bunch of others. Id you dont want Harry/people pairings I recommend looking at Marauder Era fanfics? Some of them are genuinely brilliant and the only real pairing you see is Wolfstar (Remus/Sirius) which sounds odd but really if you go with it, it makes PoA and OoTP WAAAY sadder stories.
