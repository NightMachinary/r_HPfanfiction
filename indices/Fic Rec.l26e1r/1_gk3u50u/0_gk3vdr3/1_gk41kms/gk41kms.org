  Hello journal. Today we have a prompt. Our prompt is our favrit family tradition. I do not have a favrit family tradition because I do not have a family. Signed, Harry Potter.

  Harry Potter's third form journal. A peek at pre-Hogwarts life.
#+end_quote

My favourite pre-hogwarts fic- Harry's childhood with the Dursley's told through his third-form journal. Still a WIP, but ends at a note that feels complete.

  She may not have been able to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Ginny refuses to go down without a fight. As war approaches, Ginny returns to Hogwarts to resurrect Dumbledore's Army and face the darkest year the wizarding world has ever seen.
#+end_quote

Canon-compliant narration of what happened at Hogwarts while the trio were out hunting horcruxes. Ginny POV. Deals with the revival of the DA, and a few mysteries.

#+begin_quote
  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.

  Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
#+end_quote

My favourite Dark-Lord Harry fic- I try to rec this whenever I can.

4.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/552828/chapters/985108][Stunning Shifts]]:

#+begin_quote
  During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger.
#+end_quote

A dimension travel fic, except Harry isn't the only one who travels back. (FYI: the others who travel with Harry are Ron, Hermione, Luna, Blaise and Draco.) It's a Gen-fic. (WIP)
