Also, Here's oneshots if you want to read them:

1.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12391806][where there is a will]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry writes the first draft of his will when he is fourteen.
#+end_quote

I really love the trio portrayal in this. It's pretty morbid, but pretty much highlights the danger in Harry's environment for the entirity of canon.

2.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13106128/1/A-Clean-Shave][A Clean Shave]]:

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry's being an orphan has an unexpected side-effect, and Ron helps him out---learning a lesson in gratitude along the way.
#+end_quote

My favourite Harry-Ron friendship fic.

3.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651][Sisyphus]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all.
#+end_quote

(Be warned- this is pretty dark.) A unique twist to the peggy-sue time travel trope.

4.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9191315/chapters/20857637][tell me whether he is dead]]:

#+begin_quote
  Harry suffers a few side effects from dying but not dying.
#+end_quote

Trio friendship fluff. Can be read as platonic, or Harry/Hermione/Ron.

5.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]]:

#+begin_quote
  A curse regresses Harry to his seventeen year old self, physically and mentally. He doesn't recognise this strange peaceful wizarding world, but there are two people he does recognise: Ron and Hermione.
#+end_quote

Another trio-friendship oneshot.

6.[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/][Cauterize]]:

#+begin_quote
  "Of course it's missing something vital. That's the point." Dennis Creevey takes up his brother's camera after the war.
#+end_quote

This is a very popular oneshot. Post-war.

7.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/400319][Eternal Return]]:

#+begin_quote
  "For the Greater Good. Harry understands this.
#+end_quote

A creepy time-loop fic. Read the first few sentences and you'll get the main plot.

8.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11746692][Five Facts you won't find in 'Hogwarts: A History']]:

What it says on the tin.

9.[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16957743][for as long as you need us]]:

#+begin_quote
  With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses.
#+end_quote

Harry/Ron/Hermione.
