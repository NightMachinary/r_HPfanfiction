Okay hi. If you haven't read this one, you need to it's so great. It has two sequels, and several one shots and alternate ending things as well so it'll keep you busy for a while. I'll just link the first one.

It's basically a "What if instead of trying to kill Harry as a baby, Voldemort kidnapped him instead?" So James and Lily survive, while Harry's raised by Voldemort. I don't want to spoil anything, so let me just say it's very good and if you haven't you NEED to read it. Okay bye.

Edit: Ok here's a few more. Make sure you read the one above first, but in case you need something else.

This one isn't that long, but it was decent I think. Harry time travels to when his parent's were his age for like a week.

I haven't read this in a whille, but I think it was good. Harry travels to a dimension where Harry and Lily died, but James survived.
