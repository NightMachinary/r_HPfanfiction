That's basically the only viable explanation of her behaviour. When you start to work on description of real human being Petunia (instead of the fairy-tale exaggeration seen through the eyes of the abused rebellious teenager, which is what we have in the books), it is really hard to describe such real person well. So, I really like Petunia paranoid with the cause in linkffn(Lion Unity by Fruitality) (“magic destroys everything it touches”) or thoroughly sceptical Petunia in linkffn(Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee). I have tried to explain it myself in [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html#the-story-of-petunia][this chapter of my very Alpha, not even Beta story]] (I will soon move it to linkao3(23443483)).
