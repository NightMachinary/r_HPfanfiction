As a massive Star Wars fan, I mostly like your titles. The only one I don't like is Battle of Hogwarts. It's too much of a singular event and not enough of an overarching moment. Look at STAR WARS EPISODE II ATTACK OF THE CLONES. While this may be a bit of a description of the Battle of Geonosis, it's not quite a literal title. It's more of a description of the clones mere existence on the Galaxy and the Jedi. Not sure what would be a good title for DH. I'm not a super creative man, but I'll give it some thought.

My two favorites would definitely be A New Beginning (though maybe Birth of Hope might be better?) and the clear winner is Shadow of Slytherin. Christ on a bike that's good. Second least favorite would be The Dark Lord's Secret.
