This is my ranks in terms of not actively killing or endangering students:

Trelawny: She's solid. She never tried to murder anyone or neglected any students to the point that their health was negatively affected.

Hagrid: Never knowingly endangered students. Has questionable views on what animals are safe for kids to interact with but as far as we know the hippogriff scratch was the worst incident and Draco was warned repeatedly not to be a butthole to the animal. Actually really good at teaching about the creatures themselves.

McGonagall: She is a super cool lady and great teacher. I put her below Hagrid and Trelawney because she made Neville wait outside the Gryffindor common room alone in the hallway when freaking Sirius Black had gotten into the castle twice and sliced Gryffindor stuff up both times. Like, if he was a real serial killer Neville could have really be dead. That was her one not cool moment though.

Snape: Okay it was super hard figuring out where to put him because 1. he's a giant asshole to kids. But 2. he literally saves their lives all the time. Like Harry's alone several times. I hate to think how many students would have been murdered during book 7 if he wasn't there to run interference on the Carrows.

Dumbledore: He's hard to place on the list, so I just stuck him here. He was actively trying to protect the students. Had lots of questionable judgement in staff and actions though. Like, LOTS. But he was never trying to hurt or kill anyone, and he did keep a lot of people alive with his presence deterring evil shenanigans.

Slughorn: Neglected less talented students in favor of grooming others to increase his own wealth/status. Kinda creepy. But, he never tried to hurt anyone. The main reason I put him down here is because he never managed to remember Ron's name and wasn't able to act appropriately to save Ron when Ron was poisoned, despite being a supposed potions master.

Lupin: Kept Sirius' animagus status secret from the ministry and Dumbledore, despite Sirius successfully infiltrating the school twice and slashing up Ron's bed with a knife in what was believed to be an attempt on Harry's life. Also failed to disclose the secret tunnels to the shrieking shack and Hogsmeade. I mean, he's a cool guy and I like him but as far as teachers go that wasn't okay.

Lockhart: Tried to erase students' brains and was going to leave one to die, but didn't actively put them in that situation. Basically was a benevolent narcissist that got nasty when backed into a corner.

Umbridge: Used torture and crap on students. Horrible person. The only reason she's not lower on the list is she did not openly try to murder a student.

Carrows: Used torture on students regularly and taught students to torture each other, with unforgivable curses. Unclear whether they actually killed any students.

Quirrel: Tried to murder students and also tried to resurrect Voldemort. Not cool

Moody/Crouch: Actually DID murder a student and resurrected Voldemort. Super not cool.
