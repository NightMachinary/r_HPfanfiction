Let me clarify: I am not making a political statment, especially about a fictional world whose politics don't mean anything to me, I honestly wouldn't waste my time doing something as pointless as that.

The question was how do I rate them as teachers. To be a good teacher (in my opinion), one must actually teach something. I am not arguing the morality of their curriculum, but rather their effectiveness at communicating it, which is why they rank where they do.

To be honest, idk why you are making such a big deal out of this. It is just a post about a fictional thing, magic is not real, neither are the Carrows. The propaganda and hatred that they promote is fiction as well.

You clearly have a passion for social justice, perhaps you could channel it towards more productive things than arguing with me on this form. There are many real world issues that are much more pressing than fictional classism (for example real classism,) maybe you should direct your energies in such a direction instead.
