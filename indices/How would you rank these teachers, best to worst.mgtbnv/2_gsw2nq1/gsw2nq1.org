I don't know about others but Dumbledore was a good teacher, obviously he wasn't a good headmaster though. Most of his acts we dislike were his duties as headmaster. As a teacher, he was supposed to be best and students adored him (not sure but the vibe I got from Fantastic beasts and parts of HP series).

Since OP asked for teacher, so I'll put dumbledore at top, Minerva at second and so on.
