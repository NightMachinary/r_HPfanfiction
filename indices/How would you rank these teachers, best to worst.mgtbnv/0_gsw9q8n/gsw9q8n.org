Not counting Dumbledore, since he's not a classroom teacher.

Crouch!Moody, McGonagall, Lupin/Slughorn, Snape, Hagrid, Lockhart, Trelawney, Umbridge, Carrows.

Can't really remember what Quirrell was like as a teacher, so I won't count him either.

I put Crouch!Moody first based on his actual teaching ability, his â€˜Moody' personality and the usefulness of his subject, not the fact that he was a traitor.
