It's basically the opposite of a Riddle-esque character, but I was recently feeling similarly bummed out by fanfic, and the fic /What's Her Name In Hufflepuff/ helped bring me back. It's basically a self-insert story, but done very well, and it has a delightful sense of humour and does manage to capture a sense of magic of the world that you don't often see.
