Ink Stains Harry becomes trapped in Tom Riddles Diary and eventually turns up in the hands of Bruce Banner.

You might want to visit my faves on Fanfiction.com. My name is beloved of Naruto. I'm 22 I just haven't changed my name on there.

Search my name and you will find that I haven't published anything. I do however have an epically long fanfic list. I suggest selecting Harry Potter rather than manually looking through the whole thing.

I have 519 Harry Potter fanfics saved.

Avengers + Harry Potter crossovers, Time-travel, Harry surrenders to Voldemort, Harry/Voldemort, Founders heir Harry, bashing stories, master of death stories, well written(in my opinion) abuse stories, Adopted Harry (An adoption fic of note is Harry Crow, it is the only one I know about where Harry is adopted by the Goblins.) Harry Potter +Transformers crossover

I could list more but I feel this is becoming long.

The reason I did this instead of listing names is because there are a lot of ones I like.

I hope you will like at least a couple within my favorites section.
