Your interests in general seem to align more towards younger authors, so you're probably not going to find anything like a decent plot or well written stories. I'm not saying that to be mean, but I've been around HP fanfiction for over a decade, and none of the stories you're looking for can even really be considered average. If someone can suggest something like that, I'll eat my hat.

But you're in the wrong subreddit, or at least here in the wrong week. Everything that isn't 'normal' seems to be getting downvoted into last year.
