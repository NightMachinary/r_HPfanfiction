linkffn(Blackpool) is one of my all-time favorites, and it's fairly new. So if you haven't been read hp fanfic in a while, you probably haven't stumbled on it. It's a coming of age story about Regulus Black, and it has a ton of things you're looking for: creative plot, compelling mystery, complex characters, incredible writing, themes of dark magic and pureblood culture (though Regulus never really embraces either). No pairings.

Nothing else really measures up to it, imho.
