I recently finished reading this one, after a recommendation on here. Really nice! Takes after the original books. linkffn(the curse of durand)

Edit: I also really liked linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation) if you're looking for something with the same feeling as the books.

For something different, I found linkffn(promises unbroken) really interesting, as well as linkffn(hogwarts battle school).

All time favourite authors are taure and autumn souls, check out linkffn(iris potter and the goblet's surprise) or linkffn(the one he feared)
