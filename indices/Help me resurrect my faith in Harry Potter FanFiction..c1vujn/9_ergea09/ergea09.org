If you like Voldemort centric fics, here are some:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is the most popular fic on this sub by a wide margin.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13275002/1/The-Imposter-Complex][The Imposter Complex]], linkffn(13275002), is Diary Riddle vs Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210), has a genre savvy SI replacing Voldemort just before he was about to kill Lily. Well, he is still a totally evil SOB, but at least he is a lot smarter and has some humors.

Voldemort scores total victory in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853).

Other fics with Riddle like MCs:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): Extreme AU in both magical and muggle worlds. James and Lily survived Halloween 1981 and Harry never went to Hogwarts. But he's a far more cunning and ruthless person than in canon. Voldemort got his body back in 2005, changed his strategy completely. and is doing rather well as of 2023.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Another very popular fic on this sub. It's canon compliant until the end of DH, but then Harry had it enough, and magical Britain will eventually ruled by the dark Trio. Very heavy emphasis on dark magic in this fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald breaks out after Dumbledore's murder at the end of HBP. He vows to avenge his lover's murder and offers to help Harry. Together, they spread chaos and revolutions across Europe. Grindelwald's inner thoughts are very fun to read, especially when they involve Dumbledore.
