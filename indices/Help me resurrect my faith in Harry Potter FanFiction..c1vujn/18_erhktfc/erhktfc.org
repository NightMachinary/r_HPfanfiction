Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux; Grow Young With Me; Black Luminary; Renascentia Into The Fire) I've never tried to link multiple fics in a single comment before; not sure if I did that right. If not, I'll amend it in a mo'. Anyways, here are my pitches, in order:

Accidental Horcrux follows the development of a Harry who is raised by an awakened scarcrux to be Voldemort's apprentice. Harry tries very hard to be moral while also being unfailingly loyal to "Tom," as he calls the scarcrux and whom he sees as a separate person from "Voldemort Prime," which is tricky, since, y'know, Tom is an amoral mass murderer. I'm not giving this a great sell, but I can't recommend it highly enough.

Grow Young With Me is a het romance, so you might pass it up on those grounds, but you'd be missing out if you did. It follows a widowed Harry struggling to raise three children on his own several years after Ginny's death, which is complicated further when a muggle woman befriends him (which takes a while, since he's /very/ closed off). The romance itself is very slowly and believably developed, too: we're about 200K words in (if memory serves), and we're still at the "just friends, one of whom has a massive crush on the other" phase.

Black Luminary is the one I'm most dubious about recommending. It starts off not great, and it continues on for a while not great, and the author isn't a native English speaker, which shows in a lot of awkward phrasinges and purple prose, and also it's kind of, for lack of a better term, anime-y, but it's got some stuff going for it if you can get past all that. It's a massive AU where the war with Grindelwald had a much bigger impact on Britain, Voldemort never rose to power, and Harry became a pariah after being adopted into the Black family. If you can power through an underwhelming first year, you might enjoy the later stuff.

Renascentia is a somewhat hesitant recommendation, since I haven't finished it (I was planning to wait until the author finished it to read the whole thing at once, then I never actually went back to it. Oops.), but I recently reread the first chapter and enjoyed it, and I plan to finally finish it soon. Maybe. Hopefully. Anyways, it's about Regulus surviving the Cave Incident and traveling back to Britain to help stop Voldemort. My recollection is that he spends most of his time hiding from the Order at Grimmauld Place and bickering with Sirius, which doesn't sound super compelling, but I do remember enjoying it.

Edit because I'm a dumbass: I linked the Renascentia sequel rather than the original, but you can't find the original on the author's page, if you're interested.
