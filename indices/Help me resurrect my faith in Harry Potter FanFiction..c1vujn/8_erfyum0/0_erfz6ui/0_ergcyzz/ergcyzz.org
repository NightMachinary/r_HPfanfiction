Better than the Jen Black series, it's good enough to be published in my opinion. I think one of the things I enjoy about it, is the fact that despite being magical, the characters are mostly realistic. Alex is still a pretty convincing 11 year old girl, and she grows up realistically...and the adults are also adults. Mostly.

And there's no casual acceptance of child molesters by main characters, either, which has that going for it.
