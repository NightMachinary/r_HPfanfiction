Tales From Durmstrang: Poisoned Bloodlines

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18720031/chapters/44400358]]

A story about Durmstrang that is about Nordic OC characters from Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Follows canon extremely closely and takes everything in consideration.

Many canon characters like Draco, Krum, Newt and Grindelwald appears.

Quite a dark and cynical fic. But I love writing it.
