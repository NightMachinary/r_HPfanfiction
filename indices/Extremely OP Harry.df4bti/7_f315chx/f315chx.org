In Meaning of One by Sovran, which is a Hinny Soul Bond fic, there are three types of spells. In the first and second, you can't really over-power them, but the third you can. So Harry (and Ginny) has to worry about the Bat-Bogey Hex blowing people's noses off and Bluebell Flames causing massive deforestation. Unfortunately, Lumos and Wingardium Leviosa are unaffected.
