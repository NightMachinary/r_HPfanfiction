[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4400517/1/Ananke][Ananke]] is a good one, although it's incomplete.

Summary: A strange set of events sends the 19-year-old Lily into a terrible future where she and most of her friends are dead and the war is still on. Severus can't believe his luck. Can Lily change her fate? S/L

I'll also second the Come Once Again and Love Me recommendation. I don't think you'll find a better Snape/Lily story. Ananke comes close, but it's unfinished so it loses points.
