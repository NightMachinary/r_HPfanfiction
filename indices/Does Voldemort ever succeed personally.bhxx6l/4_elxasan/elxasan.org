I feel the same, kinda. It's a bit frustrating, to some extent, too.

We get into this world 10 years after his demise, everyone thinks he's dead but they're all still afraid to even utter his name. And then he appears and somehow every fight is lost. I particularly dislike it in OoTP movie when he fights Dumbledore in the ministry. It seems so easy for Dumbledore then. And it doesn't make that much sense. He wouldn't be this feared after a decade of absence, he wouldn't have succeeded in terrifying the whole community so utterly, if he wasn't more than what is shown in the end. It felt (to me) as if the last books didn't really mesure up to the power and terror he called for. And I'm so glad Draco didn't end up killing Dumbledore because it would have been terribly absurd to see him succeed (however willing to die Dumbledore was) when just before Voldemort failed.

So, yeah. He does succeed, a lot, like the previous answers say. But it still feels, for me, as if there is this disservice to his character when he's put in action. It just falls short, always (or often enough) and it makes it a bit comical because of the dichotomy between his impact/the fear he inspires in everyone, and the actions.

That's probably one of the reason I like to read Tom Riddle's era fics so much, in part. It satisfies my need for this really fearful figure that I was waiting for.

(I'm not sure if this answer makes much sense. But I'm glad to see someone thinks the same thing on this topic!)
