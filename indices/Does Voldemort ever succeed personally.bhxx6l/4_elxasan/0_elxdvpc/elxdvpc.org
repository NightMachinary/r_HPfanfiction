I admit I have a bunch of random thoughts but I'm spacing out the posts so no one realises what an idiot I am lol.

I suppose a different way too look at it is Voldemort is less of a war lord type, going here and there killing anyone in his way. He's more like a terrorist; sitting in the shadows and building this terrifying reputation by leading monster both figurative and literal. If you dare cross him or even say his name they'll turn up at your house and kill your family in cold blood. At that point Tom could be a squib and no one would dare whisper about it. But in the series it's played up that's he's actually super powerful, he could actually duel anyone up to and maybe even including the Albus Dumbledore, and he loses over and over.
