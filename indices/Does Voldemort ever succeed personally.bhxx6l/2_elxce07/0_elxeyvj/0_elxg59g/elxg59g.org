Exactly. Voldemort's three obsessions were as follows:

1. Cheat death: Failed spectacularly
2. Achieve power: Kinda sorta achieved this for one year while Harry and Co. were on the run during Deathly Hallows.
3. Beat Harry Potter: Failed at this over and over. Even when he won (using Harry's blood to resurrect himself) in his mind he failed because Harry escaped and he appeared weak in front of his followers. Harry ultimately defeated him because he was shrewder...something Voldemort would take personal offense to. Harry beat Voldemort's Avada Kedavra using fucking Expelliarmus. Epic failure.
