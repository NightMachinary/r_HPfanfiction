It's funny that he constantly stops the Death Eaters killing Harry so he recover his pride and prove he's unbeatable but he just keeps embarrassing himself. If Bellatrix kills Harry in OotP Voldemort has a clear shot to power. Yeah he would take a hit to his credibility but if he tortures anyone who thinks about it wrong eventually it'll go the way of his name.
