Voldemort's ultimate goal was to cheat death. He ended up dying much earlier than most wizards and witches...and this was after spending 10+ years of his shortened lifespan as a wraith. He may have won some battles and achieved power briefly but from a personal standpoint I would say he failed spectacularly.
