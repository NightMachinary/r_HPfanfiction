Yeah in the other response to me it is pointed out that Voldemort was likely trying to keep a low profile and I agree.

​

But I do point out that Voldemort in the graveyard is able to identify the reason that his killing curse rebounded on him and the reason Quirrel couldn't touch him (Lily's Sacrifice). I posit that Voldemort knew or suspected that another Killing Curse would fail, i.e. that he had already identified Lily's Sacrifice and knew that another killing curse probably wouldn't work, but didn't necessarily know that he wouldn't be able to touch him.

​

But, since we don't know what Voldemort knows/doesn't know during the first book, that is conjecture on my part.
