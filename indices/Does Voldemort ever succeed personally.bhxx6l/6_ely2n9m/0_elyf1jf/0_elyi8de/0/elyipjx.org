Well we don't really know what Voldemort does or doesn't know. We do know that later in the cemetery Voldemort is able to identify the reason that a) his Killing Curse rebounded on him, and b) that Quirrel couldn't touch him. So he may have known/suspected a killing curse wouldn't have worked, but not necessarily that he couldn't touch him.

But yes that is conjecture on my part. The reason he didn't try was most likely he trying to keep a low profile, especially around Dumbledore.
