It's a book with an incompetent villain.

If they really had the numbers that they had in the last battle and had control of the ministry, they could have easily banned apparition/floo for non-death eaters/sympathizers. If they did that and kept watch of undesirable individuals, they would have caught "unauthorized" meetings easily. I think they could have done this in the same way they tracked underage magic and the taboo on voldie's name.

And, they really should have had more death eaters at hogwarts and banned students from going home. They could have held the children hostage to keep the population compliant and fearful. Xeno Lovegood would be easily handled when he started printing those articles supporting Harry if they did it right. They wouldn't even have to kidnap Luna. The whole book 7 did not make sense since voldie did not really control hogwarts aside from having the carrows there. That's a lot of trust on Snape there to keep everyone in line and do the "right" thing to support his agenda.
