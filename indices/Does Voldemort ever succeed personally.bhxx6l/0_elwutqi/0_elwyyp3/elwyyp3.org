Yeah I totally agree he had victories and definitely achieved a lot of his over arching goals. I don't mean to say he's some kind of goofy character like Filch. It just kinda bothered me that he never wins in person on the page. Maybe that's a bit childish to want him to best some impressive wizards in a duel or something like that.

And I totally agree it's clear he was kicking ass before Harry killed him, the fact people won't say his name is an amazing way to show that in my opinion.
