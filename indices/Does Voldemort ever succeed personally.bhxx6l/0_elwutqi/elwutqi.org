Most of Voldemort "sucesses" came from before the book, during the 1st Blood War. While we don't have a lot of informations about what happened, one thing is sure, he was winning. Bagnold was the 3rd minister of this war and was here because her 2 predecessors were unable to deal with the crisis. The Auror were able to use Unforgivable but it didn't seem to change the war and the Order of the Phoenix was in ruin. Only the Prophecy and his destruction ended the war (mainly because all the people he Imperiused were suddenly free, even if it allowed several Death Eater to escape.

As for the books, Voldemort has 3 distincts objectives there, retrieve his body, take control of Wizarding Britain, and kill Harry Potter (to assure his immortality).

- His first objective is a victory, you can argue that the escape of Harry from the cemetery is a fail, but he still managed to come back. Even worse, his Death Eaters mostly came back allowing him to directly reform their previous structure and he even had one year to secure his power base.

- For taking power, he won too. He may not have enjoyed it too much since he was too busy trying to kill Harry, but he was the master of the country. The murder of Dumbledore was a victory too. Dumbledore used his assured death to organize his suicide in the hope it would block the fidelity of the Elder Wand, but at that time Voldemort didn't even know about it and just wanted his dead so he could take control of the Ministry and the school, and that's what he did. As for the Elder Wand, it's not even sure it would have worked since we don't really know how the fidelity works. Even without Draco intervention, would the Death of Snape by Nagini been enough to ensure it? Or, since magic is about intent, and that Dumbledore created his plan after knowing he was on borrowed time cause by a curse cast by Voldemort, would his Death, even alone in his bed, been enough for the wand to switch for Voldemort?

- The only thing Voldemort truly failed was to kill Harry Potter. And for this it's not really his fault. I mean the guy managed to cast the killing Curse on him 2 time, a spell supposed to kill EVERYONE. The 1st time, the baby is fine and he looses his body, the 2nd time his loose a soul fragment. Maybe he should have used a different spell (but it's his signature spell, like Expeliarmus is for Harry), or destroyed his body later, but this is caused by his arrogance.

In the end, even if Voldemort lost the war, I think he won most of the battles fought before.
