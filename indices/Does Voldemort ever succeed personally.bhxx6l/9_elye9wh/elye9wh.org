If he was true evil mastermind, we wouldn't have the books, or they would have been absolutely different.

The story required a really scary evil villain with bloody past and JKR created Voldemort. But her main hero is just a child without significant skills and abilities and therefore the villain had to step down to be on pair with him. As result we got stupid!Voldemort.

In real life Harry wouldn't survive his first year. Sad, but true.
