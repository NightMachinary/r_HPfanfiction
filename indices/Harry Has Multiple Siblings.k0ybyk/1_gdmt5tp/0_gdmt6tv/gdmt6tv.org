  What if Dudley wasn't an only child. What if a gift of Lily to her sister, along with the wards protecting Harry resulted lots of children in a household full of love instead of resentment. What if the wards were more powerful the more family that lived under them, What if the protection imparted by Lily to her son, also was imparted to those new magical children
