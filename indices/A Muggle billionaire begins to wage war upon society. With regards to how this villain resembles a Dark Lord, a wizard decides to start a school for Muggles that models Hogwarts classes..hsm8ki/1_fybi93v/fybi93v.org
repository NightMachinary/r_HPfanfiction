"Professor Dumbledore! We have a problem!"

Albus stared at the slightly disheveled Muggles Studies Professor and sighed. Albus loved teaching, he loved children. Even the disobedient, pranksters, or occasional serial murder. They were what made his life worth living.

Teachers, however, had been a constant pain since he entered the profession. At his ascension to headmaster, that has only gotten worse. Teachers were his punishments for his sins.

Dumbledore put on his best serene smile. Using his wand to pull up a chair for the professor, he opened, "Calm down Charity, and tell me what has happened from the beginning"

It took a good five minutes (and a good strong cup of tea) for Charity Burbage to calm down enough to tell her story.

"Well Albus, I happened to overhear some of our muggleborn students talking about an incredible development in the muggle world. Apparently certain muggles have started developing powers." She paused for a second, and then continued. "I verified with the portraits, of course, and they confirmed this has been a topic of conversation for the last few decades".

Dumbledore nodded at this. Portraits easedropping on muggleborns was, of course, entirely standard for Hogwarts. 90% of the Muggles Studies curriculum was created from those overhead conversations. Of course, the students themselves were not told. Dumbledore found students tended to... exaggerate when they were actually asked.

"Magical powers?" inquired Dumbledore. Charity shook her head.

"No, they call them meta-humans. They seem to be disjointed, much like wizards were before the magical schools were formed. They pop in when something is going wrong, like the Wizards of old". Charity frowned "But that is not the problem. Apparently, there is this one Muggle, a Lex Luther, who has made it his life goal to defeat the meta humans".

"Ahh" said Dumbledore, "That is to be expected. After all, before the wizards had schools we would often have different wizards fighting quite publicly".

"But that is just it! This Lex Luther doesn't have any powers!" exclaimed Charity. "It seems he goes up against the meta humans with only his brain and his money. A lot of money. He is apparently richer than Lucius Mafloy" charity shuttered, "there is apparently good ol' fashion witchhunting going on under our noses. Of course, most of the muggles are against this, but it is a clash of titans, most of them keep their heads down."

Dumbledore thought on this for some minutes. After a while, he said "We will have to gather more information. Clearly, magic has started to manifest itself in new and original ways. If the muggles already know about this, it may be too late to fold them into our society." Albus paused dramatically, "But we can't afford to abandon our kindred. I'll have to reach out to the Americans and see what they know of the situation". Preferably, of course, without Lucius Malfoy finding out.

Kathrine Ballard was scared. She was still not used to boarding school, spending her primary education in the standard muggle day education.

She stared at the Gargoyle that marked the entrance to the Headmasters office. She had never been summoned to the Headmasters office in her life. She fought back tears. Magic was so incredible, and she just knew they were going to kick her out.

Pulling herself together, she entered the office.

"Why hello there Kathrine. Please have a seat, would you like a Lemon Drop?"

Kathrine nodded her ascent, and after getting the candy, she focused on the Headmaster.

"Now do not worry, you are not in trouble. I simply need some information about something happening in Muggle America. I understand you vacationed there with your family last summer?"

Kathrine nodded again, biting back on her confusion. It had been a vacation, they had seen some of America's national parks. She had not paid attention to what was going on in the American news, how could she answer the Headmasters questions?

"Now" said Albus, pulling in all the gravity that one of his position could muster, "This is important, I need you to tell me", he paused for effect...

"Where can I find a famous muggle named Clark Kent?"

Kathrine choked on her Lemon Drop.
