Elon Musk... he's gone insane! What shall we do to combat his evil, flamethrower-wielding, curiously angular autonomous robot army?

"I know. Start a school that eschews most real subjects in favour of badly coordinated, nebulous 'sciences' that would teach the young nothing about critical thinking. That way, when Elon Musk takes over the world, he'll have minimal resistance and a populace that can be easily won over with superior intellect and arguments that go entirely above their heads. And what's more, they will have already segregated themselves into 4 convenient groups that can be turned against one another in case the people need distracting from any real issues that arise!"
