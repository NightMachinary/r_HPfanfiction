Thanks, glad you enjoyed it. That's the format I use when second stage outlining a story. I write out key points to get a feel for how the story will go. More lite hearted, darker, violent, funny, etc... Through writing out condensed forms of major scenes it helps me see how it would go.

From there its connecting all the points with story between and filling out those condensed scenes.
