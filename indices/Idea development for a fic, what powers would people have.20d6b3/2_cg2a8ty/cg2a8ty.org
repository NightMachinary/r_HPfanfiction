I like the idea that Harry's power is an exaggerated version of what protected him in the series. Whatever you select shouldn't range too far afield so much as be a reinterpretation of what we've seen.

- Hermione's gift is book affinity- she can understand written works to the point that she intuits what the author intends, making even poorly-framed explanations useful to her. She transcribes Binns' lectures in order to integrate the knowledge.

- Ron can eat just about anything, even if he doesn't enjoy it.

- Seamus has a gift with fire

- Molly Weasley has Mother voice

- Arthur's power is a trust aura- he appears innocuous, even harmless, allowing him to operate within the Dark Ministry when his allegiance was fairly obvious.

- Luna has the shield of innocence- despite everything that could have been done to her, no one ever really hurts her, physically.

- Voldemort had vocal compulsion powers that were often mistaken for mind reading, They also boost the strength of his spoken spells- why else would he bother, seeing as speaking spells out loud is often seen as juvenile?

- Dumbledore actually could read minds from an early age, which sped up his learning curve tremendously.

- Ollivander... wand whisperer. (I'm going to write a whole story about this someday)

- Ginny has a gift for throwing powerful curses.

- The twins are a near lethal combination of Fred's ability to convince people to take what he offers and George's capacity for turning anything into a disposable joke.
