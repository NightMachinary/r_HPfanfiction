I really LIKE this idea. I'd suggest you under-power the canon spells and potions to make the powers count for more. Animigus forms should be power related, or the power itself. So, character suggestions:

Voldemort's power could be the power to see people's greatest desires and fears, that's why he was able to recruit so well. Since Harry's power is reflection, he's not a Horcrux, the Mirror of Erised is. Each one of the Horcruxes exploits the desires or fears of those who come near it.

Ron's power could be to slow down time, and he can move at normal speed (if he moves too much too quickly friction starts burning him). Hence he is able to do advanced analysis in a short period of time and move like a chess piece.

Snape's power could be resistance of other powers (not total resistance, but Voldemort has trouble reading him, Dumbledore would have trouble burning him, hint at the power with Hermione being dense at potions).

Draco's power could be misdirection, he can forcibly make people unfocused in general or not focused on him, he evades getting in trouble for all his bullying this way. It's also a personal part of why he hates Harry, cause using his power on him makes him suffer. Lucius' power in turn forces people to pay attention to him.

George's power could be telepathy and Fred's power could be "switching" in which he teleports to where someone is and they in turn teleport to where he was. They use this for ridiculous pranks and it's later useful in battle.

Lily's power could have been inspiring hope. James' power could have been a sort of shield (not true Reflection like Harry). Sirius' power could be deception (he can plant false ideas in other people's heads). Peter's power is lying, and he tricked everyone into thinking his power was revealing the truth.

Lupin should not have a power (this provides even more context as to why wizarding society refuses to accept werewolves). Tonks' metamorph ability is her power.

Care for more suggestions?
