Under powering spells was what I was going for, with classes more focused on developing abilities. Something along the lines of building on your power, to strength your magic.

Your Draco is perfect, it works so well with the Malfoys persona. I might expand it to Lucius, as a family inherited ability and as an older wizard Lucius could have evolved it to do the reverse.

I think Lily should have the shielding ability, and James have flight. Peters ability sounds perfect, and the idea that the werewolf virus removes abilities is brilliant.

I thought Snape should have some sort of shadowy power, he can move through shadows, manipulate them.
