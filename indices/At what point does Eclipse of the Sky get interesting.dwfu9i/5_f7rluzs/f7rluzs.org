Around the chapter you're reading , if you don't like it after reading couple chapters after 30 , story might not be for you.

However , I'm kind of biased here. I loved the story from ch1 , Harry/OC dynamics is main part of that. If you don't like characters by now, don't see how you're going to enjoy the plot tbh.

You could try other firewan HP/DP story and see how you like it. It might be that the writing style doesn't suit you
