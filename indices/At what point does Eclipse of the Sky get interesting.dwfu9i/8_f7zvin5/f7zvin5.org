You are SO close to this getting just...amazing.

The point that got me hooked to this story was right after the fight at Number 12 Grimmauld. I believe that's when the writer came back to writing after a decade and a half or something nuts like that. So it picks up right when they get back to Hogwarts (Chapter 32 I believe). The action, the romance...it all picks up then. Also, this writer has some of the by far the “best” romance scenes later on in the story I've ever read.

I saw someone mention Chapter 30 is 1/3rd of the way through the story. It really isn't. The later chapters are significantly longer. The earlier chapters are far shorter.

Keep in mind I am biased. Once I got hooked to this story I was hooked. I really like the way they write (there is a distinct difference starting around chapter 33). When I say hooked I mean I couldn't put this down. I was late to work from losing track of time and walking around like a sleep deprived zombie for a week. Seriously, nothing beats Harry going nuts on Voldemort and a zombie apocalypse done right.

Things to keep in mind....I'm the sort of reader that likes Stephen King's super long novels. I love his writing style, and he can be a bit verbose. Firefawn is similar. If you liked Firefawn's new story (the Harry/Daphne one) that's a good example of how all the later chapters of Eclipse of the Sky are written (around 32 and onwards). Firefawn has a VERY particular writing style. You either love it or you hate it.

The other thing to keep in mind....there's a reason that most popular novels are shorter. Very few readers have the steam to power through long stories. This is a million plus word story. It is LONG. That automatically means most readers aren't going to make it all the way through it (or any story) that is this long.

That being said, the author is VERY transparent that there are some typos in the story and problems with the beginning. If you happen to be a bit “uppity” and expect all fanfiction (which I hope to remind everyone is a hobby that these people aren't being paid for) to be perfect, then you might get irritated with the occasional typo in this. This writer has churned out something like 700,000 words in a year and a half. Think about that. A year and a half! Of course they will have typos. They've said they don't have a beta. The fact that there aren't more is a testament to how good they actually are. I just can't rag on a story for stuff like that. I have a life outside of fanfiction and I expect fanfiction writers to as well. I don't get the whole ‘judgmental' vibe a lot of readers online have for typos, for what it is worth. So typos (as long as they aren't excessive and occurring every other paragraph) don't bother me much. This story doesn't have enough to bother me or even flag my radar.

I did actually start PMing the author after I got hooked to this, and that made me like the story even more. They are truly just one of the nicest human beings you could imagine on the internet. Seriously, I sent them a constructive criticism and they responded so nicely I was impressed. They thanked me a bunch and made a few edits. It's one of the reasons I recommend this so often. It's a good story with a non-arrogant author.

Ziela, overall when it comes to a story you have to like the writing style, the plot, and any quirks the writer has. I hope I've laid out the quirks they have (not having a beta) and a fair assessment of the overall likelihood of if you'll enjoy it. If you don't enjoy those three things and don't favor super long stories, you probably won't. If you do like those things, it may be the best thing you've ever read for free. Out of free stories and books I've paid for this is in my top 25.

I think she is actually just rewriting the beginning. She's keeping the plot the same overall but changing the initial approach. I do think she rewrote 1 to 3 just to get them posted up but she hasn't proofread anything (last time I asked her anyway as I've PMed her to ask when the rewrite is done so I can take a look).
