Hermione has been captured and the deatheaters extracted the information about the order's headquarters. They didn't get the precise location because of the Fidelius charm, but they know it's in London around Grimmuald Place.

Meanwhile Harry and Kally are inside the headquarters and are preparing to fight the deatheaters that are 'having fun' in London trying to lure the Order's members out of headquarters.
