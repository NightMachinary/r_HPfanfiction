At 30 chapters, if it's not interesting now, it likely never will. There's an author note dated to 11/9/19 that chapters 4-12 are undergoing heavy reworking, so you might have been put off by that. But unless the overarching structure is interesting and merely the execution of it poor, I don't see how just a reworking and not a full rewrite will change how interesting the story is. Also, did they revise the first three chapters? Still riddled with typos and orbs, /retch/. (Also, not entirely fair to judge this early, but it's a love at first sight story and I don't really like those, especially this story's execution of it.)
