OironTheRed you missed out my friend. Zombies, sharks and the sexiness. You should PM the writer and tell them why you lost interest. I know they are trying to improve it so that might help them out. I'm going to reread the beginning for them once they finish writing and give them some feedback, but they are super open to it. You still missed out. Harry starts tearing Death Eaters limb from limb.
