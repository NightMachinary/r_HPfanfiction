Nah, nah, I read the zombies- that was cool. Also got a bit of the sexiness.

I didn't tell her- I was pretty regularly communicating with the author for ten or so chapters- why I lost interest because it's not really a problem with her writing so much as it's my attention span that's the issue. I'm not ADD, but honestly you're gonna get me for 500k words or so at a time. But yeah, I know the author is open to feedback- iirc Firefawn was really nice.

Fun fact: one chapter had 'damn' in it /constantly/ when it was first posted. I guess the author just had 'damn' on the mind, because literally every other sentence was 'damned' this or 'damned' that. It was very amusing to read.
