Oooh, I didn't know Firefawn was writing a Harry/Daphne story. I'll need to check that out, thanks!

But yeah- there was a /huge/ hiatus between the first thirty or so chapters and the rest of it. I picked it up right around when she started writing it again. I ended up losing it around chapter 50-ish.
