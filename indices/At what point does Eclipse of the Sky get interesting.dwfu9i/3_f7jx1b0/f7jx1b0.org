If you are not enjoying yourself, you have no obligation to keep reading. It's a lesson I learned a while ago with proper books: it is not your fault for not enjoying it, and you owe no one.

If the author hasn't captured your interest after 30 chapters: too bad, but happens. Probably time to move on.
