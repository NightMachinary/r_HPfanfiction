The only reason I wrote this post was because I'm trying to read the story for the third time (and the other times I've stopped reading earlier) because I really like the idea, and I think there's much potential there. Maybe it's just that my expectations are too high.

I know that I have no obligation of reading the full story, it's just that I really like the set up, and I wouldn't want to drop it if it becomes better soon. I think I'm just going to read another few chapters and if it doesn't get better I'm going to drop it.
