Honestly, if you don't like it by now you probably won't.

I /did/ like the parts you're reading and I still ran out of steam around chapter 51 or so.

Sometimes you just can't deal with the way an author writes, and that doesn't necessarily reflect negatively on either of you. I don't like the way a lot of very popular authors write so I kinda live by that sentence.
