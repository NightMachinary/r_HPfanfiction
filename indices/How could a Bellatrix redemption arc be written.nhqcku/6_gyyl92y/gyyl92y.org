Basically having her become a Super-Powered Batman/Punisher hybrid. She Soul Tears Voldemort, Soul Traps him and sacrifices it to the Ideal Masters, kills her former comrades, the Dark Creatures (Soul Tear or Soul Trap would likely kill Dementors or get rid of them) and uses her OP Skyrim Alchemy hax or Restoration Magic to heal everyone in Saint Mungos (especially Neville's Parents), before returning to Skyrim. "I've done my part here... I'd just remind them of the monster I was if I stayed behind. Bellatrix Lestrange is Dead, she should stay that way. I'll stay as who I was in Skyrim".

Parthurnax would be exactly who she needs to recover from it. He was once a badguy too but redeemed himself and became the goodguy mentor. He could help her seek self-enlightenment down that path.
