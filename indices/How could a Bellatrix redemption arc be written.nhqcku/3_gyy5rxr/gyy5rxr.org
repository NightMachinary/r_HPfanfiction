Finally my one area of Harry Potter expertise bellatrix that's admittedly kinda weird in retrospect.

Anyway in the fanfictions I've written with a bellatrix redemption arc here's how it's gone. She grew up being indoctrinated by the entire black family pretty much then hog warts came along and she married lestrange. Lestrange makes me think of intense emotional abuse. He doesn't physically abuse bellatrix because he's be fucking dead if he did but emotional and mental abuse on top of racist indoctrination for decades has a way of breaking a person.

The best way to break the indoctrination is to be confronted with the source directly or to get away from that. Which is where it works in your story. She has no one around to reinforce her racist ideology so as she explores nirn it slowly crumbles then gets brought back and has to reconcile who she is to who she was.

Ps:this sounds incredibly fascinating and I'd love to read it
