I don't know how you played Skyrim, but my characters always end up as complete psychopaths. I don't think time spent murdering your way through various creatures of skyrim, while facing all sorts of magical creatures you also end up killing, coming across 10 different types of racism not to mention all the people who despise other people because of the way they fight... Necromancy is sortof frowned upon but not illegal, summoning demons is a standard way of fighting, you end up coming across and making deals in some way with several demons during the course of your time there. By the time she got back she would probably be worse than Voldemort and liable to take over and become a worse threat than he was.
