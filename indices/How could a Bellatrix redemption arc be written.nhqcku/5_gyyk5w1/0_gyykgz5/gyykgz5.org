I don't play Skyrim that way.

I always try to do what I think is right.

Besides, in my fic I add Tiber Septim(Talos) to the mix.

He advises the Dovahkiin on what the best course of action is. For instance, Bellatrix only joins the Dark Brotherhood because Tiber thinks that the Emperor should die for the Empire to have a better chance at defeating the Aldmeri Dominion.
