My Bellatrix was fairly accepting of the pureblood mantra, but she wasn't insane. She was unwillingly married off to Lestrange, and to make certain she behaved, her father put a very sinister compulsion on the contract, binding her to Lestrange, and partly his will.

Unknown to Cygnus, and Lestrange (at the time), the witness to the contract being made, one Tom Riddle, placed a similar compulsion of his own onto the contract.

This created a conflict within Bella's mind, sort of like trying to fight against two equally powerful /Imperius/ at once. Her mind didn't know which attacker to fend off, so eventually, the 'good' part of Bella's mind retreated in on itself, in an effort to protect what sanity remained. What emerged was the utterly insane killer we know from canon.

Harry managed to break the compulsions, bind her to him, to ease her mind back from the brink and into the light. His heart and soul healed Bellatrix, along with some heavy work with Mind Healer Andromeda. Bella's and Harry's connection faded away as she got stronger and ultimately disappeared, but not before she had fallen head over heels in love with him.

She doesn't much care about my Harry's quest to bring peace and equality to Magical Britain, but she cares for her sisters, niece and Harry. She feels a deep need to redeem herself, and seek revenge against Riddle and Lestrange for what they made her do. And to avenge her victims.
