Permanent full amnesia is very, very rare (it's less than .1% of people). Most amnesiacs either struggle to make new memories or temporarily forget a portion of past memories (which generally come back over a year or so after the initiating incident, and only account for a specific period of time - usually the time around the incident itself or a few years previously).

Also, there are multiple types of memory - autobiographical being about personal identity, and procedural memory that covers our ability to do various tasks, etc. Generally you'll only forget one type of memory, not all of them.

So, my approach would be to have Bellatrix land, end up forgetting her recent life experiences (maybe back to her pre-Voldemort years), but still having the ability to cast spells. She'd have no idea where or how she learned those skills as she'd have no memory of Hogwarts, but she'd still have the skills.

She gets helped, connects with some people, and slowly starts recalling more and more of her past life as she 'adventures' through Nirn and starts helping people. Her current self, who'd be a slightly more decent person, would look back at these memories with fascination and horror. Eventually, have her come to terms (in the abstract) with who she used to be - then, she gets teleported back to Rowling-World and has to deal with her previous identity directly. Explore the feelings behind exploring the arsehole she used to be and you'll have a sympathetic redemption arc, most likely.
