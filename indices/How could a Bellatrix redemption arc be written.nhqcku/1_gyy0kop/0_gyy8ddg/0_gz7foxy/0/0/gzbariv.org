I like your first point. Especially since, if I recall correctly, the Thalmor are High Elf Supremacists (or at least racist against other races?). The parallel to her old self would be a nice thing to play around with and allude to there.

Regarding your second... I mean, the last hero of the Empire was technically an escaped prisoner who ended up head of the Dark Brotherhood in Cyrodiil, the Gray Fox, and probably would've ended up joining the Mythic Dawn if they'd asked. Don't know if the Empire really has all that high a standard for heroes. :D

Be a fun thing to lampshade though. Have her wake up after landing and Septim goes "Hey, you, you're finally awake!" :D
