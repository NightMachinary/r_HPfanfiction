That kind of thing could work, but I'd say you'd have to set up her new moral code beforehand to make it work.

Maybe have her see someone else in the Elder Scrolls world being tortured and being horrified and saving them, in the time before she starts getting reminders or information of what she was before? Establish that she sees the kind of things she did before as wrong, why she now sees things that way, and then have her beg for punishment or death or whatever. It'd provide a stronger foundation for the emotion in that scene if you could call back to her saving someone from torture previously and have the "Someone who could do that... they'd be a monster. I was that monster." moment.

Breaking her down that way, with a moral foundation to her distress, also opens the opportunity to rebuild her in her new morality - "You were a monster, but now you can be better." - and really get deep into the redemption part of your story.
