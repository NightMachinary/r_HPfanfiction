It is really really difficult. The true redemption and repentance for her is the only one: to knock on the door of DMLE and ask to be put into Azkaban for the rest of her life (UK, even the magical one, doesn't have the capital punishment), which doesn't make much happy finale of the story.

The only two options how to make her happy end is somehow to explain away her actions, so it is either

- time travel before she was such a bitch, e.g., excellently played in “Stepping Back” by TheBlack'sResurgence linkffn(12317784), or “The Last Peverell” linkao3(29167410).

- put here under some kind of Imperium Curse or something of that kind (marriage ritual or something).

However, the problem is that by getting her out of the hook the author completely destroys any hopes for the redemption, because where there is no guilt there is no redemption.
