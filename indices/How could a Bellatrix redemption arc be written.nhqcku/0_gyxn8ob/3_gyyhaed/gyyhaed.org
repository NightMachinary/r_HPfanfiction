Making her conscious/aware during her whole time under whatever form of mind control and her guilt of having done whatever she did during that time (even though she was mind controlled, she believes that her body did it and she is/was responsible for it. Maybe some form of PTSD, idk Im not well versed in things like that, but you get the idea. And as illogical as the whole PTSD thing sounds, guilt, and emotions in general for that matter, don't follow logic) still allows for some redemption arc IMO
