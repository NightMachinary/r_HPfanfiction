Check out Blood Magic by Gateway Girl.

Harry is conceived by magic ritual and James knows about it. But then they lie about Harry's parentage and hide the fact that he is Severus', which is highly illegal due to the laws surrounding the magic ritual. (Trying not to spoil things here.) So James and Lily together are in the wrong here.

Why is it called Severitus: Bc the fanfic author [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/123967/Severitus][Severitus]] issued the so-called [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Severitus_Challenge][Severitus challenge]].

As for Lily always getting an out: If you want Snape to be Harry's biological father, stuff needs to happen. The "Snape is evil" version would be that he rapes her. Considering that the goal of most Severitus stories is to write about a developing positive relationship between Snape and Harry, that would make things difficult so authors generally avoid that. At the same time you get the impression from canon that James and Lily were very much in love, so authors need to come up with a why and how. The easiest is to pin it on James (he cheated so she choose take revenge, James was infertile, etc). It is also easier to give Lily an out this way, bc a Severitus story is about Snape and Harry - not about Lily and James.

Just follow any discussions on [[/r/genealogy][r/genealogy]] and [[/r/adoption][r/adoption]] about people taking DNA tests for fun and finding out that they have a different biological father than they always thought. The general consensus and advice to the child is not to be angry at the mother, bc a) you don't know what she went through at the time and b) it is really none of your business who your mother did it with. Yes, you have a right to know who contributed to your genes, but the rest is none of your concern.
