I was joking as well.

The main problem with the Draco Trilogy was the blatant plagiarism, pretty much any witty lines were ripped off from whatever was on TV at the time the fic was written, ditto for a bunch of subplot ideas.

But overall it was a good fic, up there with Methods of Rationality or other current popular fics. Also, did I mention that one of the pairings in the Draco Trilogy was H/Hr? It was one of the few H/Hr fics that I genuinely liked, at least at the time. The rest I encountered had too much of what I like to call "Barbie and Ken" feel.
