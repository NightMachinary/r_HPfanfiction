I really dislike how that often happens in crossovers. Like, is there absolutely no way to write another witty character? do you really have to turn him into an existing one, with magic tacked on, which he very often doesn't even use?

I think the absolute worst offender ever in this was a fic where Hermione was somehow stripped of her magic, then studied archeology and encountered members of SG-1 multiple times, only to be threatened with custody in america (despite being a british citizen and in germany at the time) if she didn't sign a NDA.

The entire fic sort of tapered off there, but she was literally just a random muggle oc with a name from HP. She didn't even have magic. That's sort of a guideline for me - if the protagonist isn't a wizard or doesn't interact with the wizarding world in any meaningful way, then it's not a HP fanfic.
