Not sure if you're asking in a serious manner or joking manner. So I'll answer seriously.

I don't like reading about infidelity to begin with. Clearly I don't like Severitus. However, whenever I've read any of them by accident or for some other purpose, I've seen every time that Lily is either excused or justified in her infidelity. I don't like that. I just wanted to see if fics that don't sugarcoat her exist.
