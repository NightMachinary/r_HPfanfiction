Conditionally was recommended to me when I asked for some "Snape suffers consequences" fic. Every reply was saying that it was good and one of the few or even the only good Severitus fic. I saw the summary's second line "it goes as badly as you'd expect", and thought that maybe this fic would explore just how horrible Snape is and would be as Harry's father... I was disappointed. I only skimmed through for like half of it.
