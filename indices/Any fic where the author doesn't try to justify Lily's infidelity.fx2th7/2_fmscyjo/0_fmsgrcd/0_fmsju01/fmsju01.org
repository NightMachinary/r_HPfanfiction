I think youve opened my eyes I had no idea Lilly got such special treatment. I assumed it was just par the course with infidellity fics.

​

I have never read a single one where both parties are in the wrong or have valid points

​

One person always seems to be abusive or drugging the other with love potion or they are just REALLY annoying so their partner has no choice but to escape

I dont think ive read any fics where a character simply cheats

​

Unless the person cheating is the antagonist so when they do its wrong

what do you think?
