Lily is one of the least negatively-portrayed characters in the entire HP universe. The only female characters that come to mind that are portrayed less negatively are Luna and Nymphadora.

It gets to the point where authors go out of the way to engineer justifications for why Lily did something bad, in case she did, because it definitely wasn't her being in the wrong, no that can't be.

I suspect the reason for this is that pretty much /everyone/ in canon calls her as being a very good person, including that one guy that seems to hate everybody's guts. /Everyone/, except maybe Petunia whose argument is lessened by her disposition towards people in general. This colors people's perception of her to the point where people have a hard time portraying her badly.
