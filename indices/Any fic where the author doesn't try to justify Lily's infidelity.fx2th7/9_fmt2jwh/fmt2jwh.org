I've always liked fics portraying Severus as being much closer to Harry (platonically), including Severitus-style plots. However, for those cases in particular, I've always much preferred them as not being related in blood (at least not the obvious paternal route). There's plenty of reasons for this, but the infidelity is an obvious one (while I've never been a fan of James-bash, this is usually the way it's justified, but it doesn't really make any sense -- why would Lily go /back/ to James if he was so horrible in first place?). There's also another somewhat common interpretation (Severus and Lily were the genuine past lovers, but Lily ended up with James as a cover for Severus being a spy), but while it's not strictly adultery, it's both disturbing as well as just plain depressing for everyone involved. I also take issue with most Severitus fics on ao3, because the authors insist on tagging them Snily. Now, I actually happen to like this pairing, but not the Severitus version of it due to reasons explained above (I much prefer Marauder-era fics with it), and they don't even tend to contain much of that ship in first place anyway besides a bit of backstory, so why even tag it?

I /have/ seen one fic where Lily took issue with something James was doing, but her retribution went way over the line (she basically used Severus for revenge sex, exploiting his feelings for her -- James hadn't done something /that/ bad), ultimately hurting everyone involved. This is only revealed years later in typical Severitus fashion. Severus was unhappy for having been deceived over the lack of a son, and it's implied that James would have been devastated (obviously) if he had known. But that's the only fic I've seen which portrays Lily as being in the wrong. I don't remember the title of it, sorry, but I remember it starting off as Harry dying from something and needed blood from a close relative, with Severus being the one. Severus was confused, but Obliviated before he could draw the inevitable conclusion, and only found out later when he drank a potion to un-Obliviate him (for unrelated reasons).
