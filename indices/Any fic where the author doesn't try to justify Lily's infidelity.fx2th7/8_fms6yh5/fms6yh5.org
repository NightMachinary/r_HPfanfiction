In linkffn(Digging for the Bones by paganaidd) Lily's infidelity is semi-embraced. The pureblood society's prevalence of historical inbreeding meant that their swimmers every so often have issues, and their female partners every so often copulate with someone else, and there is a paternity potion of sorts that hides it. Arthur's mother is mentioned as having done it, aka how he and Molly were pureblood anomalies with 7 children.
