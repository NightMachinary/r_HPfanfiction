I was looking for this one to recommend. For some reason I thought it had been by Lomonaaeren as well, which is why I couldn't find it. The most pass that Lily gets in this one is that this is a common problem with purebloods. Snape gives her shit when she proposes him fathering the child as well as keeping the secret from James. Harry doesn't think charitably of his mother for doing what she did either.
