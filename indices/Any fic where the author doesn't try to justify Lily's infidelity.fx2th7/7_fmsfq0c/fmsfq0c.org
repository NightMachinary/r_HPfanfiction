Cant 100% remember the response to to lily's infidelity in this fic - blood by the lord of chaos ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3089927/chapters/6696266]]) but I do remember harry struggling to accept snape as his dad at first and snape not knowing harry is his for a while.

It's also extremely good.
