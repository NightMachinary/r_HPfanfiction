I feel ya. When I was looking up Harry/Ginny fics a while back I saw tons of fics where that wasn't the actual ship. Instead, Harry doesn't love Ginny because of Reasons and cheats on her with someone else (mainly Draco).

And this is never ever addressed properly! I get that some of these are just smutty one shots, but there were serious ones too. And in those, the infidelity was just explained away by saying Harry and Draco had repressed love all along or by simply bashing Ginny.
