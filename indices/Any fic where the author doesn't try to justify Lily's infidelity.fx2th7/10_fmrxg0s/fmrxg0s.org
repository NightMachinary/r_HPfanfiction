I can somewhat agree. I haven't read this specific fic, but Lily is always seemingly painted as a pariah despite whatever she may have done.

I find this trope rather boorish and one-dimensional. I prefer to write people as complex, contradictional creatures. Because that's what humans are, at least in my view. Nothing should ever be justified by the author, that's a sign of lazy writing.
