Peeves isn't a ghost, and events in the original heptalogy would suggest that your expectations are unfounded. Harry was able to successfully cast Langlock on Peeves in Book 6, and Lupin cast Waddiwasi on him in Book 3. While these were simple schoolyard jinxes, they clearly demonstrate that Peeves /can/ be affected by living beings and their magic.

Conversely, there's never been an example of Peeves being directly affected by the actions of a ghost. Sure, we're given secondhand knowledge that Peeves fears/respects the Bloody Baron, but we're never told why. We're told in Book 4 of a Council of Ghosts making a ruling on whether or not Peeves can attend the opening feast. Peeves's fear/respect may simply stem from the Baron's role on the council, being that he's one of the oldest ghosts in the castle.
