Cool, but while there isn't any proof that ghosts can effect ghosts, there isn't evidence to suggest otherwise either. Peeves is scared of the Baron, and while the whole council of ghosts being the reason is an interesting theory, it's just that, a theory. So I can agree to disagree, but while ghosts can be affected by spells, they can't die to them exactly, can they. So there still isn't a real reason for Peeves to truly fear Voldemort, and he fears the Baron. So i'm still gonna have to say that it's more likely that the ghosts can still effect ghosts, even if Peeves isn't technically such.
