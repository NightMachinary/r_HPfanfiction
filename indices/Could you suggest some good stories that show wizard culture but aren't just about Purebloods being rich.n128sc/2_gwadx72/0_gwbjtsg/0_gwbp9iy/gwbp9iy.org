I haven't read O. St. C., but based on its description, you might want to check out In the Bleak Midwinter, in which Hermione goes back in time to raise TMR Jr. and lives with TMR Sr., who is, of course, a muggle, but pretends to be a wizard with the help of a house elf, and openly joins and attempts to revolutionize wizarding society while faking being a wizard. It's great.
