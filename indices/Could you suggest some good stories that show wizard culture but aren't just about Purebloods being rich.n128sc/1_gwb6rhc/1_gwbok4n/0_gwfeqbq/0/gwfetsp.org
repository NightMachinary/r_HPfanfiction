  “Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort's actions?” Dumbledore's voice had finally turned cold.“No, I'm saying you're responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think... maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don't have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”“You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn't sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done --”“Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”“You are suggesting that we use Voldemort's first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

  Being reincarnated as Harry Potter's fraternal twin sister really puts a new meaning behind "death is but the next great adventure."Updates every Thursday and occasional Sunday. No relationships prior to year four.

  The world had always been such a terrible, beautiful place, full of colors. Then why do we always split it in half, in Black and White? In Good and Evil? Nobody has one without the other. I thought I knew what the world was about. But then I died. Then I found Magic. Or, rather, it found me. fem!harry OC insert.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)
