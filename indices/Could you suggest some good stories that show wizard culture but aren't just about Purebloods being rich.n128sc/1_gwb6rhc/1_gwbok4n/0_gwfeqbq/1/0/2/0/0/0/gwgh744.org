Already read most of them. I wish I could like Pureblood Pretense. The MC is a bit too /bland/ for a million word series. Will try Hogwarts Battle School. HP & Natural 20 is pretty good. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/464017][Girl in Red]] is another D&D crossover along similar lines but complete. It does get ridiculously long though. Imposter Complex is one of my favorites in terms of worldbuilding. Will try Blood Crest.
