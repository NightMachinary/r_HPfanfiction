Just finished Mudblood of Slytherin. Overall, it was really great!! I always enjoy fics about Tom's initial rise to power. The MC was smart and interesting but not too OP. There were some spots that were confusingly written, especially parts of dialog, where it seemed like the author knew what they meant but didn't really make it clear in the text. Other than that, it was really well done. I care more about an interesting plot than great writing style.
