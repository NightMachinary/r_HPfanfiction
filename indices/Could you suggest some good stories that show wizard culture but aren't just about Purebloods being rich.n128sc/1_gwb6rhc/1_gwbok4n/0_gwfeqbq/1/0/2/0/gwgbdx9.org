[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning To The Start]]Is not an SI, but Time-travelling Harry is quite /efficient/ with his future knowledge. Questions of ethics are raised and no time-traveller age-gapped romance.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28649517][Dandelions (Double SI)]] Is new and short but what has been written is top quality. Reincarnates acting their age. By the author of /Hear The Silence/ of Naruto fame.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11745900][Rose Petal Red]] is popular but unnecessarily /long/. It does have a believable reason for why the MC cannot shake canon too much. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14154777/chapters/69533256][This]] AU offshoot three-shot by the author is one of the best Dark!SI's I've read in any fandom.
