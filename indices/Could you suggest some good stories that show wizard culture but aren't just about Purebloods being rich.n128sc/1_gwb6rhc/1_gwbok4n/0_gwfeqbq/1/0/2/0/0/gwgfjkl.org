I really appreciate all these recs! I haven't read any of these.

Here are a few of my favorites, in case you're looking for more to read:

Imposter Complex, diary Riddle joins the Light and opposes Voldemort

Hogwarts Battle School, Ender's Game style AU

Hermione Granger, Demonologist, Hermione summons demons to help her

Applied Cultural Anthropology, dark Hermione

Prince of the Dark Kingdom, AU where Tom Riddle never lost and he mentors Harry

Blood Crest, Harry is raised by a necromancer. He's dark but also sort of timid and not at all OP

HP & Prince of Slytherin, subverts all the tropes in the best way

HP & the Natural 20, hilarious story about a DnD wizard who is summoned into the HP universe

Pureblood Pretense, potions prodigy trades places with her purebred cousin so she can study with Snape at Hogwarts (based on Alana the Lioness)

In the Bleak Midwinter, Hermione goes back in time to raise Tom along with Ton Sr, who fakes being a wizard with the help of a house elf
