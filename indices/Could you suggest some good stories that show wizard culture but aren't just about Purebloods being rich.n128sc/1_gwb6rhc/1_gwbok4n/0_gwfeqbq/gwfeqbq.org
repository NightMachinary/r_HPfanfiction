Linkao3(Seven Devils) Is a pretty serious one. Linkao3(Harry Potter And The Bucket List) is closer in tone to What's her name in Hufflepuff. Linkao3(Cisme) is very philosophical and introspective. Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort) Is a sociopathic SI into LV. Not the best writing but has some original ideas.
