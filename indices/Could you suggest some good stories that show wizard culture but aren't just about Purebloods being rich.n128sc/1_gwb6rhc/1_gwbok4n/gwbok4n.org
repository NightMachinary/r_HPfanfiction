Are there any other good SI fics out there, besides this story and Magical Me? (Not necessarily author insert, just an insert of an IRL character who has read the books.)

Other fandoms have plenty of great SI fics, but for some reason, virtually every HP SI is extremely poorly written, and has the SI skipping through canon as the ultimate Mary Sue, treating the setting like a theme park and just being all around cringey.
