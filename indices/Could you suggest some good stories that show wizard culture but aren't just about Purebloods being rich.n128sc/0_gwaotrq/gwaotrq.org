This. So many of these are just aristocracy and NOTHING ELSE. I want to see a shopping scene. Not the usual Indy!Harry one, where our rich protagonist buys a giant trunk and a wand with more cores than anything Intel has ever dreamed of.

Give me the apothecary and a potions master kibitzing about the "proper" way to sort ingredients. I want to see the artist who carves sculptures out of graphite then uses alchemy to turn it to diamond. What does the balloon animal seller-equivalent give to kids? There's so much worldbuilding space there and it isn't being used.
