There are few things I nitpick about, but grammar is something that just has to be decent, at least.

Wrong use of their, they're, there... Laying, lying, etc, drive me crazy. I know it's often typos, but even so!

Also, when the author switches between the tenses like watching windshield wipers, I drop the story like a hot potato. Watch your s's and d's...
