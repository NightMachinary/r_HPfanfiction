You know I think I agree with you, with movies, tv shows, and books, hard disagree, but fanfiction is a much different medium of entertainment than any of those, including books. Most of the time people don't look for a tv show with anything in mind, at least when I look for a fanfic, I look for something specific for however I'm feeling, so I can see how the little details would matter in the case of fanfic.

When I'm looking for a movie to watch I don't go out of my way to find something very specific I just browse till I find something interesting. So maybe I was a bit too hasty calling out nitpicking.
