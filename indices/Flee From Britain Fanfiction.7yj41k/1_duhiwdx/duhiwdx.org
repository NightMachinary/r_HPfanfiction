The second one has little to go on, though it sounds a bit like [[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset over Britain]] and sequel, though I confess I never finished the million-plus-word story to know how Voldemort was finished off. It was another "escape from Britain" type story.
