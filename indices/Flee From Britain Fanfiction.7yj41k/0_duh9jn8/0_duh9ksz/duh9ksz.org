  A fourth year fic. Harry is stuck in something he doesn't want to be in, Dumbledore's a manipulative bastard, Voldemort wants Harry dead, the school hates him...sounds like every year right? Well this year Hermione has a brilliant idea (or more than one) and her idea(s) change Harry's life, her life, and a big black dog's life too. AU and no idea which genre to put this under.
