There was one I read a while ago where Harry's parents were still alive and he had younger brothers and sisters. It was Harry/Hermione and basically followed the same romantic storyline as Lily/James with Harry being all arrogant and chasing after Hermione while she got annoyed by him. Eventually they got together.

I can't remember the title unfortunately but if anyone knows what story I'm talking about, hopefully they can link it? Sorry this probably didn't help at all lol. I'll try looking for it though

Edit: found it linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7038175/1/Like-Father-Like-Son]])
