  Okay, story time: I sat down to write a cute, fluffy Drarry with a little minor angst because 'oh, no, Harry got re-sorted to Slytherin'. But then Harry said no. And this happened. I just let the story write itself and did no real editing to it. The basics?Dumbledore announces that the fifth years will be re-Sorted for some stupid, made-up reason. Harry realizes that there's no way he'll end up staying in Gryffindor. He resigns himself to Slytherin, but then professor Snape finds out about how the Dursleys treat Harry and mucks everything up in trying to help. Harry realizes he has to get himself back into Gryffindor somehow and then defeat Voldemort. This is the story of how he does that.Read it as crack or take it seriously, because honestly, I'm not sure which this is. But it's also a story about friendship and loyalty and standing united. Also, I wrote this in one day.I'm sorry.
