Alrighty then, I hope you end up enjoying at least one of these.

Silence is Golden, linkffn(13451229)

The Dark Lady Tonks, linkffn(12998962) and its sequel, The Dark Lady Potter-Black linkffn(13008507)

Family - It's in the Blood, linkffn(13292346) is a great fic and decently long enough to tell an engaging story. Highly recommended.

Ice Cream, linkffn(13323518)

Human Stupidity Has No Limits, linkffn(7903404) is a fun story.

An Ordinary Magical Couple, linkffn(13304599) it's a longer story than the others, 45k words. But it's a good story.

The Assassin Wore White, linkffn(10071063) is of a completely different tone than these other stories but super well done and interesting.

Summer Nights, linkffn(12457527) by one of my favorite authors LeQuin.

Picnic Panic, linkffn(12265183) is my utmost favorite work of LeQuin and can't recommend enough.

Inspected By No 13, linkffn(10485934) if you haven't read this yet I recommend, its quite fun.

And I am going to stop there if you have read most of these do let me know and I can try to pick out some of my more obscure favorites. I hope there is something here you will enjoy.
