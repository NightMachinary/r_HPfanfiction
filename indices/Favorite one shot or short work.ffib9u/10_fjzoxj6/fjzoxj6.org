Read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8548502/Right-What-Is-Wrong]] stuff. He has so many one shots I cannot link them but they are very good. Also read his force interrupt for plot holes. A few more good ones.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22030591]] One touch of this heart by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/silver_fish/pseuds/silver_fish][silver_fish]]. Read her other stuff too.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9465029]] and it's companion is a good read too. That is all I can think of for now. I will make a post of my favorite one shots so look out for that.
