  Summary: Fate doesn't like what he sees happening on the events of September 1st, 2017, at King's Cross. So he looks back and changes one little thing. How can one tiny change rewrite the stars for a Muggle-Raised Wizard and a Muggleborn Witch? Not for Dumbledore, Ron, Ginny and Molly Weasley fans!Disclaimer: J.K Rowling owns the characters and the world of Harry Potter. I do not. I just like to play in her sandbox.
