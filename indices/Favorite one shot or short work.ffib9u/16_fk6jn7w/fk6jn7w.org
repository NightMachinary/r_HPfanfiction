Deja Vu ([[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Deja_Vu/Deja_Vu/]]) is one of my favorites. A different take on how to fix things with time travel.

Others I like include: linkffn(When Is It A Contract by Aealket), linkffn(Mistaken Identity by BajaB), linkffn(The Boy who wasn't by Bobmin356), linkffn(Hiding in Plain Sight by Clell65619), linkffn(The Sea King by Doghead Thirteen), linkffn(It Could Only Happen At Hogwarts by Inusitatus), and linkffn(Big Trouble in Old England by meteoricshipyards).

I have plenty more, but I think those are good ones, and most of them are light-hearted..
