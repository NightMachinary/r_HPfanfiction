Neither do I. Updates will probably be slow.

But I'm willing to work with you. That being said, what do you want Co-Authoring to mean? I need someone who can write certain parts that I'm not good at and help me with lore. I don't have the best of memory and would hate to have continuity errors. Maybe even a Beta Reader position if that's all you want to do.
