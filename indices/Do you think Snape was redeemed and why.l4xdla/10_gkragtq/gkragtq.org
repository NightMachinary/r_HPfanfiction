I think that people in this fandom tend to have really, really different things in mind when talking about WHAT exactly was/wasn't redeemed.

Personally, I think of him joining Death Eater, supporting Voldemort. So my answer is -- yes. He was redeemed. After all, he spend at least 7 years (more of you count all the years that he worked for Dumbledore aka pre-Harry years) putting his head on the line and risking his life to make up for his mistake. I don't believe it is the case where his motivation (love/obsession for Lily, which is another topic in itself) matters. But that's also a whole another discussion -- whether motivations and intentions matter the same/more/less then actions.

As for him being a foul unpleasant individual and his treatment of people in general and Harry in particular. I don't think it's somethings that could be ‘redeemed'. /Personality/ - is not something that can be redeemed. At least, not when it comes to Snape. Being, simply put, a jerk is huge part of who he is. Even if you write a Snape who somehow got some sense talked in him and started treating people better, it still wouldn't be ‘redemption' imho. Personal growth, character development maybe. But not redemption.
