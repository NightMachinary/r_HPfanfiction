I really do lol! Worst (as far as morality) character in the entire series. Pettigrew is a coward, but that's somewhat understandable. Voldemort is a psychopath, meaning he should have been committed as a child. Snape? He willingly joined the wizarding version of ISIS, knowing Voldemort was crazy (if he thought Voldemort was sane, he wouldn't have doubted LV would honor his request to murder Lily's husband and infant son, but leave her alive). He's... so despicable!!!

Snape is terrible, and it truly boggles my mind that anyone that has read the books likes him - much less fantasizes about him :P
