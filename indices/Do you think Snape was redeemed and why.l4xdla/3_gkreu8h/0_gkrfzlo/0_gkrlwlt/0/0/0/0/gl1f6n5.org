I don't know that we see Pettigrew (or Snape, for that matter) 'mass-murdering'. Voldemort is the only one of the three that qualifies, but as I said, he's a complete psychopath.

As for who fantasizes about Snape, I'd say a solid 20% or so of the fandom, based on the stories written about him. I agree though, it's pretty disgusting haha!
