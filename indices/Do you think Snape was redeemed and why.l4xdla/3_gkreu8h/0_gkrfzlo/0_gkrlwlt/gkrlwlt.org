Anything shorter than sawing through his limbs with a rusty butter knife was too quick for Snape.

As for Dumbledore, I don't feel that strongly. I think he was noble in spirit, but rather stupid in execution - after all, canon Harry is pretty much an idiot, so to leave his instructions in the form of a silly riddle for the Trio to solve was pretty dumb. As far as Dumbledore/Grindelwald, I mean, it's the difference between someone saying racist things, and someone else taking part in a lynching. Just because he flirted with the idea of world domination doesn't make him anywhere near as evil as Snape.
