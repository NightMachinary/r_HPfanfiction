Nothing Snape does could redeem his act of pointing a mass murderer at an infant. Period, end of story.

People will say "oh, but he went to Dumbledore to try and switch sides!!!" but that ignores the fact that until he found out Voldemort was going after the woman he was obsessed with, Snape didn't give two shits about the nameless infant that his boss was going to kill.

Hell, if Harry had been born at the end of June, and the prophecy clearly pointed to Neville, would Snape have bothered to switch sides? Would he have felt ANY guilt at all? No. Therefore, he is someone who willingly engaged in a conspiracy to murder an infant.

Nothing can redeem that. What a shame his death was so quick.
