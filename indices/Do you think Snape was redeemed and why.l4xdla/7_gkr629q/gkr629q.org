No.

But he could have been and that's what annoys me. I love good Snape fanfics because he has so much potential to be a good cunning Slytherin who is spying for the two most powerful wizards in history.

He could be brilliant. He could be sly and coy and clever and sarcastic and funny and brilliant and he just isn't in the books! Probably because it's written from Harry's point of view and Harry needs to not trust him for tension.

But jesus, Snape is so so interesting as a character. We see glimpses of how interesting he could be in HBP when he's basically working for 3 different people in secret like, that's clever!! I want to see more of that man! I wish he was written with any personality that isn't "obnoxious dickhead".
