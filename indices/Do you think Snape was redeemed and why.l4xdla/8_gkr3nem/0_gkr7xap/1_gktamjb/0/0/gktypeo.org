  If you see it through a rl world lense pretty much every adult in canon is straight awful in some capacity.

Yes, so? Why do you think I prefer story which utilise background adults such as the Tonks or the background teachers over stories with Dumbledore, Snape or McGonagall as the mentor/good teacher? Or why I consider Sirius the only decent important adult?

And basically all other important adults (Dumbledore, Snape, the Weasleys, Lupin) have proven that they will do nothing consequential when shit hits the fan. Hell, the Grangers have more potential because they have not shown to be awful at being authority figures.
