I've recentely read a post a pretty informative post that had a large of evidence supporting the thesis that Snape didn't really 'bully' children anymore than the other professors did. Stuff like McGonagall, at times, treating Neville just as badly as Snape was but Harry being more inclined to sugarcoat it because he actually liked her.

I'd also disagree about him not being a good man. He didn't present himself as one, true, but even from Harry's perspective in canon we see moments when Snape is legitimetely concerned about other people wellbeing that aren't 'Lily's son'. There's even a quote during the pensive memories in DH that was like "The only people whom i've seen die recentely are the ones i couldn't save."

So dunno.
