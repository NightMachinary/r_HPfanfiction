No. Nothing he did ever excused or made up for the shitty things he's done. Even the so called "good things" he's done had awful motivations.

I love fics about Snape and fics where he's a decent person.... but none of that is in canon lol Choosing to do good things for shitty reasons (while continuing to do shitty things) is far from a redemption arc.
