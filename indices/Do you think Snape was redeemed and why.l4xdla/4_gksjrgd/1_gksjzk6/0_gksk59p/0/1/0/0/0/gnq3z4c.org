I know I'm late to the party but... skills?

Snape was one of the most skillful wizards

he was a better oclumens than the dark Lord himself, we know he was good with the dark arts since childhood so we can only assume he improved with age and we also know he was a great potions master (lupins Potion) I don't find hard to believe that he got in the inner circle because of his skills and potential.
