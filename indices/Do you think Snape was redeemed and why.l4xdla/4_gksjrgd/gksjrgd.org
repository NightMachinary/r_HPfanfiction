No he deserved what he got as a student. Remember he was hanging out with the Jr DEs and if he was willing to use the M word on his only real friend what did he do to other muggle born students. I doubt the marauders were pranking Slytherins for just name calling. Then once out of school joined up with the magic nazis where he likely participated in at the very least the murder of muggles, Muggleborns, and the so called blood traitors only turning sides to try and save his ex friend who he lusts for without any regard for what Lily would want. Then he dishonors her memory specifically with how he treated Harry and betrayed his duties to basically an entire generation of students with how he acted. It disgusts me that JKR tried the redeem him at the last second (death isn't redemption fyi) and then had the gall to name one of Harry's kids after him.
