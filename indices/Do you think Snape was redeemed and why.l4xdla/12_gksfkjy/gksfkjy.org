I think that killing him off was probably the kindest thing that Rowling did for the character. How Harry presented him as after the war was a help to his reputation, but I think that his personality wouldn't have fundamentally changed. He would still have had to answer for Dumbledore's death (whether or not Dumbledore planned it is irrelevant, he still would have had to face a trial), he would have a whole generation of children who were at Hogwarts whilst he was headmaster hating him, he'd have those that would look to him as a potential love interest (some girls love a bad boy or think they can 'fix' him). Life after the war would be excruciating for him.
