Adding on, he's a fucking awful spy. The mark of the spy is that they're trusted or they're unknown. Snape is neither for either perspective. For Voldemort, he's such a bloody obvious Death Eater that nobody (should) tell him things. He's being propped up by Dumbledore alone. To the Order, Snape is abusing children and supporting the radicalization efforts in Hogwarts, to the point that shouting blood slurs in a crowded corridor don't even get you punished.

Snape's entire existence is literally "be the antagonist of whatever scene there is". Need someone to deliberately damn an innocent man and release a terrorist with a body count? Snape's your guy. Need to bully a child in the exact way you were bullied? Call Snape. Need someone to mindrape a child, view his worst memories, then not do a damn thing about the abuse? I know a guy.
