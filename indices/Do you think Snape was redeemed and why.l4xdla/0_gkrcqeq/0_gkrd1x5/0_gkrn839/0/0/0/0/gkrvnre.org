Let's review his actions:

1) Goes to give Lupin his medication.

2) Sees the map, so he knows that Pettigrew is alive and where Lupin is.

3) Leaves the potion behind while going to Lupin.

4) Despite knowing Pettigrew is alive, Snape gets the minister to execute Sirius anyways.

Even ignoring the Sirius situation, Snape set up Lupin to either die by Dementor or to have a transformed werewolf on school grounds that he can valiantly slay.

I don't want to pin anything involving restraining Pettigrew on him simply because I can't remember if he was conscious then, but if he was that also goes on his head. (Although Lupin, at least, should have realized ropes don't do shit to a man who can turn into a rat.)
