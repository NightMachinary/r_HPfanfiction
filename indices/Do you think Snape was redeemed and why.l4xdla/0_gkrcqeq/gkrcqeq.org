Not canon Snape. Canon Snape is supposedly an anti-hero trapped between his conflicting roles as a spy and as a teacher. He actually is an abusive fuckwit who exists to make the wrong choice every time. He's a goddamn animate Goofus and Gallant comic.

A good fanfic portrayal of Snape would involve changing his actions. A person seeking redemption wouldn't actively support and encourage the exact environment that drove him into working for a terrorist organization.
