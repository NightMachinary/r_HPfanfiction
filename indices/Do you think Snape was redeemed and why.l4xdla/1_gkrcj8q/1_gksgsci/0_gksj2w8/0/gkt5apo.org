  JKR has it that Snape spitefully placed the sword in the lake, so I have to disagree that he understood what Lily stood for.

Wait, what? Am I misremembering? I thought /Dumbledore told/ Snape that the sword had to be “won” by some courageous act? Which is why Ron could get it, because he dived into the lake to save Harry?

Is fanon fucking with my memory again?

I mean, to be clear putting it in the water is a dick move but pretty low on the risk factor when it comes to something necessitating bravery. It's cold, sure, but it's not like Snape knew the Locket would try to drown him.
