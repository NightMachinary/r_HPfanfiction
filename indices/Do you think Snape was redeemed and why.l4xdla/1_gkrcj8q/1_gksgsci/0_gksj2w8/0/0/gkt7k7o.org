Dumbledore just tells Snape to give Harry the sword without being seen. JKR says on the Sword of Gryffindors article on WW that, out of universe, it's an allusion to excalibur. In universe they location was a result of a 'spiteful impulse.'

I believe it's fanon that the sword has to be won. What JKR says is that it appears for worthy members, which could amount to the sword 'measuring' the bravery of each Gryffindor and appearing to those it deemed brave enough.
