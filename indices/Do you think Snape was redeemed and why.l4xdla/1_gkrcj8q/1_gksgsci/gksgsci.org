I don't at all read that quote that way. I think when Dumbledore told Snape, "if you truly loved her, the way forward is clear," he wasn't talking about protecting Harry. I mean that doesn't even really make sense in context. He was talking about Snape making the choice he failed to make in 5th year, living his life the way Lily wanted him to. The way forward is to turn away from his dark impulses and help people instead of hurting them. Which he does...mostly.

When he says "I thought we were protecting him for her," he's saying "I thought we were both moving forward the way that Lily wanted...to protect, to love, to save." Using Harry, raising him like a pig for slaughter, is the antithesis of what Lily stood for and Snape seems to understand that very well by the end of the story.
