No, but like whistlingbanshee said, he had potential to be. And, while it would have been great for storytelling purposes, it /is/ more realistic, imo, that he wasn't.

Snape was at the beginning of redemption, I think. We saw him being intolerant of the slur. He protected Luna, Ginny, and be Neville. We saw him admit he saved would be victims of Death Eaters.

The "always" moment, though, imo shows he had a ways to go and, given the amount of people who think Snape cared for Harry deep down, I don't think too many paid attention to what he actually said. I know I didn't at first.

  "I thought...all these years...that we were protecting him for her. For Lily."

The whole convo is him admitting Harry's life is of no importance to him outside him being Lily's and that he wouldn't be there if not for the promise.

Maybe it's fan fiction getting to me, but he and Lucius seemed to be good friends, too, by the end and good, redeemed people aren't friends with magical Klansmen.
