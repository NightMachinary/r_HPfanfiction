Okay, yeah I see what you're getting at now. I (having no previous experience in war) don't exactly know what steps to take when and in my mind my priority would be to always save as many people as possible so I think I was thinking more biased than actual canon when thinking about how the teachers would react in the panic that ensued. Many thanks for your explanation, it really helped clear things up for me :)
