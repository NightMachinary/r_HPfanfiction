But you also have to take into account that there would be teachers who put themselves in charge of taking all the children back to safety so that would deplete the numbers, not to mention some teachers were previous death eaters and might possibly join Voldemort the moment they see him back in power (the one that comes to mind is Karkaroff). Sure, there are teachers who would fight Voldemort & Co. but when you really consider all factors, I think it would be a pretty evenly matched battle in the heat of the moment where adrenaline is rushing and nobody is stopping to think about strategy because they were taken off guard and had no advanced warning
