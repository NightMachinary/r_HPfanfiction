Ah, well /that's/ easy: I don't think it was expected that a 14-year-old Harry Potter would survive against the resurrected Voldemort. It's not an unreasonable assumption, mind you---let's not forget just how much his escape was down to luck. In fact, if JKR hadn't foreshadowed the twin wands in the first book, it would have been a blatant deus-ex-machina.
