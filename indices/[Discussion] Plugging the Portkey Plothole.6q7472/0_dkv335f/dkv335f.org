Considering that the maze was only indirectly monitored, I'd say the return trip was entirely intentional, but that the planned end-move was for the champion(s) to be returned to the maze with the trophy, inexplicably dead. That way Riddle could get his restoration and yet appear blameless of Harry's death. Albus might suspect but would have no proof to support a deeper investigation.

That's why, when I wrote the graveyard scene, Wormtail used a stolen Time Turner. They arranged it so that their ritual would take no perceived time away from the grabbing of the trophy at the center of the maze and appearing [dead] at the entrance of it.
