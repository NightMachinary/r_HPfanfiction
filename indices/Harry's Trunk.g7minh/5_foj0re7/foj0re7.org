I don't know why you wouldn't want one, charms like that are extremely helpful and are also used at the Qudditch World Cup. Can't even imagine all the space they'd need for tents big enough for everyone. We complain about it in life about how we can't fit enough things into a bag and such, probably what a wizard thought when he invented the spell.
