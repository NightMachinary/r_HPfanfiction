But expanded trunks are canon! :( [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/extension-charms]]

I do like them a lot yes I don't see the problem with them! Hermione expanded a tiny handbag! At least a trunk is a lot bigger and possibly more believable that way. :( Go after Hermione's even more worldbreaking tiny handbag holding a library and clothes in it!! That is canon too though. :)
