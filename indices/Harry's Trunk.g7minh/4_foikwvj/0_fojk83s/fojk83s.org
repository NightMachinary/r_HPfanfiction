The issue is not that the trunk is enchanted, it is how many extras a lot of authors add to make it "more awesome". It's usually a bloated scene, showing off all kinds of great/useless features which are never mentioned again. Or it is used as an explanation for a powerwank where Harry has a training room outside of time.
