When I first started thinking about the most "optimal" trunk, I was thinking about the ease of finding things. Sure, everything could fit inside of a "standard" trunk, but everything is piled on top of each other, and you have to unpack half of it to find something. Books/cauldron alone would be a nightmare. Tetris would forever be unplayable after playing it with your belongings all year for seven years.
