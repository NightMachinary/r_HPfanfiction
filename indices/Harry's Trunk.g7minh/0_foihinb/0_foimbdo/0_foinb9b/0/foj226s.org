Not only that, but a trunk that's /just/ bigger on the inside would be madness. Like, who wants a room full of garbage?

For me, the perfect trunk would be something like this:

Compartment one: Clothes. If you stand the trunk upright and open it, the closet is revealed. By default, you can see maybe five or six hooks, with a couple of drawers underneath. However, you can drag the wooden bar the hooks are attached to, and the entire line will move aside to be compressed or stored, revealing more hooks for clothing that you can comfortably peruse. The drawers at the bottom are very long, of course.

Compartment two: Books. If you put it down flat on one particular side, It takes the form of a bookshelf, arranged in such a way that they are sorted alphabetically and with their face up. You can push the current shelf down, causing an empty one to appear from the side, storing the books more efficiently and allowing new ones to be added. If you write a title, subject or author on a scrap of paper and drop it down the side into the depths of the bookshelf trunk, the current one will be stored and a new one will appear with all the books you asked for. You can also drag them to the side to reveal more "pages" of bookshelf.

Compartment three: General stuff. If put it down flat and open the other side that's not the bookshelf, you get a small rectangle that's maybe twice or thrice as deep. There, you can put all the other stuff.

I like this system much more than just "yeah my trunk has a room in it".
