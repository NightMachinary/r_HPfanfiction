[[https://www.dormco.com/College_Trunks_Rhino_Standard_Dorm_Size_p/dormco-ralrsl.htm][College Standard Dorm Size]] (googling):

32"L x 6"W x 16"H OR 81.26cm L x 40.64cm W x 40.64cm H

Okay, let's look at the [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Shopping_List][first year equipment]]:

- Three sets of robes
- Hat
- gloves
- cloak
- eight books
- writing utensils (parchment, ink, quills. One metric ton of it)
- wand
- size 2 cauldron
- set of glass/crystal phials
- telescope
- brass scales
- Potions ingredients? (I think they bought those correct me if I'm wrong)

Now... How does all of this fit? Add in six standard book of spells books. And maybe six more DADA books. Lockhart... yeah, his books too. Oh, add another +3 for elective courses. And an invisibility cloak. Another Herbology book. Another potions book... BROOMSTICK!

Yeah, this isn't going to fit.

BROOMSTICK! How the hell does that fit?

I stand by my "Three compartment trunk". Closet for clothes, bookshelf for books, and the last one is slightly expanded for everything else.

Hedwigs cage? Quidditch uniform... Crap, those "regular standard" trunks must be hitting critical mass already.

Edit: This started off as a "Yeah, a regular trunk would work..." and then I looked up the shopping lists...

Edit x2: Apparently JKR thought of this after the series was done. I give you... [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/extension-charms]["Hogwarts school trunks, like the majority of wizarding luggage, are issued with capacity enhancing or extension charms as standard."]]

Edit x3: Didn't Hermione fill her trunk up, and that's why she couldn't bring Hogwarts, a History? This is conflicting with the pottermore link. Ravenclaws would have that trunk filled up in no time.
