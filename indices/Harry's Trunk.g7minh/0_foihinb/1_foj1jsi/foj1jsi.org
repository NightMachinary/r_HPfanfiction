My hc is that the extension charm doesn't extend bag/trunk/car/etc infinitely and â€˜the amount of extension' should be determined when the charm is cast and the object wouldn't stretch past that set limit. So a magical school trunk is 3 times the size of a regular muggle trunk but still has its limit. From Hermione's beaded handbag we also know the contents could be sorted and summoned. But that could be easily explained by the difference in how the charm was cast. For example a cheap trunk would have just one big compartment inside and more expensive ones would have several.
