Just a little side note, Harry didn't just accidentally lose the mirror in his trunk, he activity chose to not open the mirror from Sirius. He didn't open it because he didn't want to feel tempted to call on Sirius for help. He didn't even know it was a mirror until after Sirius died. Then he purposefully threw it in the bottom of his trunk because he was angry. He didn't want to see it again but he also couldn't throw Sirius's last gift to him in the garbage.
