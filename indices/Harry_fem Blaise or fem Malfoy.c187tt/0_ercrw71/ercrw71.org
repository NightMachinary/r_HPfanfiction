Apprentice Potter ([[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/]]) and its sequels (Journeyman Potter; Master Potter) have fem!Blaise paired with Harry. I think they're good stories, but the last one isn't complete.

A Harry-fem!Draco that I like is The Wizard That Never Was ([[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/fanfictionfederation/the-wizard-that-never-was-t52.html]]).
