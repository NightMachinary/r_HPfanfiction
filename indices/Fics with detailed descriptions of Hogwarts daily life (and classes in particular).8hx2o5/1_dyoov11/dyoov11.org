linkffn(The Arithmancer) If Hermione was a maths genius... how would things be different? The author goes into extreme detail of classes and magical theory. All of the math-related content is sound and taken from real-life calculus, linear algebra, etc. Hermione is brilliant. The fic is a bit long, however.
