This fic is great. The tournament starts around chapter 3 or so iirc and while the first task is the same thing as canon (dragons!), it's handled in a pretty original way. The second task is completely new though.

Edit: 2 more things: The main character is a gun-loving psychopath with a rap sheet that would make Hitler proud and this fic has a ton of stuff so good I consider them headcanon now. Particularly why the purebloods never seem to learn from their mistakes and why nobody seems to get seriously injured at Hogwarts.
