I've written a different Triwizward Tournament in my AU "Patron". I tried to stay true to the spirit of the tournament (putting three magic schools against each other in a year-long event, to foster international relations and team spirit), without the lunatic parts. So, it's not quite as deadly (without interference from outside sources), far more spectator-friendly, and involves more than just the champions. linkffn(11080542)
