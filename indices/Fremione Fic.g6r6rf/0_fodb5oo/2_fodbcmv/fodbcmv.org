He tried."

  "He regretted it," Hermione grins, though her stomach still feels heavy from the unexpected mention of her parents.

  Ron blinks. "/You/ turned Lee's hair green?"

  "Yes," she shrugs. "I tried green and silver but I couldn't figure out the spell to do both at the same time, it just kept turning fully green or fully silver on me. Green was more obvious."
