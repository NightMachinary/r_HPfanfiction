I was looking for a good fic (I'm kicking off my own Fred/Hermione fic and wanted to be in the mood for the ship!) and stumbled onto this recommendation over Tumblr. Once I read it, beyond hooked! I finished the last half a chapter I had left and now I'm eagerly awaiting the next! It's so so great!
