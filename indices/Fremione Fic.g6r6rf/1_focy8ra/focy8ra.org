My [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] review:

*The good:* A generally well-written fic, with good technicals and dialogue. Hermione's interactions with Fred and George are realistic, endearing, and feel natural.\\
*The bad:* The writing style uses a tad too many adverbs and superlatives, but it's a minor thing. At least as of this chapter, the fic is a canon rehash. We are given some glimmers of hope for a potential divergence (Will Hermione be sorted into Ravenclaw or even Slytherin in Chapter 6? Will she successfully manipulate Peeves in Chapter 9? Will she avoid the troll because she actually /does/ have friends in this chapter?) but then we are invariably disappointed when it's back on the canon rails, often with word-for-word identical dialogue.\\
*The verdict:* This fic is shaping up to be a canon plot rehash from Hermione's perspective, with an occasional interlude in which Fred and George grab Hermione and show off their latest prank, and romantic outcomes might be different.
