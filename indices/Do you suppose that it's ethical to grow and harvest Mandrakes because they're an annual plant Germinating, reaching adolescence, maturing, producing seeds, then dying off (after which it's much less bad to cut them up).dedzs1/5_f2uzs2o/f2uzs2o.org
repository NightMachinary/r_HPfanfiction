We don't know if mandrakes lose their magic after their prime. Considering that potions used timing pretty regularly I'd like to assume that magicals only harvest mandrakes at the point where their magic is most powerful. Also, like [[/u/Astramancer_][u/Astramancer_]] said, we're not even sure if they are sentient.

Of course you can make the other side of the arguments. Wizards are stupid and unethical, that harvesting mandrakes after they died is a possible alternative.
