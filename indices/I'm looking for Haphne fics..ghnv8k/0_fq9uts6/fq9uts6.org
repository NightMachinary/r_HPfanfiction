I can offer you Haphne fics at the very least. Not sure if I know any stories like what you asked.

Harry Potter and the Unexpected Friend - linkffn(12557197) - A pretty good story with a good sequel.

Ice Cream - linkffn(13323518) - A really nice one-shot that is short and sweet.

An Ordinary Magical Couple - linkffn(13304599) - A decent fic that I enjoyed. And it does take place in Hogwarts year, it just starts as little older.

Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent - linkffn(13133746) - An excellent fic that really does things right.

Soul Scars - linkffn(12501270) - This story has Daphne going into Gryffindor, however it is a Harry/Hermione/Susan/Daphne story and deals with soul bonds.

Harry Potter and the Magic of Life - linkffn(11002763) - It starts out at the beginning of the summer of the end of the third year and continues on from there. It is a good story and one I recommend.

A Blank Canvas - linkffn(12294875) - A decent story

Dancing in the Green - linkffn(11703507) - One of my favorite Haphne stories, takes place in the fourth year and is a one-shot but it is a long one.

Midnight Flights and Midnights Follies - linkffn(11490053) - Is also a decent story
