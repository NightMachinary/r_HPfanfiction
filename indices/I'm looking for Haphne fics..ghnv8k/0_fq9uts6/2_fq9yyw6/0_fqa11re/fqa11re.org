Let's see, I already gave you most of the stories take place in Hogwarts before the final battle.

Birds and Monsters - linkffn(13480069) - This is an ongoing series about the two starting at Sorcerer's stone. It's still going on.

And, yeah any other Haphne fic I think I have takes place after the final battle or some version of the final battle. Besides Soul Scars, all the other stories start later in the timeline. Sorry if this list wasn't so helpful.
