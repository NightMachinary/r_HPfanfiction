I second the above comment and add what I had written before looking down and realizing someone already got the point across.

Carnivorous muffin does not write a story to get to a destination carnivorous muffin writes about a journey with no destination. there is no beginning middle end there are the points in between. the stories are not about defeating the big bad or doing the thing but about the main character who may or may not do the thing and may or may not beat the big bad. its like how there are some parts of one piece where the plot does not advance but it's okay because you're a moron if the plot is why you watch one piece, one piece is about the adventure and the character involved with some plot advancement to keep it on track. carnivorous muffins big bads and things to do are not about doing the thing or beating the big bad, they exist to keep the journey on track and show the characters involved.

tldr: it's about the journey, not the destination.
