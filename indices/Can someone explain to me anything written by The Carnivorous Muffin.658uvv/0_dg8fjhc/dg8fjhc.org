I think I was the one who mentioned it last time, so I'll expand with a passage from wikipedia:

  While a great deal of absurdist fiction may be humorous or irrational in nature, the hallmark of the genre is neither comedy nor nonsense, but rather, the study of human behavior under circumstances (whether realistic or fantastical) that appear to be purposeless and philosophically absurd. Absurdist fiction posits little judgment about characters or their actions; that task is left to the reader. Also, the "moral" of the story is generally not explicit, and the themes or characters' realizations --- if any --- are often ambiguous in nature. Additionally, unlike many other forms of fiction, absurdist works will not necessarily have a traditional plot structure (i.e., rising action, climax, falling action, etc.).

So basically, Lily, the main character, is not there to solve the problem. Lily, the main character, /is/ the problem. How she acts and reacts, how she views the world, and how she breaks every possible law of magic and nature, despite how impossibly absurd it should be. Carnivorous Muffin isn't writing a typical Beginning>Conflict>Climax>Ending story, he's writing a story exploring Lily's own viewpoint and character growth. And since Lily has her own metaphysical logic, the story follows it and leaving all the other characters behind in the dust, struggling to make sense of it all.

In simplest terms, it's not a grand fantasy epic. It's a character study of what happens when you put a god among the little people. Of all the characters, not just Lily.
