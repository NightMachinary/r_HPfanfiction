How to approach carnivorous muffins works?

I really like them, but if you're not enjoying them then don't read them.

I'd rec lily and the art of being Sisyphus over October, as it updates more often.

What you need to know is that the plot isn't that super important, it's that there's a type of humour in having an all powerful being inhabit the body of a little girl. Lily doesn't need to go to hogwarts because she can reshape reality, but she does because it might be more narratively fulfilling.

In a typical story harry sees an obstacle, works out how to overcome it, then overcomes it. Lily removes the obstacle with a wave of her hand and doesn't understand why everyone else doesn't.
