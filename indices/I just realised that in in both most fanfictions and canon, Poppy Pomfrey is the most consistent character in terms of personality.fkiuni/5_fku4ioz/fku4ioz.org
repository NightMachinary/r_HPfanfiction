I don't remember which one, +either Goblet or Phoenix,+ but Molly was talking about using love potions to Ginny and Hermione - wasn't amormentia, and it certainly wasn't used on Harry - but Molly using love potions is canon.

It never went anywhere, and was basically a throwaway line, but it's still there.

This also has nothing to do with the original topic, but I have nothing to really add to that, other than pointing out that thing about love Potion.

Edit: it was Prisoner
