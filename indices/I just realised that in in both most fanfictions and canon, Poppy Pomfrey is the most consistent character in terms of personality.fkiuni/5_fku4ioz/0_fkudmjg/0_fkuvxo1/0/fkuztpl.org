That's what's annoying about such throw-away lines- something is sort of mentioned as a joke when it's actually messed-up. But for those who hate Molly it's just a means to write about how awful she is.And I really think she has other issues that you could criticise her for as students are actually taught to brew those potions at school. So I see the issue but as it's not about exploring her flaws as much as it is about bashing her, I don't think it's fair.
