  as students are actually taught to brew those potions at school

Did they actually brew love potions? I know Slughorn showed them /Amortentia/, which is a good thing coz students should know how to identify such Potions, but I don't recall actual brewing being ever stated.

  That's what's annoying about such throw-away lines- something is sort of mentioned as a joke when it's actually messed-up. But for those who hate Molly it's just a means to write about how awful she is.

I don't disagree with you on this but to add, it also shows how the author treats the subject of love potions especially when (maybe even /because/) the target is male. Romilda's assault on Ron (and yes, it is assault IMO) is treated very cavalierly by everyone around him, himself included. No action is taken against her that I can recall, and Harry, Hermione, Ginny or Lavender never mention it again. Then, there's Merope's rape of Riddle Sr where her fate is treated as sad but Riddle Sr is heartless for abandoning her.

Molly's mention of love potions can go either way based on how the author treats the topic /after/ this event. In canon, it is treated horribly badly. It says a lot about how the wizarding community treats the subject.

It could be done better though.

Imagine for example, Molly was preparing for her Potions NEWT and was working on a better love potion /antidote/. She needs to test how effective it is and her then boyfriend Arthur Weasley volunteered to be the test subject. They tested it in private, and Molly, ever the prankster, let Arthur make a fool of himself for a while (cue giggling), before giving him the antidote. Arthur is pretending not hear Molly tell the story while reading his newspaper, and Hermione tells Harry the details later when he asks what they were giggling about.

  So I see the issue but as it's not about exploring her flaws as much as it is about bashing her, I don't think it's fair.

But that's just bad writing though. Not every good person is /universally/ good, and a lot of otherwise good people have some horrible beliefs. It's fair to call Molly out on it based on canon. The premise itself isn't flawed, just the delivery.
