They don't brew the potions but Slughorn says they should be able to brew this potion by the end of their 7th year. The twins sell them at their shop. And I get calling Molly out on it, only it feels somewhat odd to me given that that's the general attitude so I'd prefer it to be an issue raised as a way to change the general attitude. There's a matter of hexing people and laughing at them for instance. And Harry hexes Filch, who is a squib, but no one says anything to him about that. There's a lot of messed-up stuff going on there. But I think the reason I am not particularly interested in it is because then this stops being an enjoyable series. The same way I wouldn't enjoy reading about Pomfrey being sacked for not noticing the signs of child-abuse. Reality and Harry Potter don't always mix well.
