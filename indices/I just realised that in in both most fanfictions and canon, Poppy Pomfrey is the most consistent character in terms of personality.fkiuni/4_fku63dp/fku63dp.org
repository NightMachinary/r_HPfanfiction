I've seen a fic with Assassin!Pomfrey. Healers in that fic had all sorts of legal immunities (comparable to the Red Cross IRL), but some of them took a different healers oath that let them kill in defense of their fellow healers. Some of the Death Eaters attacked Saint Mungo's and Poppy responded by visiting the death eaters and killing the one responsible by switching a bubble of air into their blood to induce an instant heart attack.
