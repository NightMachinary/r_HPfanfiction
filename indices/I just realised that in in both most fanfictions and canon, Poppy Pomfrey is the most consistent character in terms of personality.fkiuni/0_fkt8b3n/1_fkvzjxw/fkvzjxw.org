Umbridge is usually portrayed as much more incomptent though, like at this point is has become common fanon that she sucks extremely in Defense against the Dark Arts, when Canon potrayed her as quite competent and able to use powerful magic like the Patronus or the Cruciatus and had her be a horrible teacher Becca she doesn't want to teach instead of her bein unable to.
