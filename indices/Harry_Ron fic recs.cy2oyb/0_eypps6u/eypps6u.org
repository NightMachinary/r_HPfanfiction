[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/562941][Prelude and Fugue]] linkao3(562941) is a masterpiece. It's rather long and engaging all the way through.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1000792][I Can See Us Dying ... Aren't We?]] linkao3(1000792) is an excellent trio turned unrequited love between Harry and Ron. Can't recommend it highly enough.
