Yeah and the way I remember it is that the 3-Year Summer was between books 4 and 5, and the primary "leaked book" thing was prior to book 6, because the concept art for the cover really /was/ leaked and kicked off the /Green Flame Torch/ rumor.

Either way there was already enough porn by 2001 that the the fledgling purity culture got it's hooks into the fandom, and the 2002-2003 Great Purge at FFN culled thousands of explicit fics from that archive, scattering the fandom, tho mostly to the /well-established/ adultfanfiction dot net.

I'm just saying it was all there. The bashing too, although we didn't call it bashing back then, we just recognized it as an easy plot device to nix a canon ship out of the way for our OTP ;)
