Actually you're wrong. Harry Potter fanfiction didn't start out with sex. Agree that some works involved sex but the point was that some people tried to trick others into reading their works which would be presented as a leaked copy of the original books as people were awaiting them to appear. This phenomenon appeared as people were awaiting book 4 because book 3 ended on a sort of cliffhanger and became prominent as people were awaiting book 5 which was the longest break JK took between book releases as she got married.
