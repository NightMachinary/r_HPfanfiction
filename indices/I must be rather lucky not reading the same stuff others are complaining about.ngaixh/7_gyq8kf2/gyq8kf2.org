Well, to sum up my answer, people are complaining because they are too stupid to don't complain about things they don't like.

And the funny thing about them complaining about things in stories is that they are still reading them even though they don't like them (How would they know about their dislikes if they don't have experience reading few or more stories with them, hmm?).

It isn't that hard to search for something different if you don't like the things you are reading BUT who the fuck would do that when you can trash talk and complain with other people who have the same problem, that they don't even know they have, about reading stuff they don't like or straight up hate?

And the answer isn't that you are evading bashing - that thing alone isn't even a bad thing on its own. What you are doing is actually being an intellectual person and ignoring things you know you will not like.

I'm 100% certain that in few years from now bashing will be popular again. Because popular trends in books function the same way as art does. You have classicism style and after that you have romanticism style and again and again - with few periods of experimenting and doing what the fuck you want in between them. Same with bashing.

At the beginning of Harry Potter fanfictions bashing wasn't popular (I don't know how the first fics looked like but I can say for sure that the plot wasn't about bashing - the center of them was porn stuff. And how do I know that? Because it always starts with sex and so on) and then it started getting popularity until practically everyone was implementing it in some way and after that people got sick of it because it was everywhere and they wanted something original again and so it started going down into the level of extreme dislike from some people.

Guess what will happen next? It will go up in popularity because it cannot go down more than it already is. Like everything else.

(Yes, I'm aware about works that will set a new meta on their own just by existing but that's another chapter, okay?)

Oh, and now I was reading Resurrect The Living by fascinationex and it was awesome (it's finally close to that ohh so good sounding prologue and I'm more than hyped) and also finished Petrichor by BlameMyMuses. Well, they aren't both completed but I doubt the second one will get updated so it's finished xD. I started reading MoD/necromancer Harry again because I simply like it even though, like some people would say, it's cliche.

And do you know what else is cliche?

Your name :) (that's no on you NotSoSnarky but for all the people who complain about stupid shit. I'm only specifying it just to be safe xD)
