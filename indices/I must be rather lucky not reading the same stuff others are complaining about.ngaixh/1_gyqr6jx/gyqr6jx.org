I don't see it either I'm, mostly because I just scroll right on by now. I'm not opposed to discussion and different view points, but it's gotten to the point that fics i really like are being ruined by other people being so negative. I have enough of that in my life. Fan fiction is a little happy bubble I like to escape to and I don't need complaints ruining that for me lol.
