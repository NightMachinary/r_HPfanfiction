so the nature of fanfiction is that 80 percent of it is shit. to be completely fair this is largely not a problem to most people since which 20 percent is decent is somewhat subjective and the tag and summary system help narrow that down.

but when you get into tags or characters or relationships is when it really starts to show since your no longer skimming but attempting to judge quality

lets give a quick example

Pansy Parkinson: a named character within Harry's year who has spoken and interact with the main trio and is based on amount of dialogue one of the most fleshed out characters within the student body (not a hard bar to pass admittedly)

archive of our own: 16255 stories containing pansy: switch to highest Kudos and ?...

a story about Draco and Harry's slowburn romance after being mistakenly given the same bedroom

alright first tag to be removed:>english only 14978

remove omegaverse because fuck this garbage trope:14870

exclude crossovers: 14283

exclude relationship Draco/harry: 8496 well thats a huge drop lets see what the top story for pansy parkinson is now

a harry potter soul bond fic to tom riddle with hermione granger bashing as a tagas well as master of death harry

exclude relationship Harry/tom: 8390

top story Hermione sold into sexual slavery (remove sexual slavery tag 8376)

the first top story now is leo inter serpentes which is part of a series which ive never read but it doesnt look horrible

the heir of something or other which is second and quite good but pansy is a minor character

the next 8 stories outside of those you would think should have been covered by the above tags are now draco/hermione

and it is the 17th story ugly: in defense of pansy parkinson which i would recommend is the first story on this list where pansy parkinson is the focal character

draco/hermione is clogging up space 6469 and that story is now 8

remove harems and harry/snape its 6369

remove mpreg 6324

remove alternate universe muggle 6239

and so on and so forth. one begins to question if one will ever actually find a fic with her as a major character not only present in the tags because every student is present in the tags
