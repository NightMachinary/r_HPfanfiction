As someone who married a British guy and lived in France for a couple years, I absolutely agree that it reads as cultural differences written from the perspective of an English person with significant biases. I know several French-schooled people (both French and British in nationality) that deeply believe the French system is better than English/American systems. I took some classes at a law school while living in France and met several professors that perpetuated that idea among their students, as well. It could have been that Rowling had a run-in with people of that opinion (which, in my experience, is often bluntly and dismissively expressed) and, in combination with her obvious writing of all French people as snobs --- lazy and clich√© as it was ---, Fleur ended up treated quite awfully for as neutral a character as she is.

Also, Rowling wrote lots of people as "superior" and, therefore, (varying levels of) bad and championed those that were "looked down upon" in a manner I found uncomfortable and oddly defensive. Thinking about her TERF-y self-victimization, I wonder how many of more of those thoughts I missed or internalized as a kid.

Edit: I would really like to emphasize most of the bad guys in HP are obviously awful, but Fleur's slightly holier-than-thou characterization didn't/doesn't make her a bad guy and the entire class of young Slytherin students (literal children!) didn't deserve to be written off, either.
