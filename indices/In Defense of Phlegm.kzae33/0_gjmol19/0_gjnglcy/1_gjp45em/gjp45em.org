  Fleur ended up treated quite awfully for as neutral a character as she is.

Yes yes yes. Nearly every scene with Fleur being "snobby" just made me like her more and like Ginny/Hermione/Molly less. I've been paying more attention to how jkr handles her female characters in my reread and this was one of the several instances where I was "ughhhhh"ing my way through.

  Also, Rowling wrote lots of people as "superior" and, therefore, (varying levels of) bad and championed those that were "looked down upon" in a manner I found uncomfortable and oddly defensive. Thinking about her TERF-y self-victimization, I wonder how many of more of those thoughts I missed or internalized as a kid.

I never thought of this but yep, I think that tracks.
