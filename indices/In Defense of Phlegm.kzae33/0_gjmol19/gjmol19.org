Most of the friction between Fleur and the Weasleys reads like culture differences to me. I don't actually know any British or French people so Idk how accurate that is, but it feels like someone from NYC visiting future in-laws in Arkansas. Fleur says things very bluntly, so even if she truly doesn't mean them to sound rude, the way she says them is so different from how the Weasleys have interacted with each other (and friends/acquaintances in general) their whole lives that they can't take it as anything /but/ rudeness. And they're saying the British equivalent of "bless your heart" meaning "you're the worst person I've ever met and I know Lucius Malfoy," but that level of passive aggressiveness doesn't register with Fleur who probably has a totally different scale for what counts as being rude.

Edit: although Molly straight up thinking she's only with Bill bc he's hot or whatever is an asshole move. No amount of perceived rudeness excuses that.
