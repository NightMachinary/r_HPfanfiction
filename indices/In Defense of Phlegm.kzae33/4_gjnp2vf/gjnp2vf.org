What I want an answer for is, why does calling Harry a little boy make her arrogant? A fourteen-year-old comes in with people saying that said child is now a participant in the tournament, a tournament meant for adults. Why do we assume she's not complaining about the fact that a child is in a death tournament? I mean, I think we can all agree that she was using "little boy" to make sure everyone was aware that Harry was a child, but why do we all seem to think that she's in the same mindset as Karkaroff and Maxime? The other 2 champions weren't.

Besides she's dating Bill, who is canonically a fucking Tomb Raider. I assume badassery on all fronts, including interpersonal relationships.
