Eh. Social mores and personal idiosyncrasies vary, so what some people find reprehensible, others will regard as intrinsic to their personal beliefs and characters. Some people would be offended by her words, whereas others might just not care or be bothered.

EDIT - to give a weird example, talking to strangers without a direct purpose. In parts of the US, this is regarded as pretty normal. In the UK, you'd get a similar look as if you'd suddenly started telling said stranger about your last bowel movement in graphic detail.

From what I'm reading in this thread, the points of contention seem to be twofold. Some say that she was rude, yes, but she didn't mean to be (either cultural/linguistic differences or a personal unawareness). Others say that the Weasleys were shits to her, so she gets to be a shit back.
