Like I said, I understand her feelings towards the Weasley place and even agree (I have very, very strong hayfever, so being violently allergic to greenery means my relationship to the countryside will never be amiable). Everyone has different interests, tastes, and comfort zones and there's nothing wrong with that. If the rural life isn't what interests her, that's completely okay and she has no obligation to get involved or do anything she doesn't want to. My only comment is that the way she expressed those feelings to and around the Weasleys is pretty blunt and poorly phrased and I'm not surprised it pissed them off and that there were better ways she could've said those things. Having to hold your tongue when visiting the in-laws you don't like is practically a cliche at this point, so it's not entirely outlandish an idea.

The better approach in UK Etiquette would be to be more polite about her disinterest, basically. I'm not sure how she'd say it specifically, because I've never been quite able to get my head around her way of talking, but taking an "I'm sure you like living here, but this isn't what I'm used to. I'm just here because I adore your son and want to get along with his family." approach would've been less likely to piss them off.

Again though, not blaming her, and definitely agree with drenlogib that both sides are being dickish in that situation.
