There's a running (slightly serious) joke about the town I currently live in - there's only two things to do here, drugs and each other. As an asexual who doesn't even know what meth is, much less how to take it (do you sniff it, do you inject it, do you rub it between your toes - I haven't a clue), I feel about my town pretty much how Fleur feels about the Weasleys. It's rude to say it quite so bluntly, sure, but the sentiment is fine.

Same with the education conversation, I think. The sentiment is fine, but the tone itself is the thing that rubs people the wrong. There's a difference between "Ah, what a shithole!" and "Ah. What a shithole." y'know?

Tbh, I think most of Fleur's character comes from old English stereotypes about the French - pretentious about cuisine, supercilious, and hot, and also really obsessed with fighting with the English. She's basically two stereotype-levels up from the "Hon hon hon, your muzzer was a hamster and your fazzer smells of elderberries!" guy in Monty Python.
