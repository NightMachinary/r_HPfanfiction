Because MACUSA which is a representative democracy like the USA predates the USA. They did it first. I'm not even joking. The reason why it's weird is that the Magicals seem like they should have influenced our government seeing as they came up with it 100 years prior. Besides I think everyone can agree that New York was the worst place to put it. The Woolworth building where MACUSA is located was built around 1900. By 1900 NYC was a massive trade center with a huge population. MACUSA is specifically known for being particularly harsh on segregation, that's why they used to hold their congress in Washington State. NYC just isn't conducive to secrecy whatsoever. Even if we ignore the American political values which MACUSA shares, it'd make more sense to put their seat of government near the No-Maj's so they could keep an eye on them. The MACUSA, I would argue, is the weirdest piece of canon by far.
