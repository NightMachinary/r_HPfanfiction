I think it's fair to admit both sides are wrong. Molly and the gang don't treat Fleur right, but Fleur doesn't treat them right. Like every single thing we hear from her is negative about their surroundings, usually the weasley family. Individually, they can be made out to be normal statements, but if that's all she says, she's kinda a jerk. Like the first nice thing we hear is her wanting to still marry bill, and even then she insults how the English cook steak lol.
