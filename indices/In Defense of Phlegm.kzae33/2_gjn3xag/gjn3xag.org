Also I think there is something to say about second language speakers. When I started learning English, there are things I said that were rude because I did not know they were, things that in French were fine but when translated, usually word by word, were rude. Or also idioms.... for example once I was talking to a friend who told about a problem she had and I answered “big deal” which, in my head, meant this is big oh my god are you ok...... yeah not so much.It is canon that Fleur struggles with English, but like many author Rowling only concentrates on the accent.
