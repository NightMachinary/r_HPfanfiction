Please don't be rude. They are fictional characters in a fictional world. Am I offending you in some way by expressing an opinion? Mate, I like you. I like your fics. You seem nice and offered actual points, so what the hell did I do?

1. I reread it to further my understanding of an aspect of canon. I don't give a fuck that you don't like that, I will be intellectually honest about my reasons. I thought Fleur was decent but superior. I was then corrected and told that she was a horrible person. I remembered some lines from the book, and thought that it didn't make sense. So I reread it.
2. I said I was only looking at HBP. I wanted to look at Phlegm bit. Not an analysis of Fleur's entire character.
3. This is a misunderstanding of the point. I'm saying that their objections are wrong, and their arguments boil to down to we don't like her because she's pretty. This is part of a thesis, I had yet to start providing evidence. Everything you said about Fleur's behaviour towards them would have occurred off-screen. This is not good evidence. Molly is called out by Ginny for being a massive hypocrite in the rushing into marriage issue. Molly then proves that she doesn't think Bill and Fleur should be together when she says that it's different, she and Arthur were made for each other. She is criticizing the relationship on more than a, 'it's too fast,' level.
4. There's not much to do here is saying that there's not much do here. The context is that she's bored of seeing the same faces, and is happy to see Harry. Again, I don't agree with the chickens thing. I like chickens and cooking. However, I see no issue in someone saying that they don't. She does not criticize the house, she does not criticize them. She says that there isn't much to do besides cooking and chickens. This is not far from the truth based on how we see all of the kids spend their summer. Cooking, caring for the garden and animals, and Quidditch.
5. I think we're in agreeance about this.
6. Molly was inviting Tonks around for dinner a lot. The kids thought that her goal was to get Bill together with Tonks. I admit I was wrong. You were right. Molly almost definitely knew the real story with Tonks, and there isn't enough evidence to prove she was being a matchmaker.
7. Molly /was/, 'oh my god, his life is going to be ruined.' Fleur calls her on the fact that she /says/ the marriage will be off. I was wrong, it wasn't insinuation, she just straight-up said it. The interesting thing here is that it takes a moment for Fleur to stumble on the right accusation. She didn't know that they thought she was shallow. She thought Molly was saying Bill wouldn't love her anymore. She thought that was an insult to Bill, and was offended. When Molly said that wasn't it, she realized Molly thought she was going to break off her engagement with Bill. I don't have anything else to say here.

Now can we be friendly again? I don't enjoy this kind of dialogue. It's not fun.
