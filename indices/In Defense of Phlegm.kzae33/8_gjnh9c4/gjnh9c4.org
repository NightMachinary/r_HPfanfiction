Ah, what the heck, I'll bite.

  So I just reread HBP for this reason. There's a lot of people hating on Fleur.
#+end_quote

You admit you have a preconceived notion that you are actively looking to refute with your re-read? That isn't the best opening for your defense, if I'm being honest.

#+begin_quote
  I'd just like to real quick say that she's not actually being a massive dickwad, just occasionally superior. I'm going to only cover HBP though.
#+end_quote

Actually, I would argue that is far more often than just "occasionally," but I respect that you're looking only at /Half-Blood Prince./

#+begin_quote
  The Weasleys' and Hermione's objections boil down to, 'we don't like her because she's pretty.'
#+end_quote

That's not accurate at all.

Ginny's first complaint about Fleur is that she treats Ginny condescendingly, as if Ginny were "about three."

Having had /six/ brothers who babied her to varying degrees and now four of them have left home, Ginny resents being treated as a baby again.

We don't know the degree to which Fleur speaks to her, but it's hardly a stretch for Fleur who called Harry "a leetle boy" to speak this way to Ginny. Whether she realizes that Ginny--who is described as small for her age--is actually almost fifteen is another matter.

Hermione describes Fleur as "full of herself," and given Fleur's bluntness in putting down British customs in favor of French, that's not exactly a stretch for Hermione either.

Molly, it should be noted, does not approve of Ginny and Hermione calling Fleur "Phlegm." Her primary objection is that Bill and Fleur--who have known each other for barely more than a year--are rushing their engagement. Which is a /very/ justified stance.

#+begin_quote
  When in the Burrow, Fleur says that there isn't much to do unless you like cooking and chickens. This is not a massive dick move. This is someone not liking cooking and taking care of chickens.
#+end_quote

I would argue that it is too a dick move. One of my favorite places in the world is my aunt's farmhouse, and there isn't actually much to do there except talk to assorted family members.

Fleur is criticizing the Burrow--which has been the Weasleys' home and is now the Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix--as inferior to her presumably much more urban lifestyle in France, and implying that it's inferior.

#+begin_quote
  The next 'rude' thing she says is when the OWL results come in. She says that they did the testing differently in France, and she says it's better.
#+end_quote

While I agree that this is not exceptionally rude, Fleur has a reputation for being harshly critical of Hogwarts. And I'd like to see how the curriculum actually compares. Viktor Krum, for his part, said that fourth-year Harry knew how to do things he did not.

#+begin_quote
  Ginny, Molly and Hermione go around trying to set Bill up with Tonks, and calling Fleur shallow.
#+end_quote

Molly did not try to set Bill up with Tonks. She gave Tonks emotional support for Remus' rejection. Hermione and Ginny merely thought that Molly was playing matchmaker because they were teenagers and teenagers are kind of stupid.

Later, Molly defends "dear Tonks" because Fleur snidely criticized Tonks--who was an Auror and a member of the Order. But she's not trying to set her son up with Tonks, she's merely defending Tonks' honor.

#+begin_quote
  Molly insinuates that Fleur will break off her engagement with Bill because he has scars now
#+end_quote

This was less insinuation and more "My son has been mangled by a /werewolf./ His life is ruined." Don't accuse Molly of things she isn't actually guilty of.
