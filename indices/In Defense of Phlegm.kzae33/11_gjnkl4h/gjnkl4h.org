  The Weasleys' and Hermione's objections boil down to, 'we don't like her because she's pretty.'
#+end_quote

Why do you say that? None of their remarks had anything to do with her appearance, but with her snobbishness. Women can hate other women for reasons besides superficial jealousy, you know.

  When in the Burrow, Fleur says that there isn't much to do unless you like cooking and chickens. This is not a massive dick move. This is someone not liking cooking and taking care of chickens. I don't get understand that position personally, but it appears to be a thing.

Huh? Maybe I'm different, but if a guest rushed over to a family friend who's visiting and exclaimed how she's so happy they came since there's nothing to do besides (insert any two actives), I would be offended. It's such an unnecessarily rude thing to say. Like, even when I was a kid and visiting people I didn't like, I never said anything like that, because it's so mean and makes the hosts feel like they didn't do enough to engage me. If I could recognize that as a kid, Fleur should be able to do so as a 20 year old woman.

  The next 'rude' thing she says is when the OWL results come in. She says that they did the testing differently in France, and she says it's better. This is again, a fairly normal conversation. I've had the same conversation multiple times with friends who had different teachers in school or went to a different school.
#+end_quote

I'd say the next rude thing she did was smiling and saying how funny the twins are after Hermione was punched in the face by one of their products and was distraught about not being able to heal her black eye, but different strokes for different folks, I guess. Anyway, I think what she said in itself wasn't rude, but when and how she said it was. Hermione was acting hysterical (flapping her arms around, listing everything she failed, etc.), Ron was shouting at Hermione, and Harry was about to throw up, but she decided to insert herself into the conversation and talk complacently (which means smug or exceptionally pleased) about how Beauxbatons did it much better. That's a rude thing to do, and anyone with basic social skills knows that.

  Ginny, Molly and Hermione go around trying to set Bill up with Tonks
#+end_quote

Okay, this is the part where I'm actually confused, since it never happened. Ginny and Hermione thought that was what Molly was doing, but they never interfered and it was found out by the end of the book that Molly was actually inviting Tonks over to support her after Lupin rejected her.

Also, they were exceptionally kind to Fleur compared to Fleur's behavior towards them. Hermione only insulted Fleur once, and Molly was trying her best to be kind until she finally snapped when Bill was injured. Sure, sometimes her responses to Fleur were a bit clipped, but she tried her best. Heck, she even chided Ginny every time she insulted Fleur, and Ginny even stated that Molly was trying to act like she liked Fleur to everyone. I will admit that Ginny was a bit rude to Fleur, but she's not nearly as bad as Fleur. She only mocks her around 5 times.

  and calling Fleur shallow.
#+end_quote

When? None of them ever did that. Ginny implied that Bill was shallow, but she never said that about Fleur, and Molly implied Fleur was shallow after Bill was injured, but she never outright stated it.

#+begin_quote
  Molly insinuates that Fleur will break off her engagement with Bill because he has scars now. Fleur blows up at her because Molly just became a bloody asshole.
#+end_quote

So Molly, who was trying her best to be kind to Fleur for a whole year, is suddenly a "bloody asshole" for finally snapping at Fleur when her son was permanently injured? Sure, Fleur is technically right in this situation for once, but I hate how it suddenly excuses Fleur being a colossal bitch to everyone. Fleur should have apologized to Molly for how she came across, and /then/ go in on her for thinking she would leave Bill.

  This has been my Ted Talk
#+end_quote

No offense, but your Ted Talk was horrible and one-sided. You failed to mention how Fleur criticized everything (Molly's food, the house, Molly's favorite music, etc.), and how arrogant she was in general, and you instead treated her like a poor, innocent saint who was terrorized by three evil she-demons. Now, I don't think Fleur was totally wrong. She was thrust into a totally new situation, and the women around her avoided her and laughed at her behind her back. Molly, Ginny, and Hermione all should have been more understanding of Fleur. But you have to realize that Fleur should take responsibility for her bad attitude and arrogance. If she was nice and didn't criticize everything, they would have accepted her with open arms. They didn't hate her because she was pretty or anything like that, and saying that is dismissive of her horrible behavior towards them.
