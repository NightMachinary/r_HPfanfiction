  My whole point is that Fleur was not that arrogant and rude. You can't just use her being arrogant and rude as evidence. I said she's not arrogant and provided evidence. You said she's arrogant, and provided none.

The whole point of my comment was to go through all of your points and say how you're wrong, since all of your so-called "evidence" wasn't very good. For example, you said that her saying that Beauxbatons' system was better wasn't arrogant, but I brought up the context and the way she said it as evidence. I fail to see how that is not sufficient evidence.

If anything, you provided less evidence. You totally ignored the context and tone in all of your points, and even made up things like the girls hating Fleur just because she was pretty and them setting up Tonks and Bill. I'm open to critique though, so if you feel that I have not provided enough evidence, feel free to point out flaws.

  But serious question, why are acting so hostile? Is it because I swore in my writing and used strong language?
#+end_quote

I'm sorry if you're under the assumption that I was trying to be hostile in any way. I didn't mean to appear that way at all besides when I remarked that women can hate other women for reasons besides superficial jealousy. Sometimes tone is hard to express online though, so I definitely can see why you thought that.
