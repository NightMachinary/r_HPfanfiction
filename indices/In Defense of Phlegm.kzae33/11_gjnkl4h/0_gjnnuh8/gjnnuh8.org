My whole point is that Fleur was not that arrogant and rude. You can't just use her being arrogant and rude as evidence. I said she's not arrogant and provided evidence. You said she's arrogant, and provided none. That's your whole argument. I explained the marriage thing [[/u/CryptidGrimnoir][u/CryptidGrimnoir]]. Read that response if you want, it covers all of your points.

But serious question, why are acting so hostile? Is it because I swore in my writing and used strong language? I usually don't, and I regretted it a bit afterward. I try to hold myself to a certain standard of writing, and this didn't meet it, but I don't think I got how bad it was.
