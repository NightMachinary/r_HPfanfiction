Imagine their situation in an AITA thread. I'm not sure on the ages, but you get the gist.

"So I (19F) have moved to live with my fianc√©'s (25M) family temporarily while we plan our wedding.

Unfortunately, it's a real culture shock for me. I've moved from France to be with him, and now live in what looks like a converted pigsty in the middle of farmland. They all seem to do nothing but look after their chickens, cook and sometimes play Quidditch, which they all seem obsessed with.

My future MIL really seems to resent me being there. I probably haven't made it easy, but I don't see the point in doing things I don't want to do (cooking, chickens), and have said so. Maybe she doesn't like me because she thinks I'm taking her first born son away, maybe it's because I'm French, idk. She also has the worst taste in music I have ever heard.

I'm not really sure how to get along with them, and I'm not sure that I want to. So, AITA?"
