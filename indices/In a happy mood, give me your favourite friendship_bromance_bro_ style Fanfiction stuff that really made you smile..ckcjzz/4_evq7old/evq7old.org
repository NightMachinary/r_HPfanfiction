Most of the latter part of this story is about Snape, but this has always stood out in my memory as an ADORABLE little vignette of Ron trying to do his best for Harry. I can sympathie with your request as I've always wanted more from that portion of the story.

  Severus Snape never wanted to be an Animagus and the only upside to his utterly useless animagus form is that he gets to tell Albus Dumbledore "I told you so."

  However, when Harry Potter foolishly ingests a confectionary offered to him by Fred Weasley, Severus has to employ any and all means at his disposal to avert a disaster.
