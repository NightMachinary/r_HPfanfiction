I'd have sent Harry and his closest friends, maybe a group of 4-5, (Maybe add Fleur and her sister to the group? Or the patil twins?) to a parelell world for a year. Have that world be the source of Earth's magic or something, and have Ablus with a weary heart dump the children there with only a few useful items. (tent, a few books, maybe a sword) They basically end up in a wild, untamed magical world where they have to learn to hunt, fight, and kill if they want to surrvive. I'd have taken the oppertunity to either upgrade familiars (Hedwig becomes the world's most terrifying owl after hunting and consuming the heart of a pheonix/thunderbird) or get new ones, and have Harry and friends learn to take the forms of magical creature(s) after saving a dragon/gryphon/thunderbird/very, very, lost pokemon from predators or something. Basically, it's the school of hard knocks, the kids come back with new scars, new magical critters, maybe new companions, self-made magical weapons, and warrior attitudes ready to wipe out Voldemort and reform the government.

*Harry requests a meeting with Fudge, the Minister is led into the tent/portable fortress where Harry is sitting on a throne looking like conan the barbarian with Fleur/a kitsune he met on the other side/an anthromorphic magical creature of some sort on his lap/arm of his chair and Harry tells Fudge he's going to announce Voldemort is back, announce Sirius never got a trial and the Ministry has zero actual evidence against him and is therefore calling off the manhunt or Fudge is going to go the way of the evil creature/sorcerer whose skull Harry is currently drinking out of and Harry will negotiate with his successor.*

*Harry Potter and the Forge of Heroes* would either take a year in normal time or happen all at once, and maybe dump HP and group in the middle the great hall during Umbridge's speech.
