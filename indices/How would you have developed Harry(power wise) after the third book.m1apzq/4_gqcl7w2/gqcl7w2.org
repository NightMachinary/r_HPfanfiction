I completely agree that JKR abandoned making Harry an actual hero by the end of book 5. But then, considering how terrible she was at writing any sort of combat (wizards stand around and shoot 'stupefy' like a 17th century army? Really?), maybe we're better off being spared whatever garbage she would have spewed.

As to your point, Voldemort has years of experience and knowledge over Harry, so his power would have to actually be 'what the Dark Lord knows not', to paraphrase. Therefore, I would have like to see something esoteric, unexpected.

Dumbledore, one of two alchemists we're ever told about in the world, could have taught Harry alchemy after 5th year, rather than just giving history lessons.

There could have been something that happened in the DoM fight that 'super-charged' Harry, or have the brains get him instead of Ron and pass on some sort of arcane knowledge.

I could go on all day. There are innumerable ways that the HP series could have actually followed a standard hero's journey, but the best JKR could come up with was Harry using 2nd year spells during a war against murdering terrorists that killed his family and friends, and lucking into a one-in-a-million chance that allowed him to survive.

The final battle was honestly the equivalent of setting the groundwork for an immense battle between hero and villain, except just as the fight begins the villain trips over his shoelaces and falls to his death. That's basically how Harry vs Voldemort played out. Pathetic.
