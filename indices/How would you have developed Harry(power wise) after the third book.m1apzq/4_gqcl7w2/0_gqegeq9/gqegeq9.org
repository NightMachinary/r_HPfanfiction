I'd actually argue some of this, a bit. (Though I definitely agree with how pathetic the final battle was.) Experience in fighting is an issue, but Voldemort's breadth of knowledge isn't to nearly as much of a degree as some people like to think.

It doesn't matter how many various deadly spells you have, you only need one or two in each niche. There's really no difference if you're hit with fanon-ish Blood Boiling or Organ Expelling or whatever Curses. You die either way.

What Harry needs is combat awareness, skill in specific curses, and the ability to dodge, shield, and use the environment.

It doesn't matter if Voldemort knows a hundred curses designed to kill, if Harry can dodge or block them. You don't give a soldier a hundred weapons, you give him a few weapons designed for the situations he'll be in.

A highly trained combative Harry who knows a good amount of combat magic is more deadly than one who tries to know everything, basically.

I'd say the power he knows not would be a good thing to add to the above, though. Remember, he's Voldemort's EQUAL, allegedly. So he should be as powerful magically as Voldemort. Toss on something else.

Hell, you want to be funny, the Power He Knows Not is a freaking psychiatrist who gets Harry over the obvious issues holding him back from growing up in the Dursley home.
