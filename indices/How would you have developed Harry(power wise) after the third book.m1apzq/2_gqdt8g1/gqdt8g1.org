Once Harry found out that his dad and his friends completed the animagus transformation while in school, he would want to try too. Ron and Hermione would 100% be right there with him, and they would be writing Snuffles for tips/advice. It seems natural that Harry would keep in touch with Sirius/Remus, and after they hear about the numerous assassination attempts on Harry by Voldemort they would want to help Harry learn to defend himself.

Also, Harry lit his wand without touching it during the dementor attack, but it's never addressed or developed.

I'm also devastated that Harry regrowing his hair as a child didn't turn into some metamorphic talent. Introducing Tonks is a natural segue into mentioning the event to others.
