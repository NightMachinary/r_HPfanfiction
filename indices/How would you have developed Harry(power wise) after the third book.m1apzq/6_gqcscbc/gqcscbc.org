Let his scar merge him and give him a power boost:

- You can make him more active, more cunning, more ruthless, and more strategic that way
- However, he should still maintain much of Harry's original personality. It's up to you to decide which ones to keep
- This Harry should still be much weaker than Voldemort Prime, but he will have no problem dispatching rank and file Death Eaters, including Bellatrix
- To give him more support, have Ginny absorbing Diary's power and joining him in his quest
- Merging with the Scarcrux removes him from one of Voldemort's soul anchors, so he doesn't need to die anymore. And he becomes "Dark Lord's Equal" in a literal sense

As for how to write this dark!Harry well without dipping into those garbage fanon tropes, I highly recommend using the Harry in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] and the Gryffindor Tom Riddle in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368][There is Nothing to Fear series]] as examples.
