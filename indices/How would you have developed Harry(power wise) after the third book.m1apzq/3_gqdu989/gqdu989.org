Keeping him in character, I'd say that Flitwick offers to mentor him the summer after his third year, teaching him how to duel. McGonagall may help as well, but overall, I think Flitwick would help him learn more, while Dumbledore teaches him a few things, like how he discovered Riddle, his duel with Grindelwald, and things like that
