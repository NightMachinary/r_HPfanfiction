“Super easy! Barely an inconvenient” it is always nice to meet a fellow “Pitch meeting” fan ✌️👍😁.

About the power scale... honestly, the best way to do it starting during GOF would be to either have Pettigrew be caught so that Voldemort takes longer to return, this would push cannon back a fairly amount of time leaving Harry with time to grow in power and skill without a threat of death consuming his very thought but still looming close enough for him to be motivated into growing his power. and can we take a moment to just appreciate how competent and fast Pettigrew is? In a single summer he tracked down and helped Voldemort get the baby-body thingie, found and kidnapped Bertha (getting information about Barty) made contact with Barty and helped plan the whole tournament with what must have been just days if not hours before term started to find out who would be the DADA professor that year and get Barty to impersonate him... in. A. Single. Summer.

Other than that, if you are open to some non-cannon compliant interpretation of magic and made-up rituals then you can have Harry be far more afraid of death considering the history of the tournament and be willing to take drastic steps to stack the odds in his favor. I am actually musing about a potential ritual that cannon-Harry could have arguably come up with by studying a bit on the threats he faces every year coupled by the whole somewhat widely accepted idea that magic has belief as a /big/ component and some bits of conjecture plus a completely made up (but not out of the realm of possibilities considering what they have in cannon) if you are interested.
