I would have kept Harry relatively the same power-wise. Although I admit it would have been cool to see canon Harry progress into a magical juggernaut, I think there would have been several problems with it:

- It would have cheapened the moral of the series, since in canon, one of the major points of the books was that power, intelligence, and traits like those were less important than bravery, loyalty, and similar traits.
- It would have made readers confused on why certain people are magically stronger than others. In canon, we know that magical ability primarily depends on one's understanding of magic, so the most powerful people are all extremely intelligent and hard-working. For example, Hermione masters spells on her first few tries and masters nonverbal casting in mere minutes because of her intelligence and her studious nature. If Harry suddenly could do that (and more) without any explanation, people would wonder why.
- It would have made other characters useless, since Harry could solve everything with a wave of his wand.
