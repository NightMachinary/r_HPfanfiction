I agree with this. The point of the entire story is that it is love is the power that Voldemort knows not. The story is compelling precisely because of the fact that Harry is a normal boy who defeated the Dark Lord by loving others and being so loved. To make him powerful /actively detracts/ from the story.

I like Harry's power levels being where there are and greatly dislike smart!motivated!Harry fics for precisely this reason. The author had deviated from the ethos of the books.
