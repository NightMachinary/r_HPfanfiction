I know the exact one you mean, forgotten the name of it completely. Harry uses some soul destroying curse on Voldemort in the graveyard, it was very similar to Avada Kedavra but the second word was changed in some way I have forgotten. Snape realises later on what he has done, and there is a whole lot of Harry bouncing between past and present in peoples heads. If I find it I will edit this.
