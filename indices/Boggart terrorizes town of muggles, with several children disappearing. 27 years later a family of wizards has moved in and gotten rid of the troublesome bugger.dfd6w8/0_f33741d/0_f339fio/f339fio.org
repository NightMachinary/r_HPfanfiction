  A boggart is a shapeshifter that usually lurks in dark spaces. It has no definite form, taking the shape of that which is most feared by the person who encounters it. When not in the sight of a person, it is believed to look like a dark blob.

After a bit of searching this is the best desctiption I could find. And the answer is that it doesn't say. Maybe it's mentioned in the fantastic beasts book? But I doubt it since it's not mentioned here.

So the question is, why does the Boggart turn into what you fear the most, if not to terrify you so it can eat you?
