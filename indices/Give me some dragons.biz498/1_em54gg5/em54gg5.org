I would recommend [[https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/enter-the-dragon-harry-potter-shadowrun.7861/][Enter The Dragon]] by Dunkelzahn as based on the two-shot of the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5585493/1/Enter-the-Dragon][same name]] by Doghead13.

In the story, a magical accident at a ring of standing stones turns a young Harry into a Dragon. Taken to Hogwarts, Harry settles into the Forbidden Forest where he gets his first (centaur) Maiden (who ends up acting as his mother/big-sis figure), gets excessively wealthy thanks to Severus Snape figuring out how to replicate aspects of his biology (such as his stomach lining for heat-shields and nervous system for electrical conductors), learns how to turn human-shape (and Centaur-shape) and has a totally angst-free outlook on life which contrasts quite humorously with the borderline-grimdark Wizarding World that he lives in.

The Troll didn't stand a chance.

Neither did the Dark Lord who hit him with eight AK's in a row because he kept popping up to complain that it stung.
