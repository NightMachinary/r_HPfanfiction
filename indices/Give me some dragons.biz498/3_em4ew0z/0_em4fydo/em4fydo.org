I knew someone would bring that up! I've already read it, multiple times. That and Bobmin356's work are really my all time favorite Harry Potter with dragons fics.

I've read a lot over the past decade or so, and esama's one of a few that I've followed for a long time. I hate how they drop so many good fics suddenly though, and the lack of HP stuff lately.

I don't really care if it's Pern related or a crossover in general. I just want awesome dragon stuff mixed with the Harry Potter world. Doesn't matter how it's put together.
