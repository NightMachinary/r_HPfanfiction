EDIT: found it linkffn(Harry Potter and the Spiritual Heirs)

I read this a couple months ago and really enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure, unfortunately last night I was also looking for it and couldn't find it.

In addition to what OP said, there is a wolf and a falcon familiar involved, and a scene where Harry trains against himself using time travel. I think there is a full apartment in the trunk and Dobby recruits an army of elves to adapt it for the four of them to train.

The trunk slows down time and the fic takes place sometime between fifth and sixth or sixth and seventh year.

I'll keep looking for it but hope this helps anyone who knows what it is off the top of their head. Think it was recommended to me on here but I could have found it on FFN search.
