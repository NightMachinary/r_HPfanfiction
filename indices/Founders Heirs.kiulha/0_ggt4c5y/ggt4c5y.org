The only story that I remember reading where Harry has a trunk that allows him to watch the outside world while he is inside it is Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny by Wheezy1. It does have scenes where the trunk is in the RoR, and has them watching Dumbledore. The pairings are harry/hermione and Neville/luna but I can't remember if the are all Founder's heirs.
