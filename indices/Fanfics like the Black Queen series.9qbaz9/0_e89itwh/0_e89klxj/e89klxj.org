This is the first book in the series linkffn(8233291) I quite like it but it's not to everyones taste. I honestly don't know what else to say about it, it's a fem!harry fic but it doesn't read like one if that makes sense? It is a little bit dark in places but my little bit is most people very, very, very extremely dark I've found so I'm not sure I'm helping at all here so I'm just gonna stop...
