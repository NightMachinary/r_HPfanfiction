You don't have to incorporate this in your story, but in real life, because of mishearing or bad handwriting (and wizards seem to write everything by hand), it's actually not uncommon for names to be misspelled in birth certificates (and I'm guessing wizards might have a thing about True Names and stuff), so Davis and Davies could very well be the same family without even changing anything. I had some (old people, mostly) in my family with a slightly different last name because of that, and at least one of them I know passed it on to his kids lol
