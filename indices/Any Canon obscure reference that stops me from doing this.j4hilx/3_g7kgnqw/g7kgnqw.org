Not canon but reality: Davies is the 2nd most common last name in Wales and much more common than Davis in the UK as a whole. It's common enough that having more than one unrelated Davies family is plausible, let alone an unrelated Davis. JKR's original classlist had Tracey Davis as a halfblood and Roger Davies background is unknown. I doubt it was typo--she probably named them separately and neither character was worth renaming.

That being said, they are absurdly minor characters that are almost blank slates--do what you want, it's fanfiction!
