Why would that be a typo? Plenty of people have different but similar sounding names. I'm really not following the logic there. Also, plenty of people are related without having the same name. If your father's sister married a dude that wasn't also her brother and took his name, your cousins wouldn't have the same last name as you.

I imagine the only real canon objection would be the fact that they have different names and aren't related, but that's what you're changing so that note is irrelevant. You'd also have to make Roger and Tracey's male parents brothers, if you're following standard European marital-naming conventions.
