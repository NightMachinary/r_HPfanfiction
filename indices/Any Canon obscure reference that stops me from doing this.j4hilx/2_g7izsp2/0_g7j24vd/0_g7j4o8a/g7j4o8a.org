I mean, knowing Rowling's general pattern, she probably made the names up in her usual plot-relevant-description-reference way at different times without intending them to actually be similar and just didn't go back to check the first when she made up the second. So, yeah, I really don't think Snape and Irma Pince were intended to be related and she just misspelled one name, if that's what you're asking. She just made them up to be appropriate to her characters and they were coincidentally similar, most likely. Though saying that, her name does Anagram out to 'I am Prince' and they do both have hooked noses, so...

And well, random unrelated people having similar names is a lot more narratively simple than "Snape and Irma are distantly related but against all odds still have the same last name" because then you have to write that relationship into the narrative. If they're just random people with similar names (which Rowling mostly picked for some referential-descriptive purpose - a la Remus Lupin the Werewolf) then that's less plot justification to write.
