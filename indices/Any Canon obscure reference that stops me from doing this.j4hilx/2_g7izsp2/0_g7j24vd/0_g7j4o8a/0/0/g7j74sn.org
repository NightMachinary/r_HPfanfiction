Not necessarily. If Pince was actually related to Snape's mother, then she could be one of the family who disapproved of the whole marrying-a-Muggle thing and thus cut ties. Snape didn't exactly grow up a Prince and/or really knowing the Prince family, so if you were to go that route, it's plausible Snape himself might not even know they were related.

Or he was just his usual bitter angry dickbag self about the whole situation. If you were stuck in a single environment where you regularly shared space with a distant relative who'd abandoned your mother, would you not go out of your way to not interact with and otherwise avoid them wherever you could?

But yeah, plenty of people don't interact with the people they're related to, especially those in a... complicated family situation like Snape had. Sharing genetics with someone and not interacting with them definitely aren't self-exclusive.

The only book 'interaction' where Prince and Pince 'intersected' that I remember is Pince noticing Harry with the Prince's Book and getting mad at a book being written in, though I don't know if she ever registered the title or not. But I'm really not a canon-knowledgeable person, so there could be hundreds more I don't remember. I haven't read the books since the last one came out, so it's been awhile. :D
