Fair enough. Well, either way, you can go with whatever you wanna do.

Just remember, if they are 'distant cousins' of similar ages, Snape's grandfather would have to have a brother who had a son for them to have the same name by standard European Marriage-Naming Conventions and that would only make Irma his second cousin. Third cousin would be the same with great-grandparents and great-granduncles and with two generations of sons for them to have the same name. If you get into cousins-removed, then you'd need to change the ages as you go more generations away from Snape's. So, y'know, keep that in mind if you plan to go into how Snape and Irma are related.

Google 'cousin chart' and look at the family search one, if you want a good visual reference for how that works.
