Not really. If neither of them going to be plot relevant and their names aren't going to be relevant, then having people like that makes people think they are related when they're not. It adds an unnecessary confusion prone layer.

Having them be cousins doesn't make them more inbred. Actually I am trying to make the world smaller as it is supposed to be. After all Magical families in uk should be few enough for purebloods to know them all.
