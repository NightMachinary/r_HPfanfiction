Not necessarily. There are plenty of other families around. Tracey was already a halfblood. I'm only changing the fanon concept of her father being a muggleborn/muggle to being her mother, having her father be a wizard with Davies lastname.

About Madam Pince... I would only make her more inbreed if her mother was in any way related to the Princes... which we have no evidence for that in the books. Her father could very well be a Prince and her mother have no relation with a Prince for as many generations as she can track.
