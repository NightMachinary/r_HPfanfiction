Name meanings and impressions would be my objection. Names are a huge part of how JKR does characterization. (Remus Lupin is a werewolf. Sirius Black is a dog from an evil family. Severus Snape is severe and snappish. Et cetera, et cetera.)

Davis and Davies come from the same word and have the same meaning: "son of David". (David's = Davie's = Davies) I find it completely believable that they're related and just spell their name differently. If you look back through my IRL genealogy, you'll find Rider, Ryder, and Ridor. Plus the canon... impression, for lack of a better word... of the names is similar: they're both sort of boring background names.

Pince and Prince are two different names with two different meanings. Prince comes from Latin /princeps/, meaning "first". Pince comes from Latin /pinciare/, meaning "pinch, sting". The canon impression of the name Pince calls to mind both pince-nez glasses and pincers, which fit with a stern librarian. The canon impression of Prince is royalty, characterizing the family that rejected Snape as wealthy and respected, and characterizing Snape as secretly noble and heroic.

Although both Pince and Prince come from Latin, so... I guess? Maybe? ...nope, it's not working for me.
