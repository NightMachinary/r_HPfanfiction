I used to get downvoted for using the remind me bot (Sometimes as the first person sometimes not) and did not know why so I just started saving things instead. But now I understand at least for some of the instances. I don't think the documentation is very clear, perhaps it is in the smaller print of the post that is hard for me to read due to my vision.

Anyway, thank you for explaining. If there is a rule then I think this wording should be included instead of "don't do this"
