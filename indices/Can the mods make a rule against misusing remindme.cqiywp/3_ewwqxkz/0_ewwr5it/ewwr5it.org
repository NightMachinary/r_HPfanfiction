  The "problem" here is not that people are using the bot a lot---way I see it they're entitled to use it as much as they'd like---but that the reminding feature works the way it does.

I think the issue is that more people don't take advantage of the bot's features, most notably the ability to be added to its reminder list without adding more "remind me" notices in the thread. One RemindMe is easy to ignore, seven of them is spam.
