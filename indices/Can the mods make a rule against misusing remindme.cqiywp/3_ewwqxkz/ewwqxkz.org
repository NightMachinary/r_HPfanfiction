EDIT: Ignore this whole wall of text I agree with OP now

But what would constitute "responsible" use of the bot? Limiting how many times you can use it? To me that seems like a way to gimp the user experience of the sub by taking away a useful feature, because it is useful, since many people don't browse this site daily it's easy to forget threads you were interested in but did not have the content you were looking for at the time. What if you found two threads next to each other with interesting requests, but they had no posts and you could only use RemindMe for one of them because it's against the rules to use it more? That's just annoying.

I don't use it myself, but one I do use quite frequently is the "Save" feature. If it's use required a post like the RemindMe bot, and you or anyone else suggested to limit it's use because my posts are annoying them for some reason, you'd be making my experience here worse.

The "problem" here is not that people are using the bot a lot---way I see it they're entitled to use it as much as they'd like---but that the reminding feature works the way it does. It should be a button integrated to the site, rather than a bot, and that's not a community problem, but rather a problem with the way the site is designed.

And in any case, why is it a problem in the first place? Just ignore the RemindMe posts and move on. At worst they're causing you a second of inconvenience by having to scroll past them, and they're usually at the bottom of the threads since they almost always have low ratings, so in many cases you won't even see them.
