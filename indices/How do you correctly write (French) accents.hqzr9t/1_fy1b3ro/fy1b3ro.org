You have two choices when deciding how to write an accent. Do you want to write it phonetically? (How most people do it, with Fleur dropping Aitches and slurring Zes all over the place). Or would you rather do it in prose? ("Blah blah," She said, her lips curling around the French-accented English).

Really, that choice depends on if you're trying to show, or to tell. There are three parts to any dialogue - what they say, how they say it, and what it implies about other stuff - and that all changes depending on whether you're trying to show the Reader/POV Protagonist something or tell the Reader/POV Protagonist something. Remember, dialogue is there to convey information, and whether you're doing that through showing or telling, you want to keep the things you're trying to convey in mind. Specifically, does the accent add to that effort or take away from it?

If you're just wanting to do a French accent to tell the reader that a character is French, I'd say probably don't do that. If you're not overly familiar with a particular accent, it's very easy to get it wrong, and really... people aren't idiots. We know Fleur is French, and anyone else can also be easily understood as French if you say "Hey, these people came from Beauxbatons, and they have accents that the character notices, and Francois de OC Fromage said he was born in Marseille!" and otherwise state/imply it through the narrative itself. There are easier and less distracting ways than phonetics to convey that information about nationality.

And generally, everything else you want to 'tell' through dialogue is more easily done without the accent. A thing I've heard that I quite like for this is: 'Write dialect, imply accent'. After all, no matter the accent IRL, the words are still spelled the same, they're just pronounced differently. For example, a Brummie (person from Birmingham) might said 'aight' instead of 'alright'. It's not accent, because it's not a mispronunciation, it's actually dialect because it's a different word they're using. It's part of the words they say, not the way they say those words. So, you write the words they say (ie. the information they're trying to tell someone) and not how they say it, because in this case, the accent can detract. If you had a scene with Fleur and Harry coming across Bagman's corpse and she said something like:

"'Arry, ze corpse we found! Eet eez ze man from ze judging board! Meester, ah, ah, Bagman! We 'ave to tell your 'eadmaster at once!"

The accent, there, detracts. You're not focusing first on what was said - ie. the statement of events that have occurred and Fleur's observations and idea of what they should do about it - you're initially focusing on the accent and translating that in your head before you focus on what she said. The reader's attention is drawn to how she's saying what she's saying, rather than what she's actually saying. In this case, a minimal touch is far better for conveying the information she's verbally giving to Harry (and thereby us, as readers). If in that scene, she said this instead:

"'Arry! That corpse we found! It's the man from the judging board! Mister, ah, ah... Bagman! We must tell your 'eadmaster at once!"

Then it's a lot clearer - you know exactly what's happening, you're not distracted trying to work out what the heck she's saying through layers of 'ze's, and you can still take a lighter touch with the missing 'H's to give her a unique voice. In short, no accent is better for conveying information directly through dialogue.

So, that leaves implication. ie. What the way a person with an accent says things tells you about things other than what they're directly saying. To use an example from the books, Draco's exclamation of "You're next, Mudbloods!" in CoS implies to us that Draco is a bigot and is excited about the Muggleborns being hurt like Filch's cat was. It doesn't directly convey the information ("I hate Mudbloods and I hope you're all killed next, like Filch's cat was!"), it tells us that indirectly. So, how can accent help us with that?

As we've established, writing phonetically in an accent makes the content of a sentence more difficult to understand. So, you can use accent and that lacking or difficult comprehension to imply things unrelated to the content being directly conveyed by the dialogue itself. (eg. when Harry first meets Hagrid, emphasising the accent can heighten a reader's appreciation of Harry's feeling of being adrift and confused and too distracted to mentally translate the accent while first stepping into a world he knows nothing about, or Draco finding it hard to understand Victor's accent can help convey his inexperience, British-centricness, or xenophobia, or Fleur's accent can even convey that she's new to English and struggles with pronunciation and improves over the course of the story [but that's better done if it's accompanied with her actually saying those things and characters talking about them, IMO]).

And particularly if you want to make a point that the POV character doesn't understand what's being said, then that's a time to use accent or even language in telling (if you state "Harry had no idea what they were saying.") or showing (if you just leave it in French or in heavily-accented English with no indication Harry understands).

Essentially, phonetic accent will make your characters harder to understand, but if making your characters difficult to understand adds to the story or character, or just fits the personality of a particular Character you're writing from the POV of, writing it phonetically can be done. Otherwise, just write the speech in standard English (or whatever language you're writing in) and describe the accent in narrative.

In terms of actually how to write French and Hagrid Accents phonetically, I'd say everyone else has it covered - though something I find useful for accent stuff myself is the International Dialects of English Archive (IDEA). It covers a bunch of different people from different regions of France speaking English and can help you work out how to write that phonetically in a realistic, non-comical way. Hagrid's accent is also in there, under the 'England' section. It's a West Country accent, so check any place names mentioned in the West Country wikipedia article and compare them against the dialect archive to see what's right for you to use.

TL:DR - Write what people say and take a light touch on the accent phonetics to help distinguish characters, unless writing how they say it adds something to your story or characters somehow and if you're writing phonetically, do some research to find out how the people with the accents you're writing actually speak. Otherwise, keep it mild/light and stick to just making a point of it in your prose - narrative description beats phonetic transcription for keeping your prose clear when writing accents.
