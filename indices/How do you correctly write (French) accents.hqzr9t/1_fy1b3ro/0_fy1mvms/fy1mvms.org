Thank you for the write up! This perspective makes it easier to decide, and you're right, narrative description sounds better.

My intention is for it to vary depending on how good the person speaks English with 90% of them just changing names a bit ('Arry, 'Ogwarts) and exchanging words, and some minor characters having very strong accents that make them hard to understand(will probably reduce that).

For information, it's not Fleur, but Fleur's aunt called Gabrielle who initially drowned while young in the sea. But this time was saved by Harry(who back-reincarnated as James's cousin who initially died in childbirth.) And her family, young Appoline, and their parents.

As for Hagrid, I really like his character, but unlike other characters, I think adding some phonetics for his speech is necessary, if I write him speaking normally and the read it, it just doesn't feel right.
