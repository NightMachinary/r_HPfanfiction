Sure, happy to help. The psychology of writing and prose is something that fascinates me, so any chance to do write-ups like this I take with delight. :)

For the record though, I'm not necessarily saying one is better than the other - they're just more suited for different purposes. If you wanna achieve something, you find the tool most appropriate for the job, so I was just saying that you have to decide what that 'job' is. Like, if you're trying to make the point that your POV character struggles to understand those minor characters, you can do so because that's a useful implication that shows the reader things about that character.

And cool. Reincarnation as new people is fun. :)

And I can see your point for Hagrid, but I'd still recommend against making it too strongly phonetic. Full Hagrid is very, very Hard To Read and it will turn some readers off your story. You can still keep his dialect though, remember, even if you don't go Phonetic - "I'm off t' pub" is perfectly readable and understandable Hagrid-ey Dialect and still sounds like Hagrid. To me, at least. YMMV. :)
