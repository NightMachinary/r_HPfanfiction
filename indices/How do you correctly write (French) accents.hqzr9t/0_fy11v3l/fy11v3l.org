Some tips for Fleur (the main French-accent we see in the books):

- Most of her 'th'-starting words which have a vowel after it will change to 'z'-starting. I.e. The, ze; they, zey; them, zem; those, zose; etc. But not always. Sometimes she says 'theenk', 'the', etc. Words like three, throw, etc. don't change (because they have a consonant after the 'th').

- The 'th' rule also applies to the middle or end of words, i.e. mother, muzzer; with, wiz; is, eez; etc. But not always.

- Any words with an audible 'H' gets that letter replaced with an apostrophe. I.e. Harry, 'Arry; Hogwarts, 'Ogwarts; Hagrid, 'Agrid. But words like hour, honour, etc. stay as is.

- Uses Dumbly-dorr instead of Dumbledore, although this is mostly in the case of Madame Maxime.

- Occasionally slips in a French word or two among the English ones.

- Some words with i gets changed to ee. I.e. Christmas, Chreestmas; Mister, Meester; etc. But not always, as Fleur doesn't change 'little' to anything, for example.

- -eir or -ere sounds sometimes become -air. I.e. their, zair; there, zair; etc.

- (Not strictly in the books), but French speakers occasionally ignore the this vs that proximity. I.e. something could be far away but they might refer to it as 'this'.

There might be more changes in the books, I'm not sure.

As for Hagrid, the main things are:

- Uses words like blimey, crikey, etc.

- Replaces 'something' or 'something like that' with 'summat'.

- Most, but not all, of his 'you's get turned into 'yeh's. Basically all of his 'your's become 'yer's, you're becomes yeh're or yer (sometimes), etc.

- Combines should, could, would, etc. + have into shoulda, coulda, woulda, etc.

- Cuts off the t's on a good portion of his words but not always. I.e. "Harry, yeh migh' be interested ter know tha' them Skrewts are growin' real fast." (Not a book quote.) Also, as can be seen, sometimes Hagrid says -in' instead of -ing.

- Sometimes uses 'me' instead of 'my', 'meself' instead of 'myself', etc.

- Replaces 'to', 'for', with 'ter', 'fer', even in the middle of words, i.e. together, tergether; tomorrow, termorrow; forget, ferget; etc.

- Often uses 'bin' instead of 'been'.

- Uses 'o instead of 'of'.

As always, it's not a set rule, so don't chop off every letter when applicable.

There might be more, I'm not sure.
