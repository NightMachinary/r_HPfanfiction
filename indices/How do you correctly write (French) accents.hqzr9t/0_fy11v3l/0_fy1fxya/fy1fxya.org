Hi, Frenchy here, I just wanted to add that most French will say "Fank you" instead of "Thank you", and replace a lot of "th" with a "fff" sound. Some will also pronounce "the" like "ve" or "de" depending on the context.

Also a common struggle for us is the pronunciation of the "ed" at the end of a word. Most will always say "id" (rhymes with mead) or "'ead" (rhymes with bread). The rule of "'p', 'f', 's', 'ch', 'sh', 'k'" doesn't exist for us. So, for exemple, "shocked" will be pronounced "shock-'ead", and the game "Uncharted" is butchered "Eun-char-tiid" by journalists.

If you want a good exemple of strong French accent, go watch the Ubisoft E3 conference on YouTube (I can't, it just makes me cringe when I hear them speak. They don't even try.)

Edit to add: OP, please don't make your text unreadable by using too many written accent, keep it light. And don't just use Google translate if you want to insert a few French words in your text, ask a French to proof-read it :)
