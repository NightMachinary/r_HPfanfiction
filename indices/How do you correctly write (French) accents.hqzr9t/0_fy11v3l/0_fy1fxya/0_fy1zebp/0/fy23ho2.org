Expressions are the trickiest ;) a saying in English like "it rain like cats and dogs" wouldn't make any sense once translated. The French version could be "il pleut comme une vache qui pisse" (it rains like a pausing cow), but again sound weird when translated in English. Just an example but it's very common for expressions. So be very very VERY careful with those kind of translations, if you want anything you write in French to make sense.

I'd love to give you a hand if you need help, feel free to PM me when you have a question about French :).

Ps: honestly don't put too much pressure on yourself. I've read a lot of fanfic, with poorly written French, some I could decipher, some not, but for it to be so bad that I stopped reading the fic... It only happened once ;). French is hard, we know it. So don't worry too much :)
