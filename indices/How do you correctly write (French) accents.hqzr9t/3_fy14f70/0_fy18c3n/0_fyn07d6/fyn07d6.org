The immersion or making fun of those who don't speak your language perfectly? Thinking about this thread I have actually decided that I really don't like the implied sneering at non-English-natives very much. Do you write Tonks (who is supposedly a bit Cockney) with missing Hs? Do you write people from the North with their accent? No, you don't, it is just non-natives you taunt.

No, actually it isn't just that, you make fun of how stupid Hagrid is as well. Nice, with big heart, but stupid ... so yes, his accent has to be spelled out.
