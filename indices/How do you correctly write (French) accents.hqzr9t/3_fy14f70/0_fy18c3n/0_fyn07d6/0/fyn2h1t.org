The immersion of reading a characters voice as you first imagined it when first reading the book.

If I start reading a PS fanfic and Hagrid starks talking normally but with a line saying its in an accent I and others wont actually read it as that, and reading Hagrid talk like anyone else ruins the feeling that you're actually reading about Hagrid.
