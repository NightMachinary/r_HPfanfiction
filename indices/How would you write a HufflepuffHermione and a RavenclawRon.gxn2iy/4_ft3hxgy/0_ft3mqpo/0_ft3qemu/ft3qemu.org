Yes! He was! And thank you for illustrating my point. Lockhart, despite being magically incompetent, managed to hoodwink nearly the entire population of Magical Britain. He was a brilliant conman, a marketing genius, and he went from being a nobody (halfblood, right?) to getting an Order of Merlin and being idolized on par with Albus Dumbledore.

He is the perfect example of how brains can take you places that inability would otherwise prevent. Ron is no Lockhart. Hell, I can't even imagine Hermione pulling off the kind of brilliance that Lockhart exhibited.
