I'd argue that Hufflepuff would be pretty good for the socially awkward but driven Hermione we see early on. And loyalty to Harry was her best trait throughout the series. She knew that the DoM was a trap (she was the only one concerned about this) but still went there. And she was the only person in magical Britain who suffered with Harry during the entire hunt (Ron had it pretty comfortable with Bill and the Order turned from armed resistance to being radio hosts). She even withstood torture by the leading expert in that field for him.
