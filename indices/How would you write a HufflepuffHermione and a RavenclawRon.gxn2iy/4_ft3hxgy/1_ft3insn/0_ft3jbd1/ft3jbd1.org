Ravenclaws don't have a lock on intelligence, so I'm not saying it's because he is dumb. Ron's just... not curious. He doesn't show any interest in learning for the sake of knowing something; he always must be forced into it. When there is no outside force motivating him, he hangs out and goofs around with his friends. Is that bad? No, that's pretty normal. But I don't see him as ever being suitable for Ravenclaw. Or Hufflepuff for that matter (loyalty's not exactly his strong point). I think Ron as a Slytherin (but not the absurd over-the-top Slytherin!Ron that bashing fics make him) wouldn't be terrible. He's witty, and has a sharp tongue.
