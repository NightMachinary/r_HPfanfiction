Nah, I've always been consistent in feeling that Ron is very much an "Everyman" character. He acts like a regular Joe. I think the main reason he gets so much shit is that he is surrounded by genuinely heroic/noble/exceptional people (Neville, Harry, Hermione, etc), so Ron acting like any one of us regular people would in his shoes makes him seem cowardly/stupid/disloyal. The world can't be all Girl Genius and Wizard Jesus; there has to be the guys who stock shelves at Weasley Wizarding Wheezes after all. Ron fills that role.
