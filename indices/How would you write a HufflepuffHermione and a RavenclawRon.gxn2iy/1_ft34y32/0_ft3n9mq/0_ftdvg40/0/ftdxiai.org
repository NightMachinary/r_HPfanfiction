My twelve year old niece could probably beat me at uno, or something else like that. Look, I didn't say that to be controversial or edgy.

So yes - Ron, from the moment we 'meet him' on the Express, /is/ an exceptional chess player. That is as relevant to being smart/belonging in an 'advanced' group as a FortNite player showing their world ranking to the admissions office at Harvard, and saying "see?"

Edit: upvoted you for being so nice and polite despite my uncontrollable confrontational tone, lol
