Uno is a game of chance. Fortnight is a game that relies on quick reaction time and good hand eye coordination. Neither have much to do with intelligence or ingenuity (with perhaps the exception of professional fps which does require some strategic thinking).

Chess, however is a game that requires a very high degree of strategy, analysis and forethought. There are literally tens millions of possible board setups after just three moves and there is very real and documented correlation between higher IQ's and higher Elo chess ratings.
