"His chess ability proves that" ðŸ™„

Look, chess is a game, with rules and boundaries of play. It's not theoretical physics. We don't look at a pitcher and say "wow, this guy is so good at baseball, he must be a real brainiac!"

I don't disagree with the rest of your comment. Ron's not any dumber than a normal teenager, but god almighty the "chess makes you a brilliant strategist/has some relevance to the real world" is a really poor argument in Ron's favor. Is Dean a Mensa candidate because he's good at gobstones?
