I don't think you'd have to change all that much. For Ravenclaw the traits (according to the HP Wiki page) are:

- Intelligence
- Wit
- Wisdom
- Creativity
- Originality
- Individuality
- Sharpness
- Acceptance

Ron is quite intelligent. His chess ability proves that. Wit - obviously. He's very witty. I don't think we see much of his creativity, but he must be original to support a team like the Chudley Cannons that few others support, and stand by it despite everything other people say, and to paint his room bright orange. Nowhere does it say that a Ravenclaw has to be bookish and studious (this stereotype annoys me so much!). And acceptance; for purebloods, I'd say the Weasleys are of the more accepting families in Wizarding Britain.

For Hufflepuff the traits are:

- Diligence
- Dedication
- Fairness
- Patience
- Kindness
- Tolerance
- Modesty
- Loyalty

For Hermione I'd say that the only traits I'd question would be kindness, tolerance and modesty. She's kind, of course, but moments like that with Lavender and her dead bunny sort of doesn't support it, but then again, she means well in situations like SPEW. She also shows low tolerance for Luna (though she grows more accepting eventually) and to "untraditional" types of magic (Trelawney and Divination), and she does no attemt to show any modesty about her academic talents, and wants to show her ability, even when she isn't supposed to (eg. wanting to answer when Snape directly asks Harry questions in their first Potions class). Also, I am not exactly sure how patient she would be.

But I think that you could make both characters fit with some adjustments - Hermione perhaps more so for Hufflepuff than Ron for Ravenclaw. I think most people would have traits from all the houses, but some are more prevalent than others.
