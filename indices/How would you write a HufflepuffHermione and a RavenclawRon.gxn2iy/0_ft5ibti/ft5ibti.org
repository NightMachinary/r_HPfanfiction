I can easily see Hermione as a Hufflepuff - her study schedules show an intense work ethic. In 3rd year she signed up for more schoolwork than can fit in a 24 hour day. Her dedication to the rules and /pro forma/ respect for teachers also strikes me as Hufflepuffian, loyalty to an ideal of fairness. She stayed loyal to Harry during the Triwizard Tournament and the horcrux hunt. At Christmas in POA, turning in the Firebolt took courage, yes, but also the desire to place her friend's well-being over her own comfort.

Ron as a Ravenclaw is harder to see but I think it could be made to work. Not all Ravenclaws have to fit the bookworm stereotype. Lockhart, Luna, Cho, Marietta - none of them are described as particularly bookish. Ron's good at chess, which is a specific subtype of intelligence. I vaguely recall him having a head for trivia, too, e.g. chocolate frog cards and Chudley Cannon statistics.

Hufflepuff could be good for Hermione. She'd probably click better with Susan and Hannah than Lavender and Parvati. The Puffs are more likely to appreciate her buckle-down-and-get-working tutoring than the house of the reckless, and those Puffs with social skills could teach her to sand down her rough edges.

Ravenclaw could be good for Ron, too. Especially if he got on the Quidditch team, because I'm sure they have a policy of replacing members who can't balance sports and grades. He could build friendships based on a shared love of chess and Quidditch strategy. He'd be immersed in a culture where doing homework and studying for tests was a normal part of the daily routine. It would also give him something to distinguish himself from his brothers. And I could see Ron /wanting/ to study more and live up to that Ravenclaw stereotype in order to be "the smart one" in his family.
