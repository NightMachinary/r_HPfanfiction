What I'm most proud of is finding my own voice in my writing instead of mimicking others. My first two stories were extremely short while my third was all over the place and had no sense of direction. (I literally made it up as I went along and came out with 174K words.) When writing my fourth story, I was reading another at the same time and was influenced by it, so much so that I tried to copy the style the author had used into my own work which succeeded in some areas yet failed in the rest. I realized then that each story has a unique voice that needs to be unearthed and using others' work (even as a lick of inspiration) is the wrong way to go about it. Now on my fifth story, I'm happy to say it has found its own voice. All I have to do if finish it.
