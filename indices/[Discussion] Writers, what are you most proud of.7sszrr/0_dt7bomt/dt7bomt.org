A specific characterization, I think. I like my main character. She's a lot of fun to write. And if my reviews are anything to go by, she's a lot of fun to read. I don't really think I've gotten one complaint about her. It's mostly been praise on how she feels real, and is hilarious. So that feels pretty cool.

Also, probably the amount of work I've put into my outline. Thing is like 15k words. I had to add a outline to my outline to make it easier to go through.
