I'm still proud of the relatively nonlinear structure I used in one story, because I wasn't at all sure I could pull it off. To my surprise, it turned out to be my most popular fic.

I'm also proud, if you can call it that, when readers tell me the story made them cry. Or laugh, which is rarer, because wit and humor are bloody difficult to write.

I'm also cautiously pleased with the results of writing Snape in different pairings: Harry, Albus, Aberforth, and Minerva (yes, yes, let the downvotes begin). From an authorial standpoint, it's interesting to see how his character arc changes depending on who he's paired with.

And of course I'm proud of certain bits of dialogue, certain moments of characterization, certain endings (beginnings, not so much) - all small but satisfying details, too minor and particular to make great claims for.
