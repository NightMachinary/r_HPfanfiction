I am most proud of finishing my stories. It almost doesn't matter if they are much good. They are finished and have more-or-less coherent plots. And I do think that finished stories deserve more recognition simply for being finished.

Anyone (and I really do mean anyone) can write a thrilling start to a story. Weaving that thrilling start into a proper plot with a solid arc and a satisfying end is a whole other ball game.
