I'm quite happy with the first 5 chapters of my most recent work. I'm still amazed that I completed the first story in the way I intended. There's a certain evil glee I feel, when reminded that I've 'spoiled' the character name for anyone else (other fics using the name often include a disclaimer that their work has nothing to do with mine). 'It seems I've made quite an impression.'

Mostly I'm proud that posting as much as I have has made writing everything easier. I'm not intimidated by larger projects or adding documentation for co-workers, because I know that I've done much more writing with one goal in mind, in the past.
