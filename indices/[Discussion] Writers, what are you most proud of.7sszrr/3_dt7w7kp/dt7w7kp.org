Professionally, I'm most proud of my three articles in /Nature/ and eleven of my twelve in /Physical Review Letters/ (there's a story behind the last one), though I gather this is not what the OP is after.

In fiction writing, I've mainly used fanfiction as a test bed for styles, techniques, voices, and syntaxes. Sometimes what I tried [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/17/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][worked]], most times it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12261743/1/Fade-to-Black][didn't]]. But I did eventually gin up a style and voice that I can write comfortably and that's been mildly successful commercially.
