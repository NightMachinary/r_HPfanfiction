So, said bookisms are the, ‘he muttered', ‘she whispered', ‘he sneered' things where you use a synonym for said. They work for emphasis but when every single thing a character says is emphasized it can get painful to read. ‘Said' is practically invisible to the reader but sneered/whispered/muttered are not.

Filtering is stuff like, ‘he noticed it was raining' instead of ‘it was raining' or ‘he thought it was hot' rather than ‘it was hot'. Assuming you're managing to control your POV character and not head hop between several in one scene, we know that it's that character's perceptions we're getting. You don't need to add distance between the reader and the story with the ‘he thought's. (UNLESS his perception is wrong. ‘Harry thought all was lost' works if we, as the reader, know he's wrong.)

Simplistic characterizations: Draco Malfoy is a dick because his father beat him and all his negative attributes can be laid at the feet of that one cause. And love, true love, can save him.

Soap Opera Structure: an endless stream of ‘and then and then and then' where the characters go through a series of adventures but there is no over arcing plot structure or build and resolution of conflict . More stuff just happens. Forever. Until you're bored writing it.

HTH :)
