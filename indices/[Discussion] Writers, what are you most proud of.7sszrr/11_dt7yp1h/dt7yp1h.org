Mostly that I can see improvement in my stuff over the years. I've worked my way through a ton of common beginner issues (said bookisms, filtering, simplistic characterizations, soap opera structure) and things I write are slowly, 2,000,000 published words into this, starting to be moderately competent rather than unspeakably bad.
