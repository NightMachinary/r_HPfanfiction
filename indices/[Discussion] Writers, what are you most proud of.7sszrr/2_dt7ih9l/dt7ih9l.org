I'm super proud of all the bad name puns and horrific acronyms I came up with in Like a Red Headed Stepchild. Society Of Weasleys In Need of Getting Convicts Hiding Around Out of School (SOWING CHAOS) might be the worlds most labored acronym but I love it dearly.

I also giggle to myself whenever I remember I turned Voldemort into Yzma and made Quirrel Kronk.
