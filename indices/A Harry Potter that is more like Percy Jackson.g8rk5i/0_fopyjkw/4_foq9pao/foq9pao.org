- He is good in defence. His most impressive spell is the patronus charm, which he was forced to learn due to adverse circumstances. Most of the DA picked it up by the time they disbanded. He was indeed a good teacher and has above average power but his spell reportoire is still limited when compared to someone like Hermione.
- The tournament was rigged heavily in favor of Harry. Remember, Krum and Cedric performed impressive transfigurations and Fleur charmed the Dragon to sleep.
- Deatheaters weren't going all out were they? Voldemort couldn't allow that to happen. Snape practically kicked Harry's ass while he was fleeing after Dumbledore's death.
- It was a strange combination of Dumbledore's machinations, prophesy, luck that made Harry survive. Now compare Harry with the Marauder generation when they went to Hogwarts. They were doing animagi transformations, creating magical artefacts, spell creation, modifying potions. The Weasley Twins and Hermione ( the DA coins and roster) are the ones shown doing anything creative at all. Canon Harry just coasted through school. Admittedly there was this Dark lord shaped Sword hanging over his head, but still. I think this is the whole reason for the existence of the Indy!Harry trope.
