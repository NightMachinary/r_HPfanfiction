Most of the DA didn't pick it up. That was in the movie. In the books it was just Luna, Cho, Hermione, Ginny and Ron. Ernie Macmillan cast it in the Battle of Hogwarts, over 2 years later. Also, Harry didn't just pick it up. He pretty much mastered it. He drove off a hundred dementors with it. Adult wizards and witches face difficulty in barely casting it. The only other guy to drive off a hundred at the same time was Aberforth Dumbledore, and he was called an extremely gifted wizard even when being compared to Albus, although not quite in his level. Also, Aberforth did it when he was 115+ years old. Harry did it when he was 13, nearly 14.

The tournament was rigged, yes. Doesn't change the fact that he summoned a broomstick from over a mile away. Cedric and Fleur were 2 years older than him. Also, the flashiest method isn't always the best. Fleur was taken out early on in the second task. Sure, water was unnatural or something for part-Veelas, but Harry was thoroughly unprepared for the task. She had Maxime's help.

Snape used Legilimency in their duel, and Harry's bad mental defences can be attributed to Snape's own shitty Occlumency teaching skills. Harry had already defeated Greyback and Amycus by that point. He also defeated Dolohov in the Ministry. Dolohov killed Lupin and dueled Moody for quite a while. And Dolohov was using his speciality, some lethal purple curse, Rabastan Lestrange tried to get off a Killing Curse, and Bellatrix was throwing out Cruciatus Curses.
