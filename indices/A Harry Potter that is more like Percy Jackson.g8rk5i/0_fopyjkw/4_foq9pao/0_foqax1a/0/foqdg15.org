Ron, who is a known slacker. Enough said. I won't argue about Harry's power level being above average. He was 13, but it was a necessity on his part to learn the charm due to the dementors and he practiced with Lupin for ages. Moody was handholding Harry through all the tasks. Sure, Krum and Fleur may have had support from their Heads but Cedric? He was the true champion. Narrowly defeated Greyback who don't carry a wand unlike others. Amycus was dueling Ginny and Harry took a potshot. A Dolohov who was then recently freed from long term imprisonment at Azkaban.
