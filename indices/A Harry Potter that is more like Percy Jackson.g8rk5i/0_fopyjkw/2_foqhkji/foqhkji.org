  He is so good at defence he is the one teaching 7th years how to do it when he was only 15 at the time.

Very fair, but outside of us seeing him teach them like five spells, we're never actually shown that he's good at defense, we're just told he is. Yeah he survives a lot of nonsense, but that's just because he has to because plot reasons.

  He won the triwizard tournament against the best of the best of Europe, who were also three years older than him.

He had outside help for every step of this. While the others did too, Jr. used the Imperius Curse to get make sure Harry would get to the cup and win. The first task, his flying helped for sure, 100%, but he only managed the second task because Jr. again literally handed Dobby the Gillyweed.

  He defeats experienced death eaters in a duel without even realizing this is supposed to be hard. He defeats Voldemort in a fair fight.

These are plot armor, and saying otherwise at all is just being dense. Harry literally stops an the unstoppable Killing Curse using a LITERAL Deus Ex Machina, and he only ever wins these 1v1s through plot armor. Voldemort only ever throws around that one curse at him if he's not trying to use the Cruciatus on him.

The Death Eaters aren't allowed to kill Harry, per Voldemort's orders, so obviously they're not throwing around crazy shit that they'd use on the Aurors/Order during the first war or whatever.
