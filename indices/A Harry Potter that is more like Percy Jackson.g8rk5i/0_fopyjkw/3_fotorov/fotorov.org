He won the Tournament because Voldemort was rigging it and he got outside help constantly.

He survives every end-of-the-year brush with death mostly through luck, other people's machinations and plot armor.

He stumbles through the first three years of his life in the Magical world without even bothering to find out how Voldemort's followers were called. Or his own /grandparents/.

Every year, it gets more and more clear Voldemort has a personal interest in him and he will hunt him down, and he never puts any effort into improving himself. On the contrary, he signs up for the easiest classes because he can't be bothered with the difficulty of Runes and Arithmancy.

Doesn't put any effort into Occlumency. Even though Snape is a shit teacher... fucking hell, not being allowed the privacy of your own thoughts?! That's horrible! Learning a way to protect your own brain would be the first thing anyone would do the moment they learn how many ways of controlling/entering someone's mind are.

Never uses his own assets, even as the nation turns increasingly hostile towards him.

Could go on and on, really. Like another comment said, I don't want, by any means, to imply he is inept. But all the potential he has, he constantly squanders through out the 7 books. He is just a slightly above average teen who gets unfairly thrust into something he should have never been involved in, but he never puts in any effort to help himself out.

Even the Patronus thing, which most people claim as an unquestionable feat of skill. The fact that every single one of the DA pulls it off actually devalues the spell, imo. Sure, you may argue that he explained it very clearly, but that just shows he could be a good teacher later on. The fact that everyone manages the spell only shows his colleagues had the same power level as he did. You can explain anything for years, if the student doesn't have the physical capability to do the task, it's futile.

If you go for a realistic take on the series, he should have been killed in the first book, when he gets the brilliant idea of battling an adult wizard.
