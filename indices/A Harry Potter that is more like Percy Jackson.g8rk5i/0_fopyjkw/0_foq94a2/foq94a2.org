It becomes really obvious in OotP and HBP. He hits Antonin Dolohov with a /Petrificus Totalus/ and I'm pretty sure he stuns Rabastan Lestrange easily in the Ministry battle. Dolohov, who killed Lupin and is one of the most dangerous Death Eaters and Lestrange who was part of the quartet who tortured the Longbottoms.

It's even more impressive when you realise he has no formal training and went through a lot of shit the entire year, had his mind infiltrated by Voldemort and a splitting headache at the same time.

In HBP, he takes out Greyback with a single spell, who had defeated Bill just minutes ago, and his Impediment Jinx throws Amycus Carrow across the corridor.

All of this after who knows how many hours of running around all day, the RoR thing with Trelawney and nearly being drowned by Inferi.

It's when you realise Super!Harry fanfic is mostly canon Harry who isn't being sidelined by well-meaning but condescending adults.
