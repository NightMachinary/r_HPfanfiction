Not saying that I disagree with everything you've mentioned, and Harry isn't by any means completely inept, but Harry only won the tournament because of outside help. First task Moody/Crouch had to hint to use a broomstick - and, yes, we can attest to Harry's amazing flying skills, but the whole point of that task, was if I remember correctly, to judge how the champion would be able to fair in a unknown task, and it judged their creativity etc.

The second task was basically spoon-fed to him- Cedric told him what to do with the egg. Dobby gave him the gillyweed. I mean, he fought of the grindylows and merpeople, but they learned that in third year, not to mention that the gillyweed made things much easier in terms of accessibility.

And thirdly, Moody/Crouch himself said he personally oversaw the maze in order to ensure that Harry won. Most things that Harry fought off in there were either mentioned in his classes (and he'd have to be Crabbe/Goyle level not to be able recall how to get past them) or he'd dealt with before (the acromantuala) or just needed common sense to be dealt with (the sphinx and the mist)

I'm not going to comment on the duel because I can't remember enough of the Canon part from the top of my head. And I'm not saying that Harry's stupid or weak, though Harry's whole character arc is (and I've forgotten what the title for it was, though I've seen it mentioned on this subreddit a few times) molded out to make him seem as human, relatable and average as possible to the reader.
