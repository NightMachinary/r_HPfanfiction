A couple of counterpoints:

- First task.

Everyone "cheated" in that they knew upfront they were going to be facing dragons. Nobody truly went in blind/unprepared. Every other contestant also prepared for dragons their own way and had people helping them. You think Krum just randomly happened to know the exact spell to blind a dragon? No, he was training specifically for that shit after Karkarov told him, the same as Harry. At the end of the day Harry still did it himself and actually outflew the dragon!!

- Second task.

Learning about grindylows in a book and actually fighting them off for real are not the same thing. case in point, Fleur was actually overwhelmed by them and had to drop out. Everyone of the contestants had the same chance going in and Harry was still first to reach the hostages and only his moral code stopped him from outright winning it all because he choose to wait until the others arrived.

- third task

Crouch said a lot of things to throw Harry of his game, there is little to no actual evidence in the books what he said was true or that it made a difference in the end. Harry did face that task and ended up victorious against opponents older than him and already the best of their respective years.
