Harry Potter is one of the strongest characters in his world. The only reason it isn't noticeable is because we see him as a kid standing next to Dumbledore and Voldemort, which really colours your perspective.

In any interaction between him and his classmates or him and non-insane godlike adults he is the strongest one there.

- He is so good at defence he is the one teaching 7th years how to do it when he was only 15 at the time.
- He won the triwizard tournament against the best of the best of Europe, who were also three years older than him.
- He defeats experienced death eaters in a duel without even realizing this is supposed to be hard.
- He defeats Voldemort in a fair fight.

Yes, he isn't really all that interested in the theory and doesn't care tot memorize dates of Goblin rebellions, thus Hermione has higher scores than him in class. But out in the real world he clearly outclasses her in power.
