You should take that out of the summary and instead mention it in the authors note of the first chapter. While writing fanfiction isn't about the amount of readers you get get, you're probably missing out on a fair amount of people that assume it's a harem story and just skips it, if the comments here are anything to go by.

Multi!Harry is the best way to go though. It's quite unrealistic when Harry ends in with someone during his first year and ends up marrying her. Even book Harry ends up marrying his first girlfriend.
