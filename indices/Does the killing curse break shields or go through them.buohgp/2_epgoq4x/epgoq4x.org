I've always thought that it depends. I always imagined a magical shield to sort of be a competition, where you pit your defensive magic against their incoming spell. The shield charm is just really efficient at utilizing that magic, which allows you to defend against spells that are much more powerful than your shield. However, sufficiently strong spells will be able to shatter your shield. I imagine the killing curse to just be a /very/ high-energy spell, which cannot be defended normally. If you manage to give your shield another power source that can overwhelming the curse, that's another story. Also helps me explain why wards collapse (the energy is overwhelmed.)
