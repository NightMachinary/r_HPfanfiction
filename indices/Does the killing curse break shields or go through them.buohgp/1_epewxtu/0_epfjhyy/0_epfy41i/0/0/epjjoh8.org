So the difference is 'glanced off' vs. 'took the blast.' It seems that it's almost like a water balloon of death - if it doesn't get a clean enough hit, it just bounces off, but if it hits, it triggers. We know that it kills humans without a mark, and yet here it is shattering stone and bursting desks into flame.

Theories: the jet of green light wasn't a Killing Curse. The security desk might not have been one, either - Harry doesn't capitalize it, meaning it might just be a curse that's lethal, rather than Avada Kedavra. Alternately, when not given a heart to stop or a soul to eject or whatever it is that happens when the curse hits you, it builds up force or friction inside an object, causing it to burst into flame if flammable, or else shatter if it is inflammable.
