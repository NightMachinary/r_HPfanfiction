Could very well be. My personal guess is that since most of these were done silently the power behind them varied. And the amount of material that can be destroyed changes.

​

Maybe the angle of the spell also matters. Who really knows.

But what is important here is that the statue that was not destroyed continued to function after. It seems the magic that was used to make it move was not affected by the Curse. Or at least not to such an extend that it could not move while not having been shattered like the one armed statue was.
