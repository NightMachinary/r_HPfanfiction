We see the AK react in different ways to the same material in book 5.

- /But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from it's plinth, and landed on the floor with a crash between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms, protecting Harry./
- /“Another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield. This time it was the one-armed centaur, galloping in front of Dumbledore, that took the blast and shattered into a hundred pieces . . . .”/ (OP36)

​

And with another type of material.

- /“He sent another killing curse at Dumbledore but missed, instead hitting the security desk, which burst into flame.”/ (OP36)
