Yeah, because Rowling can't even keep her own rather dull and unimaginative magic straight.

I mean really, a killing curse? Can you think of anything more /boring/? (I can: the greatest villain and post powerful curse defeated by a mediocre student using a disarming spell).

The hell is the point of any other basic-bitch projectile spell (like 99.99% of spells in HP) if this one kills all the time?

It's like having an armed force that can use guns and bullets, but instead you have them use BB guns and pellets.
