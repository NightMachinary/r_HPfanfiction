linkffn(The Human Condition by C.K Talons)

There you go. This is a post-Hogwarts, post-OttP story featuring Auror!Harry and a new female villain. It's a mystery with noir-ish themes and from what I remember the author was capable in creating a tense, urgent atmosphere throughout the story.

Actually written by a published fiction author, though years before she got published.
