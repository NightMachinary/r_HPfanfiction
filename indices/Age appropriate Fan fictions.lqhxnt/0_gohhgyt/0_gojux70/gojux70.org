Gotta somewhat disagree with you here. The first Alexandra Quick book is a nice mystery that's in line with Book 1 of canon, it's definitely a kids book. But the second and third are closer to young adult (e.g. HBP, DH), the fourth is verging into adult territory, the fifth is solidly adult fantasy. I think part of that is that Inverarity's ambitions for the series have changed since it started thirteen years ago, part of that is that his small fandom is now (and probably always has been) largely adults.

That said, Inverarity's other fic *Hogwarts Houses Divided* is an absolutely lovely story that's entirely suitable for kids, and feels extremely close in atmosphere to the original books. It is a little rougher writing-wise, but when you're applying that to one of the best pure writers in the fandom, it's a lot better than a lot of other stuff.

Taure, would you recommend Victoria Potter to a ten-year-old? I think at least the first book, and probably the second, is suitable and close to the mood of canon. I haven't read the first book in a while, though, so I could be misremembering.
