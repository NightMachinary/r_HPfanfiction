This one is has Harry and Hermione friendship no romantic pairings. They are 13 but it is very similar in tone to the first book. Gives u all the wonder and feeling of magic hidden around every corner of the castle. It's a mystery. We see Dobby, talk to portraits, ghosts trying to solve. Really nice themes about love and how children can sometimes solve things better than adults because they are more open and genuinely curious. Smaller themes of respect for other creatures, grief/loss, learning from mistakes rather than trying to hide them. Linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks)
