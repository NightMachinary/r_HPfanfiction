  Something had happened in that tent. Something had happened to Harry. He wasn't sure why or how, but he longed for those days when it was just him and Hermione against the world. Somewhere along the lines Harry had done something he had never intended to do. Harry had fallen irrevocably in love with his best friend. Takes place directly after DH. Harry/Hermione
