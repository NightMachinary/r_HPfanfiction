Arguably the best series I ever read was a 3 part one that goes well into the future called The Paradigm of Uncertainty. I swear you could ignore the canon stories entirely except for the fact that they were best friends at hogwarts. The third book never finished but the author put a summary of what would have happened to wrap it up anyway. Seriously, if you want a story, Google this one. It's on Shnoogle. I can't tell you how much you won't be disappointed.
