They'd ignore it, for the most part. It doesn't fit in their worldview. They might laugh about it occasionally.

Discovering the gene isn't the huge part. Engineering a retrovirus to add it to anyone exposed, that's quite interesting. Or genetic manipulation of embryos. The general idea of quickly increasing the number of people who can use magic, by means of SCIENCE!

And once that happens, chaos ensues.

Let's say I package that retrovirus as a disease that spreads quickly and doesn't have a huge effect on a person's health. (This isn't impossible by any means, but it might be tricky to make it durable, so the payload doesn't mutate, and reasonably infectious, but not harmful.) It /might/ be the case that everyone who's infected suddenly can use magic...or it might not affect them if they're adults, but twelve years in the future, all children will be able to use it.

Who will teach all these kids?

Where will they get wands?

Who will deal with accidental magic reversal?

Five generations on, when this is all sorted, the world would be better off -- magic is better at solving certain problems, and you need less equipment to solve a diverse array of problems. But it would be a tumultuous transition.
