Considering Umbridge was accusing Muggleborns of stealing magic just for being born with it, if the genes are discovered (stolen!) and can be awakened in ordinary people (they're killing magic! sacrilege! die muggle scum!), then probably the backwards (noble!) inbred (of pure blood!) magical society would reconsider their stance (they breached the stature! obliviate them! what are computorz? kill all their mad barbaric scientists!).

Seriously though, I'm not sure they would even notice at first until the news is widespread. After that some wizards with firmly rooted beliefs will mess everything up and display the common lack of sense magic induces.
