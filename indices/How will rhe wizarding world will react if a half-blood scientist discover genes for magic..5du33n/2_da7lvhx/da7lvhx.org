As [[/u/Satanniel]] has said, magical ability in the Harry Potter universe has an inherited component. Given that Rowling doesn't seem to know much about science, I'd guess that the reader is free to make up whatever rules for inheritance patterns they like.

Your question is certainly [[http://www.nature.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-tested-in-a-person-for-the-first-time-1.20988][topical]], but I've found that any story involving a potential Muggle/wizard conflict is a lightning rod for controversy. Readers have /very/ strong opinions on who would win and are loath to change their minds or listen to differing opinions without the whole discussion turning into a shitshow.

The biggest obstacle I could see would involve the discovery itself. Your scientist would need to study a population in order to collect enough data. Obtaining a large enough sample to definitively state that you've discovered the alleles for magical ability would be rather difficult and I could easily see how any such research would potentially violate the International Statue of Secrecy. This type of research isn't cheap and any results would need to be reviewed by others in the field before being accepted. So, who would fund it, why would they do so, and who benefits from any resulting patents?

Also, what does the discovered allele code for? Is it a component in cell membranes? An extracellular enzyme? In order for your story to distinguish itself, I think you'd need to be rather specific.

Even if such a thing would be possible, I can't imagine that the discovery would be widespread among Muggle circles, thus enabling wizards to easily contain the knowledge if it ever reached their ears.
