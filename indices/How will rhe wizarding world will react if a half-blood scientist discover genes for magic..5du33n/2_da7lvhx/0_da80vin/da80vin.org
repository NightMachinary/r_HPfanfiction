So I thought about this when I was sleeping.

1) What I found interesting is the political debate among wizard only about that. Sur their will be faction. Like the one that think it should be destroy, the one who think it should be wisely use and the one who think it should be widely use. And because we talking about wizard, th S debate should be rather intense, enven leading in act of terrorism.

2) one or more allele enconding for an membranic enzyme, that enable the use of magic. I my point of view the power of the wizard is linked to other genes and epigenetic , like the one that make a normal person more susccesful than an other.

3) this study is conduct by a wizard that choose to have study after hogwart in biology. And to conduct his study he will break the law, not much. For the money let's say his family is rich.

Ps: yes CRISPR-cas9 is magical !
