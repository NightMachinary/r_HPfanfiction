Yah but their is an other thing to be considered:

1) muggle world is increasing, demographically, technologically. Wizard world otherwise are scattered and seems locked in the past century

2) their is a scientist wizard that discover magic genes, and proposes to use this discovery wisely to increase slightly the number of wizard by transferring it in some muggle. So he will create muggle born.

3) He decided to reveal this strategy to the wizarding world, because he think that he can't take this decision alone. So their is a political debate in the wizarding world to know if the wizard should increase their number or not.

4) Of course muggle don't know about this discovery and will never know because wizard will obligate them.
