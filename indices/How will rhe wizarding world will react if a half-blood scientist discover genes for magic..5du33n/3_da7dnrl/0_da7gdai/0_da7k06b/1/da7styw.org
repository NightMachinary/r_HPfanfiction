I agree. Wizards don't have electronics or lunar rovers or nuclear reactors because they don't /need/ those things. Muggles developed those things because they served a purpose. Cultural development went down another path in the magical world because of differing priorities.

Why develop TNT when you can pretty much blow up whatever you like with a casual wave of your wand? I'd think it would be more practical to research ways to make the magical explosion bigger/more efficient/less dangerous rather than finding some completely mundane method of doing it. Why research medical treatment to reconstruct shattered bones when you can just vanish and regrow them overnight? Magical people don't /need/ science the way muggles do, so of course there are facets they ignore.
