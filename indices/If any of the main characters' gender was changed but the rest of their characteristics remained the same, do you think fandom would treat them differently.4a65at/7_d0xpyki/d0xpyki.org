In the vast majority of fictional properties - especially the really popular ones - characters tend reflect and promote traditional gender role expectations. This is true in HP, too, though HP is a bit better than many.

So what happens when you flip genders? You violate gender norms. Male characters become more reserved, more nurturing, and to play supportive roles. Female characters become more adventurous, take more risks, and save princes from dragons.

Would fandom treat the characters differently? You betcha! A lot of fandom would be outraged, quite frankly, though most either wouldn't consciously understand why or, if they did, they'd deny it. Or maybe try to rationalize it.

Change all the genders in the Avengers. Or Star Wars. Or Harry Potter. A lot of people will have trouble accepting it. It will just "feel wrong" to them because the male and female characters are suddenly behaving contrary to expectations.

This is one reason why I tend to write female Harry stories - to put a female in the role of taking risks and saving the day. I find it amusing how often I've seen the objection of "what's the point?" to flipping Harry's gender, as if there weren't any problem in how gender is treated in fiction.

As to the specifics you raise, I suspect that "Herman" wouldn't be derided as a bossy know-it-all. He'd simply be assertive and confident, like a boy is supposed to be. Competitive, too, and while it's in academics instead of sports, that's also acceptable for boys.
