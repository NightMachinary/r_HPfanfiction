I didn't write anything about characters behaving differently because of having a different gender. Perhaps you meant to respond to someone else?

My comment about Herman was made under the assumption that he does behave just as Hermione does. And, as I said, fans would react negatively because so many would object to the violation of gender behavior norms.
