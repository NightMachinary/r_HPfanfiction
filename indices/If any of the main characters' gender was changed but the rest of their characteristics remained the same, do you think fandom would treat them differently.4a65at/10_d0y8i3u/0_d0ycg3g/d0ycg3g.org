That would be interesting. If she still crushed on Lily that might be an additional reason it was unrequited, and might give her a reason to dislike Harry - eternal proof, sitting in her class every day, that her crush liked men, not women - or chose a man over her.

Would she be more or less hated as a strict and nasty female teacher I wonder? She'd also be just one more strong and strict woman for poor Neville to be afraid of.

As Voldemort's /other/ right-hand woman Ms. Snape might also have an interesting relationship with Bellatrix, and Lucius and Narcissa for that matter.
