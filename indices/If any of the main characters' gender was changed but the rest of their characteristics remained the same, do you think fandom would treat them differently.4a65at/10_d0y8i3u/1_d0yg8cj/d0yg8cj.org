  she'd probably definitely be less harassed by james and co. also probably take better care of herself, bc of the associations with performing femininity and power.

I don't see that at all, actually. There's an already existing stereotype of ugly, nerdy, brainy girls who get bullied and endlessly mocked in school, and as a student Snape would still be the swotty morose weirdo with bad hair. Snape's poverty might be a little more obvious because people tend to scrutinize and rate how girls look and dress; there's more wiggle room for boys to be ragged and unkempt.

"Performing feminity" is a descriptive term for a certain kind of learned behavior. It's not innate, and it doesn't apply to women as a class. I don't see Snape performing femininity. She grew up during the sixties and was the right age for the rise of punk rock. Snape in the books seems to ignore his physical body; ambition, intelligence/power, and resentment are what drive him. Female Snape would be just as obstinate about her looks, and just as indifferent, as her male counterpart. She'd want to kill her enemies with her brain.

The Marauders would undoubtedly insult her and torment her with minor jinxes and be sexually demeaning about her appearance, but I don't think they'd go anywhere near the lengths they do in the books. Hanging a girl upside-down and inviting the crowd to view her much-laundered underwear is too obviously a sexual attack, and JKR wouldn't let James, at least, go that far. It would be really, really difficult to make him sympathetic after that.

One problem with gender-swapping Snape is that she instantly becomes the Wicked Witch of the West - skinny, greasy-haired, hooked-nose, with beetle-black eyes, thin fingers, and flapping black robes. This was the popular image of Hallowe'en witches until HP and Buffy and the urban fantasy genre came along to make witches sexy. At the time it would have seemed strangely unimaginative if the meanest teacher in the school were described as your standard-issue evil witch.
