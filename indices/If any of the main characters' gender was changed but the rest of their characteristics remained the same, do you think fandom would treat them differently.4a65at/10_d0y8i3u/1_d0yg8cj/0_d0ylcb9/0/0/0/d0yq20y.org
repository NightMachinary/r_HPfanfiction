Hmm, I was responding to the original comment's "less harassed," because I interpreted the commenter as meaning "less frequently" rather than "less harshly." Partly because the Levicorpus scene and the Shrieking Shack "prank" go beyond harassment for me, even if the former is considered business as usual among the members of feuding houses.

And yes, the extreme instances might not have been so extreme, but I do think James and Co. would have been sexist shitheads to a female version of Snape, to the extent that they would make her life equally miserable. She could conceivably have had more support from the staff, which might have toned down the worst of the bullying, but Snape's written as someone who doesn't appeal to authorities for help because s/he assumes (in canon, rightfully so) that she won't get any. Also, this wanders off to the other side of the OP's question - would JKR have changed the way she wrote the characters if she gender-flipped them? The OP asks how /fandom/ would respond to a change in biological sex. Presumably, JKR would also take that into account and revise the interactions between her characters accordingly, starting with the point you make, that they'd be assigned different dorm mates (and here things branch off into - just one genderswap? a full-cast genderswap?). But in James and Sirius' cases, she clearly didn't want them to be irredeemable assholes, so I wager she'd modify their actions.

  That's quite the condensation of what's a rather complex issue.

It's a nod to acknowledge the existence of issues beyond this discussion, and a signal that I'm not about to launch into a sociological treatise. I'm not condensing in order to minimize the complexity. Anyone who wants to run with the topic is free to do so. I've done it in the past; I'm not doing it here.

  it's heavily implied that Levicorpus saw far more use than just the incident at the lake

What makes you say that? I'm not asking because I think you're wrong, but because that would be an interesting addition to the whole Snape/Marauders history, and I don't personally remember picking up that implication. Although, even without textual proof, it would make sense.
