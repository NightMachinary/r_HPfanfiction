  Nope, I don't think James would flip her upside-down for a gawking crowd, and more to the point...

So, basically, they wouldn't treat her the same/as harshly as they did in canon? Especially since far from being an extremity it's heavily implied that /Levicorpus/ saw far more use than just the incident at the lake.

Unless you think all bullying is the same, it's quite obvious that their relationship would have a very different dynamic. Hell, they wouldn't even interact half as much in the first place, being different-gendered children in different houses of a boarding school. Case in point: Harry's relationship with Pansy vs. Draco (and vice versa)

  Kinda sad, though, that what's considered horrifying treatment of girls by boys should be shrugged off when boys do it to each other.

That's quite the condensation of what's a rather complex issue.

Cross-gender bullying has always carried [more] horrifying connotations, what with straightness being overwhelmingly visible in traditional society. Fem!Severus being stripped by fem!James and fem!Sirius would not garner as much attention either, unless they took off her bra or some shit.
