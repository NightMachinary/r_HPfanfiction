Did you read my entire comment? Nope, I don't think James would flip her upside-down for a gawking crowd, and more to the point, I don't think JKR would write that and then make the perpetrator a good man. And I suspect Sirius wouldn't actually send female Snape into a werewolf's den, although I'm less sure about that. Sirius was given to flamboyant gestures. But the extremity of those instances aside, yes, I think James and Sirius and Peter would still have looked down upon Snape and made her life a living hell. She would have been the ugly girl it was okay to tease mercilessly because she had none of the sex appeal or sportiness or conciliatory behavior that redeems the average teenage girl in the eyes of the average (straight) teenage boy. Or at any rate, the teenage population as portrayed in fictional boarding schools.

  You think the professors would have been as lax about that happening?

One would certainly hope not. Although Dumbledore allowed fake!Moody to teach Cruciatus in class, and that's pretty appalling. And he didn't rein in adult Snape's cruelty as a professor because he believed (according to Word of God) that bullying teachers were just another life lesson and students should get used to it. Still, I'd expect McGonagall would kick their asses, and I doubt Dumbledore would brush it off as just boys being boys.

Kinda sad, though, that what's considered horrifying treatment of girls by boys should be shrugged off when boys do it to each other.
