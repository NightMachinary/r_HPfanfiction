I like the Hermione character and my OTP is h/hr but I really can't tell you how much of that is due to Emma Watson.

There is a story .. linkffn(A Switched Chance) that does an interesting bit with a botched time travel where Harry ends up in Hermione's body while she's in his.

There's another story where all the genders are switched, the Hermione character is a male named (forgive my poor recall) Orestese? That one has the roles flipped, Harry keeps getting in trouble for acting like a woman, dominant, sexually aggressive, pushy.. the title totes escapes me atm.. I'll try to find it.
