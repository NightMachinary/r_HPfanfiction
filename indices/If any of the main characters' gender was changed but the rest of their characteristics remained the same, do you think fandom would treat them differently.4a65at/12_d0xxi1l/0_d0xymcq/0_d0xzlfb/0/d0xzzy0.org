And that's how you get [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894793/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Distaff-Side][Harry Potter and the Distaff Side]]. Actually, now that I think about it, that's really what the OP was getting at.

With the joking comment out of the way, why have the society be monolithically patrilineal or matrilineal? Why not either or both or neither? If you're going to AU it up, why not have it so the new generation's family name is a mash-up of the parents'? Like, the Weasley children could have been Preasley/Presley (Weawett would have been an option, but sounds like something a baby would coo).
