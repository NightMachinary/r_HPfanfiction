The name mashup is just something I always thought was interesting.

Though I have to say, I don't feel like Lysander Thomas Granger is quite pretentious enough for a child of a pair who named a girl Hermione. Though I can't think of anything else that would be suitable off the top of my head, no matter how much I wish it was Prospero.
