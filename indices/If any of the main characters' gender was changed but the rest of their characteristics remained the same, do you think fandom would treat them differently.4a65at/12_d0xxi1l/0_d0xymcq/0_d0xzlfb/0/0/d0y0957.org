Yeah. That's what I was going for with the list of names, except without the monumental fuckup that was "Distaff Side"'s names. Seriously, "Dionysidoros" and "Veronica" and "Malcolm"? Those were fucking lazy and half-assed.

Also, mashing up the parents' names really isn't something that's done in any society around the world, so it would be highly unlikely in this circumstance. I think matrilineality would be far easier to deal with in an AU like that.
