Rowling drew a clear link between Sirius and Bellatrix - They both went to Azkaban at the same time, offering no resistance, after the one they've been very loyal to (James/Voldemort) had fallen. Bellatrix was obviously more unhinged, but not by a large margin, and Sirius did hold a sadistic streak, though not as great as hers. Harry described their looks very similarly, both before and after Azkaban, they both were especially talented, and they even died the same way. Of course they aren't exactly the same, but they mirror each other very strongly, to the point that Bellatrix comes off as his female "evil twin".
