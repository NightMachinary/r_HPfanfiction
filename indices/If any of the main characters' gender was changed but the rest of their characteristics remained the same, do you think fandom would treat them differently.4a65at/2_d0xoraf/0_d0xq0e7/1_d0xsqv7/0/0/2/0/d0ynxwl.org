Actually, I can imagine a male version of Luna, but in describing him, I think there'd be less tendency to dwell on his dreamy voice and innocent blue eyes. But the vagueness, the preoccupation, the flashes of insight, the woolgathering, the belief in imaginary creatures, the apparent randomness, the unself-conscious honesty - I can envision a male character with these qualities, especially one assigned to Ravenclaw. That kind of absentminded oddball intelligence sorts very well with certain kinds of artistic or creative, slightly shy or retiring or oblivious male characters. The difficulty (I say this with tongue in cheek) would be writing a Luna-esque teenage boy who doesn't come across as a stoner or a latter-day hippie.
