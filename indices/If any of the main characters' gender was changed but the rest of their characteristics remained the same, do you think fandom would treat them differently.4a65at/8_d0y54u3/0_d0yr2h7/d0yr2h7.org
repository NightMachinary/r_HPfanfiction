Dumbledore would be interesting, actually. For one thing, the Dumbledore/Grindelwald relationship would probably be made canon, even if JKR decided to keep it one-sided (because as far as I recall, she never said Gellert returned Albus' feelings). The backstory of a powerful female character being so blinded by love that she falls prey to an authoritarian daydream, gets her younger sister killed, and then swears off love for the rest of her exceedingly long life would be somewhat regressive, though. Much like the celibate gay headmaster narrative. Especially since, according to Pottermore, we already have McGonagall swearing off relationships after Elphinstone dies. Two powerful senior witches with no sex life? Eh.

Also, I suspect Dumbledore's ruthlessness in the face of hard decisions would bother readers more if Albus were a woman. Leaving Harry to be abused by the Dursleys? Not being honest with him? Not being there when Harry needed her? Hesitant to show affection? Not stopping Draco even when it became clear that Draco's attempts to kill her were endangering students? Even the gaudy robes and twinkling idiosyncrasies would have a different impact. It would be like making the smart and level-headed version of Trelawney headmistress.

Most elderly characters are perceived as more or less sexless, but "grandmotherly" and "grandfatherly" still stir up different expectations. A female Dumbledore who's not maternal would probably get more backlash than a male Dumbledore who withholds outward signs of affection.

Not gonna lie, the showdown in the Department of Mysteries between Dumbledore and Voldemort would suddenly get a lot more interesting to me. It's one reason I love the Sacking of Severus Snape - not only is it dramatic, and full of dramatic irony, but it's got McGonagall being bad-ass. (Demerits for the Snape-shaped hole, though.)
