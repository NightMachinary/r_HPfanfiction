I'm sure the PMS jokes would never end with a female Ron. Female Harry wouldn't be considered so damn passive because gender roles generally don't expect women to be as action-oriented. Male Hermione would probably have many many fewer fans, cuz no more Emma Watson.

The lack of a Dumbledore beard would be a great loss, but I think the changes there would be the least; it would still be the archetypal wizard, but as a woman. (Obviously flipping Dumbledore's gender should flip McGonagall's, too.)

A imagine a female Riddle would cause the majority of Death Eater recruits to also be female, and it would have (un)intended "feminism" overtones instead of racial.

I can't really think of any other major characters.
