*Harry*: Will most likely be named after a flower, as I am 99% sure that it's canon that the Evens' named their girls after flowers (Lily, Petunia) so it's likely Lily would have named fem!Harry after a flower, my personal favorite is Iris, Harriet or 'Hari' just sounds stupid IMO.

Appearance wise I like to imagine she would look like male Harry, black hair and green eyes, but the hair wouldn't be as messy and wild.

*Ron*: Ronnie or Ronalda would probably look a lot like Ginny but more chubby, eventually developing large breasts like Molly, she will most likely chose to keep her hair short, since she would be too lazy to manage long hair.

*Hermione*: I really like the name Hermes, he would be tall and skinny, with wild short curly hair, eventually choosing to grow a beard since Hermione really admired Dumbledore and I picture Hermes trying to grow a beard as long as Dumbledore.

*Draco*: Draconia is an acceptable alternative though I'm sure someone can come up with something better. She will heavily resemble Narcissa, copying her way of dressing and her hair since male Draco copied his father as much as he could I like to imagine a female Draco similarily emulating Narcissa, I shudder to imagine female Crabbe and Goyle so I won't even go there...

*Voldemort*: Tom Riddle was described as incredibly handsome in his early years, likewise I imagine a female Tom (or Tamsin/Tamsyn) would be very beautiful before she sacrificed all that for immortality, eventually looking like Voldemort, with pale skin, bald head and snake eyes and nose, but more delicate, most likely with deep and full red lips.
