[[http://www.behindthename.com/name/ronald][Ronald]] is a Scottish form of [[http://www.behindthename.com/name/ragnvaldr][Ragnvaldr]], an Old Norse name roughly meaning "counsel of a ruler". So it does fit, though through a circuitous route. And anyway, JKR came up with his name before any of his family's names.
