The Latin version of an old Greek name. I'd think it unlikely that they'd be aware of any meaning the name might possibly have since all the names they gave to their children were rather ... British, be it English or Scots, and the wizarding community seems a tad isolated.

In any case, not like I'd mind if any author decided to use that name for a gender-flipped Ron, for as long as it actually made any sense in the story.
