  So it does fit, though through a circuitous route.

By this definition Veronica would count as well as Ptolemaic is a /Greek/ (Greeks are European) royal family who happens to rule Egypt.

Personally I suspect that the name is supposed to be "counsel/advice to a ruler", as someone who gives counsel or advice to a ruler will always be in the shadow of a ruler. It also happens to be that all of Ron's siblings, parents and best friend are named after English or British rulers. Furthermore the meaning of Harry's name, whether it's diminutive of Henry or Harold, can mean "home ruler" or "army" "ruler". This fits Ron's character as he is forever overshadowed by his best friend and siblings.

Do I think Veronica is a perfect match? No, as it lacks the same subtle meaning. But as a non-British/English ruler name it would still work.
