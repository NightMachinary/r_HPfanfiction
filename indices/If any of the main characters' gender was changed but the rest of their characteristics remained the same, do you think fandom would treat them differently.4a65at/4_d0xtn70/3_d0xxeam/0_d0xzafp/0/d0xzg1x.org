His name's Percival- this, their father Arthur and Ginevra (a variant of Guinivere) all relate to the Camelot story. Ronald is a Scots name meaning great counselor, and it has a certain vocal similarity to the author's friend Sean, who was partly a model for the character.

I grabbed Veronica for the association as you said, but it might have been better if she were named Izzy (as in Yseult or Isabelle).
