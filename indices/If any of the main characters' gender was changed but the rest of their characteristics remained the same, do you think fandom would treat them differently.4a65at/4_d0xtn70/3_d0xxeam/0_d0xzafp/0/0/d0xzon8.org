There is nothing in canon saying that his name is Percival, just like how Fred is Fred and not Frederick. Honestly, the Weasley name theme that you brought up is subtle enough that ignoring it would probably be fine. If it was a Black, not so much (except for Phineas Nigellus, even though it has Greek mythology and Hebrew connections).

Didn't know that about the meaning of Ronald. Pretty cool. My name only means son of [name] and that's boring as all hell.
