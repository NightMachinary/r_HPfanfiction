Honestly, it's not that their naming theme is subtle, but rather that we very rarely hear the full versions of their names. On one hand, you have names like “Bill”, “Charlie”, or “Ginny”; and on the other hand, there is the seldom-heard “William”, “Charles”, or “Ginevra”. Fred and George are also a part of the theme, albeit more subtly, as there was a king named George who ruled immediately after a king named Frederick (which “Fred” is a diminutive of) due to the latter's early demise; I'd think it a fitting set of names for twins if one were to try keeping with the naming theme. Percival, likewise, since his name is also of the princely sort.

The one who doesn't fit the theme naming fully is actually Ronald, but only because his name is a Scots one and I suspect that anyone trying to go for theme naming of this sort would lose their steam at the 6th kid of the same sex.
