If it's Harry, the whole dynamic changes because she would be spending time in the girls' dorm, relating more regularly with the other witches and probably having very little to do with the Weasleys.

Flipping Hermione into a nerdy sixth dormmate would put the main cast into a particularly male-minded state. I think the story would lose quite a bit of perspective and 'Horatio' would be competing with Neville for sympathy.

Flipping Ron to Veronica might have less disruptive impact and more positive outcomes, as her courage would be lauded and her moments of selfishness and distrust might be ascribed to being affected emotionally. Girls turning attitudes on their friends isn't seen as exactly the same sort of betrayal as Ron's breaking loyalty was.

The best option might be to reverse all three, as Harriet and Veronica might still bond more for being the sporty sort compared to Lavender and Parvati, and a scruffy but smart Horatio might be accepted more readily as taking a brotherly concern for Harriet and carrying a torch for the loud, clumsy but ultimately funny and supportive Veronica.

So many interpretations are possible.
