They'd probably treat them the same, seeing as the main reasons why characters in this fandom are treated the way they are is because of their personalities, not their gender. Or at least by the majority of fans/authors in my experience.

If Hermione had been a guy, Ron might not have initially have been so immature with her in first year, sure. But he'd have still had all the comments about her (or him, in this AU) being a bossy know it all. But it would also probably skew the Ron/Hermione endgame. Because as far as we've seen both characters are straight, so they'd end up with different characters.

As far as fanfiction goes and I hate to say this, but I feel that if Snape was female there might be more acceptance of Harry/Snape fics. Because half the time people who shout it down are people who aren't fans of slash, let alone the pedophilia concerns and the abuse of trust in the student-teacher relationship. All of that morality tends to fly out of the window when you have a horny fetishist author writing their fantasies with themself being one of the two characters featured, albeit called by a different name.
