Yes, with the trio you might have to gender-flip all of them to get the same or a similar dynamic. An interesting AU might be to gender-flip /all/ of the Gryffindors in Harry's year, or maybe even all the kids in his year. That would avoid any gender complications in the existing character relationships (as in, how they get on or don't, not pairings) like Ron-Harry or Harry-Malfoy.
