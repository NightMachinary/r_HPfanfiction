There are always exceptions. And it's easier with older boys than younger. But Katniss is not exactly gender-typical in her behavior, dress, and attitudes. A girl who hunts for food, is an excellent archer, doesn't express (or even deal with) her emotions well, and is in a survival contest is a lot easier sell to boys than most female characters. And seriously, gender-flipping Katniss would make almost no difference to the character - although it obviously would to some of the plot.
