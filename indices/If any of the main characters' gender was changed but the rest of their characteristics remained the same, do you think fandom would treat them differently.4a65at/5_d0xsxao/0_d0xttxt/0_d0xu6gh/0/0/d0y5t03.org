I'm not saying she's not an accurate portrayal of a teenage girl. I'm saying it's easier to get boys to read books about a girl who has obvious "masculine" traits like hunting and survival skills, rather than books about a more traditionally feminine girl. And popular series with a female protagonist are still the exception, not the norm.
