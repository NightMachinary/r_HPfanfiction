While I can't disagree with what you said, I do think there are a lot of very feminine things that Katniss goes through. I thought her confusion on which boy she liked honestly so close to my own confusion as a girl trying to figure out what it even meant to have a crush and kissing someone what kissing wasn't even all that fun. I think if Katniss had been a guy, his confusing feelings on which girl he liked would have been treated very differently.

I have some major issues with those books, but I do think the author did a really good job making her feel very female and very teenage in terms of her progressing maturity.
