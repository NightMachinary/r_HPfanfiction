Well, first of all, if it were Harriet Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, I suspect that it would not have become a worldwide phenomenon, and we wouldn't be here (in this sub). Which is a shame, but hard to to deny.

It is simply much harder to convince boys to read books with female protagonists than it is to convince girls to read books with male protagonists. And it probably holds true into adulthood. I simply can't think of many books with female protagonists I can imagine many men reading.
