[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4gax5d/best_of_harry_ships/d2fyzcp][Here]] is the wiki thread of good Harry/Ginny fics.

Like [[/u/stefvh]] said, pottermum has a bunch. So does [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1816754/sbmcneil][sbmcneil]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] is also an H/G writer, though some of his stories just don't work right, and the ending always is unsatisfactory. And of course, there is our Lord and Savior of Canon Compliance: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]. Our own [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] has written a few that can be found over [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][here]].
