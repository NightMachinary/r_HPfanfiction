I'm told it's okay to self plug. I think this fits worryingly neatly into the period between DH and CC. It's a largely Harry-centric mystery Auror story rather than a romance but Harry/Ginny and their children are a bit more than background. If you think it's crap, sorry. If you like it, tell me :) Hope this works [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11662486/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Eversion-of-Magic][Harry Potter and the Eversion of Magic]]
