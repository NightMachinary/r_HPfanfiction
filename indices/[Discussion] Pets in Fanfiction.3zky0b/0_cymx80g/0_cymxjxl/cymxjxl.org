Sold! I may have to find a place in the fic to do that.

I agree on the snakes, I just felt compelled to add the remark about them being overdone because I've seen them come up in some of the various "things you hate in fanfic" threads and didn't want anyone ignoring the rest of post just to tell me I'm using a common trope. (Although I think the biggest issue people complain about is the use of parseltongue, which I think I've managed to handle okay.)
