Just because a pet/device/person isn't in much, or even isn't a major plot point, doesn't mean that they shouldn't be there. Sometimes it can be enough just to be, to create a depth or reality to the story. I mean, short of getting lost many times, Trevor serves very little plot focus in the books and I would never think JKR shouldn't have included him.
