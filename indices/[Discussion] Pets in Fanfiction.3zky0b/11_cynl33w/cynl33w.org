In the fic, The Silent World of Cassandra Evans, Cassie is mute. But because Parseltongue is a language entirely made up of hisses she can still speak to snakes. In this fic, Shortcake (her snake) serves as her only companion that she can speak to vocally.

In Silent World, Shortcake is more than a pet, he is by all means a character in the story, so if you feel like your snake is lacking in screen time then just have Harry treat zir like a peer or a friend that he can talk to rather than as a pet or a minion.
