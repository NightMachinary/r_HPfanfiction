I have to admit, I've heard about it more than I've seen it, but I don't read even half as much fic as I did ten years ago so I confess to relying on hearsay for the more common tropes these days. I don't think they play a major role, just that they turn up regularly enough for people to roll their eyes. (Some just because they're there; some for more sensible reasons as mentioned by [[/u/howtopleaseme]] in this thread.)

I don't have a link yet; I like to finish writing before I post so I can alter and edit as much as I please.
