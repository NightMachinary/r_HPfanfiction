My old housemate's snake (in the year that we lived in the same place with the snake) managed to:

- Get stuck in my housemate's hair\\
- Get stuck in our other housemate's dressing gown
- Get stuck in that same housemate's bra strap
- Get stuck in my girlfriend's knitted jumper
- Get stuck through my belt loops

Solid was a dumb piece of shit, but I loved him.
