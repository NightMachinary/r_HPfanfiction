Legacy by storytellerSpW has an interesting take on snake intelligence and Parseltongue. It presents that snakes are smart enough to communicate with parseltongues but are still interested in their basic needs (sleep, warm, food). It also has them as basically only controllable when actually in the vicinity of a parseltongue, and if they get too far away they sort of just wander off and go back to regular snake business. Like you can tell a snake to watch a door, and when you leave and come back the snake will be able to tell you if it saw anyone come through, but it also might have just slithered off to sleep or chase a mouse. They can talk, but they mostly talk about how it's not warm enough or how they'd like to get out of this damn enclosure thank you, not Snakespeare. I felt it was a good, realistic balance(or as realistic as you can get with goddamn wizards). They're useful, but not /that/ useful
