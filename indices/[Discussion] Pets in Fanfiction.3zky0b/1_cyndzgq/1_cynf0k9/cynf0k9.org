Holy crap, I can't believe I completely neglected the terrarium issue in this fic, even though I covered it in a different fic. (And the rest of that fic was completely crap.) In this case, I've apparently been influenced by the shoulder snake trope, but it'll be easy enough to fix it in this fic, so thanks for mentioning it.

The intelligence issue I think I covered well enough because one of the "things I hate in fanfic" threads was posted at the same time I began writing and it prompted me to make a note to not have super intelligent snakes in my fic. I think people probably assume that because Harry speaks Parseltongue perfectly (his problems only ever seem to be in distinguishing it from English, but his vocab is fine) then snakes must be equally well-spoken.
