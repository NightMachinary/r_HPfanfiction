Here is my problem with the Harry has a snake as a pet trope. He never has a terrarium for it, it just rides around on his person all the time. Like, does it shit all over him and Harry doesn't care?

Also the snakes are always too smart and that's annoying. Philosophers stone was a childrens book and the conversation he has with the boa can't possibly be representative of how smart snakes really are. It's one of those things that doesn't make sense without stretching canon to breaking point.
