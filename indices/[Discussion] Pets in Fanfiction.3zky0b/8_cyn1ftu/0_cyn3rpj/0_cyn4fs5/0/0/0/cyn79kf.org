Good luck! And I hope you don't get struck by the same thing I did--at 120k I thought I only had another ~80k left, but I'm just now reaching 300k and still not quite done. (But the end is at least in sight!)

Will you link to it on reddit when you're done? If not, do you have an FFN or AO3 author page where I can follow/subscribe to get an alert?
