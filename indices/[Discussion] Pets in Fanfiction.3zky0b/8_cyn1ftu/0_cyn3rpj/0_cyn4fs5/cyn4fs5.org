I have scenes from Hedwig's POV where she's actively searching for the rat. It starts off as her assuming Scabbers would be a relatively easy meal, but her curiosity deepens the longer she goes without catching him. Harry is missing in the story so Ron assumes her interest in the Gryffindor boys' bedroom is because she misses the BWL. I always thought it was strange that in canon Scabbers was never gobbled up by a hungry owl as I'd figured they eat more rodents than cats.

Thanks for letting me know it's not common. I'd hate to think I'd have inadvertently stumbled onto a well worn trope.
