I've never seen it happen nor heard of it, so I don't think it's cliche, but given the size of the fandom it's probable that someone has done it at least once before.

So do you have scenes from Hedwig's POV or just have regular incidents of her attempting to eat him and Ron and Harry struggling to stop her?
