It's bad to include TOO MUCH in your story for no purpose. Describe a few pets, great; describing each roommates pets and why some don't have them, too much. Describing a few Christmas gifts, great; detailing 6 friends mutual gift giving, overkill.

It's about balance. Build the world with inconsequential details, but don't bury the reader in them. JK did a great job in cannon with this, as evidenced by the plethora of avenues fanfiction gets to explore and flesh out.
