Look at other books. See how they use animals in the plot. For example, Idéfix in Astérix is part comic relief, and sometimes he gets Astérix and Obélix to make up after they've been fighting. And he's there because it's a comic and he looks really cute, so it makes the books more fun to look at.

All Disney movies have pets and other animals as comic relief. Think of Maximus and Pascal the chameleon in Tangled, the reindeer in Frozen, etc.

Scabbers is a bit of an exception, because he's actually important in the books. His function was also comic relief, other than being Pettegrew and all that. Basically, Rowling could have used Scabbers any way she wanted, but any time he made an appearance, it was pretty funny. Like biting Crabbe in the finger, or chewing on Harry's bedsheets. Or Ron and Hermione's row after Ron thinks Scabbers was eaten, where the other comic relief (Fred and George) make it funny again.

Now, the problem with snakes is that they're not really funny creatures, like rodents and dogs are. They are generally seen as pretty scary, sometimes disgusting creatures (bullshit if you ask me, but hey). You could use that trope, though, like Harry waking up in the middle of the night to one of his (macho) roommates screaming like a little girl because of the snake slithering up his bed.

And if you've got a girl in your book you want to pair Harry with, make her not afraid of snakes, and make the snake come to her too, use him as a slithery cupid, basically.

Or make him flee when something big is about to happen. Use him to up the tension curve, write it so that the reader knows that when the snake's fleeing, shit's about to go down, and that feeling makes books a lot more exciting.
