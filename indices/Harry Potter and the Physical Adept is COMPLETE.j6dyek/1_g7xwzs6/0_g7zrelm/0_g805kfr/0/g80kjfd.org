The author is very explicit in his notes about what a terrible person Harry is, with bonuses on the authors reasoning to boot. This isn't a happy story, and it's a very different take on the HP universe, but its definitely interesting.

It's less a story with with morals and lessons, and more of a story exploring how things would go if things about the story were changed and the implications thereof. The author doesn't shy away from the horrors humanity can inflict on itself.
