Ehh, rereading it, I can see a lot more issues than I did the first time around. It has some OK humour in a few chapters after 2, but I'm kinda on the fence about Harry himself... He's a bit of an arsehole? And it feels a lot like the author's world building exists solely as means to excuse his fucked up philosophy. Not a fan now that I think about it.
