Search won't work because of the way the site caches backups, it only takes a single snap of the site so searching isn't backed up for a lot of websites.

The only thing I can recommend is using /httpp://[[http://www.restrictedsection.org/story.php][www.restrictedsection.org/story.php]]/ replacing "story" with the name of specific fic to see if there are any backups of it.

That's all I have though :(
