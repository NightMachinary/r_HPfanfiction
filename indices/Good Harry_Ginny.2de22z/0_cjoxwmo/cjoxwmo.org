One of my favorite post-Hogwarts stories is /learning to live again/ by seeker68. Its really angsty but it does have good adventure closer to the end of the story.

  Starts the morning after the Final Battle. Follow along as Harry and Ginny live through the next few years and learn how to deal with the after-effects of the war, and try to live the life they deserve. Main focus is H/G but lots of other characters
