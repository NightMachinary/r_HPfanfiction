If anyone but post-graveyard Voldemort hit Harry with the Killing Curse, Harry ain't coming back. That whole limbo scene and the choice to go back only happened because of Voldemort having Lily's/Harry's blood within him (inadvertently tethering Harry to life as long as Voldemort himself lived).

You'd have to do some serious explanation to justify Harry surviving Hermione's Killing Curse, even in fanfiction.
