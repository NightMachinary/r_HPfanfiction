Here is a list of Harry/Daphne and Harry/Astoria stories that I like. Hope this is what you wanted.

Daphne's Promise - linkffn(13528586) - A short but sweet one-shot.

Don't Look Back in Anger - linkffn(13408959) - A AU where Neville is the bwl

Harry Potter and the Unexpected Freind - linkffn(12557197) - A good story

An Ordinary Magical Couple - linkffn(13304599) - Another short story I enjoy.

Finding a Place to Call Home - linkffn(9885609) - Harry/Astoria fic that started my addiction to the ship.

Family - It's in the Blodd - linkffn(13292346) - Another well done Harry/Astoria fic. I sadly know no other good ones myself.

Silence is Golden - linkffn(13451229) - An interesting take on Daphne that I like.

Novocaine - linkffn(13022013) - A great Harry/Daphne fanfic that has great world-building.

Dancing in the Green - linkffn(11703507) - One of my favorite stories that involve Harry and Daphne.
