Not that I can find. With a bit of luck, the author pulled it down to finish writing it before putting it back up. Another possibility is that the ff.net admins pulled it. I know they do that with some over M rated stuff.

I actually haven't read this story yet so I hit it with a download script in case it vanishes from fictionhunt.
