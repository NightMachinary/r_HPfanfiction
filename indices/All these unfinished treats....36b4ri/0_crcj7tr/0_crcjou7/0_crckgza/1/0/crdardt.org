Click it when you're on a ff.net site and copy/paste to your heart's content. Edit: probably won't work on mobile browsers due to how they implement bookmarks, sorry mobile readers.

For fanfiction downloader apps and my personal scripts, they don't implement Javascript when saving the files and ff.net still gives you the raw story, they just use a bit of JS to disable highlighting.
