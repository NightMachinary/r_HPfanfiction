Most of the stuff I read is on fanfiction.net so I just use [[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/download.php][FanFictionDownloader]].

[[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net/archives.php][Here]] is the list of sites it supports.

I haven't used fictionhunt.com before but I just did a really simple 1 line script.

#+begin_example
  curl -O http://fictionhunt.com/read/7316864/[1-16]
#+end_example

It basically spits 16 files that have chapter number for the file name. I manually create a folder with the proper title and drop them all in.

If you use fictionhunt.com a lot, let me know. I can probably make a script that would automate more of it.
