linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) is Harry/Luna, but taking her to the ball is a minor plot point in a very long story. Similarly, he takes Luna to the ball in the linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) series, but it's not a focus, and the series is over a million words and regularly updating.

I imagine you could find a bunch of matching fics at [[/r/HPharmony][r/HPharmony]] if you like that ship.
