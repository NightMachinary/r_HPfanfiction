Yeah, it's... Not a great story to be honest.

From what I can tell, Clueful!HP means "I bash everyone to make Harry seem smarter without actually making him a compelling character".

And yes, the Dumbledore Bashing is at its very worst.

All in all, it's a perfect storm of almost everything I personally dislike in Harry Potter fanfiction - which is exactly what the OP requested.
