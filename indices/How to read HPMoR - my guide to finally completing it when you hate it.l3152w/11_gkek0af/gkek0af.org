HPMOR may be my favorite written work. I also enjoyed Metropolitan Man and Worm/Ward, but nothing has approached HPMOR for me. Maybe I just like competence porn with a scientific angle?

I make this point (1) to suggest no one reads work they don't enjoy, especially HPMOR, and (2) to solicit new recommendations from outside the HPMOR subreddit.
