I've just been thinking about one thing. For me, it's like a really unique thought experiment on psychology, the way the mind works, the way people behave and react in extreme circumstances etc., not a literature story in its classic meaning.

It's not meant to be read as the originals, it's the original story that is twisted to an extreme level, and that makes almost everyone super unrelatable and so surreal that you can't even keep up with all the craziness it provides. This is the starting point and let's see how the characters will fit into this insane version of the world!
