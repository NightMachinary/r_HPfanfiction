The author asks for sponsors and donations for a derivative work that stands against/explicitly insults the original books. Proceeds to ask to be put in contact with JKR for purposes of more explicit commercialization. Not sporting at all.There is plenty of interesting magic and worldbuilding (best Transfiguration system in the fandom/ Philosophers stone concept/David Monroe/ Origins of Phoenixes / Interdiction of Merlin) and the unofficial sequel Significant Digits is a lot more well-written/less pretentious but HPMOR itself is a lot more controversial.
