Here's my ancient blogpost. I think some of the links might be dead now, though.

Edit: rereading my teenage rambles now, it seems like there are some obvious places that need polishing (also that's a comically angry blog post). But I think my main argument... Stands. Namely that if you accept the evidence as it is provided you can come up with a better model than "it's just recessive and squibs are all individually loss-of-function mutations".
