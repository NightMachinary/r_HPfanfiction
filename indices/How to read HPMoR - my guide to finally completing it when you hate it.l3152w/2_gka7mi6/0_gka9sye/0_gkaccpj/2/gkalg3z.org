I don't think that's a fair read of the book as a whole, though it is an obvious takeaway, especially if someone locked in their take from the first quarter of it. The dissecting magic turned out just to be an object lesson in how arrogant of a little twit Harry was and a series of little setups for later callbacks.

I am surprised you read the book if it was so clear that you didn't like the plot, characters, themes, or writing. Were you hoping there'd be some payoff?
