  Ron, an everyman, loyal, relatable character, Harry's moral compass, and objectively a well written and interesting character, is straight up rejected
#+end_quote

So what? This Ron is a different character than that Ron! This Ron is an ignoramus who's nobody's moral compass.

  97% of hpjev's reasoning is explicitly Aristotelian, sometimes with obvious jumps and gaps in logic, with zero experimentation or observation to support his hypotheses
#+end_quote

Exactly! That's the point of the story! Harry doesn't walk in with all the answers. He's wrong a lot, he makes stupid, thoughtless mistakes all the time. The story is about Harry learning how to /become/ a more rational person.

This is probably the most often misunderstood part of the story. I feel most people who don't like the story think Harry is a Mary Sue self-insert, which he is very very very much not.

Harry is not the teacher of rationality. He is the student.

  Furthermore, a lot of the scientific topics mentioned in HPMOR are explicitly wrong or misinterpreted, or exaggerated beyond all reason

Fair. I don't like that aspect either

  the final solution was complete and utter bullshit and had no way of working.
#+end_quote

I don't agree that it had no way of working, but I do think it was only a moderately strong solution. The author agrees, in an interview he said that he had better ideas by the time he got to the end, but he had already foreshadowed the solution pretty explicitly in the first couple sentences in the story, and he felt it was too late to make such major changes.
