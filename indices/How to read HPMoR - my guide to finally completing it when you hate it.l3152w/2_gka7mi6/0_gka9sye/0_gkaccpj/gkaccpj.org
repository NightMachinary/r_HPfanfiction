the story explicitly dismisses any character that does not match hpjev's intelligence. Ron, an everyman, loyal, relatable character, Harry's moral compass, and objectively a well written and interesting character, is straight up rejected, and is literally untouched besides one joke in the beginning and a few mentions during the army battles. Furthermore, despite the fic's pretense of "we will use the scientific method to dissect magic!" 97% of hpjev's reasoning is explicitly Aristotelian, sometimes with obvious jumps and gaps in logic, with zero experimentation or observation to support his hypotheses. In fact, there is literally NO practical observation or experimentation in the entire book besides one chapter. Furthermore, a lot of the scientific topics mentioned in HPMOR are explicitly wrong or misinterpreted, or exaggerated beyond all reason. Also, the final solution was complete and utter bullshit and had no way of working. The author also did not rigidly define the limitations of his interpretations of HP's magic system, which makes a lot of HPJEV's "clever solutions" feel like utter asspulling. The prose is also really fucking irritating to read.
