  It's also kind of disrespectful to the original work

I disagree. I think patching up the problems in her magic system and world building is a sign of /deep/ respect.

Sure, some characters are going to get made fun of. I can't understand why that offends people so much

  HPMOR is just much more interested in being a Rationality textbook of platonic dialogues with fights and weird ideas in it than it is interested in being a fanfic of a thing people liked, for the people who liked that thing. That is why so many people hate it.

Is that realy what people want? I like HPMOR /because/ it's different.
