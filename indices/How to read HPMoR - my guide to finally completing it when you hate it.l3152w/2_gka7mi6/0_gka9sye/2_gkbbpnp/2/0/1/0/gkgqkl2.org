I'm glad that you can enjoy it from that perspective.

I would be on board with that angle if, say, HPMOR centred trans voices or something. IIRC that's... not the case? Yudkowsky affirmed non-binary people in Inadequate Equilibria, so /as an author/ he seems to be a lot more open-minded than JKR herself is, but... I read fanfiction because I want fanfiction. HPMOR is a derivative work, but it's not... really fanfiction. And would deeply benefit from just having all the names and a handful of details changed and being an non-fan work instead.
