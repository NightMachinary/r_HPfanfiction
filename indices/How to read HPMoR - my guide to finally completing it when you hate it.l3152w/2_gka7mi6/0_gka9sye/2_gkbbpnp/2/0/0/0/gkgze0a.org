That seems to be the source of the disagreement, yes.

A fanwork, in my eyes, is a work of love wrt to a pre-existing work the creator/fanfic writer/etc is a fan of.

HPMOR is not... a work of love for HP. Period. And I think we agree on that. It doesn ot scratch the Harry Potter itch, because it is not /concerned/ with scratching that itch at all. It's doing something else.

I come to fanfiction /to scratch that itch/. Not to read someone... put names I recognize onto different characters and write their own personal manifesto. So my experience of reading HPMOR is an experience of profound disappointment.
