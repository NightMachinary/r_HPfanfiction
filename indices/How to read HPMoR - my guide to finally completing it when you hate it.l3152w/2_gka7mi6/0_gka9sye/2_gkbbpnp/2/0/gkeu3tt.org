Let's do a study of two rationalfics: HPMOR and Metropolitan Man.

HPMOR and Metropolitan Man both write characters differently than how they are, both involve very smart protagonists, both kind of don't-care about the source material.

But /Metropolitan Man/ is written /respectfully/. The treatment it gives kryptonite is written /by taking into account all of the evidence it can/ from the actual source material, not pulling shit out of its ass whenever it feels like it. Metropolitan Man's characters are all #Rationalist versions of themselves, but Superman is not given the HPMOR "Ron" treatment. Metropolitan Man is not written in such a way that it makes people feel stupid for /liking Superman in the first place/. Or, conversely, for getting interested in actual science and seeing the fanfic say stupid stuff about it.

Metropolitan Man is a good rationalist work /and/ a good fanfic. HPMOR is a good(ish) rationalist work and a /terrible fanfic/. It works an order of magnitude better as an original work than as a fanfic. And yes, most people /who want to read fanfics/ are looking for things that make for /good fanfics/, not good original works with a coat of paint of fandom on top.
