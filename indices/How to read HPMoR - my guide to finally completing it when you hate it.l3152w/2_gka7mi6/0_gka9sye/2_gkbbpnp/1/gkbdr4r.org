I don't really understand this 'disrespect' argument. Why does it matter what intention a story was written with? Just apply Death of the Author. Enjoy the story as an independent entity, forget about the author.

I don't disagree that HPMoR is an act of love towards rationality, wrapped in Harry Potter. But it's a nice enough wrapping. I'm content to read the wrapping and ignore the stuffing.
