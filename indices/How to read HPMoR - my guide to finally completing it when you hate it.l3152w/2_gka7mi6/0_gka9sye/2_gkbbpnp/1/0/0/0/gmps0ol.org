Here.

In retrospect, it's a surprisingly angry blog post, and I should have done more with questions about the distribution of these genes in the general population, etc. But even acknowledging those failures of my /teenage self/, it's a vastly better model than Yudkowsky's "well wizards are recessive and also /every single squib/ is a loss-of-function mutation".

And it's not a vastly better model because I'm "smarter" than Yudkowsky (I am /most certainly not/), but because I actually gave enough of a shit to... /try/ to cover all the cases and their implications. For example, if squibs are a loss of function mutation, literally every child they have will have /that/ loss of function mutation unless the same gene mutates back (astronomically unlikely), and therefore the wizard children of squibs make /less sense/ than the wizard children of muggles even though it's implied that most wizard children of muggles have a witch grandparent or great-grandparent somewhere, who then /necessarily/ had to have a squib child for people to think the rest of the family was muggle.

And that's like... Self-evident? Like it's not a hard deduction to make, it's just the direct consequence of "children inherit their mutant parents' genes"...

But now I'm getting worked up again, and nothing good can come out of that. I hope you enjoy my old blog post.
