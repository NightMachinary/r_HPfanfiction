Yeah, the story feels structured to seem to be meant to hold Harry as someone to aspire to being like, an example of rationalism, but then at the end we see clear evidence that Harry is a fucking fool.

It's a contradiction to have a story that seems to be trying to sell rationalism, but then the ending involves the only major character growth coming from an external source at gun point.

I spent a lot of time arguing about the stupidity of rationalism in the past, but on feedback and reflection I realized that I was actually arguing against the idiotic version in HPMOR.
