Eh, lots of authors put in stuff they don't know everything about, don't see how that makes a story bad. I can get angry that Prince of the Dark Kingdom had complete bullshit whenever Voldemort explains chess strategy to Harry. But I understand that you can't know everything to a deep enough level to avoid being wrong somewhere about something.

As for the AU problems, it seems you have a problems with a lot of AUs in general (which transform both the setting and the characters). Then it's not HPMoR's fault it falls within that.
