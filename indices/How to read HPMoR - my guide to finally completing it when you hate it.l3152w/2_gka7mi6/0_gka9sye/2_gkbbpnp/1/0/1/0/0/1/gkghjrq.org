It's not only in the advertisement, perhaps I used the word in a bit of a wishy washy way.

Harry spouts of this techno babble bullshit, which I can only assume are things the author has read one news article on, and the story treats it like he's genius. He's not.

This didn't bother me as much on my first attempt at reading it when I was ~16 and it was just technobabble to me, but now I'm halfway through a degree in Chemistry and able to understand some of the stuff, and it's just painful.
