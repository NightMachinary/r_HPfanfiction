Dude, the answer is "people had expectations and were disappointed".

/The story is disappointing/ because it doesn't measure up to the expectations.

And the story /sets up/ a lot of those expectations /in itself/. They're not expectations that come from following Yudkowsky's Less Wrong life, they come from reading the first few chapters and watching the buildup and knowing that /this is a work of fanfiction/ and knowing the original work.

The people who like it (like you) seem to be... Really /comfortable/ putting aside their own expectations. Awesome! Good for you!

Most people who read fanfiction are not like that, which is why so many people hate HPMOR.
