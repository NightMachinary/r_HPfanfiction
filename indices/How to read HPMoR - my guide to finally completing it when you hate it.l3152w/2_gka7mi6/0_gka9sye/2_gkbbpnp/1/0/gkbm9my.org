It's not that the author is disrespectful say, on his own time when he's saying stuff on Twitter. The /entire work/ feels inherently disrespectful because of how it /treats the source material./ For example, the entire analysis of the genetics of the thing /is complete bullshit/ and doesn't properly explain the observed data in the books. I know this because /I personally/ came up with a model of Harry Potter genetics that /does/ fit the data by creating a 3-gene system of epistasis and I ran it through my genetics professor when I was working on a personal project.

He just invented historical couples that had excessive amounts of children (despite wizards frequently having very very few children) in order to make the math easy, and gave Harry access to their number of children so that he could figure out it was a single Mendelian gene, because he felt like that kinda made sense, maybe.

That shows... He doesn't /care/. He didn't even fucking /try/. Great rationalist Eliezer Yudkowsky can't /bother/ to look up anything about genetics past Gregor Mendel in order to actually create a model that explains the data? Why am I reading this fic where he didn't even /try/? Use the /actual/ evidence you little--

Anyway.

It's not /about/ the author. Yudkowsky actually seems like a nice enough dude, certainly nicer now than when he wrote HPMOR. The /work/ betrays the disdain. The /work/ is disrespectful. That is why I struggle to enjoy /the work/.

What I just described is not a private opinion of the author. It's a /part/ of the work.

Yudkowsky could 100% agree with me on all points about /both works/ and it would not make me enjoy HPMOR more.

Replacing all of the Harry Potter specific terms with rough equivalents that are different enough that my brain is not constantly expecting Harry Potter and constantly being disappointed /would/ make me enjoy HPMOR more. I literally tried to make a filter to do that once, but I gave up halfway through the character names.

HPMOR as its own work would be fine. But I can't read those names and terms and so on and /not expect Harry Potter/. I told you, some people are immune to this problem. I am glad you are! /I am not./ If you write a story about Harry Potter, 16th century stable boy, and it's just an original story but it shares a bunch of the names /reading it will fuck with my brain/.

I don't want Harry Potter wrapping. I want Harry Potter. Maybe /different/ Harry Potter. Maybe /better/ Harry Potter. Maybe only partially Harry Potter! But... Not /wrapping/.

This...

  But it's a nice enough wrapping. I'm content to read the wrapping and ignore the stuffing.

Is... Confusing to me. Since the "stuffing" is /all of the good things in the fic/. If I ignore them, there's basically nothing I care about there. "Treat it as its own thing" is basically advice to /ignore the wrapping/ not ignore the stuffing.
