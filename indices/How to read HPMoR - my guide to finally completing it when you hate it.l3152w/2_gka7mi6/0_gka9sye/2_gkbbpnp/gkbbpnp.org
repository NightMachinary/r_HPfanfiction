I can explain.

I think HPMOR is /entertaining/ and /enjoyable/. ... As a work of original fiction. As its own thing, with its own priorities, in its own world.

But as other responses to your comment showed... It's also kind of disrespectful to the original work. And therefore it kind of... Insults readers who /actually liked the original work/. Which is /the vast majority of people reading a fanfic/ because of the nature of what fanfiction /is./

HPMOR is just much more interested in being a Rationality textbook of platonic dialogues with fights and weird ideas in it than it is interested in /being a fanfic of a thing people liked, for the people who liked that thing/. That is why so many people hate it.

The idea that "this Ron is a different character" or "this Harry is a different character" is fine as one thing. But... /Every/ character is a different character. Not a single character behaves "in-character". The magic doesn't work like that, the science doesn't work like that, the entire thing is more interested in its own ideas than in Harry Potter /or/ the real world.

I read a lot of crackfics. There's a /library AU/ GoT fanfic that ships Cersei Lannister with Stannis Baratheon in AO3 in which there's weird orgies off-screen for no reason. There's also a Loki/Tony slashfic in which they raise a small child together who is a weird murderous magic bird thing. I /read and enjoyed/ both of those!

But even those things are labours of /love for the source material/, in their own way. They come out of a place of... "More". And "Better". And "thank you".

HPMOR is a labour of love /for rationality/. For bayesian updating and simple deduction and so on. Not for the source material. It doesn't come from a place of "more" or "better", but... "instead", and maybe "above". There's a mild disdain in that story and people sometimes struggle to explain it (which is why they call Harry an arrogant git and so on) but it's definitely /there/. I have no reason to believe Yudkowsky picked Harry Potter as the source of his fanfic because he actually loved it, the way the authors of the two fanfics I described clearly loved the source material, even if they had strange ideas about it. He probably just sort-of liked it, thought it would be a good framework for his ideas, and then sat down to it.

That is why HPMOR pisses so many people off. It's not because "it's bad". Lots of things are bad. It's because people read fanfiction as an act of love, and HPMOR is /not/ an act of love for the source material. It's an act of love for the writer's personal perspectives on rational choice theory and so on, snuck into a space of love (fanfiction). And the moment you realize that, as a fan, can be aggressively disappointing and upsetting.

Some people are immune to this. I'm not. I would read an original Yudkowsky book (in fact, I have!) but I would /never/ read another fanfic of /anything/ I like by him. Because HPMOR is not a real fanfic. It's an original work with original characters and a radically reimagined magical society and population... Coated in Harry Potter terminology like a wolf in sheep's clothing. It's a lie. I do not enjoy being lied to.
