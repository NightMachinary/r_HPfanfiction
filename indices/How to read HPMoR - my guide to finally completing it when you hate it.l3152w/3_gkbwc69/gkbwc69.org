Why, exactly, should I make an effort to complete a story I found banal and entirely too caught up in its own 'brilliance', which doesn't really add anything I'd value to the fandom? It's not even like the author is particularly likeable or laudable, so I certainly don't 'owe' it to them. I don't expect people who don't enjoy my stories to read them anyway. Why should I have to do so for someone else?

I think I have better uses for my time.
