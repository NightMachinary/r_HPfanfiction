Your idea of what “respect to the source material” means includes intent of the author. Or at least your own notion of what “fanfic” is.

If you read the story as is, there's no disrespect. There's mild ribbing on the logical problems the source material has, but much harsher criticism of the ways other fanfic interacts with it.

At least that's my interpretation.
