So I think you are somewhat misusing death of the author to explain away what people feel while reading this story. Death of the Author simply means ignoring what the author intended the work to mean and simply reading the text to see what it means. If people read the text and still feel it is disrespectful to the source material, then the author's intent largely doesn't matter when it comes to how people like or dislike the fic. When I tried to read it I didn't know anything about the author and still held many of the same feelings about the fic. Somewhat related, if you are skipping parts that you don't like to make the fic more tolerable to read, you really aren't allowing the text to speak for itself either. Your choosing what the text is allowed to speak to you.
