Aha. Well whatever tickles your fancy ;) I wouldn't touch those stories for the life of me, but that's just my opinion. Have you tried talking with one of your friends first? Even though it is a fanfic it should also function a real story, and if they think something is amiss... There probably is. Good luck with it.
