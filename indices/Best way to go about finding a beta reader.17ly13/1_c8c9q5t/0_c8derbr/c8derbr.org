Thank you very much! This is really good advice. I'm not sure if what I have is worth putting up somewhere, and really I want a beta just to have another set of eyes on it (so that maybe it could be worthy one day). I will definitely ask some of my friends if it comes down to it, but not even my family knows that I write at all. Last resort maybe? Thanks again!
