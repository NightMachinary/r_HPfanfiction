I got my wonderful beta by putting in an author's note that I was looking for one, and someone wonderful who was enjoying Even Unto the Seventh Generation volunteered. I think it helped that the writing/grammar was already fairly clean, so the job looked enjoyable.

For Unthinkable Acts, I ask an in-real-life friend for advice.

For my one-shots, I try to edit as closely as possible, and when necessary I ask a family member (hubby for normal stuff, my mother--a social worker--when I need to know if I got a mental illness right).
