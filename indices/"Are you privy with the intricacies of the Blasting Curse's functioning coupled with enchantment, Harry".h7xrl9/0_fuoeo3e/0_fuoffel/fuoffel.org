I only thought about my prompt because Hermione was already able to enchant objects in her very first term at Hogwarts and she became (at the very least) proficient with a curse while still being a first year. I don't know why, but I just think paper is one of the easier things to enchant and since Hermione is able to enchant goblin-made Galleons, of all things, with the Protean Charm in fifth year then enchanting paper with an admittedly dangerous curse would be feasible for fourth year Hermione.

Also, what scenario were you imagining. I want to say the Locket's cave, but, if I remember correctly, it was a wall that vanished and not a door. I would appreciate it if you could enlighten me.
