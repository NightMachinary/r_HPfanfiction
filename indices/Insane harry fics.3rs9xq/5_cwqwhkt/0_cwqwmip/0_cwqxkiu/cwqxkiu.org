Great! That means I've got a bunch of other recs for you!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][Birth of a Nightmare Man]]: This one starts out as a cliched Azkaban fic with some bashing on the side. It changes pace pretty quick around chapter 6. It's the prequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11131988/1/Birth-of-a-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] which is also a pretty good Dark Lord Harry fic.

Next up we got [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7244255/1/One-Wizard-Too-Many][One Wizard too Many]] Where Harry finds out that he has effective legal immunity for the duration of the tournament. Oh, and Moony's a shady arms dealer. It's got a great scene where Harry becomes a dentist.

This one's not really Harry, but I still think it deserves a mention: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8706297/1/][Professor Riddle and the Quest of Tenure]], a fic that answers the question, What if Voldemort had been hired as a Defense Teacher. Watch as poor Tom struggles to balance his nightlife with his teaching position and to resist murdering his students.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/][Reunion]]: Luna, Susan, Hermione, and Harry are all time traveling revenge killing psychopaths.

This one is from the Worm fandom, and not the Potter one, but I thin it still fits what you're looking for just because I love this [[https://i.imgur.com/zwh2H.png][motherfucker]] so much. [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-be-a-queen-worm-fate-stay-night.339838/][To Be a Queen]]: it's a fic where Taylor gets Gilgamesh's powers and his wonderful wonderful personality.

Here's another from the Worm fandom, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/how-i-learned-to-stop-hating-and-love-the-bomb-that-is-nero-worm-au-historical-insert.342737/][How I Learned to Stop Hating and Love the Bomb That is Nero]]. Now I know that this is gonna sound weird, but the main character of this is a reincarnated (historical) Emperor Nero, with all his views on women, marriage, backstabbing and alcohol dumped into a high school girl's body.

This one's got Lord Voldemort as one of the main characters in a buddy cop relationship with Harry as they try to solve a series of disappearances in France. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9118123/1/To-Play-the-Devil][To Play the Devil]]

I'll probably add some more when I think of them.
