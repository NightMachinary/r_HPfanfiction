The fics linked in this thread are kinda meh in terms of insanity. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6764362/1/][Here's]] a fic where Harry gets sent to Arkham and tortured by the Scarecrow. It's actually pretty quality imo.

Also, clarification: Did you want psychopath type fics (read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/The-Snow-Queen][The Snow Queen]] if you want that) or actually insane fics like the one I linked?
