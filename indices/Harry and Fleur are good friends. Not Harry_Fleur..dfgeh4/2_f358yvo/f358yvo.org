I read one once where Harry was adopted by Fleur's family and I was like "alright maybe this won't be so bad!" then he started having sex with her because he had more than sisterly feelings for her but I kept reading anyway.

Then he had too much stamina and he was starting to hurt her so it turned into a harem fic and I couldn't continue reading it.
