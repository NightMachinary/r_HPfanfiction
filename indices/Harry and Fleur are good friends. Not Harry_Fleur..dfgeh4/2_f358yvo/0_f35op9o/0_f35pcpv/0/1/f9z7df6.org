I read about half of this a few years back, the runes thing was basucally entirely accidental. (Otherwise known as deus ex machina) basically, harry broke his arm and the first fracture just /happened/ to occur in the shape of a rune of luck. After that he got really /really/ lucky, and the rest of the fractures occurred in the shape of other useful runes as well.
