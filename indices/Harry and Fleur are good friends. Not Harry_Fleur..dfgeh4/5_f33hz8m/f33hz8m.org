Bungle in the jungle and it's sequel on ffn. It's more of Harry's friendship with Charlie and then later by extension Fleur starts becoming good friends with him as well. But Harry+Fleur friendship is not the core of the story. Still the best fanfic I've ever read and I read both it and it's sequel twice despite the epic lengths!
