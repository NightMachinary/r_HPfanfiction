My favourite idea for their relationship will ALWAYS be Fleur just sort of adopting Harry as her little brother. She gives him girl advice, sneers and throws hands with people who wanna mouth off at him and just is the emotional support he should have gotten from Dudley (who should have been his big brother if the Dursley's actually loved him).
