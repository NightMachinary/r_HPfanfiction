In Fayr Warning's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2287647/1/Reign-of-Power][Reign of Power]] Harry is Lord of Potter, Black, Gryffindor, Morrigan and Heir of Slytherin but it didn't bother me (although this stuff usually does) because in this fic, all those titles were actually used to further the plot, they were a major part of the story and not just used to make Harry rich and seem more important.
