[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning Of One]] Takes the "soul bond" cliche and turns it up to 11, and then makes it work really well.

Why I like it? Well, I'm a sucker for soul bond fics anyway, but will readily admit that there are about 3 that aren't kill-myself-bad. The writing is good, the characters are completely and totally reasonable, and there's original conflict in the story.

The characters are definitely the defining trait of this fic and its sequal. While I read through it, every character felt three dimensional, and every single one felt like they could reasonably switch with their cannon-selves and work well. Molly Weasley /felt/ like she did from the books. The author just has a knack for characterization.
