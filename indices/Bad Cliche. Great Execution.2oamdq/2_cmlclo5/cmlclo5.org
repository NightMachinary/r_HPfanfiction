Well, I've just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3022004/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Freak-Parade][Harry Potter and the Freak Parade]] and it has quite a few cliches inside... But it's so strange that it imho doesn't really matter because it's easy to read and not too long. One of these cliches even is an important plotpoint somehow... ;)

(On the other hand, the fic basically parodies the cliches in itself, so...)
