The best summaries I've read tell me what the story is about without any fluff. I don't care if the author thinks their summary sucks or if it's "the best EVER!!!" - I just want to know what the fic is about. Even stories I'm not interested in reading I mentally give the author kudos if their summary gets right to the point without interjecting their own opinion. With that said, if the story sounds interesting enough, I'll give it a go.
