I pick a country for origin, or at least a culture. Then I start filtering through words and names the best I can, VERBALLY testing them out. In my experience, names never work well if you can't pronounce them fluidly the first couple times. Last names I always go for something common, but still culture significant. Names that are family based (patronymic for example) are easier to do, similar for profession based names but never have a last name match their current occupation, it's too obvious. I'll give some examples, French first names: Louise, Manon, Bastien. Last names: [patronymic] “adds -elin” to fathers name- Pierrelin [occupation] “tailor” - Couture [common] “beautiful hill” - Beaumont

Basically, go for easy names that are shifted based on cultural or regional significance. Don't go overboard with it if your character is a child, and don't devote all your time to trying to explain it! I use this for all of my OC's when I can, and never reuse a name after it's been in one story. Hope this helps!
