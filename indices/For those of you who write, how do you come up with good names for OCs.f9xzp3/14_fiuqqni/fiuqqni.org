Thanks yall! I think I've narrowed it down to the following:

Athena (I'm leaning towards this one. Any nicknames yall can think of?CelineCeleste (I used to work with an awful woman named Celeste and I can't stop thinking about it. But I kinda like the name.)IrisZara

My character is smart, fairly athletic, and can be funny. I want her to have a somewhat feminine side that comes out sometimes.
