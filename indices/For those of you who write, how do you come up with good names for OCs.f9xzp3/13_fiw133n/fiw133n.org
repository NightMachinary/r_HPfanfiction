I love coming up with names for OCs. If the OC is from an established canon family I'll look to their canon relatives for inspiration. For example stars/constellations for members of the Black family, King Arthur legends for Weasleys or names that just “sound” good together for siblings. Draco wouldn't have a sister named Jessica but he might have a sister named Lyra or Carina.

Otherwise I use a mixture of Latin names, names from mythology, popular baby names in the UK during the time the character was born or random name generators. I will sparingly have them named after deceased family / friends when it comes to next gen (I have an OC named Colin Longbottom).
