Ah, fair. Well, there are plenty of us Brits on the subreddit who can help if you're looking for a UK place. :)

And also we're pretty bad at States ourselves, so it's only fair. :D

But if you're looking for an English girl, you'll get some different names than if she's Irish, Scottish, Welsh, or from wherever in Europe, was my point. You'll rarely find an English girl named Caoimhe, for instance, but that's a thing in Ireland. It's worth at least setting a country while you're picking a name.

You can also then look up appropriate terms in various languages to see what fits. Like, if she was Eastern European, you could call her Athena Aspratiba. The latter name being Latvian for wit, since you said she was funny. That kind of thing.
