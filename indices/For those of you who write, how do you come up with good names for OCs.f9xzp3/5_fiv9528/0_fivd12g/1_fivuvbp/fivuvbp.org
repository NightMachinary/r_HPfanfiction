Google maps - street view is a great way to go exploring in other countries even if you can't travel there to do research (wouldn't that be grand!).

I like to think of the familial background of my character... are they native to the area, or did their family immigrate (recently or generations ago?) and then research last names... either common ones or unusual ones. I think of characteristics and traits of my characters and then try to find suitable names by looking up name meanings.

I also look at popular names for the time and region the fiction takes place. For my Harry Potter fic, I really like thinking about how my characters are linked to the wixen world... what families they are related to... maybe they are siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. of Hogwarts students we've met briefly.
