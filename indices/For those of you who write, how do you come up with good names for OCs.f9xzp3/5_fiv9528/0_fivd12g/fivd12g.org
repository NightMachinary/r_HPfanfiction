No clue yet. I'm American so I need to research the UK. Anytime anyone talks about any particular place in the UK I have no idea what they're talking about. It's weird because I used to live in Europe, and have decent geographic knowledge about Italy and Spain but none about the countries that speak the same language that I do.

Literally no clue where anything is. Except Ireland and Scotland. I think Wales is on a coast...
