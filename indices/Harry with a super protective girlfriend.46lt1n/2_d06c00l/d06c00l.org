This is a Fem Harry/Raven pairing where both characters remain fairly within bow cannon says they should act. Very subtle slow romance that never frustrated me by advancing to quickly or to slowly (the scene outside the door is absolutely adorable). Also gonna say that despite first impressions, it's not a soul bond fic. I definitely recommend this one.
