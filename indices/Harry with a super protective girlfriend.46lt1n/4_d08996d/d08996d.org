I just read linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Quest for Merlin's Blessing), which coincidentally answers pretty well to this description. In fourth year Hermione, who is very sure she and Harry aren't meant to be together but feels very close to him platonically, tries to protect him with "Merlin's Blessing," a bit of very ancient magic she doesn't understand at all, and as a result nearly blows up spacetime.

What I like about it relative to a lot of H/Hr---especially the stuff written in the last three or four years---is that the author doesn't seem to be a hardcore H/Hr fan, and in fact has a lot of reservations about the ship: No romantic connection, tendency to get on each others' nerves, lots of anxieties on both side. So in writing their H/Hr story they set about---very gradually and in-character---addressing and working through all those problems. (No Ron-bashing, either.)
