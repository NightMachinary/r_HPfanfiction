linkffn(Remedial Lessons by SymphonySamurai), though it has some suboptimal decisions, IMO. (In particular, bad guys are made worse-than-canon, as if to make the protagonist's revenge more justified.)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen by TimeLoopedPowerGamer) (if he ever gets as far as actually 'shipping them).
