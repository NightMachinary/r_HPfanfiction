Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis)

Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider style action archeology. Let's hire a pirate, cause several international incidents, break into the Sultan's palace and steal a unique historical submarine from a muggle museum, but hey it's alright because we just found Atlantis and immediately wrecked the place!
