Ron is very OOC in that fic though and his bashing just goes way over the top. I honestly don't understand where the trope of chauvinistic/misogynist Ron comes from. Throughout the series, he's one of the very few who does not get intimidated by Hermione's intelligence, but actually welcomes it.

Hermione is also damn OOC in this one. I highly doubt a radical one like her would ever put up with the shit of that postwar Ministry. It's the same failed characterizations of her in those marriage law fics.

This fic also goes all out into 'give every Death Eater a second chance' Dumbledore trope. We just had a long thread two days ago denouncing the very same thing.

Both this fic and "The Sum of Their Parts" have quite similar premises in that Harry fights a still malicious postwar Ministry, but "The Sum" is much more superior:

- Characterizations. Not only does the Trio stay true to their canon characterizations, Neville, George, Susan, and Dean all have their bright moments.
- This Harry doesn't wait X years until the bad guys killed off his family. He strikes out only three months after the Battle of Hogwarts, when the Ministry finally worn down his patience with its malicious policies.
- The overall, slightly melancholic, tone of this fic is very compelling. Trio interactions are a really bright spot.
- The plot, the depictions of magic, and attention to details.
