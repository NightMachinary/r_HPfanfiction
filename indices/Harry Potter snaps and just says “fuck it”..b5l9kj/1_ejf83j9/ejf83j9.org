As several other commenters have already indicated, this genre usually leads to those garbage ”Harry going grey, refusing to go back to Privet Drive during the summer, demanding his Gringotts key back, and changing his name to Lord Hadrian” and “Harry goes on to be a 13 year old powerhouse politician with 18 wives and 24 titles” fics.

There are exceptions though, and protagonists don't always have to be Harry. For example:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8854828/1/A-Crime-Fitting-the-Punishment-or-Dumbledore-s-Monster][A Crime Fitting the Punishment or Dumbledore's Monster]], linkffn(8854828): Harry only snapped many years after the war when they murdered his family. But then he systematically massacred Wizarding Britain's establishment. Once done, he time travelled back to Year 5 and massacred his enemies again.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016): Both Hermione and Ron left Harry on the Horcrux Hunt. They were soon brutally murdered. Harry waged a lone campaign against Voldemort for several years until he freed Daphne Greengrass. This is one of the few H/D fics I like as is does not have that Ice Queen of Slytherin nonsense.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10755544/1/Bowling-For-Hogwarts][Bowling For Hogwarts]], linkffn(10755544): Neville couldn't take the bullying anymore and carried out a massacre at Hogwarts. The title is a tribute to Michael Moore's [[https://www.google.com/search?q=bowling+for+columbine&oq=bowling+for+&aqs=chrome.1.0l2j69i60j69i57j69i60l2.3671j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8][Bowling for Columbine]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): AU after Year 4. Umbridge directed her maliciousness at Muggleborn students instead of Harry. Hermione snapped and would become a very efficient killer.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Again, Harry had it enough after the war when the Ministry and Wizengamot turned out to be incorrigible. One of the most popular fics on this sub.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5265558/1/What-If-An-Alternative-to-Order-Of-The-Phoenix][What If? ... An Alternative to Order Of The Phoenix]], linkffn(5265558): Instead of acting out, he, Hermione, Sirius, and the Grangers all fled Magical Britain and left Dumbledore to deal with the mess. Dumbledore had to no choice but to step up his own game.
