It is personal headcanon based on Dumbledore's anti-statute past. He would have used his myriad positions to prevent the ICW from stepping in or marshaling forces because they would have been brutal in accomplishing what was needed, as would have been seen throughout history in places like sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere that probably wouldn't have adopted the statute willingly.

The way I see it, Yes the statute would need to be enforced as Voldemort and his forces moved to either kill or control the nonmagical population. The enforcement of the statute is the core of the ICW's purpose and the core behind the magical governments.

We also only see the story from Harry Perspective and he doesn't really get out much. There should be other people at that level elsewhere in the world unless Britian has something in the water. Futhermore, Grindelwald had the elder wand. I very much doubt Dumbeldore actually beat him in a duel. Far more likely is that he seduced Grindelwald and then stole the wand. The duel that followed is the one everyone knows or the duel was an illusion/fabrication Dumbledore created to cement is status after the war and hide the nature of the wand.

I agree it will be bloody, no they wouldn't necessarily know about the Horcruxes off the bat, though the return of a defeated Dark Lord is sure to set off some warning flags.
