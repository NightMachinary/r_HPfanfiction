Is it canon that Dumbledore was blocking them? Why would they need to enforce the statute? From what I remember it wasn't a huge disaster or anything, Britain was able to deal with it easily on their own. I could be mistaken though.

There's no indication that other nations do have comparable wizards. Nobody was able to stand up to Grindelwald other than Dumbledore, and Voldemort is constantly touted as one of the most powerful Dark Lords of all time. Not to mention that nobody else knows about his horcruxes - their existence, how many (or even that there's more than one), what and where they are. That would be more than a bit of a problem. Though I suppose Harry could send a letter or something if he leaves after he becomes aware of them.

Even if the ICW does decide to unite and step in, Britain still falls, and there's still a bloody war. It's just more likely to be Voldemort defending Britain instead of him attacking others.
