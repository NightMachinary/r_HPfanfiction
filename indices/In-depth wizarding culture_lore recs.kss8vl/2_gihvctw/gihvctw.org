I feel like I'm linking this fic every single thread, but what am I supposed to do, not link to one of the GOATs? Victoria Potter by this subreddit's very own Taure has a lot of that stuff in it. Lots of extra wizard culture stuff (while steering clear of the cliches you usually get with that) and lots of really great expansion of the magic system.

Also, BrilliantLady's Perfect Normal series does this a lot in the later entries. You'll have to get through the first (very short) fic to really get into it, but by the time you get to second year the wizarding culture expansion and exposition is everywhere. If you can make it though the first fic you're in for a real treat, one of the most emotionally nuanced fics I've ever read, and I think the world building is as good or better as that in some of the more well-known stories like Prince of Slytherin.

I guess since I mentioned it above, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man has tons of wizard culture and tons of new magic. It's a WBWL story whose goal is to start off extremely trope-y, but then develop into this rich and sprawling world where every character has realistic motivations and nobody is all good or all bad. In my opinion it accomplishes the goal very well. A WBWL story that makes you like the WBWL and Ron, and Harry is freaking unheard of, but it is amazing. The only complaint I see from people about it is that there are a lot of info dumps, but if you're looking for expanded culture and magic I think you'll enjoy the info dumps quite a lot. I know I did/do.
