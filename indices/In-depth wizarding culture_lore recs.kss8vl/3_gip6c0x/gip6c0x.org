The Pureblood Pretense expands the world a lot. There was never a war; instead, there were laws passed that officially make non-pure-bloods into second class citizens, banned from Hogwarts, from government positions, and from many types of employment. As a result, the story has a lot more about blood status arguments and pure-blood culture.

Also, advanced potion brewing (canon Harry hated potions, but this Harry lives for them), exploring mindscapes, making use of a Time Turner without going insane, "free" duelling that's still not intended to maim or kill but is otherwise no-holds-barred, and lots of tricky situations that nearly expose The Ruse. Because if anyone finds out that Harry is at Hogwarts, she's looking at life in Azkaban.
