  What if Voldemort made a mistake with his Horcruxes? What if he had truly been vanquished that fatefull night? What if the Dursley's didnt treat Harry like crap, but rather with casual indifference? Who would Harry become and what would his world look like? Read along with a seventh year Harry as he goes through his diary of Hogwarts and experience his best and worst moments! AU
