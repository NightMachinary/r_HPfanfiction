I would love to have tool for extracting information from reviews, but I don't think that plain word frequency can tell anything useful about story.

I have just sampled 30 reviews from random story - and 28 of them are either 'great story, plz continue' kind of reviews or inane ramblings about everything and nothing. So any useful information from the 2/30 meaningful reviews would be drowned in the statistics from the 28/30 dumb ones.

To summarize: I want some metrics which can cope with abundance of idiotic reviews.
