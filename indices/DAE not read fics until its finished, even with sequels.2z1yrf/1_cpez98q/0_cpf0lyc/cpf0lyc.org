That's not quite right. There are more great abandoned fics than great completed fics only because the proportions are skewed in the first place. Completed fics tend to be better overall, mostly because a writer than can actually finish his stories is often better at writing in general.

I'll counter your point with A Black Comedy, The Lie I've Lived, Wastelands of Time, Song of the Trees, etc.
