All the best fanfic is unfinished or abandoned; I'll take a quality abandoned fic over an "okay" completed fic any day.

I don't really think that any of the fanfiction "greats" are complete. There are some okay complete fics, but the really amazing fics--Forging the Sword, Ectomancer, Boy Who Lived, On His Way to Greatness, etc.--are all WIP or abandoned.
