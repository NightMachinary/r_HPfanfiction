I tell myself that I'm only going to read complete stories. Then, I find a fic that's 150k words, 31 chapters and figure that the author just didn't mark it complete, and I go on to find that it's unique with great characterization and all the rest. Then I read it, and in an author's note the author is talking about how their updates will be biweekly and should be consistent but it hasn't been updated since 2012. I'm not bitter or anything, it's not like that happened to me yesterday.
