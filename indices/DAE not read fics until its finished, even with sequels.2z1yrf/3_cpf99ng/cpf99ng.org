I do this. A few experiences reading a great story and following updates only for two years to pass without an update messed with me. I also don't want the heartbreak of getting really into a story and reaching where the author left off without any kind of closure. Even if it's a sequel, I'll try and peek at reviews or the author's bio to see if it was at least reaching an ending, so I can decide if it's worth it (that's what I did with Green Gecko's work).

I know I'll probably miss some great things, but honestly, it just isn't worth it to me. Nightmare of Futures Past actually updated a few weeks ago, which means it might actually end up finished eventually. Once it is, I'll gladly read it all. That goes for all WIPs. I don't want to read to where it's currently at, then get strung along. I respect the writers, but I'm not gonna pretend to be a patient person.
