  Hermione can do no wrong (or if she does, she is never punished for it)

That is literally canon. The one time where Hermione really drops the ball (the Malfoy situation), there are no consequences for her. But I also have no idea how to include something since I don't see Harry go "I told you so" at Dumbledore's funeral.

Marietta got off lightly for de facto selling the DA out to Voldemort by proxy of the woman who craved into the skin of teenagers for fun.

And the birds are irrelevant since they caused little damage, none of it lasting (so no legal consequences are possible) and ending the friendship between her and Ron, well if you want to go down that route it should have ended after year 3.
