I would argue that Voldemort being fucking stupid is canon. Seriously, his plan during OoTP is breathtakingly idiotic and convoluted.

You want to avoid detection, and acquire a prophecy orb that only two people (you being one of them) can handle. You have a way to sneak a dozen people into the room where its stored without detection.

Obviously the smart way to accomplish all this is to spend the better part of a year calling attention to the room in question, attack someone with a giant magic snake most of the country associates with you while leaving behind the victim in the MoM because reasons, then show up in the atrium of the people you're trying to avoid for a massive battle while screaming "Here I am Motherfuckers!".

Instead of just sneaking into the DoM using the same method you used for the DE, grabbing the orb, and going home to watch Skinemax or something. Maybe do a spell and an obliviate on the order guard so they think they fell asleep.
