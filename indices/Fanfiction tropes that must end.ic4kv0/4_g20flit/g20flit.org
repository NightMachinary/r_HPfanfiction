- "May your gold flow forever, Griphook"... and "may your enemies perish at your hands, Mr. Potter" (smirked toothly the Goblin)

- Lord Potter Black Peverell Slytherin Gryffindor Ravenclaw Le Fay Pendragon, etc.

- Dumbledore and Weasley bashing...

- Lily and James being child abusers because the other potter twin is The Boy Who Lived

- Vernon and Petunia being Satan and Beelzebub reincarnated rather than being just negligent and slightly abusive (I mean, Vernon sexually abusing Harry... Really? is it necessary?)

- Voldemort being fucking stupid

- Snape bashing without any reason

- Harry BeInG a FriEnD of tHe GobLiN NaTioN because "Lily and James" were the only ones that treated Goblins decently enough (or... Because Harry knows the proper way to greet them)

- Nicknames such as "pup, cub, prongslet, bumblemore, moldyshorts, bumblebore, goat sucker, puppy, 'mione, Mia, etc. "

- Harry having a harem including NARCISSA, BELLATRIX and even MCGONAGALL sometimes... I mean, wtf

- To refer Harry, Hermione and Ron as 'the golden trio'

And these are just a few...
