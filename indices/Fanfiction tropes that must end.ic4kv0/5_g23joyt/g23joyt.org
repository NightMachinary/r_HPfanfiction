I dislike molly Weasley bashing because in that is completely wrong. It is canon that molly loved and cared about harry. I mean come on in Order of Phoenix book, when molly confronts a boggart she sees her children and harry dead. I can guess why most bashing fics include her as she is seen as diehard Dumbledore supporter and tries to make harry and his friends ignorant of war but which person would want their kid to be part of war and be killed. Many people don't like the way she treated Sirius but most made some sense. Sirius Black was very lonely and was not in good frame of mind because he had to be alone in the place which he hated the most and he had not healed mentally from his stay at Azkaban. He understood what Harry's anger at being ignorant and tried to alleviate it by telling him everything and Molly didn't like it very much as this the thing that Molly is against as she wants her children, Harry and Hermione to grow up without burden of doing the stuff which was clearly job of their elders not of teenage children.
