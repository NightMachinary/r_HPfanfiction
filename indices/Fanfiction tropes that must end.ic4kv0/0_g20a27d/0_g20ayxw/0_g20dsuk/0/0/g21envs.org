  Ginny is even shown in the Books to have changed

And then HBP/DH came along and she changed back again. Although to be fair, there isn't a single character which comes out of these books looking better than before. Malfoy went from racist bully to war criminal, Ron and Hermione are suddenly very naive when it comes to Malfoy and cause a lot of damage that way, Tonks goes from funny side character to breeding cow for Harry's orphan godson, Lupin looks even worse after running away from his pregnant wife, Snape's motivation make him look like a whimp (and it surely isn't love), Dumbledore suddenly played with magical fascism in his youth.

  If James can mature, why not Ron?

Arguably, we never see James do anything where he deserts his friends. He is a dick to Snape and a bit of a prat, but he never deserted anyone and he had enough common sense to save his nemesis from his own stupidity.

That is not to say that Ron can't mature, but I certainly see where the authors who end his friendship with Harry come from.
