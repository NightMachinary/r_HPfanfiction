I can't for the life of me remember the exact name, but it's something like 'Lessons from the Streets' or 'Learning on the run'. Essentially, Harry grows up on the street and Draco eventually joins him - the former running from the Dursleys and the latter running from the Death Eaters. It's a semi-decent growth into the relationship and there is a little bit of both Harry and Draco coming to terms with being gay, though it covers less than a chapter, IIRC. "Oh no, I'm gay. Well, at least he's hot." sort of rapid-turnover of panic.

It's not the best fit, but it's the closest I have, sorry.
