I don't object to the general idea of Animagus!Harry, but I do dislike the idea of his form being a stunning magical creature like a dragon, or him having multiple forms. It reeks too much of unnecessarily powerful and the author's desire to show how ~super speshul~ he is. It should be a mundane animal that reflects the personality of Harry as written in the fic. Also, I tend to feel disdainful of him as a snake Animagus. It feels too much like the easy option chosen just because he's a Parselmouth.
