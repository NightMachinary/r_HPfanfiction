It depends. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Canon indicates that the ability is very rare and takes a powerful witch or wizard to accomplish, which makes sense. However, I also find it problematic that people like Peter and Rita were animagi. They don't seem particularly powerful to me.

I definitely understand the dislike for magical beast animagi, as it also seems to go against canon/logic. With the exception of two stories, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem With Purity]] by Phoenix.Writing and The Phoenix Trilogy by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1760628/grangerous][grangerous]], I tend to agree.
