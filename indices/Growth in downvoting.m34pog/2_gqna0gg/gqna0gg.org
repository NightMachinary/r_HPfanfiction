I find that the fan bases tend to be more downvoted than other subs. Sometimes I really need to take a step back because it's sad to see people being downvoted just because they asked a question (usually the question is fairly innocent, sometimes it's badly phrased, an unpopular opinion, or just been asked about every other week) or similar. It just seems really petty.

I tend to reserve my downvotes for those who are assholes, who have absolutely no tact and don't know when to drop a subject. It's pretty rare that I give more than 5 downvotes a week unless I'm in a certain sub and seen a certain troll deliberately baiting others with their viewpoints.
