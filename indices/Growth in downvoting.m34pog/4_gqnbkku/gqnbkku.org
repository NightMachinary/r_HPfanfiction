Downvoting is supposed to be used in situations where a comment adds nothing relevant to the discussion. Instead, people use the downvote button as a "dislike" button. Misusing the downvote button is a trend in all of reddit (although there are some subs that skew very nice in general). It happens because some people think the button is meant to be a dislike button.
