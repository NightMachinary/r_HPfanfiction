Not really... downvoting is kind of used for both... though it is most common that disagreement will be reflected by "not upvoting" instead of just downright downvoting. I guess is kind of like trying to have the opinion that you agree with the most be the one with the most upvotes, like a sort of democratic rating of every opinion sort of thing. It's just the way it is, in this post and all around reddit and all around the internet wherever voting exists.
