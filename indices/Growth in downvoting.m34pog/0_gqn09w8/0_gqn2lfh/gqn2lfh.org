I see.... I hate it though because enough downvotes and the comments are hidden so then the whole post can become one where there is only agreement shown like an echo chamber. I often upvote posts I actually disagree with because I think the expressed view is interesting even though I have reservations. I upvoted the anti-maths post for example, mainly because I felt sorry for the poster but also because they made a point that I thought was reasonable - even though overall I support maths
