I have a Google spreadsheet! Different sheets for different fandoms. I save title, author, pairing (if applicable), and url. I only save the ones I really liked. I use FFnet's "favorite" option as "read," so I know if I've read a fic before - hard to remember when you've been reading them for 16 years!
