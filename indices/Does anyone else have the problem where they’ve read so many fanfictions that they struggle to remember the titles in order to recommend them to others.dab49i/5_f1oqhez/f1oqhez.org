I have been reading fanfiction for about eight years. In the beginning there were a lot of stories that I haven't bookmarked or which got taken down. Currently, for Harry Potter, I have 1371 bookmarks (granted, 961 are Crossovers). To make a long story short short, yes. I have a lot of plot elements in my head, but I don't always know where they are from.
