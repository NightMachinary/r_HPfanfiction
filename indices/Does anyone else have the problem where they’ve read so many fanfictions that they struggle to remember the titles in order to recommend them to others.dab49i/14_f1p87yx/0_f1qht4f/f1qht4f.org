I did that originally! I'm sure I still have some on my old barely working laptop! Then ebook converters came along and ao3 with its wonderful download button! Now I download any long fics I want to read as ebooks onto my tablet. I know of at least one that's been taken down that I have a copy of so it's definitely helpful.
