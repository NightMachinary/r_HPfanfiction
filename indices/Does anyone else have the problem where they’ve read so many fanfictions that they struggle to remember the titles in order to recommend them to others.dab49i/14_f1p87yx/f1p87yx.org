I used to save them to my computer as docs. I would copy and paste every chapter by chapter until I found the book original fanfiction downloader.

I would still save fanfics if I had a stable computer. Sometimes I'm able to give out copies of long deleted fanfictions or just read something actually new (because I would save any fanfic that even sounded interesting).
