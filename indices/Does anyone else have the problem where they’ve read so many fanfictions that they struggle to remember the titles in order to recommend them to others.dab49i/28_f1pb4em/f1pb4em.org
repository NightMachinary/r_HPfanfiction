NGL I never knew the titles in the first place. Also, once upon a time, some blessed soul had a livejournal account where she sorted through thousands of fics (she also had one for either naruto or bleach). Pairings and themes with a brief summary.

I haven't the faintest clue what that site is (bookmarked on an old laptop that no longer works) and my best attempts have come up with nothing. :(
