I am really bad at titles, but remember nearly all of the fics I've read. Whenever someone asks for something specific in my area of interest (SS-centric, bonus points for LESS where I've probably read more or less everything FFN and Ao3 has on it), I usually know enough to be able to track the fic down with a bit of searching.

I do remember the titles of the fics I like the most, and a few others that stand out, but generally have to rely on fic search to re-find things.

It doesn't always work, especially in areas of fanfiction I have little to no interest in generally. For example, a few days ago I was feeling up for some Dramione for whatever reason and wanted to read a fluff fic I've seen recommended here various times before. I know it had something to do with a Yule Ball bet of Malfoy being able to convince Granger to take him to it. After various searches in Google and FFN filters, I was ultimately unsuccessful. I ended up reading something else instead (some story of her faking being a girlfriend for 4 months for reasons). Worked well enough to sate my curiousity over the pairing.

(The reason I didn't simply just /ask/ for the fic in this subreddit is that Order/DE is usually frowned upon and I didn't expect positive responses and by the time I would have gotten any, my curiousity would probably have dimmed anyway)
