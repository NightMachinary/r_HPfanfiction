Definitely, but I make sure to make different folders for my fanfiction bookmarks. I divide them by the fanfiction (like HP) that's updating and that has been completed and then various subjects (like time travel, post-war, etc..) and then by pairing. It's a little excessive at first, but I've realized that it's the best way to compartmentalize once you've read them especially as they keep growing by the day. I'd be completely lost when wanting to recommend fanfictions to others as well as wanting to reread them. But I just started this around a year ago, so the ones I read before them - unless they were incredibly memorable or I came across them again - are a little hard to recommend.
