I've been reading fanfics for the last 12 years now. Have discarded just as many as I've written (none of them were ever put up online cause I hate discontinued fics). But I normally classify it in my head based on the pairing. Generally, even though u don't remember the title, you still remember the scenes and maybe a dialogue or two. Whenever someone want a a recommendation type whatever you remember into the search bar and google takes care of the rest.
