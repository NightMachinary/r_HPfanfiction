Always.

I have a word document where I list everything I read and its link, but I noticed that it doesn't really help.\\
"Wonder which fic was it that Harry was in Hufflepuff and Professor Sprout noticed his home life isn't good..."

I started another word document with "recs" where I list any good fic I've read recently so I might end up being able to recommend them with more efficiency.
