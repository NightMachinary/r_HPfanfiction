Or you can look around for a post that asks for Hufflepuff Harry that was around a week or two weeks ago on either this or harrypotterfanfiction Reddit and had someone to recommend it. It's the reason I described the situation in the way I did. I would have recommended this fic if I remembered the title. But I still don't remember.

I read the fic in fanfiction.net.
