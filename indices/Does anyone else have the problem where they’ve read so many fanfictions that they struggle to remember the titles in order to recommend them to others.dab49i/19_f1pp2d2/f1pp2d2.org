I started getting really hardcore into reading fanfic back in 2015 (5.5.15 to be exact I started reading the sacrifices arc and finished all 3 million words in 25 days. I didnt sleep much).

Anyway I started reading tons after that.

By August I realised like... I've already read this one. I dont want repeats!

So I created a word document. It included link date i read POV fandom etc etc. And a small summary.

By the time I got to the 330s I realized a word doc wasnt good enough.

I made an excel spreadsheet.

I'm currently at like 1290 fics or something like that.

I dont forget anymore and I have keywords in a certain section so it's easy to look up recommendations ^{^} (like time travel dimension hopping fem!character adoption people living. Like the tags on AO3 lol but in my spreadsheet).
