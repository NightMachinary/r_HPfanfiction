Yeah, I typically use follow for things being updated or that I'm interested in but haven't started reading yet. Favorites are for things I want to read again (so, not always high-quality)/thought were really good. If something's a WIP and I favorite it, I still put it in my follows until it's complete. I have maybe 30 or so in each category, with some overlap.
