That's a lot of favorites, no wonder you have a hard time finding them again to recommend. I only favorite fics if I liked them enough to reread or if I think they are really good so I only have about 130 across 10 fandoms on ffn and maybe 60 more on ao3. Not having too many favorites makes it easy to find the best fics again.
