My interpretation of the whole thing is that hunk of soul has none of the rituals/spells/etc a horcrux is supposed to have, so it has no protections.

What does this mean? A simple Accio could remove it. Or Harry had no need to sacrifice himself to remove it, as Tom dying without any /real/ horcruxes left could cause it to fade.
