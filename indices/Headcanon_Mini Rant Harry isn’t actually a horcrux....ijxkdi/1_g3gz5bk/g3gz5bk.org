I believe Harry is a Horcruxe. According to canon, a Horcruxe is a fragment of a Wizard's soul that is put into another receptacle in order to maintain him into the physical realm after his passing. If Harry has a fragment of Voldemort's soul on his forehead (which would explain the Parseltongue and the connection), then Harry is a Horcruxe, even if he is an irregular one.

When making an Horcruxe, the 2 main difficulties seem to be the tearing of the soul, and the creation of a suitable receptacle for it. But both of these conditions don't really apply to Harry:

- When Voldemort attacked the Potter, he already split his soul into 6 parts (the main one plus 5 Horcruxes). Such a thing was unthinkable for the wizards before him, and it not impossible that tearing it so much made the soul instable (which would explain why it split when he died).\\
  There is also a theory (that I likes a lot) saying that Voldemort planned to use Harry's death for his final Horcruxe. If it was the case, the necessary rituals would have been done beforehand, and the soul would have been ready to split.
- Concerning the receptacle, there are actually not necessary to create a "suitable one". Contrary to a "normal" soul, a Horcruxe need its receptacle to exist, and destroying the item holding the soul would also kill the soul fragment, so it's common sense to create a "durable" receptacle to put the soul. But nothing forbid an idiot to put his soul into whatever he has on hand, the item would be as durable as he was before (a diary could be teared up, bunrt or just put into water), but it would still contain the soul fragment.\\
  Despite being a Horcruxe, Harry is a pretty normal human, he can be hurt, ill and is submitted to his own mortality. But it doesn't mean he can't be an Horcruxe.

Anyways, my point is that, if Harry has a fragment of Voldemort's soul in him, then he is a Horcruxe. That's litteraly the only condition needed to make a Horcruxe.
