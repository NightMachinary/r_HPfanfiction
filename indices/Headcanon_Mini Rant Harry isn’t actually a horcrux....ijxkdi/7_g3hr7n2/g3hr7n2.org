JKR already came out with the cannonical statement that horcrux must be created intentionally. He is a container for a piece of soul but he is not a horcrux. There is no definitive proof what would've happened if moldyshorts died while Harry still had the soul piece inside him.\\

As for all this Ritual discussion, you guys are DEFINITIVELY in fandom territory. There is no preparation of the body or object, crazy complex rituals that have to be done before or after. You simply murder, split your soul and place it into an object with a spell, then cast protective spells on said object if you so choose. Rituals are hardly even mentioned in cannon and are almost entirely a fanon field of magic.

Attempting to kill Harry and thus causing his main soul to spontaneously break off an extra piece which latched onto Harry was unintentional and further weakened his main soul.

Voldemort intended to use Harry's death to create a 6th Horcrux. 6 plus his main soul gives him 7 total pieces which is magically the most powerful number. He never realized a piece resided in Harry thus when he made his 6th his soul was actually in 8 parts at that point. Still only 6 horcrux but 8 pieces.
