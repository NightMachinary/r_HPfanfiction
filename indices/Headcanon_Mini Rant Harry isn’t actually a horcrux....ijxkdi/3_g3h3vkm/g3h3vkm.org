I'm with you. There's no way that Voldemort's soul should be able to latch onto Harry after Lily's sacrifice had just obliterated his body. Quirrel showed quite well what the protection issues capable of.

And given that, as you pointed out, Harry was never made a Horcrux, whatever Voldemort left behind should be easily removable with a scalpel since it was never magically protected.
