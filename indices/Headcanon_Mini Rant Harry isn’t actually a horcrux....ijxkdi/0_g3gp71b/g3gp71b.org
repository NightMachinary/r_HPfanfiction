Since we're on headcanons like this, here's mine:

Voldemort didn't give Harry his scar. /Lily/ did, before Voldemort attacked the cottage. The killing curse doesn't normally leave marks or have any connection to lightning, but for some reason it left a lightning bolt shaped scar? Weird. However, that simplified "lightning bolt" also looks like the Futhark rune, Sowilo. In the actual poems, Sowilo is associated with the sun and destruction of ice, and commonly gets assigned protective meanings, including against death. I can't recall if it was explicitly stated that Lily studied Ancient Runes in Hogwarts, but it wouldn't be a stretch to guess that she did. Carving runes into the flesh of children is a little too dark for Dumbledore, though (if he even knew), so the official story was that Voldemort caused the scar (the Nazis coopting the symbol wouldn't help the PR aspect, either). "Marked as his equal?" That came later, during the resurrection ritual.

Anyway, protective rune, powered by "a mother's love/sacrifice," carved directly into the flesh, as a desperate effort to save the child from certain death? Makes a lot of sense to me...
