I agree with the scar being a Sowilo rune, but disagree with Lily doing any deliberate magic on Harry: The reason her sacrifice had an effect that nobody else's did was because Voldemort genuinely intended to let her live. If somebody's about to be murdered anyway, possibly after rape/torture, sacrificing their life in an act of desperation to shield their child wouldn't have the same mystical weight as the sacrifice of someone who could live for centuries if they just step aside and move to Canada.
