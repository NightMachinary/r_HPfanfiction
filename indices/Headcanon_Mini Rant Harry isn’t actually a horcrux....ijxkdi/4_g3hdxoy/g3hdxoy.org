I understand the point and always believed that it made a lot of sense than you needed to prepare the recipient. Otherwise, how would the soul fragment latch onto the object? Why would it stay there? I mean, when people die their souls leave their bodies (in this universe. There was never any mention of reincarnation or anything similar.. You die, your soul "goes on".. Or that's what I got from the books) . If souls attach themselves to whatever object was nearby, wouldn't there be random souls in random objects? How would you direct it to the particular object you want as a horcrux?

Souls aren't supposed to exist in objects, so a certain type of magic would be needed to make them stay there. A preparation or some kind of spell/ritual to stick it there forever.

On the other hand, it is possible that a soul piece would try to unite with the whole as it is not meant to be separated. Maybe, after the course rebounded, it tried to piece itself back, but Voldemort's spirit was already gone so it tried the next living thing. Alive humans are normal recipient for a soul, so into Harry it went. But again, souls don't attach themselves to new humans when their original recipient dies... Wouldn't it make more sense to try and join the other pieces? Or maybe simply leave this world and go wherever they are supposed to go after their recipient dies? If soul pieces can't "go on" on their own, then what happened to the other horcruxes after they were destroyed?

So, in the end, I believe Harry should not be a horcrux, nor any sort of tie for voldy to stay alive. JK Rowling doesn't though.. And as it is her world, Harry was a tether to voldy and the baddie couldn't die as long as Harry lived. Maybe part souls do attach themselves to humans nearby and being alone is part of the ritual of making horcruxes. ðŸ¤·ðŸ¤·
