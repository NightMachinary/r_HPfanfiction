Not exactly what you're looking for but in the story Can't Have It Both Ways by RobSt. Harry gets 4 broom manufacturers (Nimbus, Golden Arrow, Firebolt, and Vitesse) to each sponsor a house for a junior team. Then each Champion would coach the team. So they first drew the name of a champion, the house, and then the Broom company. And repeated until all 4 had been selected.
