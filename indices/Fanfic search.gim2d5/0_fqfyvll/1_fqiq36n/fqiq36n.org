Found this on TV Tropes

  On May 13, 2019 the story disappeared from FanFiction.net, with the author clarifying on his website that this was due to an accusation of copyright infringement involving song lyrics, though it is still available at other locations and he is appealing to the site directors to undo their decision.

I find it weird that would happen. I'd think using lyrics as part of the story would qualify as fair use.
