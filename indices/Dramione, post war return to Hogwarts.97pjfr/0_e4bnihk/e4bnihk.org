Here are some great WIPs: linkffn(9366635) linkffn(12927571) linkffn(11894165) And here are some well-known completed fics: linkffn(7676352) linkffn(11439594) linkffn(8739374) Unfortunately the rewrite hasn't been updated in a few years but here's the actual summary: Hermione has found herself alone and friendless after the war, desperately attempting to combat her residual pain and terror as she returns to Hogwarts to complete her seventh year. The world is not what she had always thought it to be. Amidst confusion and loss, she finds herself on a quest for Truth, Joy, and Love. A Hermione-centric story linkffn(3790150) Has several sequels linkffn(12068182) linkffn(4104460)

Hope that holds you for awhile :)
