The problem with stories with this plot line, from what I can tell, is that most fall into one (or two) of three very predictable groups. None of them really focus on the Harry/Lily relationship.

There's the Harry goes back (often deaged) and inserts himself in the Marauders (typically knowing a bit too much and trying to save everyone, e.g., he helps James figure out the proper way to behave to get Lily.) Examples include /Harry Potter and the Phoenix Burning/ linkffn(6820445); /A New Life/ linkffn(4345742) [note, HP/SB slash]

The second type is the Harry goes back and sees the softer side of Slytherin-type, which usually seem to involve a pairing with Snape and cast the Marauders (not really unfairly) as antagonists. Lily will typically be torn between the two sides, e.g. /Gray Skye Mourning/ linkffn(8315797)

The third type usually has Harry going back (usually a little older) and hooking up with someone like Bellatrix (Lily is thus usually a first or second year), e.g. /Delenda Est/ linkffn(5511855).

Some mix types. For example, /Stepping Back/ linkffn(12317784) mixes type 1 and type 3 (and there's a fair bit of Lily in it, if I recall correctly), while /A New Life/ combines type 1 and 2.

Just about all of these (though I really like /Delenda Est)/ aren't terribly deep. They are usually really predictable and don't feature complex characters, especially when it comes to Lily and the Marauders.

I'd actually second the rec of /The Second String/ (and I've rec'd it a few times for other reasons)/./ I'm really starting to like it because it doesn't fit into any of these types and I honestly don't know what's going to happen. Lily at this point is a supporting character at best, but she's starting to show up more in the last few chapters. I can see some being turned off by the initial characterizations of Lily, James, Dumbledore, etc., but the author seems to be taking care to show how characters develop and how Harry's initial impressions might not be fair.
