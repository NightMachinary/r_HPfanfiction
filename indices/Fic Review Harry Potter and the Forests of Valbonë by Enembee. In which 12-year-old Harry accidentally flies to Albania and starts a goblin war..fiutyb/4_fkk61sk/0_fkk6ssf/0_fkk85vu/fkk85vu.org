Firstly Valbona is in the north of Albania, they have strong accents and are more Mislim than where iam from (the south).

However most of the mythology originates from the south, meaning the Zana should be fucking south.

All of Albania have little traditions which are very similar to Turkish ones.

And we have a two headed eagle. It's in our flag dammit.

Also I cant remeber what chapter it was in but I'm pretty sure it mentions something about our flag, which was put up near VlorÃ« (where I'm from) in a farm called Kanine (where my mum is from).

Yes I'm nitpicking, but my older sister was one of its earliest readers and asked Enembee if they need help with Albanian culture an they said no.
