it's such a shame nobody explores albania more seriously in this fandom, esp given how important it is to the story (I blame Rowling but oh well). I could see riddle's experiences there having an emormous impact on his politics but even stories which take that side of things more seriously generally ignore the amount of time he spent there

e: also even from someone with relatively little knowledge of your country I can see the potential in connecting albanian isolationist policy w the statute of secrecy. (and philosophies of revolutionary politics in general)
