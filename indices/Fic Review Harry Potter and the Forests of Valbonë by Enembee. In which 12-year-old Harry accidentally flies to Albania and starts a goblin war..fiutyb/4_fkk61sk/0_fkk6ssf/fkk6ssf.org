I'm really glad to hear from you. I know very little about Albania at all, so one major aspect of the fic which I didn't feel qualified to comment on was the cultural context of the story. I don't know how well Enembee understood Albanian landscapes, culture or mythology. I know he must have done some basic background reading to have referenced the Zana and the shtojzovalle, but to what degree any of it was done accurately I couldn't say. I'd love to hear more from you about that.
