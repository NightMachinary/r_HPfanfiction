The story is /fucking wild/. I love stories like this, they're a breath of fresh air from the constant canon rehashes or lordship fics, but my issue with this one was that it was so fucking loooong. He spends 20 chapters in a forest and does things which would have comfortably fit into five or six, and been much more readable.

I've ever only read one story with a similar energy, and it was about the Dementors of Azkaban basically blackmailing Harry via mail to get them all the Horcruxes. In the end, they all hang on to a dragon that flies them into Albania and they're never seen again.
