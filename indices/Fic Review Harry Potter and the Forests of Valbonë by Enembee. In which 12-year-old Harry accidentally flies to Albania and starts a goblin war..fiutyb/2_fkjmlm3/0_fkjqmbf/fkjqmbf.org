I guess the arc you enjoy more can depend a lot on the type of story you signed up to read, because they are totally different. The overall plot in the second arc I can agree is weak, but it's virtually non-existent in the first arc, even if arc 1 has other strengths. So oranges and apples I guess?

I don't know what Realignment is, but I'd be fascinated to read someone else's HP fanfiction reviews, as I haven't seen them anywhere else. You should do it!
