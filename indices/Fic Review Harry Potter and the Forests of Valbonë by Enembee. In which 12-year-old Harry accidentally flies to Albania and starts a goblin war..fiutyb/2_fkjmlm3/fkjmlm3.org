Interesting. I actually found what you call arc 1 to be the better part of the story. Though it has been a while, I agree with your point about suspension of disbelief. You did have to forget it was a 12 year old. In fact, as I read this story I actually thought at many points that this was a 15 or 16 year old Harry. I did like, as you said, the depiction of Harry's improvement. Though I wasn't a huge fan of the magical system employed within the story, I did see it as working. I'd give the training scenes a 7/10.

I found the plot itself to be the weakest point. Though again it's been a while, it was a drag for me to read through it. While I didn't have an issue with the violence as I have largely given up on considering character ages, the plot felt contrived and the scenes against the antagonist or antagonists felt off to me.

These reviews are always nice to read through, though I suspect I'd enjoy them less if we had differing opinions. In fact, I'm almost inspired to write my own on the holy grail of fics, Realignment.
