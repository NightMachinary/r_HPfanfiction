Was going back through old comments and saw this response - I can't think of many instances where the hero loses a hand beyond Star Wars and WoT, but it's honestly been a while since I've read new Fantasy/Sci-Fi. I wonder if it can be traced back to something far older, from traditional myths and legends?
