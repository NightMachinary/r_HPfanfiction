I liked Arc 1 better, it was more impressionistic writing and I think stronger in terms of combining plot and overall focus: more emotionally effective and also more literary. It's been a while but I remember the lynx scene was particularly moving.

The second arc just goes crazy and I actually really liked how much it contrasted with the forest section, the pace was absolutely unbelievable and he manages to pull it off really well. But it's very episodic and some of the transitions don't really make sense.

I agree it was dark, but given NMB is one of the DLP big wigs it felt really emblematic of and close to the DLP style. It feels postmodern in a way that I haven't really seen in any other fic, and of course the quality of writing and storytelling is very high. Addressing OP's concerns I think part of the point is to write a dark, gripping fic in such a cartoonish and comical style. As expected from a DLPer though, Harry never really goes super out of character except for his rage scenes, and character development out of the original character is something I wish authors in general would be a little more flexible toward.

I'm a big WoT fan and don't remember seeing a WoT reference anywhere in this fic, it's been about two years so I could be forgetting. But overall one of my favorite fics, definitely in my top 5.
