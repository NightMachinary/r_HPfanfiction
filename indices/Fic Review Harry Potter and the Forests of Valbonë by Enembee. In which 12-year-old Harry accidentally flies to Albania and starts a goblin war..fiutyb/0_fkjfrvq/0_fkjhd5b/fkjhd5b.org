I found arc 1 weaker in terms of plot and structure. The training montage was well written but didn't really feel like it was going somewhere, whereas the second arc had trajectory.

In terms of writing style, yes arc 1 was probably a more aesthetically pleasing read, and it does handle survival and development well.

Sadly no, I have yet to take on the beast that is The Wheel of Time, but given the author's inspiration from the Hero's Journey and the many articles about how heavily Star Wars drew from it, I think Star Wars is a very likely inspiration for the scene you're talking about.
