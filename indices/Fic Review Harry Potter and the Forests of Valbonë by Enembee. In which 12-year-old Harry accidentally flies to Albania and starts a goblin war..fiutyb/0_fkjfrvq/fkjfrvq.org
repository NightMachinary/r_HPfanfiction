It's interesting you found Arc 1 to be the weaker of the two - I thought everything after the escape from the forest felt slapped together and hasty in comparison to the earlier parts and overall found it less interesting. It may be that I was introduced to the fic as an good example of magical theory world-building, which is far more prevalent in the first arc than the second. It's also one of the few stories in the fandom that does magical survival right, so it'll always have a soft spot in my heart for that if nothing else.

On a side-note, have you read the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan? I've never been able to tell whether a specific event in the tower was an homage to that series or Star Wars.
