Grawp. My God, for me Grawp is the dumbest thing in those books, hands down. He adds absolutely nothing of value for me to the story and Hagrid's horribly long winded story about bringing Grawp back is awful. I skip that chapter every single time I re-read OoTP.

Also S.P.E.W. - I hate those parts in the books and was very thankful they left them out of the movies.
