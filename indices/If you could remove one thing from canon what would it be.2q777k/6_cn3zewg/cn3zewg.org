I really disliked the "wand lore" stuff. Wand loyalty, especially, was just convoluted and ill-explained. No need for it in the plot.

(I also think the Hallows are pretty lame. Not in and of themselves, but they were poorly integrated into the plot. When you had Hermione yelling about how Harry is just wandering around aimlessly, getting distracted by Hallows which are ultimately irrelevant, it got wayyy too meta for me)
