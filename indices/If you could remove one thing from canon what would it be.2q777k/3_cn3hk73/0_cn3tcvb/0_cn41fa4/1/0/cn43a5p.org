  Despite this, the world building is the best aspect of the entire series.

Ehhh. The /things/ and /people/ she wrote about were powerful and compelling, beloved by many. Not the world itself. The world is more full of holes than Narnia. Which is one reason why Narnia fanfic isn't as popular, even after the recent movies. Less room to work in.

Hogwarts, for example, is powerfully presented, but not /well fleshed out/. How many students are at Hogwarts? In Harry's year? In Hermione's dorm? No exact numbers needed, just a general sense would do.

How many teachers are there? Who gets to go to Hogwarts, and why does Harry's name being down for it since birth matter (this is canon)? Does everyone in the UK just get to go? Are there any visiting students from other countries? Is it expensive or free, or something inbetween? How does one become a "Potions Master", anyway?

We know the number of staircases (142) but any of not this.

Then there are the big things, things that don't need to be said but need to be at least /suggested/ when the legal and governmental systems start becoming part of the plot. We don't know how much the non-magical government actually knows about wizards, whether the Queen is aware of it, or even if wizards and witches consider themselves British citizens at all. We don't even now how the Minister for Magic is elected, and how one might get kicked out of office. Surely someone at Hogwarts would have considered that during fifth year.

That's world building, even if only used in a throw-away line once. That's what's not done well at all in Harry Potter.

I'm only suggesting /why/ she didn't expand on those ideas and themes. Her not doing so is fine. That was her story. That's why Harry Potter doing magic isn't important to the story of Harry Potter. Because magic isn't really important to the story, even if it is important to the world.
