It doesn't have to be anything dramatic, where PowerfulHarry magically wrestles Voldemort down.

I see a good ending as being one where Harry picks up a sword (literal or not) that Dumbledore left for him and uses his fame and leadership to rally the entire wizarding world to defeat Voldemort and his Death Eaters...fine, /while using the power of love and friendship/.

You could have communities of muggles and wizards coming together, making the whole statute of secrecy thing interesting again. You'd have people working in secret and then more openly to defeat a common evil, and the overthrowing of a co-opted and corrupt government still staffed by mostly good people just trying to get by. Internment camps are liberated, a Hogwarts resistance group is run by Neville, and people do important and interesting things with magic /on camera/. Good stuff.

Instead of like in canon, where the most action in the "war" takes place in a single battle at a school, against students and random alumni plus Hogwarts teaching staff and the local PTA. They last not even long enough for Harry to manage to throw himself into one last wood chipper. Also, while defending a school full of defenseless little kids against murderers, the adults suffered only like, what, 5% casualties before surrendering? Right.

So thematically odd.

How about after helping actual qualified adults find all the Horcruxes, Harry takes out the last one, Nagini, using his Parselmouth ability to set a trap. Then he stands up and rejects his hatred and fear of death while in a face to face fight against Voldemort, one he can't win, thus severing his ties to the Dark Lord and the path he took. Because shooting an infant in the face is not the recipe for how you make a Horcrux, this is important only to Harry's spiritual well being. And then Harry dies heroically but ultimately pointlessly, because that is what happens when you're that guy.

Then Neville runs Voldemort through from behind with the Sword of Gryffindor, because he was /obviously/ the Chosen One all along. Not someone with personal power, like Harry had, but someone with the power of his friends and community behind him, working together to defend the weak and helpless. Neville's the one marked by Voldemort, causing him to fear death as Voldemort does, making them equal -- he's not literally marked, or literally equal in magical or physical power, which would be trite. This is a fear Neville has to overcome because of his parents -- who were tortured, remember, for information about Voldemort's location after his de-bodying because of the Dark Lord's choice to go after Harry. Making the whole thing /classically/ Greek and /actually/, /technically/ speaking, *dramatically ironic* in the way the prophecy works out.

A bitter victory. Harry's friends mourn*. A tomb, next to Dumbledore...and Snape. But also rejoicing and peace at last, then rebuilding and reconciliation after a civil war.

Epilogue:

Neville's kid going to Hogwarts for the first time, a busy train platform.

"You'll do great, Harry. You're named after the bravest man I know. I'll be proud of you no matter what, even if you get sorted into Slytherin House."

"Why would that matter, da?"

"It doesn't, son. It doesn't. Green's a fine color."

The End

--------------

*Series Reboot Alt Ending:*

And then Harry sits back up again, alive; because he is, in fact, both the Boy Who Lived and the Master of Death. By not fearing Death, and by having all the Hollows, he got one last chance at the price of giving up death's gifts once and for all. The Deathly Hallows appear to wither and turn to dust in Harry's hands. No one else sees this, just Neville.

They win and everyone hugs, but Neville and Harry are confused and worried, unable to believe the long fight is over. Fake smiles are shown. Ron jokes, can't anything kill you? That's what, three times now? Harry and Neville stare at each other across the crowded table at the victory banquet, visibly unsettled. They both know of only one person to have cheated death like Harry repeatedly does. And because he immediately tested it after Voldemort was gone, Harry knows Dumbledore was wrong about at least one thing. He can still talk to snakes.

Cue creepy Harry Potter music.

Roll credits.

+Epilogue+ After credit scene (...for a book, shutup):

(pitch blackness, two figures talking through a tall iron gate, lit only by two glowing wand tips)

"Look, I've got classes in the morning..."

"I'll say it fast then. You watch him, mate. The kid's no good."

"I don't believe it. Harry's a good man. He has a good wife and a good family."

"The things he did during the war, the way he just stood up after that horrible Quidditch accident. And after V-Voldemort- it isn't natural! They say-"

"That's all in the past. The war's behind him, behind us all now. Let it go."

"I've got a kid at Hogwarts too, you know. Gryffindor, and proud of it. I don't want another creature let loose, attacking kids like our second year."

"That's not-"

"You know, the Hat tried to sort Harry into Slytherin too. He said that once. And Hermione checked the old Ministry records at last. He actually is an heir of Slytherin, through the Peverels. So that means his son is, too."

"Not all Slytherins are evil. You know that, Ron."

"No, you listen /Professor/. There's something wrong with Hogwarts' latest Slytherin. I saw the animals, dead and unnaturally so. The weird lights at night from the Potter place. Mark my words, Nev. Albus Potter is Dark."

--------------

*In summary:* should have been a Joan of Arc, not a Christ figure for Harry. And the /entire/ magical world openly fighting the Death Eaters in a civil war. And Neville as the real Chosen One, leaving Harry...just Harry, a normal boy who did what he saw needed to be done. Someone who made all the right choices, not because of fate but because he was a good person with good friends backing him up. Voldemort loses in the end because he can't understand this power.

What we got was so much less interesting.
