  it's kind of hard to imagine a plausible ending where Riddle is defeated that doesn't involve some kind of deus ex machina.

Yes, but just because it's difficult doesn't mean you should just give up. I've read probably 10-15 fics that accomplished this exact feat with varying degrees of success. If they can do it so could Rowling.

I'd rather have Harry defeat Voldemort through sheer luck than for him to cheat. Hell, Harry was successful his first 4 years through basically sheer luck alone. Seems to me like Rowling got lazy, and/or bored of Harry Potter.
