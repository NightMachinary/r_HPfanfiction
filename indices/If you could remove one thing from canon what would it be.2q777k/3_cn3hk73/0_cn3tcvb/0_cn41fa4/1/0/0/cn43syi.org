  Ehhh. The things and people she wrote about were powerful and compelling, beloved by many. Not the world itself. The world is more full of holes than Narnia. Which is one reason why Narnia fanfic isn't as popular, even after the recent movies. Less room to work in.

I disagree. I find the world she wrote about to be immensely compelling largely because she leaves so much to be imagined.

  That's world building, even if only used in a throw-away line once. That's what's not done well at all in Harry Potter.

There's nothing that says a compelling fictional world will fill every possible hole. Tolkien's world is fleshed out with INCREDIBLE detail, but I don't like it nearly as much as I like the Harry Potter world.

  ...she didn't expand on those ideas and themes. Her not doing so is fine. /**That was her story. */*

Agreed

  Because magic isn't really important to the story, even if it is important to the world.

Which is something I dislike about the story, but certainly isn't its worst quality. I've read plenty of fics where the magic was an afterthought that I really loved. I read Rowling's story which has a fair amount of magic (though it isn't expanded upon), and I didn't like how it ended.
