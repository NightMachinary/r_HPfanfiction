  That's like saying the lack of peanuts is the best part of a tuna sandwich.

I think it's more like she provides you with some delicious wheat bread, and tasty tuna, but doesn't force you to eat any shitty peanuts on your sandwhich. She sets up a good framework without defining all the mystery out of it.

  I'm trying to say the reason you don't like the ending is that the objectively bad world building
#+end_quote

I think I finally understand what you are saying, but correct me if I'm wrong. You're saying the early worldbuilding is good, and the later world building is not so good. In that respect I agree.

  Why don't you think these things are linked here? Magic is key to the stories -- that's what drew in fans, not the faux-Regency boarding school themes or awkward friendship and hardship storylines. An ending to the story that didn't involve Harry somewhere actively using his knowledge of magic and how to be a wizard that he learned along the way was exactly the wrong way to go.

Yes I agree 100% and that's one of my primary complaints with the series.

  That is what the Horcrux hunt was, and to a great extent book six. Magic without reason, agency, and widely without social context. Characters jerked from place to place or emotion to emotion without warning and reason. I seriously doubt that is how JKR planned on the series ending when she finished book one, whatever her later claims.

That was really well explained, and I couldn't have put it better myself. I can't see any possible way that Rowling intended for the series to end this way.

It's almost insulting. It's like she realized 2/3 of the way through book 5 that she had a huge influence over the fledgling morality of a billion children, and she needed to put in a good message at the end of the book. So she draws up this idea about Snape's redemption and Harry being an all around stand up guy, and then starts filling in the blanks of how the characters are going to get there.

By the time she got to book 7 she was had an oh shit moment when she realized that Harry had to actually defeat Voldemort, and threw in the Deathly Hallows.

#+begin_quote
  In the end, she took out a student-based plotline and focused on a bunch of stuff that didn't make a lot of sense in book four, the one she kept having to replot and rewrite. Then that odd refocus kept on in books five (somewhat) and to a great extent in six and seven.
#+end_quote

I would have no problem with books 6 and 7 moving away from the school life, but like you said, the focus of the story moved away from the magic, and towards fairytales and morality. It got really confusing towards the end. Not in terms of how difficult it was to follow the storyline, but more in terms of why the hell she would write any of these things.
