  An ending to the story that didn't involve Harry somewhere actively using his knowledge of magic and how to be a wizard that he learned along the way was exactly the wrong way to go.

I pretty much agree with you, but it's kind of hard to imagine a plausible ending where Riddle is defeated that doesn't involve some kind of deus ex machina. When it comes to knowledge of magic, Harry and co. are completely outclassed by Riddle. With Dumbledore dead they're kind of screwed in any contest of magical skill, especially since they refuse to actually kill Death Eaters.

I could go into a whole 'nother rant about how fucking stupid the moral lessons of HP are.
