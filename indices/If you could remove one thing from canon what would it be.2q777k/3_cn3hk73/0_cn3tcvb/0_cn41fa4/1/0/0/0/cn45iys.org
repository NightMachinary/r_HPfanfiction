  I disagree. I find the world she wrote about to be immensely compelling largely because she leaves so much to be imagined.

That's fine, but that's not the same thing as:

    Despite this, *the world building is the best aspect of the entire series*.

That's like saying the lack of peanuts is the best part of a tuna sandwich.

I'm trying to say the reason you don't like the ending is that the /objectively bad/ world building didn't lead into a thematically appealing and logical conclusion, like one where Harry learns more about magic and about himself and his abilities.

He starts out learning he's a wizard, and goes out learning he's a sacrificial lamb with lots of "choice" but really only one path. Where what he knows doesn't matter, only the kind of person he is (seriously?) when the tests of his character come down the railroad lines.

Clashing and very meh compared to "yer a wizard, Harry." That was a statement of infinite possibility, from a world building standpoint.

Harry walking to his death without a plan, after two pointless years (and books) of not growing at all /as a wizard/ was the exact opposite of that. Questionable character building and totally dropping the ball on fantasy world-building.

  There's nothing that says a compelling fictional world will fill every possible hole. Tolkien's world is fleshed out with INCREDIBLE detail, but I don't like it nearly as much as I like the Harry Potter world.

  ...

  [magic not really being important to the story] is something I dislike about the story, but certainly isn't its worst quality.

  ...

  I read Rowling's story which has a fair amount of magic (though it isn't expanded upon), and I didn't like how it ended.

Why don't you think these things are linked here? Magic is key to the stories -- that's what drew in fans, not the faux-Regency boarding school themes or awkward friendship and hardship storylines. An ending to the story that didn't involve Harry /somewhere/ actively using his knowledge of magic and how to be a wizard that he learned along the way was exactly the wrong way to go.

I'm not saying thorough world building is the end-all-be-all in all stories and genres. But in modern fantasy stories (which is what Harry Potter is), it is very important to show the spots where the setting is like the real world but different. The edges and the seams are very interesting in this genre.

That's why platform 9 3/4 is so iconic. It has a purpose and a place in society. Great world building there, even though there are HUGE gaps left unfilled. It doesn't even physically work in that train station, at that location in real life, but it matters a lot and is literally a passage from one part of the story to another, even appearing in later books as an important feature of the world.

If Harry Potter had first (or really ever) arrived at Hogwarts after touching a ratty boot Hagrid handed him, perfectly acceptable in that world, it would not have been very compelling. It would have come from nowhere to jerk Harry from place to place. Bad world building, even though it sort of makes sense, because it doesn't /mean/ anything to the world. It doesn't answer the questions the Hogwarts Express does (such as it does) and is bad plotting even though it could be totally explained.

That is what the Horcrux hunt was, and to a great extent book six. Magic without reason, agency, and widely without social context. Characters jerked from place to place or emotion to emotion without warning and reason. I seriously doubt that is how JKR planned on the series ending when she finished book one, whatever her later claims.

In the end, she took out a student-based plotline and focused on a bunch of stuff that didn't make a lot of sense in book four, the one she kept having to replot and rewrite. Then that odd refocus kept on in books five (somewhat) and to a great extent in six and seven. It wasn't really about the school, his classes, magic in general, or living in a magical world with the other students anymore. Things got murky and symbolic, and it doesn't hold together well after that. It turned into a sort of morality play about hope and fate and perseverance and depression and death. Magic was no longer a thing that people did, something to inform and influence the world and society, it was a plot device. Something to move the story forward in a series of "just so" stories.

Which is why the world building being bad is really a big problem in a story like Harry Potter that needs a strong, self-actualized ending for emotionally significant characters. Not a budget Greek tragedy, complete (as you point out) with a deus ex machina and poorly named babies ever after.
