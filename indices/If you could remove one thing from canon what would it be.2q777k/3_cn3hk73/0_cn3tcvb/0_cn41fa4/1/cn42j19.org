  JKR didn't want to do much world building.

Despite this, the world building is the best aspect of the entire series.

  She wrote things happening because they were interesting, not because there were deep in-world reasons behind those things.

My complaint isn't the lack of world building, it's the direction of the story and character building.

I don't think she did anything wrong, I just don't like it. It's subjective, and I acknowledge this.
