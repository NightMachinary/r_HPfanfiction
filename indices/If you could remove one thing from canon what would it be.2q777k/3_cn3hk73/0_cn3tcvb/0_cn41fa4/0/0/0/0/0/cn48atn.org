I'm happy for all of fiction writing to constitute some amount of world building. Though obviously non-fantasy would have less of it.

The conceptual work done by your distinction of "world building/not world building" can be performed equally well by a concept of "good world building/bad world building".

Given that both definitions are equally useful, and given that there's no "true definition" of the term, then there seems little point in either oen of us trying to persuade the other that our own stipulated definition of "world building" is the one that should be accepted.

(My own definition of world building, if not clear, is something like this: any creation of fictional information which forms the background of a story. As such any fiction would involve a certain amount of this. Whether the author has done a good job of doing so is a separate matter, and to be determined by a number of factors, some of which you describe.)
