Without a constraint on what makes up world building, /all/ of fiction writing would be world building.

When JKR says Merlin was sorted into Slytherin (and nothing else about what that meant) on a website years after the books were originally published, I think most everyone can agree that isn't usefully defined as world building for the Harry Potter universe. That thought had nothing to do with building up the story world of the books and everything to do with being imaginative and adding to a disconnected lore of cute ideas.

I'm loosely defining world building as existing between writing something because one genuinely thinks it makes sense in an imaginary world, and the writing of something because it fits into a cohesive narrative -- and for no other reason. That latter case describes the vast majority of things JKR puts in Harry Potter, which is why I say JKR didn't spend much time world building, but a lot of time working on powerful, evocative creatures, characters, and locations.

Simply writing something isn't world building. Writing something to intentionally fit into a consistent story world is. Things don't even have to be rational or logical, necessarily, to count, but every addition need to cause proper reactions to all elements of the story world it could affect.

Otherwise, the characters, society, or even reality itself is carrying [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall][the idiot ball]] just to move the plot along. And that's what GP was complaining about.
