This seems to be a largely semantic difference.

We both agree that JKR created a significant amount of "stuff" for her series: character histories, spells, magical rules, locations, institutions, original takes of creatures, mythology and wizarding history.

We both agree that she didn't link up all her ideas or fully explore them, with some parts being at best vague and at worst requiring significant explanation to avoid inconsistency.

We simply disagree on whether or not to call that process world building.
