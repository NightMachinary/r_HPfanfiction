  I think JKR did plenty of world building, it just wasn't systematic world building. We know lots of individual bits and pieces about the HP world, but there are still huge gaps.

That seems weak. She didn't "do world building" very often at all in the books, and didn't seem to care about it, instead focusing on wide themes and symbols. Which is fine. That's not a crime. But it does mean most Harry Potter world building is the fans doing it after the fact, and those odd internet published extras on Pottermore. Which doesn't really help, as it is some of the most wild and disconnected stuff. Merlin was a Slytherin? What.

There aren't just gaps and missing explanations, there are things that simply don't make sense in the context of the world. Things that would cause people and society to be radically different if they existed in a logically worked out world, regardless of the details and explanation behind them. Features don't have to be explained in detail, they just have to fit into a world where things have causes, and effect other things logically.

That's what world building is, not just thinking up things and putting them in a story. The term means something rather specific.

JKR wrote stories with okay plot and characters, and seriously kicking themes and settings -- all created with little regard to connections to the story world after book one. Diagon Alley, platform 9 3/4, and the Hogwarts Express are the best situated features, interfacing with characters, the differences magic brings, and magical society. They still have major problems and missing information, but at least they /try/ to make sense in the world. Most everything else sort of just happens without good links to an underlying order.

Take something simple: Hogwarts. It stands alone, and is a powerfully presented location and idea. But people don't act in the magical world, especially adults, like they logically would if Hogwarts existed and housed and educated all of their children from years 11 to 18. No pre-Hogwarts education is ever mentioned. Preparation for Hogwarts doesn't involve telling your son /exactly/ how his social group for the next seven years will be picked, apparently. Ever. That means something like eight years (at year one) of "no, we won't tell you, and don't ask your brothers." Harsh. And your name is down for Hogwarts, if you are James and Lily Potter's son...which means what to everyone else whose name /isn't/ down for it? Hagrid isn't a muggleborn, so he can't know about standard public (UK) schooling terminology and legacy admissions.

Same with magic wand sellers who fit you with your one, perfect wand which chooses /you/ -- and which can choose another wizard who defeats you in a duel, but not just any duel, a really important one. Sometimes.

People don't act like they would with the Trace (even as horribly as it is explained) being a thing. Sure, it is close on the surface, but not really, as it only exists as a thing to use to harass Harry. The Twins, Ron, and even Hermione apparently gets away with it without comment. That's one reason the Trace and how it works is so often the focus of fanfiction. It doesn't make sense in wider context in canon without a lot of hand waving.

Also, there's the ability to create and alter simple objects. Or the ability to affect moods with simple charms a grade schooler can cast. Or the ability to teleport someone personally or with an item (even against their will) from point to point. Or the ability to create functional animals (even temporarily) from inanimate objects. Or...
