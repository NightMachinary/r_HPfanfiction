I think JKR did plenty of world building, it just wasn't /systematic/ world building. We know lots of individual bits and pieces about the HP world, but there are still huge gaps.

I think this was actually something rather clever (though I'm not sure she did it deliberately) because it means fan speculate about the gaps. Notice how something like LotR, which is so systematically and comprehensively explained, has much less fanfiction. There's too little room for manoeuvre.
