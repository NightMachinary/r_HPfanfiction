JKR didn't want to do much world building. She prefered metaphor and symbolism. That's why the bubble-head charm and partial human transfiguration in book four were the height of advanced student magic. And they were never used again in the rest of the books.

Oh. And Hermione's bead bag and camp defenses, but those don't even get names.

Having actual year six and later magic classes would have required delving into what magic was like and how it was used in the world, things that JKR wasn't interested in and weren't important to the story.

I'm not talking here about explaining how things work, though that would be nice, but how things fit into the world. She wrote things happening because they were interesting, not because there were deep in-world reasons behind those things.
