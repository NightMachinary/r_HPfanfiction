Oh 100% but the Hallows were at the end of 7 books not the end of one if that makes sense? Like they made out as if they were the culmination of the series and Harry had to decide, Hallows or Horcruxes, i'm just saying if they'd been given as much foreshadowing as Horcruxes that might actually have meant something.
