Albus /Severus/ Potter

He bullied me mercilessly for YEARS for something I didn't do and was not even concieved of yet at the time. No lets forget the fact that this is a man so petty he held a grudge for his long dead schoolboy Rival and took out his anger on his son. Fuck it all, lets name one of my kids after him cause he wanted to Bang my Mom.

Instead of someone a bit more deserving like Remus or Hell even Cedric would have been better! It would prove that Harry needed to go to therapy to get over even just 4th year but hell, why the man you mutually despised for 7 years?!?!?

Albus I can understand but /SEVERUS/?
