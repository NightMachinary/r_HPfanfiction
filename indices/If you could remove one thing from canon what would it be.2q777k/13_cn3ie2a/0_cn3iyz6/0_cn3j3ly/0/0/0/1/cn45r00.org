so are a /lot/ of Harrys allies. I mean, he lives in the House that chooses its members by their bravery. Being brave as a Gryffindor is "entry-level".

#+begin_quote
  loyal
#+end_quote

Same thing. Almost all of Harrys allies are loyal. And if they betrayed him they were either under the influence of spells/potions or in life-threatening danger.

  having character growth

Well, he is a main character. The story would be pretty shitty if he'd be the same guy at the end of the books. But thats the point of the thread, isn't it? I'd much rather see other characters get the development he got.

#+begin_quote
  noble
#+end_quote

English isn't my first language, so I had to consult a [[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/noble][dictionary]] for this one. I didn't find any definition that would fit him except the "noble" status he gets for technically being part of a Most Ancient House. But hey, I give you that one if I misread something.

#+begin_quote
  selfless
#+end_quote

Greatly depends on the situation. There are situations in the books where he acts selfless and there are situation when hes a selfish arse that risks destroying friendships. Neither a plus nor a minus.

denarii already wrote about the "bigot" part. He is pretty prejudiced against Slytherins. He tends to label things instantly and be done with the forming of his opinion at that point. The Durmstrangs, for example.

And he is pretty ignorant about many things. But so is the whole Wizard society, so maybe we can give him a break here. Not his fault for being raised that way. Also, I found it to be extremely dumb in the book that the guy who basically refused to learn got good grades. Harry is no exception there. Harry is actually worse on this point, keeping in mind that hes coming from the muggle world. "Oh, I can destroy the laws of physics with a wooden stick. Ugh, homework in breaking the known limits of the universe is the worst!"

And you already had a long thread about this one, but once again. Ron may be insecure, but he is definetly not shy.
