  He sacrifices himself in Book 1, goes to the chamber to rescue his sister in Book 2, "if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill us too" in book 3, book 4 Harry is the only one relevant to the plot, book 5 he follows Harry to the DoM and duels Death Eaters for his friend, book 6 same again, book 7 he goes on a hour roux hunt to kill the most evil wizard of all time when he had no obligation to and in fact put his family in danger because he was standing up for what is right, he comes back when free of the Horcrux and is the only person to consider the House Elves in the BoH and he himself fights to the end and stares down Voldemort "he beat you".
