We just don't see much of non-adversarial Slytherins.

  Also you're aware shy and insecure are pretty much synonyms

They really aren't.

/shy/

1. Easily frightened; timid.
2. Reserved; disinclined to familiar approach.
3. Cautious; wary; suspicious.
4. Short, insufficient or less than.
5. Embarrassed.

/insecure/

1. Not secure.
2. Not comfortable or confident in oneself or in certain situations.

Insecurity might be one cause of shyness, but they're definitely not the same thing.
