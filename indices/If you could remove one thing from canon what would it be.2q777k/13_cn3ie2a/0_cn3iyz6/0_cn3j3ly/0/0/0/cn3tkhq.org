What about brave, loyal, funny, having character growth, noble, selfless?

Also bigoted? Are we talking about Rom or Draco here? As for "ignorant and proud" I think you'll find he's a normal guy and actually pretty clever, his OWLs are the same as Harry's minus the Defense O. Oh and "big talker"? He's one of the most shy, insecure people in the novel.

I think you're projecting. Or remembering fanon Ron rather than canon.
