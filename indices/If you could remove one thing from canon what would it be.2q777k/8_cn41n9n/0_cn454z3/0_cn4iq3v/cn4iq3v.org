I think having Harry be a horcrux was probably one of the worst parts for me, since it was apparently accidental, Voldemort didn't even know Harry was one, and it's used to explain away all the things that make Harry similar to Voldemort. I like the idea that Harry could have been in Slytherin, but he chose Gryffindor, that he was also a parseltongue (maybe because he was marked by Voldemort, not because of the Horcrux, or maybe just because it's magic), they had similar childhoods, etc. Having them mirror each other in some ways makes them more interesting, because Harry chooses to do good things, rather than being great as the Sorting Hat suggests.

The diary being a horcrux seemed fitting to me, since it was clearly something Tom had poured his soul into and it could possess others; if it had only been the diary and the locket, that would have been fine. Harry still would have had the adventure with Dumbledore, found out about Regulus, and Voldemort would've still split his soul into 3 pieces, which would still be a crazy accomplishment. The ring could still have been cursed and slowly killing Dumbledore without it needing to be a horcrux, there could be some other adventures involving the diadem and cup in book 6-7 that give the reader some adventure that includes getting into the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff common rooms or including those characters in the group. I don't know, I just wish they hadn't left Hogwarts for the quest that mostly got them nowhere when there were so many better ways to go about it.
