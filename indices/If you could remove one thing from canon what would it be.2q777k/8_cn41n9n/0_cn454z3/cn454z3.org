I like the idea of horcruxes, but I think it would have been better if Harry was the sole horcrux, with the diary just being what we thought it was before HBP: a memory placed in a diary.

If Harry was the sole horcrux then there's no need for a "quest" storyline, and everything is focused on Harry.
