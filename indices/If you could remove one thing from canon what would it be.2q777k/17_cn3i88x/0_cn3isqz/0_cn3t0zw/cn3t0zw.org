I feel like the book glorified a horrible man and made him out to be a hero. Rowling spends the first 5 books showing why you should hate the man. Then she spends the next 2 books showing why Snape is actually a good guy. I like the idea well enough, but the % that each book is about Snape is way to high. By the time book 7 ended I felt like I'd been duped into thinking I was reading a set of Harry Potter books, when in reality I've been reading the Severus Snape books the whole time. A character that I've hated since I was a kid turns out to be vindicated to the point where Harry names his child after him.

Rowling steadily increases Harry's skill and power through 5 books. Then in book 6 she stops even trying to make Harry more powerful, and instead invents the horocruxes forcing Harry to have to stop his magical development to go after these things. Meanwhile, half the book is about Snape. She even named the fucking book Harry Potter and Severus Snape for fucks sake. At this point, everybody is wondering how the fuck Harry's ever going to be strong enough to defeat the dark lord. Then Rowling is like "Shit I fucked up, there's no way Harry can defeat Voldemort, because I forgot to make him stronger in book 6. What can I introduce in book 7 to fix all this? Oh I know the Deathly Hallows, and then Snape can come in and save the day too. And I'll name Harry's child after him." The day I read book 7 was the day the last remnants of my childhood died. Fuck you JK Rowling, and fuck Severus Snape.

TL;DR: For me, Snape ruined the entire series. Why would you spend 5 books making me hate reading this guy's name and them force me to read 2 entire books about him.
