Book 7.

That gets us rid of wandlore (hopelessly inconsistent with the other books), the crapilogue, Hermione's flip-flopping in being able to use mind magic and then suddenly not, and numerous other issues.

If just one thing... wandlore. That would force a proper way for Harry to defeat Voldie rather than depend on some vague, illdefined concept.
