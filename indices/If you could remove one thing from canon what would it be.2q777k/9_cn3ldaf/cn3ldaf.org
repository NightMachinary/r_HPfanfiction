Something controversial: Voldemort's resurrection.

Without a resurrection you could maintain an "annual mystery" storyline with more "magical boarding school" stuff. Basically, stick to the formula of the first 3 books.

Book 7 could feature a resurrection plot to tie things off in which Voldemort is killed without ever fully resurrecting (no horcruxes).
