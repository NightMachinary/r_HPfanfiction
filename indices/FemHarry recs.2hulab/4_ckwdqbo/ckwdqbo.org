One of my all time favorites is the Severus' Rose series. It's still WIP as of its next-gen phase, but complete through year 7. It has its flaws for sure, but I just can't help it, it makes me all warm and fuzzy and happy. So yeah, it's heavy on the parent-child drama and the fluff. Not femslash, Biological father Severitus fic.
