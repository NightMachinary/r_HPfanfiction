fem!Harry is interesting because it's a good way for subtle changes everywhere. Would Snape be quite as harsh if Harry didn't look like James? Would Hermione be more understanding of the Quidditch obsession? What about interactions with Draco? And would Sirius really egg Harry on to be more like James rather than play responsible guardian?

There are quite a few interesting things, and they could cause a whole lot of changes.
