There are a couple of good ones, imo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-ending Road]] is a fem!harry/snape. It's a mammoth of fanfic, currently sitting at over 500k words. It's a slow burn if there ever was one. The author said there won't be any romance between the two until Harriet is out of school. It's in 4th year right now, so there is a long, long ways to go. The author updates pretty frequently though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6343543/1/Harry-the-Mysterious-Curse-of-the-GirlWhoLived][Harry & the Mysterious Curse of the GirlWhoLived]] is a fem!harry with an interesting twist. It appears as though Harry, in this fic, is actually a boy, but everyone sees and treats him as a girl. It hasn't updated in a while, so I'm not sure if it's abandoned yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] is one of the better fem!harry's that I've come across. It's well written and pretty captivating. It only goes through year 1 and, as far as I know, there is no sequel yet. I'm not sure if the author intends to continue it (this author has written a bunch of stuff), but it's definitely worth a read anyway.

Hope this was useful!
