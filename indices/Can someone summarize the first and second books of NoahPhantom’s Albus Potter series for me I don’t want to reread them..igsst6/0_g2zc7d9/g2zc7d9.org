Read them more than two years ago, but IIRC the first book has Albus discover the mulunctlapol by the lakeside, subsequent plot about that and Dismiusa, meanwhile the Wizengamot is debating repealing the Statute and they do at the end of the first book.

My memory of the second book is a lot more vague, there's some plot with Albus and his friends falling out with Eftan that doesn't get explained until much later in the series, then there's some drama with Exo about his lycanthropy and the cure for that, the plot with the mulunctlapoli continues I think? This was definitely the least memorable book of the 7.
