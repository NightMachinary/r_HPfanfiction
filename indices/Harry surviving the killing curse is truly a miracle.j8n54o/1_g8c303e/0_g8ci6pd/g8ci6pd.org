Well, it doesn't have be miracle in the religious sense of the world (although, that's also very problematic, I am a practising Christian and I have hard time to understand what exactly the word ‘miracle' means ... BTW, Bible doesn't use the term at all, in whole text it is used only once in Ex 7:9 and it is used by the pharaoh about the magician tricks made by his magi). Just, why cannot we say “We just don't know what happened.” I very much like parts of the magic which are imperfect, unpredictable, and slightly weird.

That's the one thing which I think JKR managed to achieve much better than all fanfiction stories did (or perhaps authors of the fanfiction stories never noticed it is there at all): magic in the Harry Potter world is kind of slightly imperfect. Professor Flitwick sometimes blows himself from the stool, transformation sometimes gets all weird, everything is slightly dirty (notice Professor Snape's office in the films). I don't like when the magical world in the fanfiction story is like the German design office: everything perfect, clean, last fashion style, with rulers ordered by the size (eh, doesn't anybody even know what the ruler was?).
