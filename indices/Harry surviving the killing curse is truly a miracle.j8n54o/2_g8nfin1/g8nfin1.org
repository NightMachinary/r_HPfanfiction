I read a fanfic where Harry tells snaps that when snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily's life it was an informal unveeakable vow and when Voldemort asked lily to stand aside and she didn't, asking instead to spare Harry's life for hers, the vow shifted to protect Harry so lily died and when Voldemort tried to cast the killing curse at Harry it rebounded and killed him because he broke the unbreakable vow. That's the best explanation I've found for Harry's survival of the killing curse
