Imagine Dumbledore and McGonagall sitting in the Hog's Head and discussing this.

*Dumbledore:* I have just been sitting here thinking.

*McGonagall:* About what?

*Dumbledore:* About the miracle we witnessed.

*McGonagall:* The miracle /you/ witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.

*Dumbledore:* What is a miracle, Minerva?

*McGonagall:* An act of God.

*Dumbledore:* And what's an act of God?

*McGonagall:* When, um... God makes the impossible possible... but I don't think that the last night qualifies.

*Dumbledore:* Can't you see it, Minerva? That doesn't matter. You are judging this the wrong way, I'm afraid. It could be that God stopped the Killing Curse, or He changed butterbeer to firewhiskey, or He found my bag of sherbet lemons. Things like these are not judged on merit. Now, whether or not what young Harry experienced was an "according to Hoyle" miracle is insignificant. What is significant is that I felt the touch of God. God got involved.

*McGonagall:* But why?

*Dumbledore:* This is precisely what is bothering me. I don't know why, but I can't go back to sleep.
