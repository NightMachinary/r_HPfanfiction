Pretty sure you meant linkffn(Something Wicked This Way Comes by the Mad Mad Reviewer), which is as good a candidate as I can imagine.

Also try out linkffn(duality by Andafaith) for your Dark!Daphne needs and linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes by Paffy) for the muggle OC version. Smokers! They'll corrupt you just by breathing on you!
