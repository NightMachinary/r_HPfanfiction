That happened in Elf Quest. Timmain shape-changed into a wolf, mated and gave birth to a Timmorn Yellow Eyes, half-elf/half-wolf and father of the Wolfriders. In the HP case, I am going to say no. The animagus wizard would still have human/wizard DNA and chromosomes which would be incompatible with those of an animal, mainly due to the differences in chromosomal pairs.
