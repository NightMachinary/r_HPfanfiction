It probably depends on how well the transfiguration was performed. We see multiple times throughout the series that transfiguration isn't an all-or-nothing thing, so if something was still part tortoise, part teakettle, then I imagine it would only be able to viably mate with something that was a similar ratio of tortoise to teakettle as itself.
