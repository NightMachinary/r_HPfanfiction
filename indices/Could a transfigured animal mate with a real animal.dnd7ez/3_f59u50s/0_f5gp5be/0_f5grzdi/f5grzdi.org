Transfiguration in general is about turning one thing into another, according to Rowling the molecular structure literally changes, we also know that its permanent. So from all we know they really should be reals.

You probably cant transfigure humans for metaphysical reason, not because of some rule of transfiguration, from the way we know transfiguration works it simply wouldn't be able to create human souls, which would be necessary if you want to create human slaves.

About Potion ingredients we dont know either way because its never been stated, but since transfiguration only changes objects physically it shouldn't he able to create magical ingredients.

My own headcanon is that it wouldn't work in general because the transfiguration wouldnt change the magical significance of the objects, meaning a cat hair transfigured into a dog hair would still count as cat hair for the purpose of magic, but be real in any other way.
