Is a ball turned into a bird still a ball with an illusion (though tactile) or is it a true bird?

From canon, I would say yes. In classes they turn hedgehogs into pincushions and mice into snuff boxes, as well guinea fowl into guinea pig. JKR said that: Transfiguration is a branch of magic that focuses on the alteration of the form or appearance of an object, via the alteration of the object's molecular structure.

Molecular structure. This means that you really change a ball into a bird. Regardless if it's permanent. If you do the transfiguration well enough it is a bird. The phrasing molecular structure implies heart, brain, liver, kidneys, gonads etc.

So from a purely canon point of view, I would say yes. If it's done well enough.
