For a pretty common premise, I can't think of any standout examples. The Calista Snape series is probably the best I've read. The writing is technically excellent and characters are fleshed out and faithful to canon. Unfortunately, there's never much plot or urgency --- from sixth year onwards it seriously starts to drag. The early years are a delight to read though.

(Technically Snape is raising his own daughter here, not Harry. I assume you're okay with non-Harry protagonists though.)
