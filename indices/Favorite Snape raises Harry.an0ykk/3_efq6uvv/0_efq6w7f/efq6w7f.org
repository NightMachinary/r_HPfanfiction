  When Harry appears at the Welcoming Feast wearing a glamor only Snape notices, Snape decides to find out what the glamor is hiding. You, the guiltless, will pay for your father's sins,Roman, until you repair the decayingtemples and shrines of the gods, and theirimages, filthy with blackening smoke.When you act as servant of the gods, you rule:from them all beginning, leave them the ending.Horace, Odes, III-6

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.
