These are fairly popular so you might have heard of them; but also, you might not have, so. linkao3(15465966; 5986366)

Face Death in the Hope is focused on Harry and Regulus, after the Marauders have graduated. The Second String is focused on Harry and Aberforth Dumbledore, among others, and starts while the Marauders are still at school.

FDitH has more interactions between Harry and the Marauders. TSS has interactions, but it's less of the focus, especially at the beginning. Both are still updating. Neither is, in my opinion, a "typical" Marauders-era time travel fic.
