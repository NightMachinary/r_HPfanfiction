Anyone feel like the later books were in some way influenced by fanfic? We know JKR read fanfic, and I feel like they kind of had a bit of a fanservicey feel to them in some aspects compared to the fifth book. Maybe it was because HBP was setting up for DH, but the relationship drama felt very out of place, and while DH is not as bad, it has moments that feel off for the characters
