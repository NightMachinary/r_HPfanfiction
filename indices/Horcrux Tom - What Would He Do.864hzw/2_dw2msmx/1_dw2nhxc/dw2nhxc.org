Might have a way to detect stolen money, or at least locating where it came from so they could investigate. Though I suspect Voldemort is so magically gifted he could probably fool whatever detection spell they might use for this.

Maybe you could have Voldemort just put a bunch of rich people under Imperius and have them routinely wire money to a particular account. Small enough from each individual that it doesn't look too suspicious but all together amounting to a substantial sum.
