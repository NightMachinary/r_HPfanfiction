  as being so against the Muggle world that he wouldn't take the opportunity to gain a bunch of money rather unpragmatic.

Yeah, I agree about this point. I'm planning on having my Voldemort just Imperius the shit out of numerous drug dealers to get money. Maybe just rich people in general, but I do wonder if there is a department in the magical Ministry to stop that sort of thing from happening, so that magicals don't just rob muggle banks and then trade that money for galleons.
