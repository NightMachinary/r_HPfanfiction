I love this wonderful idea! As for why Horcrux Tom might not flock back to England to kill Harry, what if he's kinda happy to be rid of his bossman of an older self and would rather enjoy a life of freedom as the tyrant of Magical New Zealand than go back to England and risk being recognized, all for the sake of getting his old master back?
