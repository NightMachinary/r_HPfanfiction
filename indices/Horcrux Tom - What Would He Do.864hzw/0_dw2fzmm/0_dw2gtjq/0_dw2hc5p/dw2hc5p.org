  Maybe he'd have a crude Darwinian "survival of the fittest" attitude, as in "whichever Tom is still active gets to be Voldemort and if you lose then that's your problem"

That does seem likely. The canon Diarymort doesn't say that much in that direction, but he definitely acts like he intends to /be/ Voldemort once he's got a body, not go seek out the Albanian wraith and then defer to him: “Voldemort is my past... present... and /future/.”
