Hm, maybe. I somewhat want to stick to the canon characterization where the Horcruxes seem to have no issue doing as they think their original self would want.

Maybe he'd have a crude Darwinian "survival of the fittest" attitude, as in "whichever Tom is still active gets to be Voldemort and if you lose then that's your problem"? Hm, I might just stick with him assuming his old self would find a way without him, or maybe that he's too embedded in whatever works he's doing to help the wraith Voldemort at the time. And seeing as Dumbledore knew what country Voldemort was at in CoS, maybe he'd not want to risk a run-in.
