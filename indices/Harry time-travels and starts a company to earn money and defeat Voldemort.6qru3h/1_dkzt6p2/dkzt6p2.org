Ah, I thought this was a Prompt, rather than a Request. You should probably use the flair option on your post to label it as one of those.

Unfortunately, I don't know this particular fic. I do know a fic where Harry & Lupin (and Sirius) make magical television for the Triwizard Tournament, that's in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/13/Weres-Harry][chapter 13 of Weres Harry]], and they appear again in chapter 20 as a business.

Funny thing, I did come up with a fanfic idea once, one where Harry goes back in time and very quickly helps to whoop Voldemort's butt with his knowledge of Horcruxes and advanced magic and whatnot, but his real purpose for stopping there was to collect some 'party favours' for a second jaunt back in time to stop Voldemort and the rest of the whole pureblood supremacy and basically fix the wizarding world before the start of the big war.

Cash-raising, businessing, and rampant mischief would ensue as Harry straight up aims to get rich and powerful.
