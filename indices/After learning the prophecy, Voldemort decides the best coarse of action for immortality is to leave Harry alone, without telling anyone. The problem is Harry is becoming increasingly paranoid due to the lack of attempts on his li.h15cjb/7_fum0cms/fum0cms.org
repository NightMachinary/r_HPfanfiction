It started slow... Like jumping up when someone patted him on the back unexpectedly. Looking behind his back in empty corridor. Joking about security questions if they were to split in a fight. And then bloomed into full fledged paranoia Moody would be proud of. Not only Harry with single minded purpose learned new defensive spells, he dived into warding magics, barriers, Occlumency - anything that could help him survive.

When Voldemort met him next time, Harry who stood before him was anxiety ridden, trigger happy teenager with more ways to kill human being than even Dark Lord could imagine.
