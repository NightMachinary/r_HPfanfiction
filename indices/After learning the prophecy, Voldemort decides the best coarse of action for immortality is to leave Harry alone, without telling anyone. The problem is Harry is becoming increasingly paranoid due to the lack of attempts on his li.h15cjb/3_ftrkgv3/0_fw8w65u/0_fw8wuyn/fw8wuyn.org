Similar in which way? This is probably the only fic at this level of quality that really focuses on a more gritty story rather than fantastical and more in line with canon themes and atmosphere.

For stories where Voldemort won I'd go with linkffn(prince of the dark kingdom) this one has a completely different feel than this fic though. It has a heavy focus on a Harry and Voldemort student mentor relationship. No it's not slash. The story does get progressively darker as the years pass.

For something more dark I think linkffn(betrayal by butalearner) could work. This one is a dark story with a somewhat deranged Harry that is somewhat similar in world atmosphere but both much else.

I don't think I have a rec for a characterization of Harry that's similar, I don't think I have one because I think Harry not being our main narrator changes how we the reader perceive him and it isn't a very common choice as well as this Harry being fairly unique.

You might also like skitterleap by embilbly(this is probably spelt way wrong) it's basically a big AU that would be hard to explain that I personally couldn't really get into despite the fantastic writing and world building.

There's also like a lot that I haven't read that's good as shit so I'd recommend heading over to dlp and going through the library I promise you'll find a ton of new good ass stories.
