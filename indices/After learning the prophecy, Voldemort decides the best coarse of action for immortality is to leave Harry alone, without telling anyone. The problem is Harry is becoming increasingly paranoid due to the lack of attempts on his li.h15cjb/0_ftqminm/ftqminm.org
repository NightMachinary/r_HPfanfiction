Well, Voldemort could always try to capture Harry, dose him with the Draught of Living Death, and lock him inside his most secure vault. This way, no physical harm will ever come to Harry and he will be living for a very long time!

In addition, Voldemort could still proceed with taking over the Ministry, hunting down Muggleborns, and establishing a Pureblood tyranny. Unless we are dealing with an OOC Harry, the canon one would absolutely fight back. The war against Voldemort is essentially a war against sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazis, and goes way beyond the personal vendetta between Harry and Voldemort.

Finally from Harry's POV, it's: "My name is Harry Potter. You killed my parents, prepare to die!"
