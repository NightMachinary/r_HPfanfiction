Well, my story has a smart and calm female Harry, who's also a very kind and compassionate person! Of course she can get stressed or fly off the handle like anyone can, and then she gets snappish and sometimes also cussy at people around her. But she always tries to say sorry. :) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12784998/1/The-Fight-For-Rights]])
