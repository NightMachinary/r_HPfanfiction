To be fair, kids lie about stuff like that because they think it makes them look ccol/badass/awesome/rebellious/etc. Doesn't necessarily mean he actually did anything at all. People who talk about that sort of stuff are actually the ones I /least/ worry about. I know /that/ from personal experience too.

And in defense of kids, they don't quite understand the implications of long term actions. I suspect most of them cannot really even contemplate the idea that they might actually die or go to prison. Sort of like an invincibility mindset.

Maybe that explains why Harry in canon is so screwed up. When he was eleven, he almost died loads of times.
