  Its weird that even by the age of eleven, he is contemplating murder.

When I was in elementary school I knew a kid who crucified a squirrel, or a rabbit, or something, to a tree in his backyard. He always said stuff like "I wish you were dead" or "I'm gonna kill you", and he always looked bored when he said it, but that just made it creepier.

I'm just saying, psychos are kids at some point too.
