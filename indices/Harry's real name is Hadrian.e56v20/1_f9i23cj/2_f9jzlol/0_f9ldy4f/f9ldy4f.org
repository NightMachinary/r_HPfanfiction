I've read some /really/ terrible Indie! Harry, Lord! Harry, and Super! Harry fics where it seems like the author gets off on how powerful he can make Harry. The level of power, number of titles, the amount of money, and the superior attitude in those fics is obscene. It really does seem like the author gets his or her jollies from stupidly and ludicrously overpowered they can make Harry.
