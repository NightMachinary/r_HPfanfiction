Lets not forget the ever popular Harold in those same genres, and some of the more cliche Indie! Harry fics. I always got the impression that they thought Harry wasn't regal or aristocratic enough, and thus too plebian for Lord Slytherin-Hufflpuff-Black-Potter-Minmax Wank Fantasy. I found it kind of cringey and eye rolling myself.
