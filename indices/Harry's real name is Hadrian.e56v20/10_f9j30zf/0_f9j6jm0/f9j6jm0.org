That doesn't matter - yes, the name origins are different, but that's besides the point. For instance, when I look it up, the most suggested nickname for Hadrian is Harry.

Henry, while used by the nobility, doesn't invoke the same sense as Hadrian in terms of showing that Harry would be from a different class. It's kinda like Louis vs Charles in the French monarchy - both very common over the centuries, but if I were to want to emphasize a character as being derived from said royal line I'd choose Louis as a hidden name, feeling more aristocratic/associated with it.

In addition, a Roman name can carry connotations in magic as well - I've seen a lot of fics saying that the Romans introduced the wands to Britain, for instance. If power fantasying Harry, I can see how connecting him to Roman aristocracy could be a good way of emphasizing his power and whatnot.

In any case, I'm not a fan of any fics where he immediately changes the way he refers to himself to that name. Even if he had a secret 'real' name, he should still think of himself as Harry.
