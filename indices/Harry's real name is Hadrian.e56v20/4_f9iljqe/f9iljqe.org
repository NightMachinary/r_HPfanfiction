There's a /lot/ of parallels you can draw between Death Eater/blood purist ideology and the usual themes you find in indy!Harry fics.

I don't want to sound like I'm moralizing here - it's never wrong to enjoy stuff in fiction, and exploring alternative themes is one of those things that fanfic is great for!

But there's just /so much/. Noble and Most Ancient Houses, "Lord Hadrian Potter-Black", family grimoires and secret House magic, powerful ancestry like Merlin or the Hogwarts founders, magical cores so that some wizards are Just Better than others, manipulative!Dumbles and the Weasels stealing from all the secret family vaults Harry knew nothing about, magic that's "classified as Dark" but really just misunderstood, the barbaric noble-savage Goblin Nation that welcomes Harry as one of their own after he remembers Griphook's name or something...

Any of these elements can be done well, but taken together in the usual way, they paint a /very/ Death Eater-sympathetic view of the wizarding world. It'd be cool to see a fic where some in-universe fiction books are written this way, the author is one of those Death Eaters who claimed Imperius, and Harry has to deal with the misconceptions, getting more and more exasperated at the ridiculous propaganda. (I think White Squirrel had one that would have been like that, but it never got more than a chapter in)
