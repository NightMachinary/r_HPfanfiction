I think I have that one downloaded but haven't started it yet. However, I seem to recall a bit in the bodcast as a bit of 'fanfiction of a fanfiction' where Harry was talking to Hermione's ghost and try to determine if she was aware of her own awareness. I even remember him teaching her a game called "Petals around a rose" or something like that.
