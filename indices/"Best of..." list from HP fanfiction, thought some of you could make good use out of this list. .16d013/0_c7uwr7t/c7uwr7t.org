The stories are unfortunately mostly incomplete novels from way back when, as the lists have been mostly the same since when I first joined the site in 2008 and the site hasn't been as active since the HP fandom heydays. But there are some great still-active authors who have managed to break the top 10 in recent years :) I recall there being a lot more terribly written Draco/Hermione last time I looked.
