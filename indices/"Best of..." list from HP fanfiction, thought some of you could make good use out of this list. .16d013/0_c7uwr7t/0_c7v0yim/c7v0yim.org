As a regular on the site for the past year and a half, I agree with mostly everything you say. The "best of" list is pretty much static at this point. Unless JKR writes some more books, the site will never again be able to generate enough traffic to knock stories like /Delicate/ -- which is really, /really/ good, by the way -- from their perch. I've seen it suggested to the site owner and staff that the "best of" page be modified to give more recent stories a chance, but there just isn't much enthusiasm for change. The site's back-end code seems to be a bit fragile, and every time there's an update it's like playing with fire.

The page for [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/getinfo.php?page=dobbys][Dobby Award Winners]] is a little more current, although it still hasn't been updated for the 2012 winners.
