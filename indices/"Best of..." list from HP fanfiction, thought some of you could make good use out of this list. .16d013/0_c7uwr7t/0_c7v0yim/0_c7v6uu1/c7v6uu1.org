I suggested the same before, too! I think it comes up pretty often. I'm supposing they don't save monthly hits, and reads all go in one data field. I suggested sort by read count a long way back too, but they said something about it'd be too much of a load to constantly recalculate, and I guessed that might actually be the reason the never fixed the read count 'bug', where the total # of read counts on a story don't update until you make changes to a chapter, because that means less updates to the database.
