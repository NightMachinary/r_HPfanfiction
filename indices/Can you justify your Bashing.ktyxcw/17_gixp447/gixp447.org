Snape, for all the obvious reasons. These replies are reminding me why I stick to marauders fanfic, because Rowling's characters are just so deeply flawed. (As in plot-holey and don't make sense, not the good kind of flawed) She projects her own opinions/what she wants her characters to be and does none of the actual work of getting them there.

Just my take though.
