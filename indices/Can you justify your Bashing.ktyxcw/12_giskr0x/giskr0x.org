Albus Dumbledore.

Like, I get where the man is coming from, but seriously, jeez, most of the things he does borders on psychopathy. He literally has 17.5/20 on a test I found. It's pathetic, honestly. Now, for the reasons....

At the beginning of PS, he left a /baby/ on a /doorstep/ in /November/ in nothing more than a /basket/ and /note/ to tell his aunt that her sister is dead and that she now has to take care of her sister's child who just saw his parents get murdered. Also, I'm, like, 98% certain that Dumbledore knew exactly what sort of person Petunia was, and not just because McGonagall told him that the Dursleys were "the worst sort of muggles imaginable."

And the letters. Like, I know they're automatically addressed, but, /that/ many letters couldn't /possibly/ be sent. Dumbledore did that on fucking purpose.

And about Mrs Figg... Surely she saw Harry working like a house-elf. He was so thin and he always worked so much. So when he did some painting or gardening for hours she should have noticed. And she did, clearly.

And sending Hagrid to get Harry? /Seriously?!/ That man is a bumbling fool (He's great, but still) that hasn't even completed his education!

And the whole Hagrid getting the stone from Gringotts thing... That's obviously a setup.

And when Hagrid stopped Harry from getting a book on hexes to use on Dudley? Well...looks like someone didn't want their weapon to be knowledgeable...

And first year.... Well... That's a shitshow.

First, there was the Weasleys at Kings Cross and Ron... He said that there was no more room on the train. Liar. It was a magical train. And he could have sat with his siblings.

Now, I don't think that was outright malicious of the Weasleys. Course not. But it was likely that Dumbledore asked them to befriend Harry. Probably to make sure he was a Gryffindor. And Light. He didn't want another Tom Riddle.

And as for the troll, surely there would be creature repelling wards on Hogwarts, or else the creatures in the forest would be coming in nearly all the time! Dumbledore must have wanted that to happen for Harry and Ron to befriend Hermione, so Harry wouldn't want to research and study things himself.

And the trials at the end, those were /easy./ A first year did them! And surely Snape knew better than providing the antidote and a way to escape during his riddle. Idiot.

Also, what are the odds that a staircase could send Harry and Co right to the third floor corridor? Hmm? And Dumbledore telling everyone that the corridor was forbidden is like asking the group of reckless teenagers (Gryffindors) to go there.

And showing down with Voldemort... Well, that was just no...

Dumbledore didn't react like a normal adult when finding out that an 11-year-old boy faced down with the terrorist who killed his parents and then killed one of his teachers. Harry should have gotten therapy!

And surely Pomfrey, or anyone, could have seen that Harry was malnourished. Neither one of his parents were that small, and his ribs could clearly be seen! He could barely eat right!

And second year...surely Dumbledore knew /then/ that Harry was abused? There were /bars/ on his window and the Weasleys had to rescue him. They clearly spoke about how he was treated!

And what with the whole Chamber of Secrets thing... Dumbledore was over a century old and the Chamber was already opened once. And he probably had an idea of where it was, what with Myrtle and all. He knew damn well where and what the basilisk was.

And really, couldn't they buy mandrakes from someone else instead of waiting for theirs to grow? We're talking about comatose children here!

And Dumbledore knew damn well about Lockhart. That man was a clear fraud and the fact that he didn't fire him was clear negligence at best and maliciousness at worst.

And Snape too. That man didn't teach a thing! He bullied everyone he was Neville's worst fear! Take that in, Nev's worst fear was not Bellatrix (the woman who /tortured his parents into insanity)/, but his /teacher/ instead.

And letting Harry go into the Chamber? Only giving him a sword and a bird? Pathetic. And it was not "Harry's loyalty to Dumbledore" either. That's pure Albus Dumbledickâ„¢ bullshit.

And third year... All I'll say is that Dumbledore either knew Sirius was innocent or he wanted him to stay away from Harry. He was the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot! He was able to call for a trial for a man who never got one if there was new evidence to be found. Just use Veritaserum, memories, and witnesses you dick.

Fourth year. That was less fabricated by Dumbledore, but surely he could have helped Harry in the tasks? All the other headmasters did. And yeah, I guess it wasn't fair with Cedric and all, but at least he could have arranged for extra lessons. Harry was only 14 and competing in a death match!

And during the end, Harry was clearly weakened and hurt, and Dumbledore still made him tell exactly what happened instead of immediately sending a /clearly traumatized/ boy to Pomfrey.

And fifth year... The idea that Dumbledore thought Harry was possessed was bullshit. And an excuse to keep things from Harry.

That whole year was a bunch of bullshit. Dumbledore and McGonagall knew damn well what Umbridge was doing. It's why Minnie stopped Harry from finishing his sentence and telling her. She already knew.

The Occlumency lessons were bullshit as well. Snape didn't teach Harry a thing. All he did was rape his mind and that was it. It likely opened Harry's mind to Voldemort even more.

And about the prophecy, Dumbledore really went to great lengths to keep it hidden from Harry. For years.

It's simply pathetic.

And sixth year... Dumbledore didn't even properly train Harry! He barely knew how to fight! And Hogwarts's education was mediocre at best. Harry had no chance to defeat Voldemort in a duel.

And asking Harry to get Slughorn's memory was a stupid idea. Dumbledore could easily have gotten it himself instead of asking a teenager to do it.

And he didn't tell Harry he was going to die either! Why?!

And making him go on a Horcrux hunt was stupid, too. The Golden Trio were just kids!

That's about all I know, for the moment. Though there was also the time where /Harry was a horcrux and Dumbledore planned his death ever since he was a baby./

He was just a boy! Dumbledork had no right!

And yeah, that's about it. Dumbledore is a manipulative, psychopathic bastard. There's a reason I bash the man. Kinda.

Yikes. This is long. It says a lot about Dumbledore's character though. And I didn't even speak about anything before the series.
