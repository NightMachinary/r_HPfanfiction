James Potter was a teenager with adoring older parents who babied him/gave him everything he wanted without a fuss.

Harassing Lily is a fanfiction thing. it isn't canon that he asked her out repeatedly.

Also with the cop Muggle thing, anything that wasn't written in the books isn't canon.

James saved Snape. I believe he didn't like Snape because of him being Slytherin and close to Lily, but I don't think he wanted him dead, especially not because of Remus, who was an innocent party in the mix. Also he might not have liked Snape, but I highly doubt he'd want him dead. He's a 15 year old jerk, not a killer or heartless bastard.

James ends up changing for the better, which in turn gets Lily interested to him.

I like Snape, even with all his flaws (and he has a lot). In a way I think Snape is worse than James, because James changed/grew up. Snape never grew up, he bullied kids, had Neville's Boggart be Snape himself, was rude/inconsiderate, etc. I like the abused Snape aspect with his family, the child Snape was, but if I met adult Snape, I'd want to punch him in the face, even with knowing everything that I know about him.
