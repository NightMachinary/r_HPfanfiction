Agreed. Some people are shitty people when they are 15, and it had been established that James was a pampered little prince. People grow, people change, people mature. Think about someone who was shit to you in school. Chances are, if you meet them in your 20s/30s, they are better people.

Also, James is never portrayed as bullying anyone except Snape, and it's implied that it's because either he is jealous of the fact that Snape is close with Lily and/or can tell that he fancies her (not a good reason, but again - teenagers), or he bullies Snape because he is racist and into the dark arts (better reasons).
