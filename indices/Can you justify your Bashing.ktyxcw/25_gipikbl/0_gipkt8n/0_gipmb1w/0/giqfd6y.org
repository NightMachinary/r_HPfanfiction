Pampered little Princes as you called James often do grow up to be shitbags. One must only look at the rich fuckers in America for proof. My opinion of James is colored by the fact that we are told by people who liked James that he was a good man. What we are shown tells a completely different story and what we are shown is a popular kid picking on and humiliating his classmate because he was friends with a pretty girl he liked and he had a fascination for the dark arts, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Snape after all was never malicious in his use of the spells he created which cannot be said for James. It is also worth noting that James using dark magic despite bullying Snape for his fascination with it makes him a massive hypocrite. We never see James change. Maybe he did and I am completely wrong. But the cynic in me finds it hard to believe that he did mature. If he didn't see the error in his ways after his posse nearly got Snape killed because SWM happened after the Whomping Willow, I would need to actually see him change to actually believe it. For me it is a farther jump to think that the arrogant asshole changed into a good dude in two years than it is to think that the girl who was amused by her friend being dangled upside down decided to ignore James' bad behavior since she's no longer impacted by it. He clearly carries this reckless immaturity into adulthood, evidenced by the incident with the muggle police. So I don't believe he changed and that is why I dislike him
