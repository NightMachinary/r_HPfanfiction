1. And fifteen year olds are allowed to treat each other like shit?
2. That is part of a thing Rowling released for charity or something where James and Sirius fucked with two muggle cops and when they found themselves pursued by death eaters they threw the cop car at them. [[https://www.mugglenet.com/harry-potter/james-sirius-prequel/][link]]
3. What Snape does definitely doesn't excuse James' behavior in the slightest. And again, it wasn't just Snape he fucked with
4. I would have to check but I have heard from others that, yes he did
5. SIRIUS said James matured. Given that he was James' best friend, and he was probably talking to Harry, I will take his word with a grain of salt
