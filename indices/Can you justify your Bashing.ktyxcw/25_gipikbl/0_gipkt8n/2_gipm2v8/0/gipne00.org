1. It shouldn't excuse his behaviour, but he's still a child and still going through adolescence which is why he's immature and arrogant early on

2. I know what you're talking about, and they used the cop car to stop the death eaters and not the muggle cops

3. If James was bullying Snape than Snape was also bullying James according to your logic. Snape literally followed them around looking for reasons to expel them which is why James used Snape's own hexes he created against him. Not to mention that Snape was part of a group of death eaters during his hogwarts years that would DEFINITELY do far worse to other people than what James did. In James's mind, Snape is nothing more than a death eater in training who supplied dark curses to his death eater friends to use on people.

4. Id like to see where you got this info

5. Lily literally wouldn't go near James with a ten foot pole during their first five years of school and we all know she wouldn't go out with James while he was an arrogant and spoiled child. Sirius also says that they stopped bullying other kids and grew up into a brave, kind man which is the person Lily fell in love with, not the spoiled arrogant child
