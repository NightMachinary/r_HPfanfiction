1. Again, it doesn't matter if you're 15 or 50. There is no excuse for being an asshole. There are plenty of teenagers in this story and not all of them are assholes who treat people like garbage
2. They threw the car with the cops in it. Those cops are either dead or very injured
3. Again because I knew there would be people who said this stuff, it wasn't just Snape. Snape is not a bully because they were actually troublemakers who actually doing things that would warrant them being expelled. He was just one of their many victims
4. I obtained this information through discourse so I can exactly source it
5. That's not entirely true. Lily was actually amused when Snape was being dangled upside down by James and this comes right from book 5 meaning she definitely thought he was a charming funny person may have eventually decided to overlook the dickishness because it wasn't her friend he was being an ass to
