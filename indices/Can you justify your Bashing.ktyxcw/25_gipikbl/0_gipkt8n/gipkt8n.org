1. James Potter is fifteen years old
2. Where the hell does it say in the books that James killed two muggle cops
3. It's not relentless bullying of Snape goes back just as hard, and most of the things James does to Snape are things meant to humiliate him, not hurt him, unlike Snape who used a cutting curse on James's face.
4. In no way does it say that James uses the incident of him saving Snape to bolster his standing in Gryffindor.
5. Sirius literally says that James stop bullying people including Snape and matured in his seventh year so Lily would notice him, which she did and it's clear that they loved each other.

Literally every thing you've said here is either from your head canon or from some random fic
