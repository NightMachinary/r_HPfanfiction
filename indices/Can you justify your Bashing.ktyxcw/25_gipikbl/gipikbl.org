James Potter is a fucking bully. Ignoring all the shit he does to Snape for a moment, he bullies other students, harasses Lily repeatedly and even tries to blackmail her into going out with him, does the same kind of stuff the twins do except it's malicious, at one point murders two muggle cops to get away from some death eaters, and he gets to do all of it with impunity. Now let's bring Snape back in. What he does can be classified as relentless bullying. Even after Sirius almost gets Snape killed, he keeps doing it and even uses the incident to bolster his standing in Gryffindor despite Snape being nearly murdered by his werewolf buddy. And imo he only saved Snape to cover Lupin's ass. We are told he becomes a better person but the only evidence of that is that Lily agrees to date him and given that she found him charming and even found it amusing when James tortured Snape, that argument is not one I believe in the slightest. James is an arrogant asshole who does shitty things to people and gets away with it because [[https://youtu.be/FyqV9jOgeyE][he's a popular kid with a bright future in Quidditch. James Potter is Brock Turner (minus the rape)]]
