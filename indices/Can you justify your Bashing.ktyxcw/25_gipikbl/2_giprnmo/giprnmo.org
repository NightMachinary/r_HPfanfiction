First off, I'm going to assume you're a snape lover because there's nothing else that can make you hate a character other than the blinded love of another.

James Potter is /not/ a bully, and if he was, it was when he was 15. And although that's no excuse, we know he grew up completely spoiled and did in fact /change/ by their seventh year, because the Lily from SWM would not go out with a bully. She stood up for anyone being picked on, muggle-borns or purebloods, so I'd say she's a pretty good judge of character. This is why her opinion of James changes so drastically, because he changes so drastically. He also joins the fight against Voldemort and gives his life for the cause, and specifically in the moment so his wife and child have a better chance of living.

And JKR has no idea who the marauders actually are, which is obvious in that little death eater thing you mentioned. They've taken on a life of their own, so the puny little backstory characters Jk imagined them as aren't what they are now. They're full-fledged characters who have millions of words written about them, and she can't change James's character years later to fuel her snape-loving narrative,

And he doesn't just save Snape for the sake of Remus, he saves him because it was the right thing to do. Even if he didn't do it for snape, sacrificing his life to save Remus is a very noble and brave thing to do, indicative of a good person.

And we know Snape fought back just as hard as James did, seeing as he fights back to them and hurls insults just like James and Sirius do. And Lily doesn't just 'agree to go on a date with him,' she marries and has children and risks her life just to live with the guy, so obviously she likes him more than you think.

But hey, if for some weird reason you do like snape, don't bother replying to this because there's no way we could ever see eye to eye about the marauder's era.
