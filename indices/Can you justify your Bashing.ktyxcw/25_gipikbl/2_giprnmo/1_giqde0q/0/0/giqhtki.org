Like I said, Snape is by no means perfect by any stretch of the imagination. And neither is James. He didn't grow up. He recklessly baited two muggle cops and put them in danger and showed them magic which is completely in character for him when he was 15 and if he's still doing that kind of thing then he hasn't grown up.

I would bet anything they would be divorced by the time Harry got into school had they lived
