The whomping willow incident took place before SWM, meaning James saved Snape from getting murdered by Lupin and then went right back to bullying him and because of this and the fact that James always sees Snape as Snivilus, I don't think he did grow up. The way the Marauders treated Snape is a big part of why Snape went out into the woods, meaning James was partially responsible. If nearly having a hand in someone dying (again this is more of a writing fault on Rowling) doesn't make you grow up, I am hard-pressed to find something that will. I have never gone to war and I have thankfully never been a part of somebody nearly dying so I am not at liberty to say which will make you grow the fuck up more
