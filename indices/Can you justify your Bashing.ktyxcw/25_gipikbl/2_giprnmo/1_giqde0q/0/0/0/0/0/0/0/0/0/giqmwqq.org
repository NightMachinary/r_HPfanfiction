You said you're 17 right? Not attempting to undermine you here, but from that I can tell you aren't "grown up" So to speak. Once you're older, you realize that people can and do change. Odds are a childhood bully isn't going to be the same type of person as an adult. People can change and grow. Not only James, but anyone.
