It was released by Rowling for a charity thing (I think). Imo as long as it's not from after she started saying stupid shit on Twitter, it's canon.

"Go out with me and I'll never lay a wand on Snivilly again", "Don't make me hex you" two direct quotes from the book that James said to Lily

I am 17 so it works for this argument because James supposedly matured from 15-17. I am relatively the same person I was two years ago aside from the anti anxiety meds I started taking. I was stubborn and a bit temperamental at 15 and it hasn't really changed very drastically and drastic change is what would be required

Yes Snape is an asshole. This is an indisputable fact. The fact that he was abused, bullied, nearly murdered, and discarded by everyone around him goes a lot towards explaining it but it by no means it justifies or excuses it

If James had let Snape die, Remus would be hauled away for killing a student and being an unregistered werewolf. It was in James' best interests that Snape not get killed and if he hadn't gone right back to bullying Snape I would have a much easier time believing it was an altruistic action rather than James covering Lupin's ass
