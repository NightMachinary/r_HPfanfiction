Someone being a teenager shouldn't change how their actions are perceived. You can be a 15 year old kid and not treat people like shit because you wish their hot friend would date you. And James is an even bigger asshole because he's a spoiled rich kid who always gets whatever he wants and is jealous of the poor Slytherin boy the pretty girl would rather hang out with so he torments him. One of the reasons I greatly dislike James is because despite Snape nearly getting killed and it being the fault of the Marauders, he keeps bullying him. This is largely a writing flaw because had Rowling simply switched Snape's worst memory and the whomping willow incident and made the whomping willow incident a turning point in James' character, I would probably like him a lot more
