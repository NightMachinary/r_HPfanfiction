An asshole can change, especially a 15 year old who was never told no because of his parents. A war going on can also change how people act/make them grow up faster. James changed over time. You don't seem to realize that or are purposely ignoring that fact.

Maybe I'm misremembering here (I could be, I'm sorry if I am), but are we sure he kept bullying Snape afterwards?
