Oh I'm not cynical because I have a childhood bully. And I'm not saying that James can't change, just that from my perspective he doesn't change or he hasn't changed yet. Like I said from ages 15-17 I am for the most part the same person. I haven't had something big happen to me that could make me become a different person. James did and he remained an arrogant douchebag. Over time, he maybe could change. It may take a while but after a war and being a father, by the time he's in his mid to late twenties or early thirties he could be much more responsible. The inevitable divorce he and Lily would go through (they got married way too young and regardless of whether or not James was still an asshole they would've still probably gotten divorced. #highschoolrelationshipsareforsuckers) would definitely help with that
