The Muggle Cop thing isn't canon. It wasn't written in the books so for sake of argument it isn't canon.

Also: We don't really know how James and Lily interacted, we have a bit from canon to work with and that's it. James harassing Lily/constantly asking her out is complete fan fiction, not canon.

People change and grow. I don't know how old you are, but assuming you're an adult, I highly doubt you're exactly the same person you were at 15.

Snape bullied Harry, Neville, Hermione and anyone else who wasn't Slytherin. HE was the adult, the one in charge.

James and Snape had more of an equal footing because they were both hot headed teenagers, and from again the little we saw, it seemed like James and Sirius were the only ones who bullied him. Remus seemed to sit it out and Peter seemed to egg it on.

I highly doubt that James wanted Snape dead. He wasn't a heartless bastard. Who knows maybe he overheard what Sirius said, maybe Peter told him, or maybe even Sirius himself told him, his conscious getting the better of him. We don't know how James found out, after all what was going to happen.

He could have let Snape die, but James didn't. That shows he has a heart/that he cares. Dumbledore might have been able to cover it up somehow. Eileen didn't go to the magical world and Tobias didn't care about Snape enough.
