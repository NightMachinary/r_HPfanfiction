James is better. James grew up, Snape never did. And you could say it's because Snape's a Spy, but I call BS on that. He could have changed, he could have been there for Harry, but wasn't. He helped Harry out when necessary, but he did it out of his love/obsession with Lily more than anything.

Also I'm a Snape fan, I like Snape's flaws. But would hate him in real life.
