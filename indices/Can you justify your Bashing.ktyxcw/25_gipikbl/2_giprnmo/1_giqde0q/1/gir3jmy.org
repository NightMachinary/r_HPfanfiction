  Far from it actually he is kind of a dick. But James is no better

Dude, if you think that a war hero who fought & defied Voldemort multiple times to protect his family and muggleborns is no better than an actual death eater you've drunk way too much of the cool aid.

Yes, every villain is a victim of their circumstances. That doesn't excuse their actions. James was a mean little bully until he got his act together, but he didn't make Snape join a terrorist organization and James, as opposed to Snape, atoned for his mistakes by becoming a better person.
