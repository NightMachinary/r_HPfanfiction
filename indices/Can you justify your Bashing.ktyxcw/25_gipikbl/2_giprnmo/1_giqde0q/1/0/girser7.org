Dude war heroes can still be shitbags. They are not mutually exclusive at all. They are both shitbags. Snape joined the death eaters because they were the only people who actually accepted him, similar to how a cult works. And again, we never actually see James be a better person. All we ever see of him is him being a jackass and there is evidence of him still being this way after Hogwarts ie after he supposedly changed. Maybe I am completely wrong and he really did turn things around. But it's a classic example of show don't tell. We are told all these good things about James and we are told he matures but all we ever see of him is him being a douche bag and an asshole
