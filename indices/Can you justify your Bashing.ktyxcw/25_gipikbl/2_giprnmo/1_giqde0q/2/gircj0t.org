Snape did not care for anything apart from Lily and it was to the point of obsession and that is the only reason he turned from Voldemort not because he cared about a kid being murdered (I mean he was the one who informed Voldemort) no he cared about Lily not surviving and that is why he asked for her to be spared not Harry who is a kid.

James on the other hand hated Snape but so did Snape and he still saved him from Remus but if James was the way you said he was -who is the biggest bully, is a person who condemns dark magic but still uses it (though that was never in the books, if it is then I would like to know where) would have left Snape to die he wouldn't even care for his friend who would have turned into a murderer so yes James is definitely better then Snape.

If by saying that Snape is the way he is because he was from an abusive home then the same would apply to Harry as well though with Harry it went furthermore than just abusive home, having professor who bullied just because he resembled his father and having a murdering dark lord who wants him dead but still Harry did not turn out that way.

I think you are getting confused with what is actually in the books and the fan fictions. It is not the same thing I hate the canon Snape but I love the Snape that is depicted in FF he is one of my fav character after Harry but that doesn't change the fact that the actual Snape was biggest jerk and kind of evil.
