Honestly the fact that Snape cares for nothing in this world besides Lily is really depressing and makes me sympathize with Snape more. How shitty must your life have been to make there be only one person in the entire world that you actually give a shit about

Hexes are dark magic I think. Also, he specifically saved Snape from Remus, an illegal werewolf who was his friend and was not supposed to be in the school. And he goes right back to bullying Snape. Because of this stuff I do not believe that James saved Snape for altruistic reasons. He saved him to cover for Remus

I am of the personal belief that abuse victims will become way better people or assholes themselves. Harry had a big support system and was regarded as a hero by everyone around him except Malfoy. Snape on the other hand was bullied by James and ignored by his teachers despite being a fantastic student, and even his best friend took a small amount of pleasure in watching Snape be tortured. Snape was completely alone, had no support system, and had nothing in the entire world he actually cared about except for Lily. It's no wonder Snape became an asshole while Harry did not

I am actually not. I know Snape is an asshole in the books. My argument is simply that James really isn't much better. The kind of person Snape is is really irrelevant to the kind of person James was. James was an asshole and we are not given anything more than super biased testimony and circumstantial evidence that he actually changed
