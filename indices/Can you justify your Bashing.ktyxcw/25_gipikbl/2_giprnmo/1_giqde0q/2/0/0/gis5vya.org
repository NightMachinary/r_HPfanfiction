Actually in canon Snape had friends in his house so Lily wasnt his only friend, she was his first yes but not the only one.

As for the incident what I was trying to say about James saving Snape for whatever reason James did save Snape (just to save his own ass) and when Snape was put in the same situation did he even for a second think of saving James from Voldemort just for the sake of life debt that Snape owed James no he didnt the only person he wanted was Lily.

The part where you said Lily was the only one who cared for him is not canon it is again FF as that part of relationship is not explained in detail.

  I am of the personal belief that abuse victims will become way better people or assholes themselves. Harry had a big support system and was regarded as a hero by everyone around him except Malfoy. Snape on the other hand was bullied by James and ignored by his teachers despite being a fantastic student, and even his best friend took a small amount of pleasure in watching Snape be tortured. Snape was completely alone, had no support system, and had nothing in the entire world he actually cared about except for Lily. It's no wonder Snape became an asshole while Harry did not

Harry did not have any kind of support system before Hogwarts but he was still kind, timid and scared yes but not cruel. Snape was like that from the start the only reason he befriended Lily was because she had magic, would he have been friends with her if she was muggle of course not.

Again James bullying Snape has been only mentioned twice in the books once when Harry sees the memory and once when he gets it cleared Sirius and Remus and nowhere does it mention Snape was ignored by his teachers and Lily did not take any pleasure in Snape suffering she was the only who defended him but was called a mudblood in return, it hurts more when you get called racial slurs by a friend then by an enemy. So he wasn't a good friend also to his only 'support system'. So please tell me where does it mention James went onto bully Snape again and again or was ignored by his teachers. I would actually like to now if I have missed out on it in the books.

Snape was never scared of James and Sirius (expected of a victim of bullying) because it shows in his and Sirius's interaction in OOTP. They had the same kind of relationship like Harry and Draco no one inferior if at one time one person was pranked/shamed the other person did get their revenge though Harry and Drace never fought with that level of hate as James and Snape.

The only difference is James grew up and fought in a war, war changes people it makes you grow and face the reality. Bullies are usually cowards and they run when they have to take a stand for something James proved again and again that he had changed because he did take a stand he did defy Voldemort thrice. I am in no way saying that what James did to Snape was not wrong it was wrong but in the end he is human and humans are flawed but if we have to judge a person based on one incident is it fair and all the other good deeds not counted? there is something called redemption, accepting your mistakes and moving on and trying to whatever good you can and I think that is what James did. Snape was stuck in past reliving the same thing and that is why there is no growth in his character at all.

Yes hexes are dark but it was Snape who invented a dark curse whereas the marauders invented the Hogwarts map almost at the same age so which is better?

Edit: Remus was in school with Dumbledore's permission why do you say he was not supposed to be in school.
