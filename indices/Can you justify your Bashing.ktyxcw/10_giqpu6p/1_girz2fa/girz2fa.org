I mean I understand, but people often think that Ginny's rude to Fleur because she's jealous of her beauty of something. Don't forget, Fleur was meant to be very condescending and irritating, maybe even more so to Ginny than we see in Harry's perspective. Also, Zacharias Smith was also portrayed as incredibly obnoxious and the bat bogey hex is quite harmless. It's not like she crucioed him or something. I believe he said something quite personal that made her hex him, and it's not like she was the first person to do something like that /cough/ Hermione /cough/. The verbal attack on Ron was uncalled for, although it's justifiable. These are just my opinions of course; you are obviously entitled to disliking anyone you please :). I do wish she was better written; she could've been a very interesting especially after the Chamber incident, but alas...
