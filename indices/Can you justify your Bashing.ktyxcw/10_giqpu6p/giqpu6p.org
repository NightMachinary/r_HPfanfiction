I don't write fanfics, but I dislike Ginny Weasley. It's not because she's dating Harry, but I found her a tad underdeveloped and sorta rude.

•She makes fun of Fleur

•I never really saw much character development, as I said, /(I know it was sorta from Harry's POV, but I would at least expect to be shown)/

•I can understand her getting mad at Ron for him nagging her about dating so many different boys or whatnot, but her making personal attacks about people having been kissing, and he hasn't? Not my style.

•Spelled a boy for asking/nagging about what happened at the DoM, /(I can understand being annoyed, but seriously. I mean Siriusly!!!)/ and then she gets into the Slug Club for being good at that spell, not getting in trouble at all.

*I hope in no way I have offended anyone, these are just my opinions. If I got some of the facts wrong or something, you can tell me!!*
