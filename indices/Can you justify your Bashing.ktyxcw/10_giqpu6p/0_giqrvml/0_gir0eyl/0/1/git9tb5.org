Fair enough, and I'd actually forgotten that, so thank you.

My point was more: None of Ginny's kids are named after her family, or people that meant a lot to her. They're named after /Snape/ and /Dumbledor!/

And kind of randomly: Luna. I mean, I love Luna in fics, but I don't think she was /that/ close to Harry and Ginny in canon...
