Linkffn(Duty II by Dyce) is one of my favorite examples of this. Just a short one-shot, but it makes Percy's role in canon so much better

Edit: it's actually the sequel where Percy is spying at the ministry, the first one just explains some of Percy's character in GoF in a sympathetic way. Linking the sequel instead, though the first is definitely worth reading also.
