I try not to show my disdain for him in my own fics, but Percy Weasley is undoubtedly my least favorite character in the series. How he treats Harry in GoF and OotP combined with how he treats his /own family/ just leaves me feeling sick to my stomach every time I think about it. Also, his last-minute redemption leaves me seething in rage as it was just so unexpected and also felt like it didn't really pull through with his character arc.

Like, not saying Percy should've joined the Death Eaters or anything, but if he had died instead of Fred (or even alongside Fred), I'd have a better opinion of him and the direction that JKR took with his character.
