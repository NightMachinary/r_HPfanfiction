A Fanfic author doesn't have to justify anything. But if you mean to ask if a story with bashing can ever be good then I would say no.

But then again, 90% of Fanfics are awful anyway.

Personally, I don't hate any fictional character: they just don't mean enough to me. Frankly, I'm struggling to think of any real people I hate.
