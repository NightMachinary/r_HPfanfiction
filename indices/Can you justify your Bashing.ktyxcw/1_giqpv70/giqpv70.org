I was playing among us of all things and I usually act dumb when I'm imposter and this dude told me: “ you can't act dumb and smart at the same time” cause I was playing detective the other game. In the same token, Dumbledore can't act both omniscient and ignorant at the same time. “I didn't know Harry was being abused” isn't a good defense at all. Mf you put him there with his abusive relatives, apparently with no paperwork and no input from his rightful guardian at all. You can't just leave him be without checking up on him at least once a year. And even if you don't want to interact with his relatives in case they don't take too kindly being reminded of magic, (which shouldn't be the case considering harry is magical.) you are after all a transfiguration master and failing that, you can become literally invisible at a flick of a wand. If you're too busy to visit the child of two war heroes and the child you put in the hand of abusers, then you have too many positions and need to vacate at least one of them. So you see, you can't act like you always know what's going on but act like you're ignorant of the abuse that is being inflicted on harry. Can't have it both ways.
