Now /there's/ a fic idea: Harry is taken away from the Dursley's because law enforcement tends to ask questions when people randomly get new children without filing for it.

Harry ends up in a really nice foster home, loved by his new foster family, all because Dumbledore didn't get the paperwork done on the non-magical side of things.

Overall: I agree, Dumbledore is a bit contradictory like that.
