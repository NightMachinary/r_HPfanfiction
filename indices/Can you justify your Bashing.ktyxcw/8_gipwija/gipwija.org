I don't write fanfictuon much. But I do like to bash dumbledore. The reason is quite simply his actions surrounding the students in his care is appalling.

In 1st year. He has teachers create a series of potentially deadly traps to protect the philosopher's stone, but then he leave the door with it locked and a waring to pre-teens and teenagers (whi are too curious for their own good (o would know im 17)) and doesn't think to do something like the fields charm with Nicolas Flamel as the secret keeper or something else to keep the students away.

Im 3rd year, it is said that the minister was always owling him to ask for advice, so why couldn't someone with that much political sway, a) stop the dementors being at hogwarts and traumatising students, and b) get Sirius a trial for something he was innocent of.

It is similar in 4th year, he has all of this political sway, yet he is being pushed around by the ministry.

In 5th year (and this goes for all of the staff as well), how did he not notice that lots of students were getting words carved into their skin. The lack of awareness of their students makes me think they should have been fired ages ago.

In 6th year and 7th year, he kept his cards way too close to his chest. He never told Harry anything until he absolutely had to, and he was as cryptic as possible about it as well.

The other major thing, is lack of care for his student's home lives. He sent 3 major boys back to abusive situations repeatedly, after being asked by them not to be sent back. Tom Riddle grew up in an orphanage during WW2, he was exorcised at aged 6 and he was mistreated by everyone there. Severus Snape's father was a muggle who would hit him and his mother, so he found refuge at Lily's house. And Harry Potter relatives kept him in a cupboard for 11 years, locked him in, starved him, then when he was moved, he got 12 locked on his door and a catflap in which they would put tins of soup (uncooked), put bars on his window and would only let him out for 5 minutes to shower and use the bathroom. Dumbledore kept sending these kids back to their relatives and it's upsetting and in my opinion deserves to be bashed. Also, the argument that he was brought up in the 1800s and doesn't understand is a bad one as he has had over 100 years to learn what is and isn't acceptable any more.

Anyway, these are, in my opinion, the reasons why Dumbledore deserves to be bashed.

Thanks to whoever read till the end
