I dont like Hermione, its mostly because fanfiction depict her as this perfect woman with godly intelligence, even though in the books, and movies shes just above average, and studies the most for their "quest" that year.

Dumbledore, I dont particularly care for bashing fics because they're so overdone. Along with that I think its more interesting to see a fic that depicts him as a character who regrets his actions greatly, but still does them because he thinks they're the right choice instead of a fic that just says Dumbledore is evil. And continues to bash him. Yes he's done things but I feel like its an overdone trope.

Weasley, I dont care honestly.
