One that I hate will have to be ginny weasley. I just can't see the point of her, neither did I find her particularly kind. She bullied luna when she got "popular". Didn't seem to regard anyone feelings when she cheated on Dean Thomas with other people; and of it wasn't for that she felt so mary Sue to me. 'She's perfect.' 'Everyone loves her.' ' I hear..ect, ect.'

Ginny and harry relationship also seemed so rushed, maybe I can blame the author on that one, but I just can't seem to like the relationship nor the character. She always seemed like an extra, just another character to further the plot in book two. There's really not much to know about this girl besides her family, quidditch, bat biggie hex and her obsession with harry.

And then 'Bam'! She now perfect, and some warrior princess..I just can't believe it. ( I'm exaggerating how many think of her in the war) there's another character I can't stand but I don't want to make it to long. Sorry for any mistakes
