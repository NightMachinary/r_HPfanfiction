I feel like I might have helped inspire this discussion through my reply to your Ron/Luna post. Here's a mini-rant on the subject from a week or so ago.

There's a whole bunch of stuff not mentioned there as well. Creeping over Harry's scar on the Express, anti-Slytherin behaviour, the Scabbers/Crookshanks thing, accusing Harry of lying about entering the Triwiz, abandoning the Horcrux hunt and major anti-intellectual vibes.

It's been a while since I reread the original series so I can't remember exact quotes, and it's not an important enough matter to merit the effort.

I admit that I don't hate /everything/ about him, though. Red hair grants +10 awesomeness points, and I like having a reason to use the word 'twunt'.

Not a fan of Dumbledore either, but [[/u/WhistlingBanshee][u/WhistlingBanshee]] already has that covered.
