Ron's anti-slytheirn behaviour is almost entirely fanon. See this thread for more on that: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/byu3g9/does_ron_have_prejudice_against_slytherin/]]

Also, the Crookshanks thing was entirely Hermione's fault, there was so much evidence that Crookshanks ate Scabbers it's laughable that you could pin that on Ron.

Downvoting but not disproving, I wonder why?
