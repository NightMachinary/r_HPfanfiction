Crookshanks was on Hermione. She bought a cat that has a taste for rats, when her best friend has a rat. When Ron tells her that crookshanks has it in for Scabbers, she rejects the possibility. All Ron wants to do is let Scabbers roam the dormitory so he can die in peace. When Scabbers goes missing. There is a substance that appears to be blood. Hermione rejects the possibility of crookshanks having eaten Scabbers, despite multiple prior attempts. Crookshanks and Ron were in the right. Hermione was the one at fault there.

Everything else on Ron is valid though. He was a bit creepy at eleven
