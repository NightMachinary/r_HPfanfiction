I'm not dismissing the argument against Hermione with this one, she 100% turned a blind eye, but surely the griff tower would have more than one cat in it. You've also got the fact that he was part Kneazle, and Scabbers was human. Or, why wasn't he killed by another cat earlier? (Also it was probably meant to establish the untrustworthy/forshadowing, but we don't discuss that here)
