The problem with loyalty it's not something you can only be occasionally. An act of betrayal negates loyalty entirely. Especially a second one.

I don't think Ron is a bad person, but I also don't think he's someone who you'd want watching your back during a war. I think he'd be a decent friend, especially after some growing up, in a peace time setting, though. Not everyone is built for war.

Neville would be a much better hero's friend, as he'd likely have been loyal and, after his wand broke, we'd discover he's capable too.
