  and we all know that the social knives that cut the deepest don't come from your enemies, but from your friends.

It's important to remember that being openly hostile (like we see in HP with Draco vs the rest) is pretty rare. I wouldn't call people who do that shit to each other 'friends', but yeah, it's all about making someone feel "you are worthless!" without outright telling them. It's about establishing dominance, while still showing somewhat acceptable behavior in pubilc.
