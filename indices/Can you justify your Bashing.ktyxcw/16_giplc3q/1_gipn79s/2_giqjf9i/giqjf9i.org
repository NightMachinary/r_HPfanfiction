I can't agree that he is loyal though. The most I can concede is that he is loyal when it is convenient. And if he was truelly a loyal person, his jealously wouldn't be a repeating wedge between them. It could also be argued that this is more his immaturity than a lack of loyalty, but I am of the opinion that these 2 things go hand in hand, or at least have a large ammount of overlap.

Also, even though he never used slurs like malfoy did, Ron was about as mentally abusive towards hermione as draco was. In some ways, Ron was worse, as malfoy was obvious in his contempt of hermione, ron did all his mental bashing under the guise of being "a friend", and we all know that the social knives that cut the deepest don't come from your enemies, but from your friends.
