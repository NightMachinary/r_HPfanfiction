  You have to remember that he is still a child throughout most of the series

Judging him by the standards I had /at the same age/ kind of invalidates the 'he was just a kid' thing.

When I read the first four books, before the first movie was released, 11-12y/o me thought 11-14y/o Ron was a dick.

When OotP was released, 14y/o me thought 15y/o Ron was a dick.

When HBP was released, 16y/o me thought 16y/o Ron was a dick.

When DH was released, 18y/o me thought 17y/o Ron was a dick.

Adulthood hasn't done much to change my opinion of him for better or for worse, I just have better words to describe him now. Like 'twunt'. It's a good word.
