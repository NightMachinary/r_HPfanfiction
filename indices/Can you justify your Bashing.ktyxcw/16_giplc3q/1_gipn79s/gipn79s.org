You did indeed help inspire it! Thank you!

You do cover some valid points on Ron. You have to remember that he is still a child throughout most of the series, and does have his good points too. He is loyal to Harry (barring the events you mentioned), funny (depends on your taste I suppose), and brave.

He does do some stupid things, but at all do at that age.
