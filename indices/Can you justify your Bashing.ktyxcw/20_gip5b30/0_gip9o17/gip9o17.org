Yeah, but isn't that kind of why everyone hates Dumbledore? Because he worked so hard to make sure that Harry felt that his own life was worth so much less than anyone else's. I honestly don't think I would describe Harry's saving people thing as a Hero Complex. I think it's a combination of lack of self worth, and a distrust towards authority figures, that combine to make him act regardless of risk, because he thinks that he's the only one willing to.
