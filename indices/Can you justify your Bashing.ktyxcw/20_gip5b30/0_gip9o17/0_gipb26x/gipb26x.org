I don't dislike Dumbledore. I've always said that “he did what he had to do.” And for obvious reasons some things are hardly justifiable but I do believe that he did what he had to do with the circumstances that were presented to him. I don't think Dumbledore's influence made Harry's feel like giving his life for everyone else without stoping to think what he felt about that decision was the right thing. I think it was in OTP that I formulated what I mean about his hero complex. I don't think the influence of authority figures have anything to do with it in my opinion. I agree that he was his own person even if he trusted Dumbledore with his life. And it's because of that independency that i see, and that drive to do the right thing without caring about anything else that it just doesn't sit right with me? He firmly believed everything was about him even tho he was genuine on his will to saving everyone and it was that task and that burden that led him to have the attitude that had never necessarily appeal to me.
