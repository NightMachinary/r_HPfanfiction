It's not that I hate him, he's just not even close to my top favorites: Harry. Hero complex. I know everyone's lives are on his shoulder and I know he went through more things that probably anyone. But- you can't deny his hero complex went beyond that and I just don't really like that aspect? I can't explain it but maybe what I'm trying to say is that- I like a lot more almost everyone else. Which is why I've never read a Harry centered fic. Ever.
