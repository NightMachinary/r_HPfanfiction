That's some questionable logic.

For one, Snape probably knows about the DADA curse because he keeps getting turned down, but it's never explicitly stated, as far as I know, and everyone else besides Dumbledore seems to regard it as more of a rumour.

Secondly, by outing Lupin, he goes from being hireable by only a few people who can work around his absences, to basically no one, because now everyone is aware he's a minority that basically everyone hates. Lupin probably would have resigned anyway because he's self-loathing and feels guilty for endangering kids, but that still doesn't give Snape the right to blab to everyone and torpedo any chance Lupin will ever have of finding another reliable job. It is never appropriate to out someone. Snape does so because he's a petty bully, and only ever punches down.
