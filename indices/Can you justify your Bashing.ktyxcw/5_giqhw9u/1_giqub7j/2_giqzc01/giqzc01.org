Well Snape already knew that Lupin wouldn't get to teach another year in Hogwarts because of the curse on DADA. So he thought that it won't matter if he outs him or not because he won't be teaching anyway. And Lupin already wouldn't get hired because he would have to regularly take time off and his employers would probably connect the dots. It's still a dick move for Snape to tell everyone that Lupin is a werewolf.
