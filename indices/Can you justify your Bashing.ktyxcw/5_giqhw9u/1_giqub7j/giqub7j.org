Just finished a rewatch with friends around Christmas, and the Lupin bit really hit me hard this time.

Snape outs his extremely disadvantaged and discriminated against minority colleague to the public and gets him fired from what is probably the best, most stable job he's ever had, forcing him to return to his life of miserable, likely Wolfsbane Potion-free poverty. And it's probably even worse now that a good portion of the country is now aware that Lupin is a werewolf that ran amok at a school, so he's probably not getting hired again anytime soon.

Considering that lycanthropy is written as a strong analogy to HIV/AIDS, and can be read very easily as a metaphor for other issues, (being LGBT, for one), it's such an utterly irredeemable thing for Snape to do.
