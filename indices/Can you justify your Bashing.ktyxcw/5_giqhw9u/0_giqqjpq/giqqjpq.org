Wow, for someone who dislikes Snape you're not giving him enough blame for his actions.

There needs to be a distinction made with the Lily mudblood incident. It was the straw that broke the camel's back as it were. He was already becoming a death eater and harming other muggleborns.

Then there is Lily's death, he was the one who gave the prophecy to Voldemort, almost certainly aware that it would lead to the murder of a baby and likely their family. The only reason he defected was because he realized that his obsession was in the crosshairs.
