Several people have already mentioned him, but I'll mention him again (repost from an old comment of mine)

*Albus Dumbledore.*

First chapter of the first book. Rather than knocking on the Dursleys' door in the morning, informing Petunia that her sister and brother-in-law have been murdered, that her nephew is now an orphan, and asking her to look after him, he abandons Harry at the doorstep in the middle of the night with a letter. But /fuck/ common decency, right?

Then, it gets worse. And /worse/.

- Not obliviating Snape into a vegetable or killing him outright when he's discovered spying on the prophecy.
- Taking custody of Harry after his parents' death and then abandoning him in a known abusive and neglectful household, and not checking on him and correcting the issue.
- Testifying against Sirius (that he was the Potters' secret keeper) without even talking to him about his betrayal, even though he was an Order member and betrayal was out of character. Not calling for a trial, not visiting Sirius in Azkaban to question him.
- Using Hogwarts as his personal fiefdom and testing ground rather than to benefit the students by hiring Snape, Lockhart, Lupin, Hagrid and Trelawney in teaching positions, and not firing Binns and Filch.
- Allowing rampant bullying in Hogwarts in the second, fourth and fifth books. Allowing teachers like Snape and Umbridge to bully and torture students.
- Keeping the Philosopher's Stone in Hogwarts knowing a Dark Lord was after it and thus risking the lives of all students.
- Suspecting Quirrel but not confronting him even after there's an attempt on Harry's life during the Quidditch match.
- Possibly using Harry as bait in the Philosopher's Stone gauntlet to test his hypothesis about the blood protection.
- Not doing anything about the Chamber of Secrets even after five decades, though he knew Voldemort was the culprit. Twelve year olds solved the problem.
- Leaving the petrified Muggleborns in the hospital wing for months rather than buying the restorative draught. Not evacuating Hogwarts even though the attacks killed a student last time. (Why was the Ministry not involved except to arrest Hagrid?)
- Not accompanying Fawkes to the Chamber of Secrets, and leaving the basilisk to Harry. (Don't tell me Fawkes believed the Sorting Hat was a better option than Dumbledore himself).
- Giving a Time Turner to a student for attending /extra/ classes. Not accompanying Harry & Hermione when they went back in time to save Sirius.
- Allowing an underage Harry to be shanghaied into the Triwizard tournament, which Dumbledore was responsible for preventing. Not helping him in any manner throughout the year.
- Not telling Harry the truth about Voldemort and the prophecy even after Voldemort's resurrection.
- Then, telling him half the truth when Harry was emotionally vulnerable after Sirius' death. Emotionally manipulating him throughout the conversation.
- Isolating Harry in an abusive, neglectful household and forcing his friends to cut meaningful communication, even after he's witnessed a student's death and the resurrection of his parents' murderer, even though there were viable and safe means of communication available like the bodyguards following him secretly.
- Having bodyguards follow Harry /secretly/. Trusting Mundungus for the position.
- Allowing Malfoy, a wannabe murderer and terrorist, free access to the school knowing that he's been tasked to kill him, even after two students are nearly killed. Admonishing Harry when confronted about this and then blatantly lying that he gives a shit about the students.
- Leaving the hunt for Voldemort's horcruxes to three teenagers rather than a few trustworthy and qualified adults. Not telling Harry /how/ to destroy horcruxes straightaway.
- Scheming and planning his suicide with Snape like some glorified cult leader. Trusting Snape above all other Order members. (Honestly, who trusts a spy /this/ much?)
- Scheming Harry's forced suicide-by-Voldemort with Snape, leaving Harry with no *practical* choice but to walk to his death because he was informed at the last possible moment that he was a horcrux. (Why? Because his answer is the only possible answer and that no one else could've found another way?)

This list (or rant) is not comprehensive by any means, but honestly, Aberforth was right about his brother.

And I sympathize with Dumbledore!bashing fics coz their worst flaw is that their authors lacked the talent/skill to express their anger and disgust with Dumbledore properly.
