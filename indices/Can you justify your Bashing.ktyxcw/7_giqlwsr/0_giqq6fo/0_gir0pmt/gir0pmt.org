  Rowling tells the reader that the character is (supposed to be) a genius, but shows the reader his idiocy. That he is supposed to be kind, but shows some acts that are absolutely evil.

Rowling does this a lot.

I'm gonna get flak for this, but my favorite example is Molly. Rowling tells us that she's this great maternal figure for Harry, but when it comes to Molly's actions, it's the twins who decide to rescue Harry from being starved in Dursley prison (and Molly is mad at them for taking action). IMHO she doesn't really do anything that shows deep caring, worry or affection for Harry, but she (and Rowling) talk a lot about it, so it feels like she does.

McGonagall has similar issues, where the idea of her character and stereotype trumps any of her actions (looking at Harry like more of a nuisance than anything else through most of the series).

But there are other, less controversial, examples. Like Snape: We are told that he is a double spy and therefore his actions make sense... but he doesn't act like a double spy would. If he's trying to pretend to be a good guy, it doesn't make sense to act blatantly evil and "death eaterish". Voldemort: "Yo snape, how come Dumbledore doesn't fire you? Shouldn't you pretend to be good if he's supposed to believe that you are reformed? It's almost as if Dumbledore is in on it, protecting you and you're only pretending to be evil...". Imagine if Dumbledore had a spy in Voldemort's ranks and he'd constantly be openly defying Voldemort and protecting innocents. "Gosh darn, it sure is strange that Voldemort hasn't uncovered my obvious spy yet".

We're also told that Snape holds genuine regret for his actions, but what we see is that he has no affection or sympathy towards Harry, a direct victim of Snape's heinous acts, who's also the child of the woman Snape (supposedly) loves. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This goes so far that many fans think he's just obsessed with Lily and doesn't know what love is, directly contradicting what the narrative is telling us, simply because his actions and his narrative idea are so incommensurable.
