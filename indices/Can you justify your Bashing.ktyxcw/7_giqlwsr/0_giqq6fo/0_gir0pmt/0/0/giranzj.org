Yup. IMHO this realization then leads two to options:

(a) Forget the plot and try to do the character ideas justice. For example a believably good/non-evil Dumbledore requires writing an almost unrecognizable AU, where everything is different (plot wise).

or

(b) Take the plot and character actions as is and at face value, which leads to what many consider character bashing even when it's just being honest with how they usually act.

These are the two fanfic categories that interest me the most. I really love a wise and grandfatherly Dumbledore, as long as he appears in category (a) fics. Justifying his actions and play-pretend (Dumbledore acts in mysterious ways! It's all part of his 4D chess benevolent plan!) which falls in neither (a) or (b) makes me gag a little.
