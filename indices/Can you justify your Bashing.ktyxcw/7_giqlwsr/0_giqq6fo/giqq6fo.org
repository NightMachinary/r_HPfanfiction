You see, all the things you listed as Dumbledore's failures were required by the plot. In failing the "show, don't tell" rule, Rowling tells the reader that the character is (/supposed/ to be) a genius, but shows the reader his idiocy. That he is supposed to be kind, but shows some acts that are absolutely evil.

Even small things could fix some of the problems you listed.

#+begin_quote
  Not accompanying Harry & Hermione when they went back in time to save Sirius.
#+end_quote

"While it is my responsibility, I'm afraid I must leave rescuing Sirius to the two of you. Hogwarts can only have one headmaster at a time, and I have no wish to duplicate the results of Headmaster Englebert's attempt to get through his paperwork more quickly. I'm afraid our resident Healer would have some harsh words with me. At Christmas... by the time she finished putting me back together."

#+begin_quote
  Allowing an underage Harry to be shanghaied into the Triwizard tournament, which Dumbledore was responsible for preventing.
#+end_quote

"The portraits I charged with watching the Goblet of Fire alerted me each time an underage student attempted to cross the age line. Mr. Potter did not do so. Alastor personally checked the cup itself every night, and he has been unable to determine exactly how Mr. Potter's name was entered."

Just little things like that would /show/ that Dumbledore is flawed, but not stupid for the plot's sake.
