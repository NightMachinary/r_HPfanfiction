  You see, all the things you listed as Dumbledore's failures were required by the plot. In failing the "show, don't tell" rule, Rowling tells the reader that the character is (/supposed/ to be) a genius, but shows the reader his idiocy. That he is supposed to be kind, but shows some acts that are absolutely evil.
