Bashing fics for me are like rollercoasters. I don't mean it in the typical twist and turns ways either. When you are approaching the rollercoaster you see the entire track before you even get in line, but even knowing what's comming you get in line cause it's fun.

You have a very black and white perspective in bashing fics, this is good this is bad. Also, in a world where injustice is so often not addressed it is nice to have a fic where you know the villain will get punished and the good guy is going to have some quippy things to say while doing it. They may not be the most well written, or complex things, but they are easy fun and not a huge emotional investment.
