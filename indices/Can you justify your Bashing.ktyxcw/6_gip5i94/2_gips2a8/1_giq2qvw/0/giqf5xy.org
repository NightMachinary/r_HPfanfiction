I like Dumbledore, but he had a hell of a lot of flaws. Could have told Harry the visions, that would have helped Harry, rather than hinder him. He could have let Harry talk to his friends, instead of abandoning him for months after Sirius died.

Maybe he did care about Harry too much as he said, maybe he was doing his best, but his best wasn't good enough, not when he could have helped Harry more.
