Dumbledore left a boy, a 14 year old child, completely alone in his abusive household right after he had just been kidnapped, tortured and watched his friend die infront of him. He offered no help. No consolidation. He sent Sirius out of the fucking room so he could interrogate Harry alone. He cut Harry off from his friends, his family for 2 months and forbid them from telling him the truth about what was happening in the wizarding world.

He creates such trust issues in Harry (who already doesn't trust adults from the years of abuse from the Dursleys) that Harry won't go talk to ANY of his teachers about the fact he is being LITERALLY TORTURED by Umbridge. And on top of that, he forces Harry to have occlumency lessons, a skill that is very intrusive and personal, from Snape, a bully who actively dispises him.

And this is without even bringing up the emotional issues if the Trial or the visionsor the stress of Voldemort being back and no one believing him that, again, Harry wouldn't talk about not even to his friends because he wasn't given a chance to when it happened and instead was isolated for 2 months.

Dumbledore is the reason Sirius dies. If Dumbledore had been open with Harry about the visions and what they mean, he wouldn't have believed them. If Harry had any scrap of trust in adults, he would have trusted Snape. If Dumbledore had taught Harry legilimency rather than Snape, he wouldn't have had the visions. If Dumbledore hadn't have isolated Harry then maybe Harry would have talked to someone about his issues. But no. Dumbledore created the anger, fustration, fear and mistrust in Harry that leads him to wildly follow Sirius to the Ministry. that wouldn't happen if Dumbledore cared for Harry.

And this isnt even going into the HUGE stockholm sydrome twist shit that happens in the 6th book where suddenly Dumbledore won't leave Harry alone. And there's trust issues there. The opening to HBP is heartbreaking. Harry doesn't even pack because he doesn't trust that Dumbledore would actually show up when he says he will.

And again, I'm not touching the fact that Dumbledore kept so much ridiculous shit from Harry that definately would have helped him defeat Voldemort waay faster but noo. Dumbledore fully expects Harry to die and not survive the killing curse. That's why he doesn't tell Harry any of this shit. Because he needs Harry to be niave so he won't run from his 'destiny'. Because the only way to defeat Voldemort is for Harry to die (neither can live while the other survives) so he needs Harry dead. And he'll manipulate Harry in any way he can to get him there...

I've issues with Dumbledore in the other 5 books too but I won't get into them. He works as a dramatic character in the story to create mystery but I don't like him he's aa dickhead.
