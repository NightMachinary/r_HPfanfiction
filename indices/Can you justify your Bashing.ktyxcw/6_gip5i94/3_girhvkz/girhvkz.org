First I agree with all the points plus there's the whole leaving a 15 month old child on a door step in November, I don't care about any spells he could have theoretically placed on him you don't do that it gets cold at night especially that time of year I'm taking near freezing here. Couldn't he have waited till light and physically handed him over because you know kids that age are perfectly capable of getting up and walking it's not like there would have been much between him and the road.
