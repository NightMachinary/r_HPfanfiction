  Tbh I'm surprised that I haven't seen a fic use that as a divergence point. As a one-shot, at least.

This idea has the same problem that a lot of "Dumbledore isn't incompetent" fic ideas do: If Dumbledore got off his ass and actually did something? The entire series would be over by book 4.

Teacher is possessed? Dumbledore fixes it.

Chamber of Secrets open and the students are being paralysed? Dumbledore knuckles down, works out that it's a Basilisk (if Hermione can figure that out, so can he) and starts getting Basilisk protections put in place (like a lot of roosters). And also pays for all the cures that he needs for the students.

And so on and so forth.

Now, don't get me wrong, your idea is cool, and I really like it. It's just my opinion of why no one has written it.
