Yeah, but I feel most stories that have the "adults are useless" trope at least have better reasons than "they didn't feel like it", as seems to be the case concerning Dumbledore and the Time Turner.

Or have a reason /at all/. Dumbledore doesn't even offer a reason he can't go back and save Sirius, he just walks off!
