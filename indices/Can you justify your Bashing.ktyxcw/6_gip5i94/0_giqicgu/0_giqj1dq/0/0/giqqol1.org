Yeah, I made a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b2wv2x/prompt_third_year_dumbledore_accompanies_harry/][prompt post]] about Dumbledore accompanying Harry and Hermione when they time travel to save Sirius, and it got no real response.

I think Dumbledore accompanying them would make for good reading too instead of the adult just solving the problem.

Imagine this.

Dumbledore and Hermione explain time turners and the rules involved to Harry and the shit that could happen if they break those rules. They watch past!Hermione smack Malfoy and the two teens are horrified that Dumbledore witnessed that; only to find their headmaster humming and commenting on the beautiful sunset.

He then questions Harry and Hermione about where exactly they were when Lupin transformed and Pettigrew made his escape, and then tasks them with freeing Buckbeak. When asked what he'd be doing, he says, "laying down mousetraps."

When all is said and done, with the hippogriff free, the rat captured, and the werewolf subdued, Harry drags them to the edge of the lake because he swears they were saved from the Dementors by his father.

Dumbledore looks at him and says quietly, "Harry, perhaps you may have tired of hearing this, but you do look remarkably like your father."

Harry stares at his headmaster blankly before charging off and casting a brilliant patronus.

They then watch Snape take their past selves to the castle, and once Sirius is locked in, they break him out again and take him to the Hospital Wing (and watch their past selves go back in time).

When Fudge and Snape arrive, fuming that Black escaped and the latter blaming Potter, they find the trio in their beds, Sirius being treated by Pomfrey and all of them, including Dumbledore happily drinking hot chocolate. Also, Pettigrew is tied up in the middle of the room.

Bonus scene at the end: Dumbledore asks Snape to meet him in his office. He wants to know how multiple Death Eaters in Azkaban knew Pettigrew was responsible for the Potters' deaths and that Sirius was innocent, but his spy somehow didn't know the same.

Edit: Pomfrey, not Pomfret.
