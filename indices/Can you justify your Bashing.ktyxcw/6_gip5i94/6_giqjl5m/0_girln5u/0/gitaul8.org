Hell, Shifu at least literally has a moment where he basically goes "okay, everyone out, I'll do this myself and die trying" with Tai Lung. That's kind of the total /opposite/ of this problem.

Kung Fu Panda dodges the "mentor is useless" thing by just having the action not be where Shifu is for the most part (2 and the back half of 3). Whenever Shifu's around, and not fighting Kai (who's literally magic), he kicks all kinds of ass.

It can even be argued that he /could/ beat Tai Lung, he just lacks the heart to actually do it.
