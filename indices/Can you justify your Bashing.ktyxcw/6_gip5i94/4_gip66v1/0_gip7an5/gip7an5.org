I love OoTP because Harry is such a damp hobnob the entire time and I find it hillarious.

That man is 150 years old. He knows when he is making mistakes. He is old enough that his mistakes shouldn't be this detrimental to a child's wellbeing especially not when he is headmaster of a fecking school. And undoubtedly McGonagall, Molly or Sirius would have raised concerns about how Harry was being treated and still nothing was done. Sirius didn't even know Snape was teaching him Legilimency until Harry told him and Sirius was furious.

He can say sorry all he likes but I don't forgive him. He caused too much damage to be forgiven. Isolating someone after they've just been tortured is bad, that's not a mistake that's an active choice. Sending Sirius out of the room when Harry came back from the Graveyard when Harry SPECIFICALLY DOESNT WANT SIRIUS TO LEAVE is not a mistake it's a choice. Those things were wrong and a blind person could see they were wrong. So no. I don't forgive him and he can have all the shit that comes his way because Dumbledore at no point in that series ever looked out for Harry or showed any ounce that he actually cared about him as a person rather than as a pawn to defeat Voldemort.
