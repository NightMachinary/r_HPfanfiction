Very well put.

This is possibly why OotP is my least favourite book, along with the fact that Harry acts terribly through the entire year.

To be fair, Dumbledore recognises that a lot of his actions were mistakes later on. I won't bash him completely, because he does have a lot of good qualities, but I think if somebody read OotP in a vacuum with having only a rough idea of the plot of the preceding four books, I can definitely see how he would come off very badly.
