Not only is he a dickhead, he's also bad at the things he gets praise for. The whole history of his life is laden with abject failure *everywhere* (Grindlewald, Riddle, Being a proper/competent Headmaster, Order of the Phoenix, the Potters), but for some reason he's seen as a sign of hope?

Even if he would claim that everything he does (to Harry and Wizarding Britain) is for good reason and some kind of noble goal, I'd have no reason to believe or trust in his judgement. Years ago I made a pretty long [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6baf8d/whats_so_great_about_that_dumbledore_guy_long/][post]] about what a huge failure this guy is.
