I really like how complicated Dumbledore is, I like his character, but definitely agree of everyone you wrote out. He messed up, on more than one occasion, and instead of learning from the mistake and doing better, he continues to make mistakes where Harry was considered.

Even if he did believe that Harry would return from death, there's still so much more he could have done to help him, to help defeat Voldemort sooner, rather than later.

Also: Dumbledore is a pretty respected man, why the heck didn't he contact Amelia Bones and tell her the truth about Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew? He also has (retired) Alastor Moody, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Tonks on his side to help in the Auror department.

I know that Truth serum and Pensives aren't usually a thing in courts, but surely they could have done something to make sure that Sirius was freed, but he didn't.
