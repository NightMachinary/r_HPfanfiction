I've always felt that Voldemort was kind of, uh, not a great person.

Like, you can't tell me that he has a permit for that exotic snake he owns, and the fact that he keeps her in a confined space during Book 7 is just icing on the cake.

He borrowed Lucius Malfoy's wand, broke it, and didn't apologize.

When he hugged Draco Malfoy in Deathly Hallows, Draco was clearly uncomfortable but Voldemort either didn't pick up on that or didn't care. Whichever it was, I think that's clear evidence that Voldemort isn't good about respecting other people's boundaries (though if we assume he just wasn't aware, then there's lots of potential for improvement there). It's almost as bad as how Tonks kept asking Lupin to go out with her until he gave in, if you ask me.

Voldemort is also very unkind to others: he insulted Hagrid and he's always so demeaning to Pettigrew. Honestly, the way that he makes Pettigrew hurt himself, then hurts Pettigrew, then gives Pettigrew a shiny new hand, well, it feels like a bit of an abusive relationship there, you know?

I could go on, but I think you get the idea.
