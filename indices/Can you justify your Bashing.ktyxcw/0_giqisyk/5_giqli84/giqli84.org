Dude....he's the main villain. The entire book revolves around that.The motherfugging Dark Lord, of course he isnt't /nice/. He isn't a good person so that he can be a good character. I mean, I can see why you wouldn't like a person like that to exist, but he is compelling, I think for sheer prettiness Dolores Umbridge is a most perfect candidate to bash on.

Edit: pettiness not prettiness , she's horrendous
