So there needs to be a distinction made between bashing (which in some sense exaggerates flaws) and holding characters to account. Most of the adults in Harry Potter deserve to be raked over the coals or imprisoned for their actions.

The problem is both there isn't a good label for lambasting characters nor does most fanfic favor a moderate take.

For me there are few characters I don't like being bashed, though that doesn't mean they can't have their flaws pointed out in ways meant to help them improve. But for most of the rest I tend to have to take what I get.

For instance, there's not nearly enough stories where a Gryffindor Harry is dismissive or antagonistic towards Mcgonagall, who you can really ask the question of "what has she ever done for Harry?".
