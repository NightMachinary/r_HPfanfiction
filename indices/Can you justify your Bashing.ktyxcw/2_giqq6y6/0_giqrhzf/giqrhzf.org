Exactly. Point very well made.

  For instance, there's not nearly enough stories where a Gryffindor Harry is dismissive or antagonistic towards Mcgonagall, who you can really ask the question of "what has she ever done for Harry?".

This. So much this. I actually scoffed in disbelief when Harry used the Cruciatus on Carrow for spitting on her in canon. I would've found it much more believable if he blamed her for not doing enough to protect the students and doing the bare minimum to protect her job/position.

Edit: There's an incomplete story in this [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11181910/42][one-shot collection]] called Quantum Leapfrog where Harry says that the Gryffindor House Ghost is called Nearly Headless Nick, because they're the Nearly Headless House. This, in front of the school champions and their Heads, in the antechamber after the Goblet selects the champions.

Also, Ian Hycrest's /Cry of Freedom/ series on FFN is an AU which blatantly calls out McGonagall's uselessness.
