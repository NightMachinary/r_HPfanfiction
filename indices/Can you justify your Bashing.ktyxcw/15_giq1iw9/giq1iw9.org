I'm against bashing but, I'll give thoughts on criticisms of characters.

I have questions about Snape. He behaves rather poorly as a teacher. The only justification that would make this passable for me is that he's putting on airs as a spy, and it was all part of the plan. Kid Snape was just an sad kid who was bullied by the popular kids who were otherwise nice to everyone else. He gave as good as he got because he was finally able to fight back. To him the entire war was personal. It was to fight people like the muggles he grew up around, and then to fight for Lily. Adult Snape seems far more contradictory and awful.

Lily seems like someone who thinks of themselves as perfect. She was the perfect child who befriended the poor kid. She was the only mother who's love was enough to save her child. I don't like characters like this. She's a contradiction inside of a conundrum. She has no flaws. So she's probably the devil. :)
