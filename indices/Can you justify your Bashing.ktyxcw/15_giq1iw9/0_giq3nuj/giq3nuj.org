That's a rather interesting take on Lily. She most likely did have flaws, she was only human, just that no one probably talked about them. She is in a sense kind of a mary sue in that she was perfect in every way possible, but you also have to think: if the wizarding world heard that a 21-year-old woman that had been murdered protecting her 1-year-old son, people would most likely remember their fondest memories of her, paint her in a good light. I can't remember exactly, but most of James' faults were told to Harry by Snape, who had a grudge against the man (i know Sirius and Remus talked to Harry about James' faults, but i think those were after Harry asked about James and those situations specifically). Also, the narration is through Harry: most adults wouldn't come up to this famous kid who had had his parents murdered at a young age protecting him and tell him that their parents did this and that wrong. Not a great impression.

So yeah, Lily is painted as this woman with no flaws, but when you look at the narrative, it makes sense for her flaws to not have been told.
