Lily Potter

I don't see the awe of her. Yes, she sacrificed herself for Harry, and Narcissa would have done the same for Draco. Yes, she was pretty and Narcissa was beautiful as well, that doesn't make either Narcissa or Lily as good human beings.

Lily didn't try to understand Petunia's feelings. If there was one moment I pitied Petunia, it was when she wrote to Dumbledore to let her come to Hogwarts. And Lily rubbed it on Petunia's face, as though she was a laughing stock, mentioning how Petunia was begging to come to Hogwarts. And Saint Lily easily redirects the blame on Snape.

In the end, whatever her problem was with Petunia, she dumps it down on Snape.

And the almost smile in SWM. What horrible person would do that to their friend? Would Hermione ever almost smile at Ron or Harry or even Neville if, they were embarrassed by Draco? Or would Hermione ever forgive any of those boys if she found them almost smiling when Draco embarrasses her?

That's when I really disliked Lily. Considering how Snape's childhood was, I really wished she was a better person.

The only thing I like is, she cutting off Snape. I mean even on moral levels, they were different and it was better to prune the relationship that was anyway going to hurt him.

Not that I approve of Snape but anyone writes a Lily bashing, I would love to read it.
