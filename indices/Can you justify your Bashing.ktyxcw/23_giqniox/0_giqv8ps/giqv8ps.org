Lily didn't cut Snape off early enough. Snape was already throwing bigoted slurs against people like lily and hanging out with people that want muggleborns heavily oppressed (at best) and brutally murdered. Lily already expressed her disapproval at this. This all happened before SWM.

It's not lily's duty to ensure that Snape stay on the path of good if Snape himself is dead set on doing the opposite. Being an unpleasant person with a shitty childhood doesn't entitle Snape to shit. Lily doesn't have any obligation to remain friends with someone who is bigoted against people like her just to "save" Snape.

If anything lily's flaw is being too forgiving with Snape because of their shared childhood and equating schoolyard bullies who pick on genocidal bigot to said genocidal bigot.
