How does almost smiling at a bigot getting picked on make her a shitty friend? Their friendship already seemed strained enough. Were Harry, Neville, and Ron going around calling people mudbloods and hanging out with Crabbe and Goyle? If so you absolutely can't compare.

Thats like asking why is it ok to say "asian" but not "chink". In their society muggle can be a racist or descriptive term depending on the inflection. Mudblood is most definitely a racist term.
