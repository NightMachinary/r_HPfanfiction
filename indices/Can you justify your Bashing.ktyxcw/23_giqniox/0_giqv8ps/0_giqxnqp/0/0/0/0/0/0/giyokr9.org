Lily was as toxic to Snape as much as he was to her. It is easier for people like Snape coming from abusive household to create co-dependant relationship with people who show even very little care. And it's a wonder if Lily hadn't known Snape's feelings were more than friendship. Even Harry notices that Snape has romantic feelings on her.

I ll not indulge in all characters. Snape had made terrible and wrong choices in his life. And his treatment of Harry would need another century of life to remorse. Similarly, James had equally done wrong deeds. One right thing will not compensate for the wrong thing. So, you can be assured that I am not here to justify his actions.

My point here is, Lily being described as epitome of love, goodness when with all the evidences shown a piss poor friend.

You keep repeating that Lily didn't owe Snape anything, because he was in the wrong.

But, friendship, at the end of the day, is about two people and the trust they have in each other. If Snape had almost smiled at Lily, if she was abused in front of a crowd, I would call him out that he was a shitty friend. She didn't even raise her wand. And enjoyed James's mischievous stints. Accused Snape of being nosy, when he was almost to be killed by James's gang. And the matter with Petunia, and Lily having another instance of being awful.

And all this happened before Snape calling her mudblood.

Which even Harry isn't bothered to feel sorry for, because of the physical abuse he is seeing right through his own eyes. And mudblood is a built up slur that isn't as worse as being called muggle.

If it's not the identity I approve, you can't call me with some random word, and that would definitely be slur. Muggle is as much slur as mudblood because both are used in inferior tone and looking down at other people.
