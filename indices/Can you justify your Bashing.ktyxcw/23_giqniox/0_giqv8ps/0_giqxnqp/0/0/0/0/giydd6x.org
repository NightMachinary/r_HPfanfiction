Muggle is a slur. From Hagrid, McGonagall, Dumbledore, everyone uses that word as a slur, like addressing people below them. Vernon vehemently dislikes that word and he is a non magical person. No human without magic would like to be addressed as "muggles". They hate themselves being represented such way. If I am an Indian or Chinese, I need to first accept that term. Did Vernon or Petunia accept that term? Didn't Vernon feel insulated over the term? And all the situations in which they addressed "muggles" are all with inferiority.

And there was always a "us" vs "them" with the wizarding world. The term mudblood is only for wizards and witches from non-magical community. Just because the witches and wizards hate to be demeaned among their lot, it doesn't make them good people. They demean and disrespect non-magical people. So, I give a little less shit when the word "mudblood" is used. It doesn't impact me as a reader, at all.

Now, coming to how Lily was able to give multiple chances, I would tell, that's her huge flaw, considering she even went ahead to marry the big bully of her child hood friend.

She isn't a good friend if she is able to almost laugh at Snape being bullied. Let us reverse this scenerio. What if Hermione was bullied by Draco and her knickers were shown in open, and Harry almost laughed. Wouldn't you think that's betrayal? And Fyi, Harry would never almost smile and he would hex the bloody hell out of Draco. Where was Lily's wand? She just came with fancy words, no real fight, well, that we could add because of her taking fancy on James Potter.

Snape being a bad guy doesn't justify Lily being an awful friend. As much as Snape was awful, Lily was an awful person too. Her demeanor in insulting Petunia's privacy and easily loading that blame on Snape and then, almost laughing at Snape while bullied just makes me not feel the awe of "great Lily Potter"
