No. They came up with the term muggleborn.

Bullies who pick on racists are neutral at worst. Like I said I believe in punching nazis.

Anyone who tried their best to remain friends with a person when that person clearly disregard your viewpoint and treat you and your kind as inferior is clearly a good friend. You thinking that this is the behavior of a shitty friend means you have completely unreasonable demands on what friendship is.

I have no problem admitting James is an arrogant bully. But not because he picked on snape. Because he hexed people for fun.

Also find me proof that Lily said Snape smelled. James and Sirius made fun of Snape for his bad hygiene. Snape being poor has nothing to do with his personal hygiene while at Hogwarts. Hogwarts doesn't charge students for showers.

Have a nice day. I also maintain that lily is a shitty friend to her other friends because she continued her friendship with snape.
