And wizards needed a term for people who didn't come from a long line of wizards. So they came up with the term "mudblood". It's always the intent that shows derogation.

And even by your own terms, all of the wizards are racist. Hagrid, McGonagall, Dumbledore, every one are racist, then why Snape alone becomes the greatest offender for calling Lily a mudblood?

Lily sure was also calling Snape immediately with her classist remark of him being smelly. Well, let's forget that. Because guess what, bullies and classists, racists who don't choose to kill are still good people in your dictionary.

Yes, I have a sincerely different understanding of friendship. Anyone who feels uncomfortable being a friend to a person, shows about their nature of friendship in the first place. Anyone who tries to compromise with words when their friend is being abused, mocked and belittled, before taking their wand to defend their friend, is no true friend.

And I can still accept Snape was an extremely wrong man, but by the way you defend James clearly tells you have one-sided judgements when it comes to James and Lily.

Have a nice day! I still stand by that Lily is a shitty friend.
