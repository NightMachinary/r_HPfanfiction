Again in this case was Hermione somehow throwing around the term mudblood? Was Hermione being an awful friend to Harry by sipping tea with Umbridge, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Lucius Malfoy? Why do you keep coming to that comparison?

Reread that vernon scene again. "Even muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy happy day!" You can replace muggle with quite literally any nonsense word (mufolist, abugos, tolkrast) and Vernon would be rattled because of the way the word is used in context. If you aren't willing to accept this simple fact then I don't know what to tell you.

You keep saying that Snape is a bad guy but somehow I doubt you believe that. You downplay the use of the word mudblood. You think Snape's friendship with Lily was bad for *Snape* because they had different moral values. Different moral values don't even begin to cover it. Lily's moral position is that she would like herself and people like her to not be killed. Snape's is all mudbloods can die except Lily because she's my special mudblood.

I just don't see how it's a bad thing to finally cut out a toxic relationship from your life.

Like I've said Lily's flaw isn't being a bad friend to Snape. Lily's flaw is being a good friend to Snape. Her flaw is being naive enough to think she can save him. Her flaw was being willingly blind to Snape's foul behavior because she knew him as a kid. Her flaw was equating James' bad behavior to Snape's when anyone can see that Snape's is so much worse.

As for James bullying Snape. Just think back to the internet debate a while back on "Is it ok to punch a nazi?" My answer is yes, every time. You don't get to claim victimhood when you're a nazi.
