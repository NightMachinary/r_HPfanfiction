I'm not even going to touch the whole Lily should have known Snape has romantic feelings for her part. It's completely irrelevant.

As for the term Muggle, I don't know how many times I have to explain it to you that just because a term can be used in a racist context does not mean a term is racist.

"I'm not staying at the Leaky Cauldron. I'm staying at a muggle hotel in London." Descriptive.

"These muggles with their silly ideas." Racist.

Wizards need a term to describe the human population that doesn't have magic. The term they came up with is muggle.

And why are we talking about how the term affects you as a reader for? None of the terms are real. It's not about how it affects you. It's about how it affects the characters.

You and I also have completely different understanding of friendship. We know that Lily has been making excuses for Snape for *years*. Let's be generous and assume it's just been 2 years. Conversation happened end of 5th year so since the beginning of 4th year, Snape has been throwing slurs and/or hanging out with future death eaters who want Lily dead.

As far as I'm concerned, the baseline behavior in this case for Lily would be to cut Snape out of her life and when the bully picks on the bigot, Lily should have just stayed out of it. From this point onwards, the relationship is completely uneven. Lily is a good friend to Snape while Snape is a shit friend to Lily. Not only did Lily remained friends with Snape despite the baseline being that she should end the friendship, she also stood up for him when nobody in the school would. That makes her a good friend. Almost smiling makes her a less good friend.

I don't see how you're going to hold the event with Petunia as evidence that Lily is a shit friend. All that showed is an 11 year old girl that's not an accomplished liar.

And let's be real Snape was being nosy. Snape suspected that Remus was a werewolf ("I know your theory"). Snape wanted to out that Remus was a werewolf as part of his vendetta against the marauders, which consequently would have completely destroyed Remus' already low career prospects and made him a social pariah. Snape willingly went anyways.

Sirius: You know that dude you hate? He is hanging out at this place behind this electric fence. I'll tell you how to get behind the fence.

Snape: I know that the dude is going to be on a bloodthirsty rampage tonight but I can't wait to expose him and all his friends.

And I agree Lily isn't the epitome of love and goodness etc. But we completely disagree on the why. Lily is a shitty person to other muggleborns that Snape hurled slurs at because she tacitly approved this behavior by remaining friends with him. Lily is shitty to James because she equated his behavior to Snape's. Lily is shitty to her muggle parents and family because she remained friends with Snape who she knew looked down on muggles. Lily is shitty to Mary Macdonald because Lily remained friends with a person who thought Mulciber using Dark Magic on Mary was just Mulciber having a laugh.
