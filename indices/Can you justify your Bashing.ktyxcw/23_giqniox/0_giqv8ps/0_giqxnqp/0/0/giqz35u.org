No. Muggle is discriminatory. They first thing, a random wizard tells to Vernon is, "Even muggles like yourself should be happy that you-know-who is gone." Vernon feels insulted for being called muggle. McGonagall addresses, "Even muggles are not that stupid" while speaking to Dumbledore. Which she indirectly implies muggles are comparatively dumber to magical people.

Calling Asian is an identity, that Asians themselves approve and embrace. If non-magical people don't approve and embrace a certain term, and if that particular term is often passed off as an insult most of the time, it isn't complimentary and it is as much bigotry as much as mudblood is.

Irrespective of her concerns with Snape she still chose to be his friend right until that point in SWM. If she was that much disgusted of Snape's association with wrong people, she shouldn't have come to defend him. There she comes, the mighty, saintly Lily to defend her friend only to end up almost smiling at his bullying. That's her being a shitty and awful friend. And shoving down Petunia's issue, when she herself accused Petunia of "begging" to Dumbledore. That's her again being a shitty friend.
