I don't know why you wrote the same point what I have mentioned already. Lily cutting off Snape was a good thing. I already told how morally they both are different and it was good that she ended their friendship.

What I don't like is, she almost smiling at Snape when he was bullied or that putting all the blame of Petunia's issue on him, while she was equally, if not more responsible for her disparage with her sister. She is a shitty friend. That's all to it.

It is funny when calling "mudblood" ignites entire HP characters but being called "muggle" as sweet and nice. The entire series and all the characters look down upon "muggle". All witches and wizards feel non-magic people as inferior but more like a pet way. The only difference is, good characters dont want to kill the muggles while bad characters want to. That's not a honorable thing, anyway.
