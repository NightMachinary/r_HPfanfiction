I actually hate him far more for his treatment of Harry.

James, Sirius and Pettigrew were his best friends; friends who made the effort to become animagi just to keep him company one night a month. They were not random classmates.

Yet, he made no effort to contact Harry, visit him or write letters? Harry was abused and horribly neglected at the Dursleys and I hold Lupin partially responsible. Sure, he had no legal or fiscal responsibility for Harry's care, but he definitely had a moral responsibility to at least check if Harry was safe and happy.

Even after he became DADA professor, Harry did not know how close Lupin was to his father, even though he agreed to give private lessons and spent time alone with him. After Sirius broke in twice, he still did not inform the staff that there was a secret entrance into the castle under Honeydukes and that Sirius was an animagus. All because he cared more for Dumbledore's opinion of him than Harry's life.

He made no effort to contact Harry in his 4th year even though his help might have made a lot of difference to Harry, both emotionally and in magic, not to mention Sirius' health. Sirius was living in a cave, and off rats that he caught, while Lupin was... elsewhere, I guess? Bloody hell, I /loathe/ that guy.
