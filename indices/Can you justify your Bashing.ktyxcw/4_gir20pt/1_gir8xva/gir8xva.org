I don't think that's so much "bad character trait" as "crippling insecurity". It's established throughout the whole of HBP that Remus truly believes he is not good enough for Tonks. When he finds out that are having a baby, he has a massive panic attack because he is terrified he'll have passed his condition on to the baby.

I'm not excusing his actions, because they seemed out-of-character to me too, but they're at least understandable. He realises his mistake in the end, when called out on it.
