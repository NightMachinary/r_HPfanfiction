I enjoy ron bashing as long as it's done well. Ron is a jealous, low work ethic no talent who rides on Harry's coat tails and is constantly bashing hermione in canon. Simply put, he's the kind of person I would greatly dislike in real life, so I can't find anything I would like about him in the books. Also, even though he never used slurs like malfoy did, Ron was about as mentally abusive towards hermione as draco was. In some ways, Ron was worse, as malfoy was obvious in his contempt of hermione, ron did all his mental bashing under the guise of being "a friend", and we all know that the social knives that cut the deepest don't come from your enemies, but from your friends.

I also enjoy dumbledore bashing. I won't list the reasons because many of them have been posted here, and to be honest I would have to write a small essay to enumerate all the reasons why dumbledore from canon is deserving of bashing.

For the fic I am currently writing however, I am reducing ron to a background charector rather than bashing him, and I am taking the opportunity to write a good dumbledore, one who actually HELPS harry rather than USE him
