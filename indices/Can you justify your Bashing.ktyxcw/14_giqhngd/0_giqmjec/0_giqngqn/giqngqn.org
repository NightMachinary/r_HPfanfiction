I haven't posted it yet. It is a series rewrite, starting from 3rd year and will go through the rest of the series. I won't be posting it until the first book is fully written, but I'll give you some info on the premise of the first book

Dumbledore puts harry in augusta longbottoms care to grow up with neville as I'm using neville's mother as Harry's godmother (got idea from other fanfics, though I haven't read any where harry grows up with the longbottoms.) Both harry and neville are sorted into ravenclaw instead of gryffindor (I wanted to do a smart and talented harry, but not overpowered harry, this is important because the voldemort in my series will be much smarter and more dangerous than he was in canon. Neville will also be in ravenclaw because he was never depicted as unintelligent, just low confidence and poor casting due to having a badly matched wand). I am using neville growing up with harry as a way to explore a neville who didn't go through the series with confidence issues.

The main problems will be the same for each of my books, but how they happen and the details will all be different based on how I have changed other details of the series from canon. Harry will be shipped in this fic with daphne greengrass, but it won't be through marriage contract our soul bond tropes. Her family will be a death eater family instead of neutral and she will be ordered to befriend and use him for voldemort to gain access to him. How they get together instead of her giving him to voldemort will be a surprise! Tracey davis, normally daphne's best friend will not be her friend first at all, as she isn't even in slytherin in this story, she will also be a claw.

Dumbledore in this story will be a good dumbledore who actively helps harry throughout the series, keeping far lest secrets from him and starts giving him private lessons on all things death eater and voldemort from the very first book.

Hopefully this gets you more interested for when I finally post the first book!

Edit: also, voldemort wasn't fully destroyed by the rebounding curse like in canon. In my series, voldemort survives, but with very negative effects on his body from the rebounded killing curse. I am using this to bring in voldemort as active from the begining of the series, allowing me to have the evil villain involved in the plot more, as well as allowing me to do something different with the horcruxes than has been done with them before, to my knowledge. This will eventually lead to more of a war time for the 7th book rather than a horcrux hunt like deathly hallows was. It will truelly be Harry's war this time around, not "go on a scavenger hunt before meeting him in battle one time"
