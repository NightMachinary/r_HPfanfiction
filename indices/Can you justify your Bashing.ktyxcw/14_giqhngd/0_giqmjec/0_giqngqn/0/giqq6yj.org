That sounds awesome :-). If u remember please dm me or something when u post it. Looking forward to it. Ive been keeping my eyes out for fictions that have dumbledore take a more an active role in the story instead of bashing him. Theres so much dumbledore bashing although some of them are quite good. I really enjoyed beside me always. Its the books from dumbledores point of view. Not sure what u will think but check it out if u want. Again please let me know when u post the first book if u can :-)
