It will be a bit as I've only just completed my 3rd chapter. I'll probably be knocking out 2-3 chapters a week though so I don't think it will take TOO long to complete the first book. I'm really excited to write it, because I'm doing a lot of things different in this book than I have seen in any other canon rewrite. Harry even plays a chaser instead of seeker on the house quidditch team! Though I'm pretty sure that's been done before, harry has likely played every position of quidditch with all the fanfics out there lol.

And yeah both voldemort and dumbledore will be much more active in my rewrite. I never understood why voldemort was such a small part of canon even though he was the big bad of the series. Even in books 5-8 he didn't have a lot of text time. While my voldemorts text time won't be a ton at first, it will ramp up over time as he regains his strength.

And it will be nice to see dumbledore take a more active and benificial role in Harry's preparation rather than keeping him in the dark for 90% of the series then dumping everything on him in the last 2 books

I'm particularly excited on how I'm getting harry and daphne together. I haven't read a fic that gets them together in a way that's even close to the way I will be getting them together.
