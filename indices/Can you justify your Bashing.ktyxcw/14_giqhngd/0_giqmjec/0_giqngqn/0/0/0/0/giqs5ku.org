This one will be the first one I complete. I've got the entire roadmap for the first book finished, I just am writing now. Part of why I didn't continue the others I started was because I didn't complete the prewriting planning lol. This time I've got all the prep work finished and just need to write. If you want, you can beta it if your good at catching inconsistencies. My grammar and structure is pretty good so I'm not worried about that, but it would be nice to have a beta go through and check for discrepancies and inconsistencies.
