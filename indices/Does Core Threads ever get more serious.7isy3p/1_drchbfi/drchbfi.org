No! Blasphemy! What have you got against vampire ducks. How can a story with vampire ducks possibly go bad.

To be honest, while it never loses it's tone, it does become more serious. Harry does things to help out magicals that need it, and with so many stories of dark!angsty!OP, but doesn't get anything done Harry stories out there, I like the whole OP, but still a kid Harry. There are so few, and I think this should stay as it is.

Thanks,

Warryn.
