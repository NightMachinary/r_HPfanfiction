Well... I consider it to be wholly awesome, but precisely for the reasons you mention. It is totally devoid of conflict and angst, which of course I wouldn't wish every fic to be that way, but for this particular one it has an absolutely exhilarating effect for me. Reading /Core Threads/ and all its light-hearted fun just makes me so damn /happy/ every time. It's kind of like /Like a Red-Headed Stepchild/ in that respect.

Now, to be honest, Harry /does/ use his powers more later on (he most notably creates a country all of his own), but the /tone/ never change. I think it's for the best. Perhaps /Core Threads/ just isn't your type of story.
