I can't remember what happened before or after ch30, but (spoilers) [[/spoiler][it does branch off (heh) into some dimensional travel (incidentally into one of the more cliche manipulative Dumbledore worlds), and Harry has to deal with a few near-death (heheh) experiences involving his magic exploding]], but I think you'll never get much "true" conflict as long as you're dealing with what's essentially a god. But that's most of the fun of it!
