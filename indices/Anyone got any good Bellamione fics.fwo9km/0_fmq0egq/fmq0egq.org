Generally, I've tried a few fics like that in the past, but I found that Hermione in them usually gets this passive, flighty ingenue portrayal that's also common in Dramione fic---and that's when she's lucky. When she's not, she gets that, plus Stockholm Syndrome.

Are there any readable Ballamione fics in which Hermione ends up as the "top" in the relationship?
