Snape may have been great at potions but what he loved was the Dark Arts - he invented spells, wrote about them in his potions book, and even twenty odd years later he was still proud of them. IIRC he went on fairly lovingly about the dark arts once he was able to teach defence. Defence is just the closest class he could get to dark arts

As far as the curse goes, the large majority don't die. Maybe he just wanted to lose his job so he didn't have to teach kids
