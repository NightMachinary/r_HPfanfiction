  the large majority don't die
#+end_quote

Almost all DA teachers we see are dead or really fucked up. Quirrel died, Lockhart essentially died, Crouch died, Umbridge raped by animals. I mean... 3/5 dead, 4/5 life-alteringly incapacitated, 5/5 with severe consequences.

Not odds anyone reasonably intelligent would take.

  Maybe he just wanted to lose his job so he didn't have to teach kids

He could leave his job any time. Leaving or losing his job would mean losing the protection of Dumbledore and his excuse to be a spy -- i.e. losing everything.

  what he loved was the Dark Arts

He can experiment without teaching kids. In fact there's no evidence he'd enjoy teaching DA to kids even if he liked messing around with it himself. Also... to the extent of willing to die in 1 yr to have the privilege of teaching kids DA?
