  “Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sounded a bit like you.”

  “Like me?”

  “Yes, when you were telling us what it's like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn't just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts---well, wasn't that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?”

At the same time that Snape was inventing such spells as a toenail-growing hex, he was also heavily modifying potions that were a year beyond his level. There's nothing to suggest he loved potion-making less than the dark arts.

Also, Snape didn't need an excuse to leave Hogwarts. The reason he didn't leave was because he was there to protect Harry, in the first place, and because it was crucial to his spying, once Voldemort returned. The reason he wasn't killed by Voldemort was because he supposedly had decades of spying on Dumbledore to serve up to Voldemort.
