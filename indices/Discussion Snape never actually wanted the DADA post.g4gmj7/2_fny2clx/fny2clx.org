Talk to any teacher who teaches two seperate subjects. Teaching takes preparation, for every hour in front of the class you need 1-2 hours of prep time. It is less for experienced teachers and it varies from subject to subject. Art hardly takes any preparation while a language class can be quite time intensive. Different subjects also vary in how draining they are on your mental reserves as a teacher.

The way I see Snape teaching he probably has the written prep work for potions down on file cards. Like 4th year, 5th lesson, blood replenishing draught. He then just copies the relevant text onto the blackboard with the flick of his wand. But he will still need to make sure that the relevant ingredients are in the store cupboard and that workstations are set up correctly. A fanfic that I read stated that he spends 20 min between each lessons to clean up and set up everything and I find this somewhat believable. Then the actual teaching. It is mentally extremely draining to keep 20+ teenagers under control while they are handling dangerous substances. There is fire and explosives and little shitheads who don't listen. He has to watch all of his students like a hawk to prevent accidents.

Do this for 8 hours every day 5 days a week and most people will end up completely burned out after a 3-5 years.

To me it makes total sense that Snape wants to get away from teaching potions and that sort of mental drain.

Compared to teaching potions teaching DADA might be a piece of cake. He has more control over what the students are doing, there aren't any things that might explode, he can turn around without constantly watching over his shoulder. Yes, he will be forced to do more prep work at least initially, but this might be a small price to pay for more peace of mind and less mental exhaustion at the end of the day.
