  Harry sincerely believes Snape wants to expel him and poison him, which is obviously wrong, and is part of the misdirection. People actually think the obvious misdirection can be part of an interpretation that is as valid as the interpretation you get to when you actually know the end.

I know. It is mind boggling. I understand assuming Harry is correct on first read through (depending on age, experience and maturity), but it should be obvious to most people on re-reading that Harry was more often than not, wrong about Snape's actions/motivations and feelings.
