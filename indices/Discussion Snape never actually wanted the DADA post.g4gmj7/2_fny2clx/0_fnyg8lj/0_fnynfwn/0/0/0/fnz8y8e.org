Constantly insult everyone not in Slytherin, belittle a child whose parents were tortured so far into insanity with Dark magic that they're stuck in the Magical Damages ward for possibly eternity while never recognizing their own son, single out the orphan, and say that you see no change in the Muggleborn girl's teeth after she was cursed with a teeth growing spell.

Yeah, totally not causing emotionally harm to the students. By the way, the least likely to cause harm to a student, in order from least likely to most likely, are Trelawny, Sprout, Flitwick, Hagrid, Firenze, McGonnogal, Slughorn, and Snape. And that's the teachers we see Harry interact with so I'm not including Vector or Babbling on the list. In addition, I didn't include any of Harry's previous DADA teachers as each one tried to kill or maim him in some way, shape, or form even Lupin.
