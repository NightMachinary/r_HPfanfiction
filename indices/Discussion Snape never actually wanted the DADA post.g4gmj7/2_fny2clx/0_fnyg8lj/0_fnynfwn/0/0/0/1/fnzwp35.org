  Constantly insult everyone not in Slytherin,
#+end_quote

You've used the words "constantly" and "everyone". Show me 1 example of Snape insulting a Hufflepuff or a Ravenclaw. Show me 1 example of Snape insulting the Gryffindors Dean, Seamus, Lavender, or Parvati.

  belittle [Neville], single out the orphan, and say that you see no change in the Muggleborn girl's teeth

Neville's story is very sad but Snape never belittles him for his parents' state, he "belittles" him for his incompetence. Criticizing students is his job. He doesn't single Harry out for being an orphan, either - if anything, everybody else is singling Harry out for being the BWL while Snape knows that Harry didn't do anything special, so he /doesn't/ single Harry. Also, in that first lesson, he calls everyone dunderheads, including the Slytherins, and criticizes everyone except Draco.

The teeth comment is in GOF:18. Go read it again.

You'd think Snape would never miss an opportunity to punish Harry, who attacked Draco, right? Wrong. He sends Goyle to the hospital wing, despite Goyle being in pretty bad shape. Why doesn't he punish Harry? Because at this point, in GOF, the Dark Mark is already growing darker and Voldemort is coming back. Snape will soon have to resume his spying role. He cannot act like he otherwise would have, which is to punish everyone, including the Death Eaters' children - he is downplaying the whole thing to avoid punishing anyone.

Did he absolutely /have to/ mock Hermione? No. Does he ever do that in any other context? No. It was an easy way to demonstrate his hatred of Harry and supposed disdain for Muggle-borns, when he needed to reinforce that image of himself.

  Yeah, totally not causing emotionally harm to the students.

Snape's biggest "victims" are Harry, who names a child after him; Hermione, who constantly defends him; and Neville, who overcame his fear of Snape after the boggarts lesson.
