  so he /doesn't/ single Harry.
#+end_quote

Except for the pause in first year before calling his name with a sneer, calling Harry a celebrity, and firing 3 questions one after the other to Harry when there were other students to question. But sure, no singling out Potter there.

  he calls everyone dunderheads, including the Slytherins, and criticizes everyone except Draco.
#+end_quote

So it's a blanket "all children are stupid" insult. He's not going to bother going out of his way to say "all you Gryffindors are morons/dunderheads" when in fact, all children are stupid, especially in the subtle art of making potions.

Despite sending Goyle to the Hospital Wing, he does no such thing for Hermione who was also hit with a curse from Draco. It was one of the other students that took her without Snape's say-so. Also in relation to Hermione: “That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger . . . Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.”

  Harry, who names a child after him
#+end_quote

Because Harry is an oblivious idiot that Rowling wrote to forget Snape's abuse of him because he (Harry) looked like James Potter, Sevvie's high school bully.

  Hermione, who constantly defends him
#+end_quote

Outside of originally thinking that he wasn't going to steal the Stone but then coming around to that way of thinking when she thought Snape was cursing Harry's broom in the first Quidditch game, when did she defend him? Oh, right. When telling Ron to shut up because Ron was pointing out that Snape was a former Death Eater and it was shaking Hermione's confidence in Dumbledore, the ultimate authority figure.

  and Neville, who overcame his fear of Snape after the boggarts lesson.

Yeah, kind of messed up your biggest fear is a teacher that you're stuck with about 9 months out of the year for up to 5 years, 7 if your career requires you take their class the final 2 years.

Now I'm off to your other response to respond to points there.
