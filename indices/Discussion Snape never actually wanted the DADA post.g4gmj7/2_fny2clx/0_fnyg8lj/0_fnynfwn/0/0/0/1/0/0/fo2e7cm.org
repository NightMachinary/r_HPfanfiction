For the record, your argument was "Snape CONSTANTLY insults ALL NON SLYTHERINS", and you've only managed to provide examples of him insulting 4 specific Gryffindors.

I asked you for very little to prove that extraordinary claim - one example of Snape insulting someone other than Harry, Ron, Hermione, or Neville - and you couldn't even do that.

You said Snape is singling Harry out because Harry is an orphan. That's ridiculous. Of course he's singling Harry out, his entire existence is dedicated to protecting Harry, you don't think he would be curious to know if Harry has maybe inherited his beloved Lily's love for potions, or talent, or...? But it's not because he's an orphan. Go complain about the other teachers, who fawn over Harry for being the BWL, and who fawn over Hermione to the point that nobody else can prove themselves, which is actually harmful to every other student.

And yes, a blanket "I think most of you are stupid" statement isn't very nurturing, I never accused Snape of being nurturing and pleasant, I said he's able to criticize Slytherins, and I've shown it.

Hermione ran off to the hospital wing by herself because unlike Goyle, she's smart enough to do so. She didn't even reach out to Snape herself, Ron called his attention to her. You're ignoring the fact that he had to be nasty to Harry and his muggle-born friend in front of the Death Eaters' children. By the way, McGonagall didn't send Draco to the hospital either after he was tortured by Moody, she sent him to Snape to be punished some more, and that's in GOF13, the teeth comment is in GOF18, so it's her who has set the precedent that students can be disfigured and then NOT be sent to get help immediately. Snape has multiple valid reasons to be upset with Hermione on top of that. That she gets away with a remark about (possibly) her teeth and being chastised in class indicates that he actually likes her, or at least respects her.

Hermione is NOT a blind follower of authority. She has zero respect for Trelawney. Indeed this might be based on the fact that McG, whom she respects more, has zero respect for Trel too, but it means Hermione is choosing who to respect based on her own values. She acknowledges that Hagrid is a poor teacher. She is the mastermind behind many of the Trio's rule-breaking capers. She might have more respect for authority than Harry or Ron, but that's saying very little. Do not flatten Hermione's character to make your case. As for her defending Snape:

Book 1 (she doesn't believe Snape would steal the stone), book 4 (the cave scene, you've mentioned this), book 5 (talks excitedly about Snape's lesson), book 6 (says Snape sounds like Harry when he talks about the dark arts).

Neville's boggart is meaningless, his fear of Snape is mild, there's nothing messed up about a poor student who is preoccupied with a teacher who criticizes him. He gets over it by picturing Snape in funny clothes. Compare this to him crying for hours because McG docked Gryffindor 150 points, and the "total disgrace" he was in because she locked him out. Harry also experiences lasting damage because of McG, as he still remembers his first punishment at the Forbidden Forest as "nightmarish" as of the end of his 6th year.

Lastly, you wrote that Harry is an oblivious idiot who forgets how Snape abused Harry just for looking like James. That is staggeringly ignorant and illogical, enough so that it will take multiple paragraphs to refute.

Harry is not more of an oblivious idiot as a middle aged man, and a fully qualified auror at that, who has already had time for the truth about Snape to sink in, than he was as a kid or a teenager. Through his kid self's eyes, we see Snape as unjustly hateful and as a guy who is likely to be tempted by the Dark Arts, then as a potential unreformed Death Eater who might actually be playing both sides or even trying to get Harry killed; Harry certainly accuses him for Sirius dying (which even he acknowledges is more due to his own bias than fact), and then of his parents' death (that, at least, is not groundless), and of course he sees him killing Dumbledore. As an adult, he was able to appreciate Snape's courage, /because/ he had complete information and he was *no longer* oblivious.

As an adult and a father, perhaps he could appreciate that being criticized and disciplined does not equate to being abused, even though children don't like it, whereas being neglected and then subjected to disproportionate punishments at random actually /is/ abusive (it's astonishing that McG could dock 150 points for breaking curfew, yet assign one detention for the flying car stunt, for example).

Finally, Snape indeed disliked Harry, and didn't see him for who he was, because of James. Considering that James traumatized him (and you said insults are traumatic, so you have no leg to stand on if you're gonna say insults+physical violence+sexual violence aren't traumatic), this isn't a choice to abuse a James clone just for shits and giggles - this is a trigger, and it's involuntary. Harry himself was traumatized for weeks just from seeing how his dad had treated Snape, and he still remembered this with sadness two years later.

There are other reasons why Snape dislikes Harry, that have nothing to do with him looking like James:

1. When they first make eye-contact, both of them are set on the wrong path because Quirrell is right there. Harry feels a pain when Snape is looking at him, and Snape, who /must/ be reading Harry, is actually reading Voldemort. Harry later sasses at him in the very first lesson, and nearly knocks him off his broom
2. In COS, Harry arrives at school by flying car, launches a seemingly random attack on Slytherins, and also turns out to be a Parselmouth, another quality associated with Voldemort
3. In POA, Harry displays recklessness truly worthy of his father
4. In GOF, Harry becomes, again, the center of attention. Snape resents this, but /so does Ron/
5. OOTP: Harry violates Snape's privacy and endangers him, Snape does not know that Harry regrets the whole thing
6. Worst of all, Snape catches Harry casting Sectumsempra on Draco and lying about where he had learned it. This is the ultimate confirmation that Harry is no better than his father and godfather, who had nearly killed /him/.

This is a partial list of times when Harry behaves like James - and everyone said James was the biggest troublemaker in Hogwarts history, so any teacher would have a problem with it. There are also multiple occasions, before legilimency is formally introduced, of Snape looking into Harry's eyes just as Harry is thinking how much he would like to hurt Snape, and that must be flashback inducing on top of affirming Snape's belief that Harry is James 2.

Snape has a disincentive to try with Harry: He knows he will return to Voldemort as a spy. The cover story is, “I thought Voldemort was finished, and that Harry did it.” Becoming best buds with Harry would have been inexplicable; becoming best buds with Harry and then NOT using that to deliver Harry to Voldemort on a silver platter (i.e., what Crouch Jr. has done) - unforgivable. Snape relied heavily on half-truths and misdirection but there was one thing he could be honest with Voldemort about: He hates Harry with a passion. /That/, ironically, helped him protect Harry.

FWIW, I believe that the inclusion of the memory of Snape ranting about Harry, and Dumbledore dismissing Snape and telling him he's wrong, is intended as an apology.
