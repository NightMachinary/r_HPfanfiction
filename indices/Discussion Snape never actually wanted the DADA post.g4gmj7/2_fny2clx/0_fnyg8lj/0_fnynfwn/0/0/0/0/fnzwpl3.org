2/2

#+begin_quote
  the least likely to cause harm to a student, in order from least likely to most likely, are Trelawny, Sprout, Flitwick, Hagrid, Firenze, McGonnogal, Slughorn, and Snape.
#+end_quote

In that order, here are the teachers harming students:

*Trelawney:*

1. predicts a death every year and distresses students with her predictions
2. To Hermione: “I don't remember ever meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.”
3. takes her anger about Umbridge's performance review out on students: throws a book at Dean and Seamus, and thrusts another one so hard into Neville's chest that he falls. She then calls the entire class a bunch of idiots: “You know what to do! Or am I such a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?”

*Sprout:*

1. Has students working with a flesh-eating plant that punches them; Neville is working alone and he gets beaten up.
2. Acted distant toward Harry because he was named the 2nd Hogwarts Champion

*Flitwick:*

1. does not appear to do anything about Luna's bullying
2. has Seamus repeatedly write "I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick" because he overdoes it with Aguamenti. The Irish were once openly compared to apes in England in the past, so that's in extremely poor taste
3. Lavender bursts into tears during Charms, Flitwick doesn't notice

*Hagrid:*

1. gives Dudley a tail because Dudley's father insulted Dumbledore. Dudley has to get surgery to remove it
2. gets the Trio involved in his illegal and dangerous dragon hatching scheme, which results only in them being caught and punished, and in Ron being gravely injured
3. calls Draco an idiot
4. sends Harry and Ron into the forest to speak with Aragog
5. Draco gets injured in Hagrid's lesson
6. His blast-ended skrewts lesson result in multiple injured students
7. threatens Draco with transfiguration again after Moody's stunt
8. asks Harry and Hermione to secretly look after his incredibly dangerous brother
9. makes a fuss about the Trio dropping his subject and guilt-trips them about it

Not sure what you have against Firenze, but...

*McGonnogal:*

1.  forces Harry to become Seeker without asking him if he wants to, threatening him with punishment if he doesn't practice hard (in the process, ignores Draco's attempt to steal Neville's Rememberall)
2.  pulls 1st-year Draco by his ear in addition to assigning detention and docking 20 points
3.  sends 1st years to the Forbidden Forest to find a unicorn-slaying horror, in addition to docking 150 points from her own house, thus making Harry & Co. a target for hatred and discouraging Gryffindors from trying to win the House Cup
4.  Doesn't notice 1st-year Ginny's mental state
5.  Allows Ron to study with a broken wand
6.  catches Harry and Ron wandering the hallways alone, when teachers escort students everywhere, and lets them get away with it because Harry lies that they're going to see Hermione in the hospital wing; does not escort them
7.  locks Neville out of the common room with a mass murderer on the loose for having his passwords stolen, a humiliating and dangerous punishment for something that's not Neville's fault.
8.  Lets Harry practice Quidditch outdoors in POA despite the danger he is in bcz she wants the Quidditch Cup
9.  reacts to Moody torturing Draco by ordering Moody to take Draco to Snape to be punished some more, and doesn't check on him
10. humiliates Neville because she doesn't want to look bad in front of the foreign delegations
11. punishes Harry for losing his temper with Umbridge, proceeds to do the same thing in front of him
12. admits she treated Peter poorly because he wasn't as talented as his friends

*Slughorn:*

1. starts an elitist club to promote his faves and doesn't bother to learn Ron's name. This clearly affects Ron (Molly is still raw about Arthur being excluded from the Slug Club, years later - talk about emotional damage!)
2. Ron gets poisoned in front of him and he just stands there
3. was Tom Riddle's mentor and his influence on Tom is apparent in Tom trying to become a teacher to influence young minds, and testing poisons on house elves; he is openly prejudiced, though non-violent. Further, Slytherins were groomed into the DEs under his nose.

*and Snape,* according to you, the worst offender at the school, who insults students on a few occasions, takes a few points, and sets safe, sensible punishments.

A partial list of Snape protecting students:

*Snape:*

1.  runs into the Shrieking Shack to face Black and Lupin on the full moon to save the trio
2.  when the egg starts screaming in GOF, runs toward the screams alone in the middle of the night
3.  gives Umbridge fake Veritaserum
4.  Orders Harry to release Neville when he thinks Ron and Harry are fighting him
5.  Saves Neville from being choked by Crabbe
6.  Leaves an occlumency lesson because he hears someone screaming
7.  Vows to protect Draco, follows through
8.  Runs toward Myrtle's cries of a murder, not knowing who was hurt or how and what danger he might face
9.  Steers Hermione+Luna out of harm's way before shit goes down by telling them to go help Flitwick in HBP
10. After killing Dumbledore, stops Death Eaters from Cruciating Harry
11. He is the one Dumbledore assigned to keep students safe during DH. Within this, he Sent the silver trio to Hagrid as a form of "punishment" for trying to steal the sword.
