That is assuming that Snape associated the DADA post with certain death. Yes, it is cursed. But out of the 6 DADA teachers we know of only Quirrel died. Yes, Lockhart, Moody, Crouch and Umbridge had bad stuff happen to them. At the same time Moody, Lupin and Umbridge came out perfectly alright physically, ditto for Snape at the end of year 6.

We don't know what happened to the other DADA teachers who taught in the years between the day the position was cursed by Tom Riddle and the day Harry finished Voldemort for good, but from the above canon we can infer that the survival chances are quite good and that being the DADA teacher does not mean certain death.
