Your reasons for applying are that its slightly easier to teach. In the face of a chance of death, rape, or ostracization from society that just doesn't hold up as reasonable. All DADA teachers are incapacitated s.t. they are unable to teach again. That is a death sentence for Snape, who relies on teaching to spy. Also, I actually had numbers for what we've seen - and the death rate is > 50%. I never claimed it was a death sentence before, but you have to admit saying that going from math teacher prep time to art teacher prep time is worth the chance of death is an outlandish claim. If Snape wanted to kill himself, he could've done it with his own wand, not by applying for a position he knew he wouldn't get.

Alternatively, the explanation that applying when he knew he wouldn't get it suits the ends we know him to have is not outlandish and is actually sensical/logical.
