As somebody else pointed out in another comment, it is canon that Snape applied for the post repeatedly. We sadly don't know why, we can only speculate.

I believe that there are plenty of good reasons for Snape to apply. You argue that it would be a death sentence. I disagree. And even if there was a high risk of dying, who says that Snape wasn't slightly suicidal? He isn't exactly the most well-adjusted person in canon and there are plenty of fanfics that have him depressed and with anger issues.
