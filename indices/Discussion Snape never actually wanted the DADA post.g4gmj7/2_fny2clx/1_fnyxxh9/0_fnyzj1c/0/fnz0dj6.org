Lockhart lost his full memory, which is essentially death (a death of personality). Crouch died (Moody was not the DADA prof). Umbridge was raped by centaurs.

3/5 of them died. The rest of them had their lives wrecked in some way.

You still havent given literally any reason one would risk a 3/5 chance of death (or even a 1/5 chance or a 1/10 chance). People are here saying the 'prep work is probably less for DADA than potions'. Oh well alright in that case...
