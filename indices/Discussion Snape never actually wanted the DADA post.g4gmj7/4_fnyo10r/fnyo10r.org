It's a fact that Snape "loved" the Dark Arts, and DADA was the closest thing to it while at Hogwarts, but I wonder if the rumor that he wanted to teach the class does not just come from his animosity with pretty much all the previous DADA teachers?

Of course, I can't speak for before 1991 since we don't know who taught it then, but from the time Harry arrived at Hogwarts :

1. Quirrel : A previous Muggle Studies teacher, who seem barely competent. Is also the main suspect about who would want to steal the thing protected in the 3rd floor corridor (not to mention has Voldemort behind his head but I doubt Snape learnt about it before Harry).
2. Lockart : Well pretty much the perfect opposite of Snape. While Snape doesn't care about appearence and focus on skills, Lockart is someone completely incompetent who only cares about appearances.
3. Lupin : Just a guy part of a group he hated for most of his life, who also happen to be a werewold who almost killed him when he was 16.
4. Moody : Dark Wizard catcher who antagonized him for most of the year. (Because Barty impersonated him and hated Snape for his lack of "loyalty" for the Dark Lord but most people believed in him).
5. Umbridge : 100% incompetent to teach any class, and is just really easy to hate in general.

I mean, if he treated all the previous DADA teachers like this one (barely masked comptent if not outright hate), no wonder students thought he wanted their job.
