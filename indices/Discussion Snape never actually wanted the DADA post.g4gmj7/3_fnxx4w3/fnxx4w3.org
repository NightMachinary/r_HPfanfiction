I don't know - Snape /does/ want the DADA position in canon. It's 100% canon that he wanted it for years before he /finally/ got it in year 6.

You might think it's illogical, and sure - it kind of is, if he believes in the curse. But it's the canon situation, and though fanfic obviously dials it up to 11, as it's wont to do with everything, I don't see why it's that unbelievable that people go with the canon route there.
