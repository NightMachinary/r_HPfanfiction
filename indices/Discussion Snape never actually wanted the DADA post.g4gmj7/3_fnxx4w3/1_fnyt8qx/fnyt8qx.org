It's not canon that he /wants/ it, it's canon that he applied for it, repeatedly. And in HBP it's revealed why - he and Dumbledore concocted a story that Dumbledore never fully trusted Snape, and that Snape had reason to resent Dumbledore (as [[/u/HagofaSophia][u/HagofaSophia]] has rightly pointed out in the OP), which would make it more believable to Voldemort that Snape never truly became Dumbledore's man.

The quote from OotP that you posted actually proves this - the fact that Snape kept applying, despite knowing very well Dumbledore would reject him, makes no sense /unless/ you realise that Snape didn't expect his application to be accepted.

The interview you posted precedes the last two books - /obviously/ JKR wouldn't have given away the real reason behind the whole DADA story, since it would have made Snape's true loyalties clear. Of course Dumbledore fully and completely trusted Snape.

The fact that the first mention of Snape mentions his desire for the DADA post is... very clearly meant to be a giant red herring, and part of the reason Harry suspects him, and not Quirrell, throughout the first book.

As for the other DADA teachers - Snape was asked by Dumbledore to keep an eye on Quirrell, his distaste for incompetent Lockhart makes perfect sense (and he's still civil towards him), his suspicions regarding Lupin hiding information about Sirius were actually true, his wariness of Moody is perfectly normal, and Umbridge was universally hated.

The reason Snape took the post in Y6 was because he and Dumbledore knew that Dumbledore would be dead in less than a year, Snape would have to flee, and Hogwarts would fall to Voldemort. At which point, Dumbledore hoped, Snape would be named Headmaster, so the DADA position would become irrelevant.
