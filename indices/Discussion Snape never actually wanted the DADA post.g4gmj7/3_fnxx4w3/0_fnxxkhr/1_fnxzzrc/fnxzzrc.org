Well, obviously we never get Snape saying it outright - but his actions towards the DADA professors, the student rumormongering about it, and his being the one to go for it in 6th year would put the burden of proof on the opposite side.

We also have interviews with JKR like [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2003/0626-alberthall-fry.htm][this one from 2003]], where she says:

  When Prof Dumbledore took Prof Snape onto the staff and Prof Snape said “I'd like to be Prof of Defence Against the Dark Arts please” and Prof Dumbledore felt it might bring out the worst in Snape so said “I think we'll get you to teach Potions and see how you get along there”.

Basically, if JKR's interviews, her very first introduction of Snape in the books (literally the first mention of Snape in the books is that he wants Quirrell's job), and his actions throughout the series all point to Snape wanting the position of DADA, I think that's fairly emphatically the case.

For emphasis, for at least each of the 3 first books, virtually the first reference to Snape is that he wants the DADA position - at every feast it's repeatedly stated that it's common knowledge that that's the position he wants.
