But they technically /were/ in cahoots - for an entire year, Lupin kept silent about Sirius being an Animagus, /despite being convinced that he was a mass murderer out to get Harry/. Not even after Sirius was seen standing over the children's beds, with a knife, did Lupin tell Dumbledore how Sirius was getting inside the castle.

What Snape didn't realise was that Lupin wasn't sacrificing the lives of children to help out his friend, he was doing it because he didn't want to look bad in front of Dumbledore. Which sounds so ridiculous, of course Snape would assume it's a lie.

This is the Trio's reaction (children who actually /like/ Lupin):

  Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all---but why was Lupin playing along with him?

  Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would be calm sort of voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.

  [this is immediately after they reach the Shack, and Lupin says Scabbers is Peter; then there's a long discussion about Peter being an Animagus, but absolutely nothing about him being a traitor]

  “If you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,” said Black, who was still watching Scabbers's every desperate move. “I've waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.”

  “All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,” said Lupin, “I only know how it began...”

  Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it.

  [then Lupin launches into a heartwarming story about what good pals he, Sirius, Peter and James's beloved father all were - which sounds extremely manipulative from an outside point of view]

  Getting someone's soul destroyed is a bit of a leap if you're not absolutely certain of their crimes, no?
#+end_quote

That was the Ministry's and Dumbledore's problem. Snape took Sirius (and would have taken Lupin, too) to the rightful authorities, without harming him in any way (which is more than can be said about Sirius and his treatment of unconscious Snape).

And, again - there was absolutely no reason /not/ to be certain. The only new information, compared to 13 years previously, was that Sirius Black had slashed the Fat Lady, then broken into Gryffindor tower. Why didn't he go to Dumbledore, or at least write him a letter, telling him to check Scabbers? The only reason anyone would think Sirius and Lupin's story should have been taken seriously is because they have meta knowledge.

  And by vitriol, I was more referring to the general deranged and angry spitting and snarling during and the prideful smirking and gloating afterward way he spoke and phrased rather than the terminology he used.
#+end_quote

Was he supposed to be cool, calm, and collected while facing the mass murderer who had gotten Lily killed, and who had been trying for an entire year to murder Harry? The fact that the entire scene, with Sirius, Lupin, and James 2.0, was taking place in the same spot where he'd almost been killed when he was 15 would have been a huge trigger, no doubt, but then it's all the more impressive that he managed to inflict zero harm on anyone (and only was harmed himself, again).

Only a few minutes earlier, Sirius had been /choking/ Harry.

#+begin_quote
  And I could alternatively ask why you're trusting a spy and someone who knowingly put a child in an unhappy home (ten dark and terrible years) when you're not trusting Harry? Who's to say that whole spy plot excuse wasn't a lie as well? Or even Sirius and Remus? Why not trust them?
#+end_quote

I'm sorry, I don't think I understand what you mean. Could you please elaborate?

#+begin_quote
  And the interpretation of the Fidelius more comes from the attempted Watsonian explanations of their actions. Was Sirius genuinely worried that he'd be tortured so much he'd eventually go mad and give the answer willingly? Was Pettigrew an attempt to draw out a spy by getting them to target the one who could turn into a tiny rat and run away really easily? Did James and Lily not want the pressure of being their own secret keepers? Did the spell get updated and developed between their using it and the Weasley's using it? etc.
#+end_quote

Yeah, that's why I said the Fidelius charm and the way it works is a plot-hole - once it's established that the information cannot be extracted from the Secret Keeper against his/her will, via Veritaserum/Imperius/Legilimency etc., it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever that they didn't make either Dumbledore, or one of the Potters, Secret Keeper.

The canon explanation, that they wanted to use Sirius as a decoy, only makes sense on the assumption that those methods /do/ work, and that they expected Voldemort to waste his time sending his followers after Sirius. Meanwhile, Peter could be hidden somewhere, and nobody would look for him. But even that was an idiotic plan - once Sirius was caught, the Potters' location couldn't be extracted from him, but the real Secret Keeper's identity could. And the entire logic of choosing Peter specifically because he was weak and a coward, who sided with the "biggest bully", as the person to trust with the secret to Voldemort's downfall was incredibly nonsensical, especially at a time when Voldemort was winning.

I think that entire plotline might be the biggest issue in the entire series, exactly because there's no Watsonian explanation that doesn't require everyone, including Dumbledore, to be a cretin.

Even if you go with "Dumbledore actually /wanted/ the Potters to be attacked, because he knew Voldemort would give Lily a chance to step aside, and the special magic would be activated" (and I could buy that), it still doesn't explain why the Potters weren't their own SK, or why James agreed to use Peter over Sirius.

  I have no skin in the game in the Snape argument, I'll take whatever position a story I'm reading takes, so long as it fits the fic's inner logic and narrative voice.
#+end_quote

Oh, sure! In a fic anything can happen, as long as the author doesn't mind going against canon or having the characters behave OOC. I think [[/u/HagofaSophia][u/HagofaSophia]] was pointing out that people confuse those OOC, and sometimes illogical, renditions with canon, to the point that /they/ get treated like canon, and become extremely frequent in fanfic. Snape being willing to die in exchange for the pleasure of teaching DADA for one year would apparently be such an example.
