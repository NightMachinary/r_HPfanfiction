No biggie. I don't much pay attention to usernames either. :)

And well, that's your interpretation, no? :D

Another example is the Fidelius - even if you don't include the times that Rowling breaks her own rules (eg. Bill telling Harry that Arthur and Co are at Muriels even though he's stated to not be the secret keeper and thus can't share that secret), that still provides a mess of interpretations. We know from Bill that you can be the secret keeper of your own place and that the Secret can only be shared willingly, so why wasn't a Potter the secret keeper for their Godric's Hollow hiding place? Why was Sirius worried about giving up the secret if he couldn't share it willingly? Since the answers aren't directly given, you can take a whole bunch of interpretations.
