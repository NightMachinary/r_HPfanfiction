  given the majority of everything else Rowling has done, it was probably something crappily Doylist and contradictory that only works for the plot of the single book it was written in.
#+end_quote

It's the complete opposite of that - it's an overarching story with a Watsonian explanation that makes perfect sense. Snape and Dumbledore wanted to sell the idea that Snape was never truly reformed, and that Dumbledore never fully trusted him.

It only becomes contradictory and dumb when someone is so keen on hating Snape, they ignore the fact Snape practically spells out the explanation, in "Spinner's End", for even the slowest of wits. Which is how they end up with "Snape was so desperate to curse children/get out of his job/[other idiotic reason], and cared about nothing else, that he was willing to die after one year of doing it!"

  while I'd observe that Snape is very vitriolic and quite irrational in that scene - he phrases everything more like he's trying to get revenge due to his hatred of the Marauders than justice for Lily/to protect Harry.

Does he? It's Lupin and Sirius who keep referring to the "schoolboy grudge" (which is in itself grossly reductive), and Sirius is the one who is weirdly and obsessively vitriolic towards a guy who, as far as he knows, was just some kid he used to bully, then never heard from again.

  “Vengeance is very sweet,” Snape breathed at Black. “How I hoped I would be the one to catch you...” [...]

  You would have been well served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black---now get out of the way, or I will make you.

Sure, on first reading it, you would think Snape's primary motivator is getting revenge on the mass murderer who almost murdered him, too. But once you know "the twist", which was actually guessed by some people after PoA, it's glaringly obvious that Snape's desire to be the one to catch Sirius has to do with him thinking Sirius was the traitor, and he's furious because it looks like Sirius is managing to trick James's son just like he did James.

Snape was perfectly calm and capable of being civil to Lupin, even brewing his potion, and was also perfectly calm, if wary, around Sirius once he knew the truth.

  so he hears enough of the conversation to get the idea that Remus isn't in cahoots at all, he's just in enough denial and hatred to not really care and then lie about what he heard later to Fudge.
#+end_quote

He doesn't - between the moment the door opens, and the moment he reveals himself, Peter being the traitor isn't mentioned a single time. Instead, he's mentioned lovingly as part of the Marauders, and the entire thing sounds like a mass murderer and the man who /openly admits to covering for him/ trying to spin a story that will trick 3 children.

#+begin_quote
  And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all along.
#+end_quote

Any normal person looking at this entire incident would see a Voldemort-supporting mass murderer (and /nobody/ doubted his guilt), who has been trying to kill Harry the entire year (was him showing up in Harry's bedroom with a knife a cute misunderstanding, or what?), and whose method of entering the castle was known to Lupin. The latter, who has left his office without taking the potion, is currently in the process of regaling Harry with a heartwarming and completely irrelevant tale about the antics of his father while at school - it looks like Lupin is trying to distract Harry, by playing on his father issues, as a way of stalling for time until his transformation.

Saying that Snape should have suspected the truth, in these conditions, because the reader knows the truth, is lacking theory of mind.

In truth, very few aspects of the books are open to interpretation, by virtue of them being children's books - JKR has the characters spell out their feelings or motivations, or those of other characters', for the benefit of younger readers. The Fidelius Charm is, indeed, a plot-hole, but that's not the same thing as something being up for interpretation.
