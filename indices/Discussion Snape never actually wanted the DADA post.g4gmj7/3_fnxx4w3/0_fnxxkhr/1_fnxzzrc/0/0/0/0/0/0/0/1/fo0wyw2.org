And well, yeah. All of that is your interpretation. I'm not arguing for the opposite, only that the opposite is similarly valid to the people who posit it as their chosen interpretation, especially given that they can also draw certain things from the books and movies to support their points. Just because you're convinced by your points doesn't make you right, the same way them feeling that way about theirs doesn't make them right. Technically the only person who can say one or the other is the right one is Rowling, given that it's her story.

Aside from the fact that Animagi are a thing and commonly known to the point that literally every kid since McGiggles starting teaching knows they exist? And that Snape knows the Marauders had no problem doing stupid shit outside the rules (possibly even with McG's help, since he seems to think she was soft on them), like becoming Animagi? When it comes to literally obliterating two people's souls from existence, that would probably count as reasonable doubt to be investigated.

But then again, after talking about Peter being an animagus, they literally chain up the guy who can turn into a tiny rat with a single thought, so maybe Remus and Sirius are complete morons like Snappy seems to think. :D

  That was the Ministry's and Dumbledore's problem.

He also says things like "give me an excuse and I'll do it" and "I don't think we need to go to the castle, I can just call the Dementors and get them to do it when we get outside", which implies some strong "I'm not going to take them to the authorities" vibes.

No, but at least mildly rational is a good state to be in when you're making the decision to literally destroy someone else's soul or judgements about taking in new information. When you're angry to that degree, you're not going to listen to new information or consider other points of view, in addition to being in the place he was nearly killed in and being faced with the man that he thinks killed the girl he was obsessed with.

Basically, what makes you believe Snape and Dumbledore about that whole "We don't trust each other" ruse when Snape is a spy (ie. his profession is to pretend to be things he isn't and lie to people) and Dumbledore is the type of man who'd knowingly send Harry to an unhappy childhood ("Ten dark and terrible years") when you don't believe what Harry thinks about Snape? What makes them more trustworthy to you than him?

An alternative possible explanation there was that he believes in his abilities and is confident he could survive whatever the curse threw at him until he could leave semi-gracefully like Lupin did at the end of year two and disappear into obscurity.

And as a final question - do you really believe that all the things he did were okay, simply because he did them to win a war he and Dumbledore didn't even have proof would restart again? 'cause that's how it's coming off - that him literally being a student's worst fear is okay simply because he was trying to keep his cover? That explanation equals excuse?
