Yes, and it's also my interpretation that Harry is male. Not all opinions are equal, or valid. The people arguing that Snape's life goal was to teach DADA for one year cannot bring any arguments to support that thesis, as you'll notice right in this post. And JKR did say which is right, when she had Snape use the ruse on Bellatrix.

  Aside from the fact that Animagi are a thing and commonly known to the point that literally every kid since McGiggles starting teaching knows they exist?

And Lupin launching into a story about the three of them being Animagi proved what, exactly, other than the fact that Lupin had hid crucial information for an entire year? Which automatically made him a liar and an accomplice.

#+begin_quote
  He also says things like "give me an excuse and I'll do it" and "I don't think we need to go to the castle, I can just call the Dementors and get them to do it when we get outside", which implies some strong "I'm not going to take them to the authorities" vibes.
#+end_quote

??? He literally took them straight to the authorities. Do you have an issue with Snape not being gentle and soothing with a mass murderer who had been trying to kill a child (and injured one of his friends in the process), and his werewolf accomplice? I don't understand.

#+begin_quote
  No, but at least mildly rational is a good state to be in when you're making the decision to literally destroy someone else's soul or judgements about taking in new information.
#+end_quote

Once again, he took a mass murderer to the proper authorities. What are you even arguing - that if someone sees an escaped mass murderer (who has been recently spotted in a child's room, with a knife), he should stop and listen to the murderer's sob story, instead of calling the police?

#+begin_quote
  When you're angry to that degree, you're not going to listen to new information or consider other points of view, in addition to being in the place he was nearly killed in and being faced with the man that he thinks killed the girl he was obsessed with.
#+end_quote

Well, if Sirius hadn't been so obsessed with James, and with getting revenge, he wouldn't have spent an entire year acting like a sociopath, wouldn't have strangled Harry and broken Ron's leg, and would have gone to Dumbledore instead. Except even Sirius realised how ridiculous his story sounded.

#+begin_quote
  Basically, what makes you believe Snape and Dumbledore about that whole "We don't trust each other" ruse when Snape is a spy (ie. his profession is to pretend to be things he isn't and lie to people) and Dumbledore is the type of man who'd knowingly send Harry to an unhappy childhood ("Ten dark and terrible years") when you don't believe what Harry thinks about Snape? What makes them more trustworthy to you than him?
#+end_quote

No, I understood whom you were referring to, I don't understand the comparison. Are you asking me why I believe that Dumbledore and Snape were working together to bring down Voldemort, and why I believe they know the history of the DADA post? Seriously?

Harry's not omniscient, and he's subjective, like everyone else - it's very clear when his likes and dislikes inform his opinion. See, for example, the way he complains about Snape supposedly talking about the Dark Arts "lovingly", with Hermione pointing out that, actually, he sounded exactly like Harry.

In any case, concerning the DADA post, Harry's opinion really is worthless, since he has no way of knowing what Snape truly thinks on the matter. All he has to go on is a rumour he heard from Percy.

#+begin_quote
  An alternative possible explanation there was that he believes in his abilities and is confident he could survive whatever the curse threw at him until he could leave semi-gracefully like Lupin did at the end of year two and disappear into obscurity.
#+end_quote

And what would be the point? It would mean that Snape didn't actually care about protecting Harry and defeating Voldemort, and that his goal in life was to be the DADA teacher for one year. Not only is that out-of-character and directly contradicted by canon (there's an entire scene that establishes Snape's reason for staying at Hogwarts is to protect Harry, and prepare for Voldemort's return), it's the sort of moronic writing that has people look down on fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  And as a final question - do you really believe that all the things he did were okay, simply because he did them to win a war he and Dumbledore didn't even have proof would restart again? 'cause that's how it's coming off - that him literally being a student's worst fear is okay simply because he was trying to keep his cover? That explanation equals excuse?
#+end_quote

How is this related, in any way, to the fact that thinking Snape tried, every year, to get himself killed/booted via the curse is idiotic?

But if we're going down the tired "Neville's BoGgArt" path... are hands literally being a student's worst fear ok? I think the Ministry should have led a strong campaign to chop off everyone's hands. Alternatively, can we talk about the absolute sociopath that is Hermione? She fears failing an exam more than the deaths of her parents? And Ron - his sister has just been nearly killed by Voldemort's memory and a Basilisk, and his greatest fear are spiders?

There's a Doylist explanation for the Boggart, and a Watsonian one, and neither has to do with Snape being eViL.

As for his general teaching behaviour - not only do I think it's ok, I think it's outright saintly compared to the monsters that are Hagrid and McGonagall.

They send 11 y.o. children, on their own, to find the horrendous Unicorn killer; McGiggles turns her own students into bullying targets, and locks Neville outside of his common room while a mass murderer is on the loose; she lets Harry train in dangerous conditions because she's that desperate to win the Cup, etc. As for Hagrid...

  “It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. “I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.”

  Hagrid's smile faded off his face.\\
  "Yeh'll do wha' yer told," he growled, "or I'll be takin' a leaf outta Professor Moody's book. . . . I hear yeh made a good ferret, Malfoy."\\
  The Gryffindors roared with laughter. Malfoy flushed with anger, but apparently the memory of Moody's punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting.\\
  [...]\\
  "Look like they're havin' fun, don' they?" Hagrid said happily. Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren't; every now and then, with an alarming bang, one of the skrewts' ends would explode, causing it to shoot forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.\\
  [...]\\
  Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut across one cheek). Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.

But Snape docked 5 points from Ron for physically attacking Draco, the injustice!

Also, the fact that Harry thinks Draco being tortured, then being threatened with more torture, is hilarious, is exactly the reason why you shouldn't treat his opinions as if they were fact.
