Oh, I was just imagining what Matpack was referring to by his comments. I don't really have an opinion or care overmuch as to what the answer to the original question is either way - given the majority of everything else Rowling has done, it was probably something crappily Doylist and contradictory that only works for the plot of the single book it was written in.

Really, there's enough room in canon for whatever interpretation you want to take of anything in it. So long as the position a fic telling a story involving that detail takes is good for that story, it doesn't really matter to me.

To give an example of the open-to-interpretation thing, you see the scene as Snape trying to get Remus kissed because he thinks he's in cahoots with Sirius, while I'd observe that Snape is very vitriolic and quite irrational in that scene - he phrases everything more like he's trying to get revenge due to his hatred of the Marauders than justice for Lily/to protect Harry. Also, that whole part where they stare at the door because it opened suddenly was apparently Snape sneaking in with the cloak and the time-travelled Harry and Hermione see him running in barely a minute or two after they (the pre-timetravel version of them) first enter the tunnel to the shack, so he hears enough of the conversation to get the idea that Remus isn't in cahoots at all, he's just in enough denial and hatred to not really care and then lie about what he heard later to Fudge. Both of us could be right, both of us could be wrong - there's enough detail to support either interpretation and enough detail to contradict.

So, yeah. You could be right in that he didn't want the job and was just faking it for some reason, while Matpack could be right in that Umbridge's directly stated quote was accurate.
