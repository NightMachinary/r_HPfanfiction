I did say to get the idea he wasn't in cahoots, not to know for certain - they did talk about Scabbers being Pettigrew and Pettigrew surviving a little bit before the door opened, as I recall (I admit I haven't read the books in years, though). Getting someone's soul destroyed is a bit of a leap if you're not absolutely certain of their crimes, no? Perhaps a leap someone who hated another person would make? Especially since Harry and Hermione saw he literally entered the tunnel a couple minutes after Lupin when they were time-travelling, meaning he likely could've heard more than just the bit after he entered. And by vitriol, I was more referring to the general deranged and angry spitting and snarling during and the prideful smirking and gloating afterward way he spoke and phrased rather than the terminology he used.

And I could alternatively ask why you're trusting a spy and someone who knowingly put a child in an unhappy home (ten dark and terrible years) when you're not trusting Harry? Who's to say that whole spy plot excuse wasn't a lie as well? Or even Sirius and Remus? Why not trust them?

And the interpretation of the Fidelius more comes from the attempted Watsonian explanations of their actions. Was Sirius genuinely worried that he'd be tortured so much he'd eventually go mad and give the answer willingly? Was Pettigrew an attempt to draw out a spy by getting them to target the one who could turn into a tiny rat and run away really easily? Did James and Lily not want the pressure of being their own secret keepers? Did the spell get updated and developed between their using it and the Weasley's using it? etc.

But again, as I said, I don't actually care what the answer is either way. I have no skin in the game in the Snape argument, I'll take whatever position a story I'm reading takes, so long as it fits the fic's inner logic and narrative voice.
