  I think that entire plotline might be the biggest issue in the entire series, exactly because there's no Watsonian explanation that doesn't require everyone, including Dumbledore, to be a cretin.

If you ignore "the info can't be extracted from someone against their will" (which is only 2ndary canon anyway), maybe the idea was that James and/or Lily will be able to leave the house or invite people in without breaking the charm (preventing a scenario where it breaks like it did in DH when Yaxley or whoever apparated to 12 grimmauld with Hermione by touching her).

Then Bill will have chosen to be his own SK only after the Potter precedent.

It still doesn't explain why it wasn't Dumbledore... But i can live with "Sirius is stupid" as an explanation :)))
