I agree that he probably did not really want the DADA position. But I can't really think of any reasons for the rumour to exist. Might be a little bit far-fetched, but maybe it was Dumbledore's way of ensuring Snape's position as a spy. Ultimately, if Voldemort knows that Snape has been refused to become a DADA professor, just as he was, he would be more trusting to him...
