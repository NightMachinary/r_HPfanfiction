I believe it. Snape needed to keep up the appearance for the other side as well, and making it look like he wants the Dark Arts job could be his way of letting the Death Eaters and Voldemort know that he hasn't moved from his old ways. This isn't to say that Snake didn't want it, on the contrary, I think he really wanted the job but I think applying each year (despite fully knowing the oncoming rejection) was done for a greater purpose. And as you said, he was permitted in the 6th year, because Dumbledore was dying (and he wanted Slughorn to join Hogwarts).

Not only this but creating false rumours for appearance has been done before by Dumbledore - he made the public believe that the Shrieking Shack is haunted for Remus Lupin's sake. He's well verse in giving air to such things.
