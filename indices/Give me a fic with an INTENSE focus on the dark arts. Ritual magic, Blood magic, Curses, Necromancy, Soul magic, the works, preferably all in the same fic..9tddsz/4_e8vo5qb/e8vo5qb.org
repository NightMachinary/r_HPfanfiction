I just finished Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(8303194) and it pretty much covers all of these things. Featuring Hard Working and not OP!Harry and Mentor!Dumbledore, it has some pretty good stuff in it. The downside is the level of typos, but if you can filter them out with your brain it's a good plot and story.
