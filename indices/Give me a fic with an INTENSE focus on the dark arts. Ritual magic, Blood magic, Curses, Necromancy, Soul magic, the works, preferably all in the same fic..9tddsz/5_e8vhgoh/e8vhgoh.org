Can't link as the material approaches Ludicrous levels of inappropriateness (and overwordiness) but search for the Enter the Silver Flame series by SamStone, probably best found on hpfanficarchive.com. The original story was known as Harry & Kiki: Tales of the Boy Necromancer.

If you weren't wedded to the idea of Harry as the MC, I'd suggest trying the Black Queen series by Silently Watches. Main character is Jennifer Potter, the abandoned (not)squib sister of the boy who lived, Danny Potter.
