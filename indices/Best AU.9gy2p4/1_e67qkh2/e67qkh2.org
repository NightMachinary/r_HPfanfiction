Linkffn(the havoc side of the force)

Star wars harry potter crossover with Harry in the prequels universe. Harry doesn't just wave his wand and fix every problem and the Jedi are weary of him for the most part. The story does not under power the Jedi or sith. Harry keeps winning because people underestimate him, which I will be fair, feels a bit like a cop out.

Also a great hk-47 who never fails to make me laugh.
