  Harry keeps winning because people underestimate him

More like because wizardry is just straight out more powerful than the force, no way around it.

Jedi and sith are remarkable compared to normals because they're essentially highly trained magical warriors. Harry on the other hand is a highly experienced magical warrior wielding a much more versatile power that actually disrupts the force when used. Harry losing basically requires HIM underestimating the enemy or being caught off guard.
