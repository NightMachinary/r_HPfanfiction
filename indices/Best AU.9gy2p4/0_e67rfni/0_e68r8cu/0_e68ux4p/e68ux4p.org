A matrilineal society formed centuries before canon due to a number of important physical and magical disparities between wizards and witches. Now females control everything in society, for good or ill, and generally force males to marry in order to maintain their population. There is also some elemental information (not like avatar though) and Harry is an aether (sort of a magic sensor). Its sort of depressing, yet at the same time understandable within the context of the story. Its also, arguably, one of the only /good/ examples of a harem story, because it spends 80% of the story trying to tell the reader why they are bad in the first place.
