POTDK and the Firebird Trilogy. I can't choose one, but both are incredibly creative.

POTDK is a Voldemort Won AU which manages to stay true both the character of Voldemort as well as Harry which is no easy feat. Sadly incomplete but what is there manages to paint a rather believeable picture and is very creative.

The Firebird Trilogy takes place in a matriarchal society. I've never read anything like it, the dystopia he builds is highly creative. Darth Marrs manages to create an amazing world, but the plot does go a bit off the rails towards the end. The subversion of usual harems as well as the political landscape are well thought out. Well worth a read.
