I like this: updates are slow, though.

I feel sorry for Neville: he's trying to replace Harry in Hermione's life, only for it to be a doomed venture from the get-go.

Given that a lot of characters in the series are blank slates, barring a name or other details (such as Katie Bell being "kind", a chaser, and one year older, as a quick overview), there are many characters that could go full on batshit yandere.

...Oh man, I now want to read a yandere Katie Bell.
