linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Future Past) feels like this nowadays. It's very tropey (though it was early enough that it might have spawned some of those tropes) and the author really can't stand Snape/Malfoy (they're not even well-rounded villains, just flat evil), but I love seeing idealized versions of Ron/Hermione/Neville/Ginny/Luna.
