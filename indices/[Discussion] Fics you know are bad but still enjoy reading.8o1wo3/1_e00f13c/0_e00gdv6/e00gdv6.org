To be honest, I can't help but love the idea of the six of them in this fic. They become such a team, and after everything is out in the open their dynamic becomes so entertaining to read.

They're like the spy team from Mission Impossible (take your pick they're pretty interchangeable, not the original tv show). This works pretty well too:

Harry = Ethan: He's the leader, always in ridiculous situations, confident in the face of danger. Tom Cruise is short and always running (again like Harry!) in his movies, and is generally acknowledged as capable and well known.

Ginny = Julia: Ginny's in sort of relationship with Harry, spends the early part ignorant of Harry's "job," but cottons on over time that something is up. He is always trying to keep her safe, and she thinks thats a waste of time and effort.

Ron = Luther: they meet due to the circumstances early in the story, bond due to mutual positions, and become steadfast friends who bond from conflict. Sticks by him consistently and has Harry's back in whatever he does, and defends him first.

Seriously, its like the the title is Harry Potter and the Impossible Mission.
