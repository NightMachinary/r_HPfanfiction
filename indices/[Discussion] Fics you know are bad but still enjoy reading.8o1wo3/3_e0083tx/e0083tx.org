It has to be linkao3(Harry Potter in the Claw of the Raven). It was my first experience with the tropes incorporated, but that's about all it was. Weasley and Dumbledore Bashing, 11 year-old politics, Pureblood Culture/Society, helpful goblins, you name it it's there.

The writing itself wasn't bad though, and the last task in the GoF there stood out to me.
