I can stomach a lot of stuff, including all the tropes you mentioned, but I can't abide just how long-winded the author is. He takes blathering to a whole other level. Information that could be conveyed with two sentences, he gives in two paragraphs and he does it constantly. Not only that, every few chapters he repeats Harry's diatribes from earlier chapters.

Not kidding, like 40% of this story is repetition in slightly different form. It would benefit hugely from some competent beta work.
