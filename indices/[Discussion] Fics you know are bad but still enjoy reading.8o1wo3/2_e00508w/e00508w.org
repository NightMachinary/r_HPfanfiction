Easily linkffn(Basilisk-Born). Filled with certain consistent horrible spelling/grammar (though I think the author is a non-native English speaker, so I give a bit of leeway here), manipulative GreaterGood!Dumbledore, creature ancestry, nobility, family magic that happens because you are born into the family, lazy magical theory and silly time travel. However, highly entertaining so I overlook all the other crap.
