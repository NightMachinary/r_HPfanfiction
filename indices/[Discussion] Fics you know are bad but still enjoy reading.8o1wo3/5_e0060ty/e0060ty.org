If you're a SSHG fan, it's got to be linkffn(When A Lioness Fights by Kayly Silverstorm)

Pros: Long! Badass Hermione. Harry grows up along the way. Ron is mostly immature but comes around a bit towards the end. Good, developing relationship between Snape and Hermione without unrealistic misunderstandings that are just thrown in for angst. Redeemed Draco.

Cons: Poor grammar and spelling at times, but English is not the author's first language. Wtf, "Hermione the Death Eater" does not make any sense (I skipped over this fic for years because of this, but I eventually gave in when I couldn't find anything else to read). Hermione is too overpowered, without any real basis for it. I'm sure there's more that I'm not thinking of right now.
