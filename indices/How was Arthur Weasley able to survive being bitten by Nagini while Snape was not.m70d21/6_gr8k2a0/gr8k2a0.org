Well. There are several theories so TL:DR because J.K wrote it like that

The first is Snape accepted his Death, he knew he was going to die and he didn't fight Arthur fought the snake probably making it harder to hit important arteries.

The second is voldermort was in hiding theres a good chance that Voldemort didnt want arthur dead because that would. Bring more risk of him being discovered.

The third is. Nagini feels emotions from Voldemort(harry is a horcrux and he does) so. The need to kill Snape for Voldemort was stronger than arthur and nagini reacted accordingly
