Because JK Rowling didn't want the Weasleys to go through anymore heartbreak, while Snape was just an exposition piece who needed to die for the plot to continue. Imagine if the Golden Trio wasn't there though. Do you think Harry would still die somehow, or if they would kill Voldemort and he would return later?
