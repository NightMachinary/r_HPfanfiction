[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] by The Carnivorous Muffin Still in progress. It's very OOC. I believe the author said at one point that it would eventually be fem!harry/LV, which might be what you're looking for. But I highly recomend.

If you're just looking for a fem!harrry fic, then there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] by Silently Watching. Things get weird very fast though and its NOT recomended if you are squeamish...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4040192/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived]] by Agnostics Puppet has an alternate demension where Harry meets his female counterpart.

Hope this helps, I haven't read all of them so I don't know their quality.
