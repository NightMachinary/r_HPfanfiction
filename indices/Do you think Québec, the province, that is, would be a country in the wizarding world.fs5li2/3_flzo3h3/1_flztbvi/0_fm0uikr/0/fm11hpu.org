So what? They'll exterminate them like the British and Spanish did and make them retreat to small enclaves? The French were very friendly to the First Nations except, obviously, for those who attacked them like the Iroquois, who literally exterminated the Hurons. The French would still need to learn about the different magical plants and creatures from the continent and if the French wizards were anything like the Muggles in their colonisation tactics then they would have been vastly outnumbered by the Natives. The French also had a tradition of gift giving with the Natives, to show their friendship with them.
