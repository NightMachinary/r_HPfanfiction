I like it, but I think the indigenous communities would have to be treated on a case-by-case basis. The tribes on the west coast are very different to those up north and those out east. Especially for the west coast ones I can't imagine them wanting to give up their land willingly, since that's where the red cedar trees are and they were less nomadic (if not mostly sedentary? I don't remember) than northern tribes were.
