Why the he'll would the French share a country with the First Nations?

I'm of the opinion that French Canada would take the Quebec, Newfoundland, N.S. and N.B. Region, while English Canada would take the other Provinces. I would have the First Nations be mostly in the Territories and Alaska, in some sort of tribe system.

Maybe the F.N. would constantly venture into the southern Provinces and have to be beaten back every now and then.
