I meant in the time of SoS.

“crowns were unified, but the kingdoms weren't” ... you mean it was a personal union, two separate kingdoms with one person holding the crowns for both of them? That was the same as what become the Austrian Empire at 1804. Until then all Habsburg emperors have titles like “Joseph II., the Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia, Archduke of Austria, ...” and long long list of lesser titles.
