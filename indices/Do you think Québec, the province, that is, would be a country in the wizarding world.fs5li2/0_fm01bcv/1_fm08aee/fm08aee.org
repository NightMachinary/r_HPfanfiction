The Scottish and English crowns were unified when the SoS came into effect but the kingdoms weren't.

Hogwarts was founded in around about 990 (long before the SoS), only a few years after England was unified politically and before mainland Scotland was unified - Strathclyde was at least nominally independent until the eleventh century IIRC. At various points in the 700 years between the founding and the union of muggle England and Scotland, Scotland was a vassal state, conquered territory, a friendly independent neighbour, an ally, an enemy, and so on.

All of which is to say ... muggle borders don't appear to matter much to magicals.
