From my notes for a fic that'll never see the light of day:

- Canada (Western provinces/territories up to Ontario)

- Athabascan Territories (Alaska, Yukon, Nunavat, Northwestern Territories, extending to include the northern part of the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec)

- Acadia/Acadie (Quebec, the Maritimes and part of Maine.)

I imagine that some areas in "Canada" would remain unceded territory for various tribes, however.
