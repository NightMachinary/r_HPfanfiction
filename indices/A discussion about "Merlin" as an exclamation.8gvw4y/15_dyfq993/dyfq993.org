I do lean on "Merlin!" quite a bit and especially Hermione's "Merlin's pants!" because she used it so conspicuously, but I also use "God," "good Lord," etc. a lot too--just more "balanced" than in canon. I just figured you could reasonably extend JKR's use of "Merlin's beard" and so forth to more varied usage.

My headcanon is that Christianity was nearly stamped out of Wizarding Britain in the 1600s, the height of the witch-hunts in that country, but filtered back in over subsequent centuries with ~10% mostly-Christian muggle-borns added to the population with each new generation. So during the 1600s, Christian-based exclamations in English were replaced by invoking Merlin and other famous witches and wizards similarly to the names of saints, but by the present day, the lexicon has become more mixed.
