I've always thought references to God from purebloods was weird. The Wizarding World is run by people who at best simply do not care for muggles but even the bigots are cool with their religion? A religion which around the time the Statute of Secrecy became a thing, was explicitly beginning to tie all magical use to the devil and using that to justify persecution of any oddity in society? Its just weird.

As such, I don't mind the Merlin usages.
