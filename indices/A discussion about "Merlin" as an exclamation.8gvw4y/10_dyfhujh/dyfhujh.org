It makes sense that Christianity would not just go away from magical culture, just because they separated. What would /not/ make sense if they were still catholic, protestant or anglican. Christianity probably took on a unique form for magical culture, embedding their ability within the canon of the Bible. Hey, maybe thats even part of why they think themselves above muggles - because they have received this blessing and these others didn't.

Merlin as an exclamation has always seemed to me like involking just this pillar of magic. I also often use Circe, Morgana, Solomon,... as exclamations, in the same vein as Merlin's name. If magic is a core part of their belief system, it would make sense to have - as you said - Saints of magic.

I also believe for the sake of my headcanon that naturalistic religions would be much more common among the magical folk. After all, the condemnation of non-divine magic, especially witchcraft, by the Church has a rather long tradition. I would assume magical communities would have been faced with an impossible choice when pressured to christianize.
