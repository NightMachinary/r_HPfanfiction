Guys, seriously, you're "disappointed" in me? OK, here it is:

  "And are they getting married in my bedroom?" asked Ron furiously. "No! So why, in the name of Merlin's saggy left ---" "Don't talk to your mother like that," Mr. Weasley said firmly.

Personally, I've always thought "Merlin's pants" is funnier because it brings to mind the image of wise old Merlin wearing nothing but a pair of saggy white briefs.
