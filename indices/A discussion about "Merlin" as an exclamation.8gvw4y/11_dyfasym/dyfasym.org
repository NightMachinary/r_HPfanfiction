Eh. That might be official canon but it's not my headcanon and here's why:

First of all, Wizards and Witches started to hide from the Muggles primarily because of religious persecution, and since Wizarding society is very traditional and conservative, they will remember that for a long time.

Second of all, Wizards derive their traditions from paganism, not Christianity, sure there are exceptions such as the Fat Friar, but he wasn't devout, he joined the order in order to help people, here's an excerpt from his [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Fat_Friar][wiki page]]:

"At some point in his life, he joined the clergy as part of a mendicant religious order. Meaning that he spent his life begging in the name of charity. A noble life for a noble man. Apparently, given his physically large appearance, he indulged in the pleasures of food and drink.

The Fat Friar's kindness was to be his undoing. He was executed because senior churchmen grew suspicious of his ability to cure the pox merely by poking peasants with a stick, and his ill-advised habit of pulling rabbits out of the communion cup."

And finally, Merlin wasn't just a great Wizard, he was a mythical almost God like figure to them, at least British Wizards. More akin to Jesus than, say, a Saint.
