I have to admit that I use "Merlin!" or "Oh Merlin!" in real life... I don't know how cringey it is, but I am not even the tiniest bit religious and using "god" or "jesus" feels extremely wrong to me, like I am mocking someone and I do not want to do that. Therefore I prefer reading it in fanfiction as well.
