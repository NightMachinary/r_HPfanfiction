Always interesting to see the Malfoys conform (doubly so with how they dress in the movies). Kind of throws the snobbish, pureblood etiquette, society stories off.

Given just how isolated and out of touch with everything muggle the magical-raised witches/wizards we see are, I wonder if it was intentional on Rowling's part or just a worldbuilding fail/nonissue.

I'm okay with the Merlins and equivalent exclamations ('Morgana's tits!' 'For Salazar's Sake...'), no matter how corny or jarring they are. It's fun and adds a bit of distance to the muggle world. There's this irrational sense of wanting to convert everything mundane so to have an appropriate amount of whimsy attached.
