right on. this also ties in with a lot of fanfic going the route of assuming the wizarding world is into samhain, yule and what not

like, im pretty sure everyone called it christmas, even the snotty purebloods. yule only ever got mentioned in the context of the yule ball as far as i can tell

that said, i don't mind it if it's done well as part of an AU. usually tho, it's just in bad slytherin fics and sth else that evil dumbles tried to take away from the poor pureblods
