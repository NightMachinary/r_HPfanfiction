I'd love to see a story where arithmancy is hard because it's base-everything. If you're working out a ritual with a pentagram, your spacing has to be calculated in base-5. If you're working with a circle, it's ALMOST base-3. Everyone thinks it's base-3 but just a bit finicky; maybe the MC figures out that it's actually base-pi, and can get just that little bit closer to a perfect magic circle. And, hell, if you're working on some complicated, multi-layered hypergeometry for a ward scheme or epic enchantment, you may have equations with four or five different bases that you have to reduce to a single solution without any cross-category interference!

I dunno about a story ABOUT arithmancy. That might be boring. But having that as a side element could be cool.
