You are missing an essential truth: when we change the base we just change how we look at a certain number, but not the number. 111 in binary is exactly the same thing as 7 in decimal (or Base12) or as 13 in base 4 (for example).

It's still the 5th prime number and retains all it's properties, including magical ones.

So Voldemort separating his soul in 111 parts in binary is the same as separating his soul in 1111111 in unary or 7 in decimal, you'd get just as many soul parts.
