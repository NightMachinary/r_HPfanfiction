Different numerical bases might make certain calculations easier, or represent some phenomenon more closely. The reason behind time measurement being base 60 use by the Sumerians has already been mentioned. That's arbitrary, though, just like other measurements, such as distance.

Most distance measurements (inch, cubit, mile) were originally based off the dimensions or capabilities of the human body. I could see the size of a shield produced by a spell being arithmetically (and arithmantically) related to the body measurements of the wizard or witch who first developed the spell.

I've read one story in which curses were all properly described using base-13 arithmancy. Charms had a different base, possibly 7, but I don't recall.
