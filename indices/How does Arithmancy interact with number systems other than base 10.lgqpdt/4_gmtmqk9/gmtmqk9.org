Seven is the most powerful number magically because of what it represents. You, your parents and your grandparents. Three generations, seven people. Its a very old Anglo Saxton symbol. Which makes sense why its included in a magic system made by an English woman. Three is powerful for the same reason, you and your parents. That sort of veneration for ancestry is an important part of paganism which seems to be the basis Harry-Potter-verse.
