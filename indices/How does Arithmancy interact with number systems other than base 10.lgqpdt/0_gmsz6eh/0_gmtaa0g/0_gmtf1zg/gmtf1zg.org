5 fingers on one hand (or 4, if we keep the thumb as a pointer - in which case you wouldn't use that hand for the first iteration of 12), 12 knuckles on the other (thumb is used as pointer). That lets you count up to 60 on both hands.

I think it may have started as a compromise of sorts - if you count in base 12 and want to trade with someone who counts in base 5, base 60 is an easy conversion for both of those (because 5Ã—12=60).

Certain other Base 12 systems use the knuckles on both hands, counting up to 144.
