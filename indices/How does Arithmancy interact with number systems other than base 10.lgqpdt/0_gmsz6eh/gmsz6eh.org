We might get some clues about certain other number-systems, based on older civilizations that used anything other than Base 10.

For example, the ancient Sumerians counted in Base 12, using their thumb to point at the knuckles on one hand. The Egyptians also used this system after them.

Base 4 was common in Pacific nations, such as Papua New Guinea - they just used their thumb to point at their fingers and counted on one hand.

If we figure out which numbers featured in their folklore/mythology (and that of other civilizations that didn't use Base 10), we'd most likely have an answer to this question.

EDIT: Apparently the Sumerians actually counted in Base 60, using the knuckles on one hand to count to 12 repeatedly and "iterating" with the other.\\
Incidentally, old civilizations counting in base 12 and base 60 is also why we measure time the way we do - 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and (2Ã—)12 hours per day. Anything shorter than a second only became important after the Decimal system was introduced, so we "grafted on" the decimal way for those.
