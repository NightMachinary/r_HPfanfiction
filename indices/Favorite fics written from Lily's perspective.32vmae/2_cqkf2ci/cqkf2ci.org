[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6019444/1/Before-The-Fawn][Before the Fawn]] is one of my favorite Lily stories. It cycles through multiple years and the writer really showcases how everyone matures through school and the unrest with Voldemort. I just reread it and would definitely recommend, except for the fact that it is unfinished.
