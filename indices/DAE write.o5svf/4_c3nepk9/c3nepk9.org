I've been working on a story for almost a year now. I think it's turning out pretty darn well so far, about 120,000 words in...but it's not even a third of the way to being fully written out, I'm afraid. It's the first HP fanfic I've attempted, but it's an idea that I've had for a while. Lupin is one of my favorites (books and movies), and I wanted to explore his character further. It's definitely more of a character exploration thing that just "OMG LUPIN YAY MAKE BABIES WITH MAH OC," dealing with grief, loss, loneliness...and, yes, a bit of romance. Once I finish it (who knows when that will be...), I plan to submit it to FF.net. But only when it's completely done. I hate when authors just quit on a good story due to hiatus or other obligations.
