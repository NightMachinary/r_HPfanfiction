I used to write Harry Potter fanfic and posted on FFnet. Now I stick to another series. But I'm not sure I want to share what 14-year old me wrote during my lunch breaks. I'm surprised I got so many reviews still.

But for the other series I write for - I just like writing as a hobby. Plus after reading so much I felt the urge to give back to the community of sorts.

I stopped writing in the Harry Potter world because I'm out of original ideas. If i'm going to write something I don't want to do what's already been done good, and after lots of HP fanfic I'm out of ideas. But I enjoy the occasional story.
