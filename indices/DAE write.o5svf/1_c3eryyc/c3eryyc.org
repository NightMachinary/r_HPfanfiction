I write! I am currently in the middle of two HP fan fictions in between my actual novel. One of them is a retelling of Snape's time in Hogwarts if he had been the fourth member of the Marauders instead of Wormtail. The other (and my main fan fic currently ) is a next gen fic. It's got Albus and Scorpius working as teachers at a school in America (thought it quickly dissolves into political intrigue, obviously).

I try to keep things as in character as possible, though I won't lie, I adore the Slash and even if its not super obvious, almost everything I write is Slash flavored. I only post to FF.net mostly because I grew up on the site and never bothered to branch out. I'm comfortable with their lay out, so there you go.
