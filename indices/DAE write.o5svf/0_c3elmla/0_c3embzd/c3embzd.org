Definitely :D Writing's like a idea dump for me and it's like a load off my mind. I hope you do publish something! I find most fic communities pretty friendly.

I'm pretty shifty with my knowledge of canon to be honest, which is likely why I've gravitated toward next-gen. I just really like writing in the world JKR has built. Quite nice how there can be so many different kinds of outlets in the same universe.
