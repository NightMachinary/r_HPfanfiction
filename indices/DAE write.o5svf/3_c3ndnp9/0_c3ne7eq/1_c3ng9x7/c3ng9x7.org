I hate readding stuff that isn't cannon, just can't deal with it (Methods of Rationality excluded from this naturally).

Dracomione's just will not be read by me either (because, they exist in real fantasy landto me, I mean Draco REALLY didn't give a shit about Hermione and GENUINELY believed she was like the dirt on his shoe.)

Don't like Lily James fics because in all honesty, I dislike gryffindors. Sounds harsh, but I find them to be a very blunt, tactless boring house, Slytherins make for far better reading. (Hence my love for Andromeda/Narcissia/Bellatrix fics).

And yes poor Scorpius, he is totally wild carded. But personally, I think you can really do what you want with the next generation. I like to start from a standpoint where the Weasleys have been elevated to a point of high fame and an almost superhuman status, and the Malfoys being the equivalent to mudbloods instead, makes for some very interesting character development in my opinion. I mean how can the Weasley/Potter kids NOT end up fucked up if exposed to riches and fame. I mean I can just imagine Ron Weasley spoiling his kids rotten to avoid them never feeling poor in the same way that he did. I can imagine Harry's kids to be too at ease in the public spotlight. At the reverse I would have thought that on the whole, the Malfoy's would live a very horrid existence, after all they defected at the last second, so their standing among the pureblood community (well those left who aren't locked up, which really isn't many) would be severely dimished and then in the public eye they would be openly hated and Scorpius would be born into this hate (I love fics that use this as a driving point to define his character in one way or another)

Don't mind reading AU fics either, as long as they are pretty wildly AU, but keeping characters off JKR in character. Oh and I drop all fictions that are like "GRYFFINDORS GOOD, SLYTHERINS EVIL!" immediately.
