Not a Harry/Ginny fan either, mostly because Ginny annoys me. Maybe it's just a first impression that stuck from the first time I read the books. Movies didn't help.

Scorpius, on the other hand, I throw him everywhere in my stories. Rose/Scorpius, Victoire/Scorpius, Scorpius/OC. Poor thing's become the Next Gen wildcard. Do you write a lot of eras or just read them? HP's the only fandom where I like reading just about anything that's good, though I know most people have strict preferences for pairings.
