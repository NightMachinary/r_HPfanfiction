I write. I'm a shameless fan of most canon pairings (Except Harry and Ginny, you are NEVER going to convince me that those two had enough to make a lasting relationship).

Currently quite obsessed with the terribly cliched Rose/Scorpius fictions. But I do also have a nice Andromeda Black / Ted tonks fiction floating around in my head (but I can't bring myself to post it after one of the most quality fictions I ever read was on that pairing)
