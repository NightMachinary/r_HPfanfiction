Other than Penny Harwood, I think my own "Bad at This" fits this bill. Harry and Hermione spent time together, it's fluffy, it has cuddling, Ron is mentioned in passing, but the story pays more attention to Lavender, who is Hermione's annoying friend whom she nonetheless likes (to a certain degree).
