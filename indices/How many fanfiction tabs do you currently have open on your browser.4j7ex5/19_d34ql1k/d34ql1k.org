Actual fics? None. Rec lists? Three.

I try not to keep fics up in tabs - stuff from FFN gets emailed to my kindle with the fanfictiondownloader site, AO3 fics get added to my Read Later list (god I love that feature), and everything else I use a browser extension to turn into an ebook and load on my kindle. Well, no, the short ones I'll queue up in Instapaper, which emails to kindle.
