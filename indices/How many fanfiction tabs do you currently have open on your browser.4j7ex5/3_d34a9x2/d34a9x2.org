Six, which isn't a lot by any means (if I'm not careful it could easy be as many as 20) but still too damn much (I hate clutter). I'll have downloaded/saved those fics by the end of the day so that should clear it up. Honestly, Google Chrome's "pin tab" feature is both a blessing and a curse.

I also have four tabs open for different fic rec pages. It's bugging me but I don't want to close any of them right now.
