Two. First is C2 at ffnet that I'm prowling for new reads, second is fic that's waiting to be put in Calibre.

I used to keep fics pinned/grouped in browser before judging them download-worthy, now I simply download any fic with description that even remotely arouses my interest.

Using Calibre library to keep track of what I've read/judged as waste of time was fine for a while, but then it grew too big and took forever to load up. I've settled on deleting whole fanfic library after every 500 fics.
