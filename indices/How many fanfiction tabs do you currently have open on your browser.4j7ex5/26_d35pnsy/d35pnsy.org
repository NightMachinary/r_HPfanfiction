Don't even want to count - sorry, it's many (about three browser windows with 40 tabs each at least...at least that was what I had a few minutes ago - had to update the flash player and I'd re-open those fictions later on when I am the mood for some reading))...I am kind of messy with Opera (it can handle a lot of windows without crashing or even showing signs of slowing etc. - I like damned Waterfox more, but they still haven't fixed it becoming slow and unwieldy if you open to many tabs!)...I often close down a few windows with loads of tabs, but they tend to accumulate :) (till I get rid of them...I am glad that I equiped this computer with 16 GB of RAM when I put it together in 2012 (4 GB where the norm back then, but the Price for RAM was down (50 Euros for 16 GB of low profile Corsair RAM) and I wanted to use quad-channel with 4 GB Modules and it was obvious that RAM-Size would increase in the future, so why not build a system that lasts a while?))
