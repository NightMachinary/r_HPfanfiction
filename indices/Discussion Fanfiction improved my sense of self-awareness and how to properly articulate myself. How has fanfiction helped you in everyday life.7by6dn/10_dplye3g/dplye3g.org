Fan fiction was what got me into writing in the first place. For years I had had issues with essay writing due to various learning disabilities but fanfic was where I really learned how to write. I've looked at my old work and I've seen the time progression improvements. Honestly without fanfic I wouldn't be the writer I am today.
