Fanfiction made me really great at writing porn.

Sounds useless, I know, but now I actually do that semi-professionally, and I make money publishing erotica - I don't think before I started writing fanfic that I ever would have thought I could end up making some money out of those skills, you know? Except for the very vague "famous author" day dreams lots of people have.
