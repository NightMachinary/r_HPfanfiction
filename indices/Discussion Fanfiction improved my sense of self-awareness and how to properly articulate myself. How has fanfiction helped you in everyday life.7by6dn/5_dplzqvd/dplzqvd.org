Fanfiction is what introduced me to the concept of asexuality. After having broken up with my boyfriend because I found kissing him to be weird and uncomfortable, I really thought that there might be something wrong with me. It was really great to learn that I'm not alone, and that I'm not broken. I don't know that I ever would have discovered asexuality in enough detail to feel comfortable identifying that way if it weren't for fanfic.
