This is ridiculously close to my own experience in life o_o

I never dated anyone, but fanfiction was also what made me realize I'm asexual. I had severe misconceptions about asexuality, and was trying to understand my own sexuality, and then I related 100% with an asexual character in a fanfic and thought "wait, so THAT'S what I am?!". After that I researched asexuality and yes, so that's what I am.
