The wealth in gay characters definitly opened up a whole new world for me. I'm from a small-ish non-English speaking town, and while our library was pretty great it didn't have a lot of books with gay characters. And when they did, it usually didn't say so on the back so you just had to read all the books to stumble upon a homosexual here or there (which was fine by me, I read a lot). Maybe a librarian would have been able to help, but no way my young closeted self was going to ask for that.

Cue me learning enough English to explore the internet, and finding out about fanfiction. Here were all these stories about people just like me, and I loved it. It didn't matter that it was all about gay guys and I'm a girl, just the fact that the standard romance wasn't boy-meets-girl really helped me. And I could read it all by myself, didn't have to explain to my parents what I was reading or save up money to buy the books (in which case I would probably have to order them somewhere anyway, the book store had the same problem as the library). When I look back at the fics I read and liked back then I cringe at the writing, they were honestly pretty horrible. I definitely learned better ways of looking for fanfiction, haha. But that's okay, since those horrible fics helped me come to terms with my own sexuality. Representation is important ;)
