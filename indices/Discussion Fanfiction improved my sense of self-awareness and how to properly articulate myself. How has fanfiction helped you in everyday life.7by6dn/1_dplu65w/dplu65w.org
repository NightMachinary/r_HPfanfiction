Fanfiction is what made me realize that there is an audience for pretty much everything.

I can write pretty much anything (as long as the quality of the writing itself isn't garbage of course) and someone out there might at least be interested in what I put on each page.

I really didn't have the confidence to write the things that strayed away from common understanding until I saw that AU stuff can actually reach an audience.

Now here I am outlining a fairly ridiculous Fanfic for Lord of the Rings where the ring has complete agency and it's speaking to/influencing the people that it meets in order to bring Middle Earth into the age of Man.
