I wasn't. If I remember correctly I was rewatching a Silent Hill 2 letsplay.

The Lord of the Rings thing came from me re-reading Fellowship recently and getting caught up on the line:

"It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the ring itself that decided things. The Ring left him."

With that line, I kind of got obsessed and started retelling the entire story in my head but largely from the point of view of the ring who decided to betray its master and move the world out of its current age and into the future.
