I don't know if I would call it helping, but it made me a lot more critical of writing in general. I now pay way more more attention to writing style and quality and appreciate a good plot, characterizations and dialogue.

Although the side effect of this is that I no longer enjoy a lot of fics since I am way too critical of random things and generally stop reading if I see something I don't like.
