Not sure if this constitutes as everyday life, but writing more FanFiction has helped me understand that "flowery language" isn't universally spoken, and for good reason. Also, sometimes the best details given in stories are the ones that aren't accurately depicted, in the sense that the reader uses his/her own imagination to draw out the scene that's in front of them.
