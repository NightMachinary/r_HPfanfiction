#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.
#+end_quote

"Prison" only has one "i", and commas are needed before "but" and "and" if the conjunctions separate an independent clause.

Three simple errors in three sentences gives me an idea of the quality of writing I'd be in for if I clicked that link!
