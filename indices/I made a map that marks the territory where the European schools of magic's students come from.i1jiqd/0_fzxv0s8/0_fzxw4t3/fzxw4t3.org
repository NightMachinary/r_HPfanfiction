That is indeed true. In my story, like some others, Krum didn't go to the Yugoslav one because it's trash since Grindelwald's War (semi genocide of the intellectual population who protest against tyrannical rule and lack of actual professionals in teaching positions does that) and his skills in Quidditch allowed him to be noticed by Karkaroff and he offered him a place. From Scandinavia to Bulgaria is too big of a students pool and just Scandinavia with Bulgaria seems oddly specific.
