Does Rāuarcane come from Răuarcane by any chance? I thought that was a breve at first (curvy thing on the a) not a macron (straight line) but it still is weird since "rău" means evil and "arcane" could refer to arcane stuff, as in magic, so it would be translated as "evil magic." Is that what you were going for there? And yes, I am Romanian, so I know what I'm talking about :)
