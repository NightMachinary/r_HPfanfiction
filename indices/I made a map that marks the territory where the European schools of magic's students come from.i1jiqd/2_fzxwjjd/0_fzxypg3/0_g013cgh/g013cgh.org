That sounds very wrong as a German Speaker since it translates to Gracefulphoenix (it should have an H after the P either way) and not in a form which was correct at any time. If you want something with a phoenix reference, Phönixberg (Phoenix Hill) or Phönixburg (Phoenix Castle) sound a lot better in German. Phönixsburg (Phoenix's Castle) if you want to change the case. That being said, the Phoenix is not part of the "German mythology" if you want to call it that.

HOWEVER, I have a solution for that problem. Near Cologne, there is a hill called Drachenfels (Dragon's rock) with a castle ruin atop of it (a proper castle, not something which looks like a Disney palace), overlooking the Rhine. So Drachenfels would be a good option. Depending on where exactly you want that school to be, I can also dig up something there.
