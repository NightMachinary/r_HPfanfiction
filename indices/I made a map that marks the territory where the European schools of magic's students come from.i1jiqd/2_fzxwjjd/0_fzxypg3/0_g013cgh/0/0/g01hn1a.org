Bavaria is a bit tricky since there was no reason to build stuff in the high mountains and most of those have names which do not sound like magic. There are a few things with fog/mist (Nebelhorn near Obersdorf, Nebelberg in Austria) and more than one Falkenberg (Falcon Mountain) to choose from. I went through the lists of all hills, castles, ruins and moors in Bavaria and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (also has alps) and there's not one cool sounding place in there.
