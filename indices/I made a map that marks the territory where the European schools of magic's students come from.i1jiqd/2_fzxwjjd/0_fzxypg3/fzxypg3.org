Rāuarcane, Anmutigerpönix and Òlympos are completely yours truly, Czarnokiesto is directly from linkffn(Animagus at War) by White Squirrel - I highly recommend it and its prequel -, and the one that shares Bulgaria and Yugoslavia I saw in multiple stories but was a concept I'd already thought of for a previous story with a similar background that I deleted. Turkey I put no information because the school where it's children go isn't European and wizarding Albania's dark wizard puppet government doesn't have the resources and the leeway in the ICW to have an officially recognized school of magic and it certainly doesn't want to send its children to study abroad, it could give them ideas.
