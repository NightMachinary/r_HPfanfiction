First, I would like to thank you for correcting me, it is greatly appreciated. Second, Slovakia is something I can change easily in both my map and fanfic (since for the latter it is not mentionned yet). Thirdly I'm not sure I completely understand the first part of your last paragraph about the Balkan division; the Austrian lands go to the German school, the Hungarian lands go to the Transylvanian school (which is shared between Hungary, Transylvania and Romania), the Albanians go nowhere because of its political situation, the Greeks go to Ã’lympos, and the smaller Yugoslavia and Bulgaria go to their own South Slavic school. Since Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are countries I haven't changed yet in my political map following your comment I'm going to send you the newest version in DM. Fourthly, I can't give Scandinavia Karelia because historical Karelia isn't an available state on the site I made this.
