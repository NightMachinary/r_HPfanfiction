Transylvania is a bit tricky because the official language was German, under both Hungarian and Austrain rule due to the large number of "Saxon" (Rhenish would be more accurate, but the historical term is saxon) settlers who came there from the 12th century onwards (and later it was used to resettle a lot of Protestants from all over the Habsburg lands (17th and 18th century mostly).

Hungary and Romania in one pot is asking for a lot of violence, especially after Trianon. They never got along well, but after that the relationship was poisoned, especially since Romania annexed all of Transylvania, not only the Romanian majority regions they were supposed to receive according to Wilson.

For the Balkans, I'd place Crotian with the Austrian school, the Dubrovnik area to Italy. Transylvania is historically Hungarian, but Hungary is closer to the West than to Romania/Bulgaria. Not that Bulgaria or Romania should exist in the first place based on 1692 borders, but Bulgaria is canon.
