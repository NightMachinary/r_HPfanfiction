The bits south of rump Poland should be with Austria and/or Hungary rather than Poland since there is not a lot of history linking them after the failed Crusade for Varna in 1444 (where the Polish/Hungarian/Bohemian Union died with their King on November 10th). A good chunk of Transylvania was culturally Saxon, German was more common as a language in Bohemia than Czech until Nationalism hit in the late 19th century.

Also, why is the historical core of Lithuania not in the Polish group? The Grand Duke of Lithuania was elected King of Poland for more than a century before their dynasty died out and both "countries" formed the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the Treaty of Lublin, uniting them until the three partitions of Poland(-Lithuania). The Dnieper would be a more suitable boundary, with a Russian exclave around Kiev.

The Baltics are also a mess, culturally Courland is way closer to Germany or the PLC, you can make a case for Liefland (Estonia) being in the Swedish sphere. Karelia should definitely be Finnish, that border was only changed by Stalin's invasion in 1939/40 (Winter War).

Grouping the East and West Balkans is also quite messy, a division into Wallachia, Moldova and Bulgaria at one side and what was Yugoslavia (-Austrian lands) with Albania on the other side. Ragusa/Dubrovnik could be in the Italian sphere, Lombardy and Venetia only became Italian in the late 19/early 20th century after 3-4 centuries under the House Habsburg (and three decades of France in 1515 and under Napoleon).
