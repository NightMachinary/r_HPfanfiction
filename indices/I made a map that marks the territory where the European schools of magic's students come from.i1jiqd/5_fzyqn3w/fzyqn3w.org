I've got so many questions. If Beauxbatons draws srudents from three of the more populated countries in Europe, it's got to be massive. As in at least a hundred and fifty students per year. And say that it's a boarding school, I'm not sure France has the tradition for school houses as the UK, but you've got to split the years up a bit, right? You can't have common rooms for 150+ students or a potions class with 150+ students.

Also, I think it's so odd that JKR claims Durmstrang is in Scandinavia. It does not sound Scandinavian in the slightest, and wouldn't make sense if they draw on students from Bulgaria, and maybe Russia, as I think Poliakoff is Russian. If so, I would be surprised if the Sandinavian countries would agree on a school collaborative with Russia. The Scandinavian countries have never had a good relationship to Russia (or even the Soviet union).

The Nordic countries are similar and friendly between each other despite a complicated history, and have so much in common that I've made a headcanon for myself that Durmstrang is somewhere in central or eastern Europe, while a different school draws students from Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, The Faroe Islands and Denmark (+ Greenland).
