If that was the case, what's the point in one school, if all the classes were done three times in three different languages? It just seems to me that it defeats the purpose of having a shared school across several countries. There are international boarding schools irl too, but they choose a language to teach in. Children can learn languages remarkably fast

Beauxbatons should at least have some shared area so they would have other places to go in their spare time.
