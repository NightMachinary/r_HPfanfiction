I personally imagine them being separated by languages in classes, which would make the French classes bigger since it would draw from France, Wallonia, Switzerland, Luxembourg and I imagine some others who speak French from other countries (I mean, is it really the true Beauxbâtons experience if you don't have it in French?). But more seriously, the classes would be separated by languages (but even then it's not all the French together, all the Spanish together, etc. that would be too big). I also don't really think Beauxbätons /has/ common rooms, just an area in the castle (maybe some corridor or wing) where the students have their rooms of 3/4 persons which are randomly selected.
