One of my favorites in that vein is linkffn(The Sea King by Doghead13).

There's also linkffn(Harry Potter and the Aftermath by CJaMes12).

Also linkffn(A New World by Leonhard van Euler), in which Harry works IT for Stark Industries.

If you don't mind fem!Harry, there's linkffn(Blackdog by Atlantis Sinatra), although that's unfinished and fairly inactive, and the story hasn't progressed very far. I like it, though.

There's also one with Harry running an auto repair business in the US, which is an Avengers cross, but I can't come up with the title.

Another story I really like, which is more about what Harry has to go through before he can work at a cafe, is linkffn(To Become A Muggle by lifebitten).
