That's a really odd deficit to exist. Honestly, I'd think a Post-War Hermione would be the most likely to go full Knight Templar to get her way or fight her fight. I can totally picture her just throwing her hands up at all the incompetent Ministry folk and their nonsense then concluding that the best option would be Murder. Sort of Yandere Activism, basically. Do to the Ministry what she did to 'ole Rita Skeets and Malfoy.

EDIT - Also, you might get more response if you flair this appropriately. You want 'Request', not 'Recommendation'. Request is asking for fics, Recommendation is when you're recommending fics.
