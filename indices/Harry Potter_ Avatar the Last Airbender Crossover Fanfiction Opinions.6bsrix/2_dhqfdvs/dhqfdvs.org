I enjoy crossovers (or AUs) where just the settings are merged, but not the characters. For HP/ATLA, this'd be either Harry Potter, but with bending instead of magic or ATLA, but with wand magic instead of bending. The parts I like most with those are the world building and seeing how they've interpreted parts of one universe in the other universe and seeing the effects the changed circumstances have on the characters. However, the changed universe needs to actually change things. Just changing the window dressing results in a boring fic. linkffn(Harry Potter: The Last Avatar by The Sorting Cat) would be an example for what I'm talking about.

Personally, I don't think crossing over main characters between ATLA and HP works well. If e.g. Zuko is suddenly transported to the HP universe, he'd have no knowledge at all about the world and no motivation to help either the Death Eaters or the Order or anyone else. It's possible to argue that someone like Harry or Aang would help out regardless because that's just how they are, but even so, they'd still need a reason.

On the other hand, if a character is born in another universe, they're basically an OC that borrows name and appearance from a character from another fandom. Both the HP characters and the ATLA characters grow and develop inside their respective universes, if you change that, you change their character. Harry that grew up first with the Dursleys and later with Hermione and Ron is going to be quite different from a Harry born and raised in a loving earth bender family.
