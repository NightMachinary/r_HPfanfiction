I think part of the problem is the very, /very/ stark differences in the two mythologies of the work.

Harry Potter is a world that lives alongside the "regular" world. And the magic doesn't seem to have external sources acting in their own interests.

Avatar is a different world in its own right. Different animals, different cultures, primarily Eastern influence, and a magic system that couldn't be more different that Potter's.

It's an uphill battle for even the best of authors to make a crossover between these fandoms work.

Having said that, Avatar does have the best crossover fiction I know of. Stargate and Team Avatar anyone?
