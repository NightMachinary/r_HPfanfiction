I would have a actual way for the two to crossover, and for it to make sense. Send Harry to the Avatar Verse (especially since everyone send The Gaang to Hogwarts to protect Harry from School Bullies and the Late Spring Yearly adventure). But send Harry to the Avatar World and let him do stuff, let him be a hero, have him lead a rouge group of Earth Benders or something let him help the Gaang out, join them. To often with crossovers the Characters joining the other world kinda sits around they see what is happening or "help" defeating a group the Canon group was able to anyway but they have negligible effects on anything, often only stepping in for overblown moments of cool that often mean nothing.

One of the best HP/ATLA Story (which is sadly now lost) had Harry end up in the southern water village, just before they find Aang. Harry soon discovers he is a Fire Bender utilizing rare colored flames, Black. Harry joins the Gaang and acts as the muscle the enforcer they never had, he gets Suki to travel with them from the start. The point was that A) Harry had a role other than crossover Character and B) Harry became important to the Gaang, yet he never replaced Aang as the main character. Really thats all I want, have The Crossover mean something other that "lol look at how dumb/crazy/scary/funny this world is, hey I can Solo the Strongest here" and for the crossover Character to mean something but not become the main character of the adventure.

Also get the story the hell out of Hogwarts
