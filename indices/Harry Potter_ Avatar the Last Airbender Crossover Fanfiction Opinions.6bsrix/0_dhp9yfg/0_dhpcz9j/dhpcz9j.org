I've seen some, and one i don't wish is for Dimensional Travel to be a common enough occurance that ol dumbles can send Team Avatar in a mission or something like that. Aside from that, I wouldn't mind seeing something like how some FMA crossovers happen with Eddy getting flung into the Potter Verse during OotP in Grimmuld Place.
