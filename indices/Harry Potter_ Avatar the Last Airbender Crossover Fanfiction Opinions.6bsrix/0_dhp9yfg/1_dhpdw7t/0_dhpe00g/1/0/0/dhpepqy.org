An ancient spirit-within the Spirit World- wants blood (preferably the blood of the Avatar). When a mortal interferes with their realm, it senses opportunity and hatches a plan. Avatar Roku senses it departing the Spirit World and fears this will cause an imbalance. Aang, having just defeated Ozai a mere day ago, is forced into another mission to save the world.

The summary is "meh" but I have a lot of ideas for this story that I think would make it very engaging. One of the story's main themes will be investigating the Avatar's role in the spirit world during their lifetime and then after death, with extra focus on their limitations.

I'm still picking cast members from the Gaang.
