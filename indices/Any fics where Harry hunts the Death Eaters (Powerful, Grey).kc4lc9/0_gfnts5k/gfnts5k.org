Betrayal linkffn(9095016) - Hermione accidentally leaves with Ron during the horcrux hunt. Years later, Harry is basically The Punisher with magic.

The Unforgiving Minute linkffn(6256154) - Time traveling to the day of the 3rd task, Harry has a few hours to defeat Voldemort.

Also, I think Wind Shear linkffn(12511998) fits your criteria - 20-year old Harry accidentally ends up in the past as the first war is starting to heat up. He about on par with Voldemort and Dumbledore.
