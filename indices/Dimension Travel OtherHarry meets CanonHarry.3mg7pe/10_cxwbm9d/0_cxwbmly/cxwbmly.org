  The Girl-Who-Lived won; Magical Britain never recovered. As their world grows closer to another war, the surviving DA members concoct an elaborate plan that will see Iris Potter back in time to guide her younger self and prevent the war from ever happening. Fate however has other plans. GWL BWL, dark!Harry, timetravel, canon magic.
