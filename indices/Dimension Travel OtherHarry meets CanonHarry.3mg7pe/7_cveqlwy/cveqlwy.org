I'm not quite sure if this is what you're looking for, but from the short amount I've read of elsewhere not elsewhen, it seems like these are similar.

Chapter 17 of linkffn(9720211) seems to be similar to what you're looking for. It's the middle of a story, so you might be a bit lost, but really in a sense it's a bit of a one-shot in the middle of the story (and imo largely fluff) Not much harry with harry interaction, but there is some.

linkffn(1962685) has a good Harry switching spots with an evil Harry. They don't actually meet, but there is the dimension confusion stuff. Also, the sequel to this is a third dimension, where Grindlewald replaces Voldemort, Riddle replaces Dumbledore, and Katie Bell replaces Harry Potter as the chosen one.
