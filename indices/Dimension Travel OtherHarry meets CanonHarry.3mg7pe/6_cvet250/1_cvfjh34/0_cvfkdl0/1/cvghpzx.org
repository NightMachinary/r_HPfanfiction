It's been 20hrs now, where's that list? lol

A Jaunt Through Time actually solidified my want of two Harry's coexcisting somewhere, it was hilarious. A Good Teacher's ending was sad though, and that ending is a bit open for my liking. Never read Shaping The Future, i'll add it in my to read list. Thanks for the recs, again! :D
