  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

  In a darker future, the Order pitches one last battle at Hogwarts. Defeated, Harry Potter is defenseless against Voldemort's death blow... that somehow throws him into the past. (Snarry slash and evil!Dumbledore. You have been warned!)

  COMPLETE. The odds of temporal displacement were tiny, too infinitesimal to count, and yet... The Harry Potter luck striking again, he supposed. So now there's an older, wiser, more mature Harry (well, the older part's true at least) stuck in the past. And he's determined that if he's going to change things, he'll have some fun doing it. (OR: Time travel minus angst equals this.)
