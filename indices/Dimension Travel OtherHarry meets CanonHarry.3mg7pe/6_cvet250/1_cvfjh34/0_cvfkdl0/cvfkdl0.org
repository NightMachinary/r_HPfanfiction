Well the Potters do have another kid called Harry, so there /is/ a 'Harry' even though Harry took over his dimensional counterpart?

Oh and I forgot but Nia River([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/780029/Nia-River]]) has a few of these fics but mostly abandoned except for the oneshots - linkffn(A Jaunt Through Time by Nia River;A Good Teacher by Nia River). There's also linkffn(Shaping the Future by CharmedArtist), snarry. I think I have read far too many 'dimensional!Harry coexists with canon!Harry', haha, if you give me a day or so I might probably come up with a list as long as my arm ;)
