God, I can't remember the name of it, but it's one of the most famous HP fanfics, it's over a million words, never finished, and involves Voldemort being Harry's mentor. Lot's of intimate ritual magic, a werewolf colony where Lupin and Sirius started out as a couple together, but then it was retconned away. Voldemort is the ruler of Magical U.K. and the order is a terrorist group. I think Harry was raised in Germany by his parents before they were killed in a mugging?

The story definitely involved brainwashing muggleborns as well. I think Hermione was adopted by the Malfoys.
