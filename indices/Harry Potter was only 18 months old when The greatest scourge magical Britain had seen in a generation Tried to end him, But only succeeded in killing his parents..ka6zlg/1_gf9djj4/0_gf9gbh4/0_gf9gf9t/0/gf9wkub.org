If I remember correctly Moody tried to avoid killing. But if Peter tried that bullshit with blowing up the street I think Moody would have killed him first.

Moody was not a murderer, but he did what was necessary. He did kill Evan Rosier - he has killed Death Eaters. It just wasn't what he tried first. His favorite way of dealing with them was arresting them.
