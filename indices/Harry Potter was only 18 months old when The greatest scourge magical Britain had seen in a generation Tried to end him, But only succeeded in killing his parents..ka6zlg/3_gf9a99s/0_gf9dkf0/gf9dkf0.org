His brother Charlus is 3 months old in this prompt, which fulfills the "born as the seventh month dies" and allows the divergence of Harry being 3 months older than canon (and thus /clearly/ not the child of the Prophecy). At least, I /think/ that's what pygmypuffonacid is going for - it can get a little hard to tell with English /probably/ not being their native language.

It's a WBWL fanfic prompt, Harry's age doesn't have to adhere to canon.
