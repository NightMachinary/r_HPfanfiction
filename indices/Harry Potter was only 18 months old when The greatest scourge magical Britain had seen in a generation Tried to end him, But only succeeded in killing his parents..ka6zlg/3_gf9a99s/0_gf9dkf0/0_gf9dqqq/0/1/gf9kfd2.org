I've always been curious about the following stories

WBWL with happy family life with younger brother

WGWL with Harry and his sister as adversaries

And your one Harry not being the right boy who lived. It's his bro but everyone seem to think Harry is the boy. This one would take a lot of plotting to get right.

And yes to Edgelord Harry üòÇ - I'm reading one right now, and one of the few reasons I love it is because the writer has redefined magic in the story which is quite interesting. But it does get tiring reading through his hatred for his parents who survived (which is justifies to a certain extent but does get underwhelming from time to time reading the same ‚ÄúIll never forgive them... ever‚Äù)
