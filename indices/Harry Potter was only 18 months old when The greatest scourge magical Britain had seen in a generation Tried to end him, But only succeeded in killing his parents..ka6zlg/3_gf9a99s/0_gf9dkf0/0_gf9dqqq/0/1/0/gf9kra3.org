Now the plotbunny is stuck in my head. God damn it. I already have like 5 HP WIP, I do not need another.

I was thinking that the truth of who's the BWL doesn't come out until like the final battle. Harry gets defeated (not dead but like disarmed and injured) and his little brother is like â€˜not my big brother' and steps in front of him Molly Weasley style and defeats Voldemort. The power he knows not, the love of his big brother.
