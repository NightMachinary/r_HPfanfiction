It'd be just as interesting, to me, to have Harry /blatantly/ not be the child the Prophecy refers to, but to still give them both a relatively happy childhood and have a supporting-protagonist "Harry isn't the BWL" story. Better than all those "one gets neglected, the other gets spoiled rotten, whoops we just turned our potential Saviour into an edgelord" that like 99.9% of these stories turn into.
