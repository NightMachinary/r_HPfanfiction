Okay just says at least with this prompt. Harry still has his scar, Charlus is the right age but they will be raised by Sirius ... At least with this promise I highly doubt either of the characters would be treated badly.. Voldemort is gone and Sorius went to his very Slytherin but favorite cousin Andromeda for help... On all likelihood with this prompt, the Black's would spin it as lily and James somehow taking down Voldemort to protect there kids.Plus I highly doubt a cannon sirius would ever mistreat James Potter's children.
