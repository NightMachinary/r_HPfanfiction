Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived.

The basic premise is that either Harry has a sibling, or Voldemort goes after Neville instead - fulfilling the prophecy for Harry in some convoluted way while actually being disembodied by the other.

Usually in these fics, the one hailed as the Boy-Who-Lived grows up spoiled rotten, the other one gets neglected and/or abused, and neither of them is a likeable person by the time they actually make it to Hogwarts.
