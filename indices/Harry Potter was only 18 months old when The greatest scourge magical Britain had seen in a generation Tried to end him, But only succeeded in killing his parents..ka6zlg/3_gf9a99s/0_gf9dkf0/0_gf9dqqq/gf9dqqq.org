??? I mean yes, of course fanfic doesn't mean it has to adhere to canon, the correction was just a habit lol sorry.

But Charlus could be born on Harry's birthday just a year later. Actually that would be kind of interesting and confusing. If they were both born as the seventh month dies, but on different years, which one is the prophecy child? They think it's Harry because he was born just after the prophecy was foretold but it's actually Charlus.
