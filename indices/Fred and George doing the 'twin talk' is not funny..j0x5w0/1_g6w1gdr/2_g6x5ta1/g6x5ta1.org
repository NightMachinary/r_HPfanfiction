Yeah, this would be fine. I know a set of triplets and when I'm talking to more than one of them at a time, I often have to keep turning back and forth between them because the one who started the conversation is not always the one to continue it the next sentence. I've seen that with people who are just friends too, actually, but I've never seen anyone switch every word.
