[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i2n8vm/healing_in_harry_potter/]], here's why I don't think healing would involve surgery or be a muggle "healing" education. Anatomy seems important only for identification, healing spells don't seem to require knowledge of anatomy. I definitely think potions would play a large role, though, along with spells. In short, anatomical knowledge most likely takes a step back in favor of magical skill in the wizarding world.

Also, a lot of these subjects seem to be muggle subjects. I'd expect advanced topics to be alchemy, metaphysics, conceptualization/psychology, and continuations of the Hogwarts' classes.
