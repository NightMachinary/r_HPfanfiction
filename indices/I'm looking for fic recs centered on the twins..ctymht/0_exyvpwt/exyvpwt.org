linkffn(Twin Vice Paranormal Detectives) is the best fic I can think of that fits your criteria. Admittedly, Fred isn't quite alive, but he's still very much one of the main characters (and as the story goes on, it's hinted that his status is more complicated than it seems). The story is exciting, engaging, hilarious, and beautifully written. Every character that shows up is characterized very well, but it never stops being a story about Fred and George. The only downside is that the story is unfinished, and will probably remain that way, but it's so good that it's worth a read anyways.

Also, if you haven't already, I highly recommend giving linkffn(Fox Ears) a try. This fic explores the aftermath of the battle, how Fred's death affected George, and what George is going to do to fix it. Fred is dead at the start of this one, but he gets better soon enough (and there's tons of alive Fred in the sequel as well). The story's an emotional roller-coaster in the best way possible, and is probably the best portrayal of the Weasley Twins out there.
