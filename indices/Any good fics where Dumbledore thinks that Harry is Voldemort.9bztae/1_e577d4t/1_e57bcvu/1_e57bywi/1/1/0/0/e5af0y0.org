the relationship in Full Circle doesn't take precedence over the story. Their relationship is like a cute old souls type relationship where they've been together for hundreds of years. As they've been together for so long, their relationship isn't angsted over or can't-keep-hands-off-each-other. It's almost like a cute elderly couple.
