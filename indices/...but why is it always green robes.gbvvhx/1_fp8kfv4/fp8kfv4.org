Most of the time things like this are done so that Harry stands out, even more, his eyes are special " Killing Curse Green" They're bright they shine, they are a focal point. I know this girl she has silver/grey eyes, you can see them from easily 15 feet away if you look her in the face they are that... ABRUPT.

​

Choosing clothes that fit well with who he is and what he is going to do are important, in a lot of fics where he gets these new fics its because it is a Slytherin Harry, or he is trying to appeal to the Pureblood society. Showing himself in their colors will help greatly even subconsciously.

​

Next we have the question of why green. a lot of science actually goes into color coordination, and what we think of when we see someone. In-universe this probably isn't as well known but there are some people who would obviously know of this, clothiers being a part of that group. Green with Green... Pops for lack of a better word, it draws the attention and with what Harry is known for; Surviving the killing curse, reminding people of that may act as subtle intimidation. this is the boy who lived he who shrugged off a killing curse and in recent years has fought and will continue to fight Voldemort.

​

Personally, I'm not even sure what color I would put Harry in as the green works on so many levels and for so many reasons. It doesn't help that my favorite color is also...green
