First of all, I don't know how any of you replied because I couldn't post anything yesterday. xD Second of all, I don't see it either on this reddit or in my posts or anywhere. x''D

Also - I know green and green pops out and yeah, feel free to give him green robes as well, but /come on/, other colours are fine too, it's not like his entire wardrobe has to be coordinated to match his eyes. xD It's tired and boring. Let him wear other colours too.

Be like Dumbledore - say "Fuck it!" to all fashion conventions and just wear eye-searing robes with patterns all over the place! :D
