Mostly a chapter should be about as long as you want it to be. It should accomplish exactly what you want it to accomplish. The length doesn't particularly matter.

That being said, perusing through said story, you're work is almost entirely dialogue. If you want to add length to this you could expand the conversations, have the characters talk about things other than the topic at hand, have conversations develop and then get to the plot, rather than just being entirely plot.

You can also add in more prose. Again, it's almost all dialogue, and quick dialogue at that. Another way to add in length would be to write more prose about the scenes, the characters, or the general goings ons around them.

You could also add in a more omniscient narration, if you wanted, to detail more specific character thoughts to certain situations. That being said, the limited narration does work on it's own, so it's not really necessary in my opinion. But it is a way to add word count.
