Don't feel obligated to hit a set number of words. If it flows well then there is no reason to change. You are the author not your readers. The moment you change formats they will demand more frequent updates, you can't please everyone.

Outline! Make sure you hit everything you wanted to happen.

Ask yourself questions. What was this chapter supposed to accomplish? Did it? How does this progress characterization/plot?

TLDR: Short or long, the quality of a chapter is not determined by words but of content.
