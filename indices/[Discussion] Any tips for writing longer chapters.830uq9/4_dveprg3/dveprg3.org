I try to introduce three plots to chapters.

Plot a is the main plot: e.g., harry has the top cow power of the darkness. How does this affect the story? Plot a takes the whole story to be resolved.

Plot b is taken care of over a number of chapters. For above, it's a project. Making satchels, learning what fabrics to use, the spells, and so on.

Plot c is chapter specific. THat chapter introduces a specific element that really pnly affects that chapter. I.e., harry introducing BINGO to Hogwarts. This c plot affects a plot but can easily be left out or just glossed over but i write the story partially as a slice of life as much as an adventure.

Think of it like star trek ds9. We see sisko slowly coming to accept he's the emissary over the whole series. Specific episodes are c plot basically while arcs like the dominion war are b plot taking place over chapters/episodes.
