I totally agree with [[/u/moomoogoat][u/moomoogoat]]. You're the writer, therefore you're in charge. We've all seen that movie where that last 20 minutes was completely unnecessary or read the book with the pointless filler. Quality will always top quantity and having a clear idea of where the story is going is key. If you're really worried about chapter length, try combining chapters, but that may not always work depending on the action.

As for advising you on your writing directly, the story link you provided doesn't seem to work.
