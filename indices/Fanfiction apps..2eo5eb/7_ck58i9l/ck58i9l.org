I have Fanfiction Reader for both my phone and tablet. You can search for fics from FF.net and save them to your library and log in to your FF profile to sync the stories to your apps.

For those who like copy/pasting each individual chapter and saving it in Word or Wordpad I use Cool Reader. It works for .rtf files as far as I tried but sometimes when you're reading, the screen for Day Mode suddenly goes dark and you have to resort to Night Mode, or the screen is unreadable for both modes until you exit the app. It's an okay app but I enjoy it.
