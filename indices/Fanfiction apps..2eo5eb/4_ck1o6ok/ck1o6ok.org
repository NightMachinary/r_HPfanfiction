The one I used before was removed too, bummer. So I switched to Codex Reader which is mostly the same, except it can retrieve stories from 3 sites (FanFiction.net, AO3 and fiction press I think) instead of just FFnet.

However, it has a advert banner at the bottom which can be annoying sometimes when you're reading (but hey, it's free...)
