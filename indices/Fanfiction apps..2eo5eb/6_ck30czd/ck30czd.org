I convert my stuff to pdfs - used to do it via flagfic which is shut down now. I have more fics saved than I can probably ever read. But if I want to read something new, I download it via Calibre with the FanFiction plugin. Then I save my stuff in GoogleDrive (though you can use Dropbox as well). The actual reading is done in the GoodReader app on my iPad Air. it can even sync folders, it is wonderful.
