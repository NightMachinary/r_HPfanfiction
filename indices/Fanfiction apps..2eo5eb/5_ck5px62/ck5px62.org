I used */FBReader/* for some time but it was missig some feature or the other (I dont quite remember) so I grabbed */Moon+Reader/* when it was free in amazons appstore. It is absolute overkill for just reading but it allows you to do pretty much everything (like opening and searching in my /calibre/ library, finding and opening files in my dropbox when my laptop isn't running, TTS when I'm on the go and bored etc).

In conjunction with using calibre (and the FFDL plugin) and syncing my library to my dropbox I literally never have to go without every fic I ever liked at my fingertips. And when I find a new fic or get a update email I just chuck it into my */Pocket/*, that way I can easily add it to my library later and can read it immediately outside of the crappy mobile websites if I so choose.
