Thanks for that text.

I am indeed a European muggle (English, living in Scotland) so many of history lessons and school trips featured around our dirty ways. People were living in squalor and slums as recently as WW2. It wasn't until post-war that people started to question it.

Dumbledore, for example, was born only 6 years after London's sewers were completed.
