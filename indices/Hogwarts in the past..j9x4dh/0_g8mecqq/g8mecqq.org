During the Middle Age, most European Muggles rarely bathed because it was considered a sin. Then when the Black Death struck, the Jews fared a lot better because of their better hygiene, and were thus [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Jews_during_the_Black_Death][blamed and hunted down in various pogroms]]:

  There are many possible reasons why Jews were accused to be the cause for the plague. One reason was because there was a general sense of anti-Semitism in the 14th century.[4] Jews were also isolated in the ghettos, which meant in some places that Jews were less affected.[14][15] Additionally, *there are many Jewish laws that promote cleanliness: a Jew must wash his or her hands before eating bread and after using the bathroom, it was customary for Jews to bathe once a week before the Sabbath, a corpse must be washed before burial*, and so on.[5]
