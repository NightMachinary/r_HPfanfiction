Basically, /that/ is the original point of religion: giving the believers some sort of guideline on how to live safely. Circumcision of boys, not eating pork and being near dogs, not mixing cutlery for meat and milk... thousands of years ago nobody knew of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other pathogens but sure enough those who stuck to the religion managed to survive. Not to mention that the Old Testament and the Holy Quran carry a decent load of military/war stuff.

Wizards on the other hand? They need not obey any of that...
