I like it, but with all good plot bunnies it needs an outline. I also have some questions.

When were the Potters killed? When does the story end? Does Dumbledore start to feed Tom's ego at the first meeting, end of xth year, when? How does Tom teach in a way that doesn't reveal his frustrations with society/politics?

Also as a side note, Bellatrix was married to a Lestrange in the series (I forget which one).
