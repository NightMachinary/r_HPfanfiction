Definitely plausible and maybe make it so without Voldemort they don't do things so stupidly. We see that the public are fickle and easy to lie to in the stories so maybe intelligent purebloods put muggle borns down a bit and engineer a situation where muggleborns are caught being essentially death eaters or sabotaging the ministry/ or attempting to breach the statute of secrecy. Basically making sure that the muggle borns aren't seen as oppressed simply for their births. This allows for more reception to laws taking away some rights. Obviously nothing huge because people would be angry about it but small steps. It always irritated me in canon that we see that many death eaters are well respected highly regarded people and Voldemort became a terrorist.
