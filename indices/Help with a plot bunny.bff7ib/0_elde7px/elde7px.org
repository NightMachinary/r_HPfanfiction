This could be interesting, but I'm very skeptical of the idea that blood-purists could seriously have a shot at taking over Britain without Lord Voldemort to guide them. If you removed Dumbledore from the equation (and why not? perhaps Riddle's different path has a butterfly effect and Dumbledore dies in the process of defeating Grindelwald, or something), then... maybe. But realistically, Dumbledore would curbstomp through anything Death-Eater-shaped if the Dark Lord wasn't there to keep him at bay.

And that's if the Aurors aren't enough to take care of it; their whole point is that they are highly-trained Dark Wizard hunters, after all, and they did canonically manage to subdue all the Death Eaters as soon as Voldemort was gone, including Bellatrix. That most of the people they'd captured then proceeded to claim the Imperius doesn't change the basic fact that the War would have been over in a month without Voldemort.
