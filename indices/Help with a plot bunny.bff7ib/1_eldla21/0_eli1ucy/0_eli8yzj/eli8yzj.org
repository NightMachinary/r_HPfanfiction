About the Blacks, it's mainly fanon, but there is a theory that no matter the ideology, family was sacred (in the sense that they could not kill each other). Which would explain why the blood traitor Andromeda was never attacked during the war despite being the sister of the most crazy Death Eater and, in a lesser mesure, Sirius.

This theory also say that the curse Bellatrix sent to Sirius in the DoM was not fatale (only movie used Avada Kedavra, from what I remember from OotP, it was "a red curse") and that Sirius only died by falling in the Death Arch.

Of course Canon never explicitly said it (and in a AU story, canon is not that important) and Bellatrix /may/ have killed Tonk during the Battle of Hogwarts (remember somothing about Dolohov killing Remus, but not sure for Tonk) so in this story Sirius can also just go on warpath to avenge his friends (and maybe dying or gravely injured to punish his lack of planing?).
