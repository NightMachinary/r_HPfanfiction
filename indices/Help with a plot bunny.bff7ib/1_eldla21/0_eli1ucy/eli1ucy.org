- I think that Tom Riddle would definitely push Harry in a violent direction. Especially if I go on the route of having Hogwarts being threatened by blood purist ideology, which is something that just occurred to me.

- I can't see Sirius caring about the Blacks who just killed his best friend. I'd need to look more on the matter of the werewolves, but I'd probably have them against the pureblood.

- I also have to look more into what info exists about Andromeda and her reason for not being a blood purist to develop her character. But the idea of Bellatrix cursing her is not uninteresting, to be honest.
