With Voldemort out of the equation, you still need a leader for the Pureblood (at least if you want to go for violent terrorist group), something to nerf Dumbledore would also be appreaciated (as someone said before, him and Voldemort were basically countering each other).\\
Then some questions :\\
- What do you make of Riddle in this story : someone completely disinterested of the whole affair or does he give some kind of support to Harry? Like talking to him from time to time (maybe even pushing him to form a group and be violent when he is still emotionally hurt by the Death of his parents) and teaching him some curse.\\
- The Marrauders : Sirius would probably be in the full "Blood traitor category" but maybe some tensions because the Potter were killed by his "family" and even if he want justice, he doesn't want to kill them? Do you try to put the Werewolves with Blood Purist, with the blood traitors (because blood purist treat them as beast) or neutral? Is Lupin part of Harry life since his parents had lived? And Pettigrew, he betrayed the Potter because he feared for his life, but in this scenario there is no Voldemort to frighten him and even if he does end up a traitor, it would be way later when he had already played a part in Harry's life.\\
- Andromeda Black : if you make her a blood purist, how? Ted was killed by a muggle or a muggleborn and she is out for vengeance? Cursed by Bellatrix to change her mind or full OOC?

Still an interesting idea, the kind I would read as long as it's not Harry/ Hermione (I'm at a point I loathe this pairing).
