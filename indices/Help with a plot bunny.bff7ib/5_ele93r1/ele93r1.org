I think that placating Riddle would need to start earlier than his application for the defense position. Without Riddle to lead I think it would be a long political war with the pureblood gaining steadily thanks to bribery and corruption. I don't think purebloods would attack the muggleborns. I think they would use the laws as their weapons. I think violence would come from the oppressed(muggleborn/halfbreeds/...) or from muggle baiting gone wrong. I think Tom would help Harry's cause indirectly as a way to get revenge by proxy and not risk himself.
