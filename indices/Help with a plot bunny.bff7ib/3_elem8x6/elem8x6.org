A thing that bothers me is that with people like Umbridge in positions of power in a supposedly "moderate" government, why did they death eaters think they needed a terrorist rebellion? If anything, being seen as violent thugs set their cause back and enough of the wizarding world basically already agreed with them that they could have gotten their way by 1991 by just playing the game, maybe with a few discreet, targeted assassinations. Maybe James Potter could be one of those? Maybe there's still a prophecy that Harry will lead the muggleborns to power and the secret violent wing of the right-wing wizards gets wind of it?
