I think it's probably because the author needs some hope too. Writing is a really precious thing, and few people want to abandon their own story outright. Putting indefinite hiatus leaves them room to come back. At least for me, sometimes life gets too rough to write, but I think authors are entitled to be able to pick up their story again when they desire to.
