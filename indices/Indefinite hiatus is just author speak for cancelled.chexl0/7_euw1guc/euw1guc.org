I have a story in a different fandom (NCIS/NCIS:LA/Hawaii 5-0 crossover) that's one part from being finished ... and has been that way for almost five years. Why? Because I changed jobs twice, moved to a new state, switched work schedules about five times, took up running and have had a few family things happen. Do I still intend to finish it? Yes. Do I know when that will be? Nope. Every time I start digging into it again, life throws me a curveball and it's six months before I even have time to think about it again. It's not dead, but it's definitely on indefinite hiatus.
