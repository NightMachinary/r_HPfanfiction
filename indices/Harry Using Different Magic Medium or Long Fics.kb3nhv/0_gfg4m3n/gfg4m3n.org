FlameThrower and their stories on Ao3.

Of a Linear Circle is a monster story (11 books and counting) but it has elemental magicians, magical masteries, secret organisations, family forrest's, fucking everything. Harry becomes a master in blood magic and metamorphmagi and there's masteries in potions and just jesus christ there's so much amazing amazing plot and magic and history and eugh it's completely incredible.

Swung by Serafim has Harry being brilliant at Potions too.
