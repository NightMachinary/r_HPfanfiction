No. There are 750,000+ HP fanfics solely on FFN. I'm more worried about the archive sites with older and unique stories shutting down, resulting in the loss of those stories forever.

HPFF reddit has 11,090 subscribers as of the time of this post, and dozens of new topics are posted every day. I think we are in a good place. Furthermore, many people are at least writing, even if some of that writing isn't of high quality.
