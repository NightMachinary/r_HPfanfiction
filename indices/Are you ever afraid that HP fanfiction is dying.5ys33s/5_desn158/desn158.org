Maybe it is, or maybe my interest in the genre is dwindling. The number is increasing, but I'm not so sure about quality. If you discount all the badly written fics, the wierd slash and the over the top tropes, finding decent fics(that have been started in the past 3 years and/or haven't been abandoned yet), you get a rather small number compared to the size of the archive.
