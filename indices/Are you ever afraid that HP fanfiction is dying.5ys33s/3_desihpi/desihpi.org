The ammount of fics is going to be always bigger but I really struggle to read fics I like. Most of them are:

- Bad slash, I have nothing against it except when the author is a 12 years old girl without any idea of how anatomy work.
- (Marie Sue) Hermione (I really hate her and could litteraly watch a wall for one hour than reading any fic staring her. It already eliminate 80% of the fics)
- OP Harry, where Harry can speak 99+ languages at 11, is a master of every little aspect of magic, can humiliate Dumbledore and Voldemort at the same time, etc...
