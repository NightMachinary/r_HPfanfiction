Henry Potter's request goes through and he himself + some Pureblood family lords go to intervene in WW1.

The pureblood family lords completely hide themselves with invisibility cloaks and muggle repelling charms and bide their time for the perfect opening. Henry takes offense to such cowardliness and goes to battle with magic.

As you would expect from 1 wizard fighting a army squadron, Henry dies quickly. The Lords quickly cover up his use of magic, take his body and return home.

Final Result: The Potter Family's patriarch dies, the stupidity of his death is mocked for years and the Wizarding World's conviction to not meddle in the savagery of muggles is reinforced.
