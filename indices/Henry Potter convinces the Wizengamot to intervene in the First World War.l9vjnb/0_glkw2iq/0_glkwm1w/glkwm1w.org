With regards to the mobilisation of the French causing the mobilisation of the central powers that's what I also though. Also imagine the boost to the Russian war effort if they mobilised their wizards, it stands to reason that they would have the largest forces of mages which I imagine may result in a more even eastern front. Regardless of how the war turns out in the end I reckon it will be very bloody (well, more bloody than it already was).
