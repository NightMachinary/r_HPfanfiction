There's Three Slytherin Mauraders, which is long, obviously very pro-Slytherin, and is really rather AU, but I liked it anyway (won't continue because I've had shit luck formatting for spoilers on mobile). linkffn(4923158)

There's also A Different Fate, which is very AU in that Harry suffered some fairly bad developmental delays due to the trauma of the Avada, and it's honestly one of my favorite stories. linkffn(4113087)
