  There's a chance that Dudley was spoiled so much just to spite Harry. Maybe?

Definitely. If nothing else, an equal treatment would force Dudley to behave appropriately with Harry and face the fact that people other than him have worth.

There are more than a few examples in the books where the Dursley specifically set up a disparity of treatment to either spite Harry or make Dudley feel better.
