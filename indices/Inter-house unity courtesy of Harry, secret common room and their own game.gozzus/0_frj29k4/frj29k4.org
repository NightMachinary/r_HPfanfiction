I don't think that this is the story but Motivations by Jeconais has harry join an interhouse club that over time he becomes the head of. They slso have their own common room but I don't think they came up with a new sport.

For some reason if I'm remembering a story I read before I think the story your looking for has Mcgonagall reinstitute a crosshouse position that she gives to harry that has similar responsibilities and capabilities as the headboy position and allows him access to all common rooms. Problem is I'm not coming up with the correct search terms to find the fic.
