One of the best Lily & James fanfics I have read is called Priori Incantatem by fellytone. It has made me laugh, it has hit me right in the feels, and it has made me feel anger towards characters (Peter Pettigrew anyone?) You should go check it out! I highly recommend it. It is a completed story, 64 chapters. The link is right here: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1541401/1/]]

Edit: I had provided the wrong link, sorry!
