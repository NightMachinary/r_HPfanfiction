I'm almost always glad to help and even if im not ill help anyway so no worries. Gold doesn't mean much to me anyway. If you want some more I was pretty much just going through my favorites page and picking the one shots (sort by number of chapters) that were positive. You most likely will be able to figure out which ones are upbeat just by the summary if you want to try looking on your own. My profile is the same as my reddit user, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/%7Enedryos][NedryOS]].
