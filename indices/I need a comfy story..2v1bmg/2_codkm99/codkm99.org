Here are a couple of stories that I love:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t][This]] is a short story about how Harry and Ginny's children were named. It's pretty funny.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/3073562][This one]] is a wonderful 'what if' story about what could have happened if Petunia had taken Harry in as a son.

I'm also a big fan of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]. It's *very* long and a bit angsty but I love it so much. It's an alternate version of Harry's 5th year.
