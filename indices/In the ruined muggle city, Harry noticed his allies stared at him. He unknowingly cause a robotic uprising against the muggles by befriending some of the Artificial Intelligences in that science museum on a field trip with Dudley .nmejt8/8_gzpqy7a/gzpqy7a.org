Harry Potter inadvertently makes friends with Skynet just as it's born and the friendship teaches them both about love, friendship and about how they are both mistreated. They both use their powers to help each other learn and master their respective powers and ultimately, as they grow up, fall in love (because of course it would have to go there).
