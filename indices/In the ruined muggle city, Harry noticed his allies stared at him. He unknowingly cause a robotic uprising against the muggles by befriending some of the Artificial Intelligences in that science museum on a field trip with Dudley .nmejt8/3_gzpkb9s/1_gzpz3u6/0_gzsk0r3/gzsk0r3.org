... I mean, ultimately any law or rule-system is fallible because of the possibilities opened up by different interpretations of each situation and how people choose to apply it in practice when there is no clear answer. Technically dropping a nuke at a city is not the same as killing all of those people if you make it so it will somehow only detonate if someone takes a picture of it and ripping someone's legs off won't kill the person, only the untreated bleeding that comes immediately after... while on the other hand by definition any type of advanced (and useful) enough medical treatment will involve the potential of harm even if it is only a fever in exchange for curing a terminal disease, a similar argument could be made about the possibility of food poisoning to justify locking someone in a room without food or water until they die of thirsty (which is technically a natural death)... to say nothing of how open to interpretation most orders are, even “keep me safe” could be twisted into “lock me up on a room with all my members and tongue ripped off and cauterized so I have no way of deliberately pulling myself in danger.
