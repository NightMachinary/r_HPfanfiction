Stop, you're making Harlan Ellison blush.

I think the trope around the idea of a 'benevolent' AI 'rescuing' humanity from itself, because humans are too violent/destructive/stupid to take care of themselves, is almost as old as the trope of 'man invents robot, robot destroys man because reasons.'

The problem with Asimov's Laws isn't just subversion or perversion by the machines themselves - as hardware and software developed, it became harder to accept the idea that anything could be 'hardwired' into a system. Anything can be reprogrammed or hacked by a human operator and the 'robot revolution' is just as likely to have a human cause.
