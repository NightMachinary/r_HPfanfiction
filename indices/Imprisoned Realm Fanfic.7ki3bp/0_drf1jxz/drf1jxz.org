Depends on which point you left the fic. Yes he seeks guidance in developing an ability he doesn't want and to go home. He also helps his Mirror out... they help each other. I've just finished the second last chapter before my epiloque, he's become more mature than canon Harry, but that's imo.

It's not harem at all. I just added the ships in the disclaimer in case ppl get offended midway through by AU Harry's past flings, crushes, girlfriends etc.
