YES! I fucking /love/ the Hero trilogy. Just thinking about it gives me chills; the Dark Tower was/is one of my favorite series of all time. The way the Hero series was written though, was fucking brilliant. The (de)characterization, the settings, the Ways of Twilight, and the very end... my god. I have to reread this series again, for the fourth time... good thing it's break.
