The number one thing keeping me from crossposting to ffn and AO3 is what a hassle it is to just post and edit chapters there. AO3's automatic formatting can get weird and buggy, and ffn requires going through too many pages just to edit (have to upload a file then manage stories then select which doc...). Posting should be as easy as click the chapter to edit, paste, post.

Tags are great but should be limited, so they're used like they're supposed to be. Same with character selection and genre.

Something interesting might be a review or author note system that can annotate throughout the chapter, kind of like how soundcloud works. It can be toggled on or off of course. I'm not looking for that in particular, but it might set youself apart from other sites.

Oh! and maybe some sort of critique flag, so the author can mark how much feedback they want to receive. I'm always unsure of whether the author really wants critique or is just posting for fun.
