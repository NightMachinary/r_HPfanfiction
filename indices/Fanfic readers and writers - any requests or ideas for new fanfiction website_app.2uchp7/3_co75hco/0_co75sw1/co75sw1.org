Thanks, that thing about posting - completely agree. We've checked FFN posting workflow and that's just a nightmare. So, we've definitely going to make it absolutely as simple as possible without any unnecessary hassle.

Tags - again, completely agree. There will be a limit to how many tags can be added, but it should be enough to allow for good filtering.

Note system - is it something like annotations on medium.com? Check example [[https://medium.com/five-hundred-words/apple-the-oil-company-5b5983aa81e2][here]] at the end of the page where small comment bubbles are. If so, then I can't really say anything specific right now.
