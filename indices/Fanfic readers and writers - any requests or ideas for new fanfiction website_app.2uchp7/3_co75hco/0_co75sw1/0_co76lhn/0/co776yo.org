Thanks for clarification. I'm going to have to talk to the developers and designer about it - how feasable it would be for long texts. Medium has an advantage in the general size of its posts - they don't have that many paragraphs, so text is not overrun by annotations. Anyway, that's a one way to do comment and we certainly consider it throughly.

Comment threads - yes, one of the possible ways to handle conversations. Depends on how conversations usually go.
