Have a good comments section. Take FimFiction.net for example, they have a fantastic comments section that's easy to navigate.

Also, for cataloging and searching crossover. In Fanfiction.net, you can pick from a list of series that are crossedover with the main series you're looking at, and then you can select "See All Crossovers with [Main Series]". My problem with that is that, if I'm organizing by favorites/rating, I can't filter out which crossovers I want/don't want to see.

Like Harry Potter's crossovers on Fanfiction. I go to "See All Crossovers with Harry Potter", sort by favorites, and the majority of the first few pages is a bunch of Naruto crossovers. I don't have a problem with Naruto, but I'm not looking for a HP/Naruto fic. So I think there should be an option of "Toggle [series]" somewhere in the search.
