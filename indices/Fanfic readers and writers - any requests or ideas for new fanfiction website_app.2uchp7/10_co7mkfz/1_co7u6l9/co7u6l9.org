The problem is that authors are generally fucking terrible at tagging their fics well, as demonstrated by AO3's tag system. It's impossible to search effectively because of people adding every tag they can think of. You'll get M/M tags because there was a gay couple mentioned once in chapter 11 and then never seen again.
