Author and story blacklists for readers to use in search results, latest updates, and categorized listings.

I don't want to have to see MrsMcSpammy and company's one hundred and thirteen vapid and poorly written one chapter tumblr fics cluttering the top of the new updates section every damn week. That's half the reason I don't read new stuff on FFN, just ancient things recomend from other people on this sub and elsewhere.

Let me remove those +shitty+ unwanted author's works easily from the search results page with a click or two on their +odious+ unique pen names. Same for stories, too.

#+begin_quote
  /What if Draco was a half-vella dragonborn who went to a non-magical high school in the 1800s with-/
#+end_quote

Nope. Click. Gone, never to be seen again. I don't care if it eventually gets 86 chapters and spontaneously cures cancer in 50% of readers. I don't want to see it. Ever. Again.

I want to be able to put /thousands/ of teenagers' first fanfics on blacklist. Anyone who writes unrepentant spammy garbage should never darken my web browser again, if I so choose.

And checkboxes to not use or /only use/ the blacklists, in case I want to go dumpster diving for some reason.

Oh, and everything as both positive and negative searches, like in AO3. But better, and on any built-in tags and filters. And saved searches that doesn't involve using my bookmarks, which is lame.

As an author and a reader, an erotica section that works and allows you to actually sort and tag sexuality and sex acts correctly.

Allow searches depending on, for example, whether or not one wants to read stories where dick /only/ goes into vagina, or ass, or both, or neither, and which genders everyone's parts belong to, even in multiple pairing fics where some people are queer and others aren't, and the physical and mental are representative of modern approaches to sexuality. AO3's "multiple" is not. Good.

Example searches: M/M and M/F in two separate relationships with no (ahem) overlap; no M/F but at least one person has a dick /of some kind/; F/F/M with everyone identifying as female but having dicks, and two of them are magically created weredicks (perhaps not a single tag). In AO3, all would show up as "multiple".

So better tags and searching options. Maybe a way to note when gender and sex change in canon characters, and exactly how the various bits will fit together in the "story".

Something like:

#+begin_quote
  Tagged: F/M/M (single relationship, threesome), Hermione[sex:female and magically male; gender:dominate male; sexual preference:male sex, male gender submissive], Harry[sex:male; gender:male submissive; sexual preference: any sex, any dominant gender], Draco[sex:veela male, gender:veela male, sexual preference: all]
#+end_quote

You can see what that fic might be, possibly /vividly/, and how it could be hard to search for things like that. But it looks a bit of a mess. So just hide all that behind standard settings for authors to use (or not, if they don't like to). The author can fill in their own character lists as detailed as they want. Readers can likewise search as detailed as they want, without having to know the system inside and out, by using more common generic tags like "M/F" or "Hermione/Draco/Harry". You know, the common ones.

Wait, I can ask for anything here, right? Hell, forget tags, I want freaking PC gaming-style dropdown menus for all selections, /real AAA stuff/- or maybe Diablo 3 equip screen paperdolls for gentalia and toy locations, hit targeting for all acts, and /challenge ratings/ for everyone's sexuality, a-and a fully gamified comments system, and a laser, a /sex laser/, that can carve a /giant/-

Whew. Okay. Got a little carried away there. I'm better now.

--------------

So yeah.

*tl;dr* Blacklists for authors and stories for reader searches and browsing, negative searches on all built-in tags, and separate handling of detailed sexuality tags for erotica in addition to the standard relationship ones would be good. Thanks.
