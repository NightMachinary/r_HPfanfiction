1. I agree that you have to sift through a lot of stories to find something you're interested in. Noted, added in todo list.

2. Yes! We'll have both positivive and negative filtering for any tags and "filter presets".

3. Interesting insight. Never knew there was so many details. It is a good proposal and certainly could help with search, but heavily depends on whether authors would actually spend time and "equip" all the slots for their characters.\\
   Will note for developers to investigate it futher as I'm not really equipped to talk about such intricacies and the way to implement them.

Thank you!
