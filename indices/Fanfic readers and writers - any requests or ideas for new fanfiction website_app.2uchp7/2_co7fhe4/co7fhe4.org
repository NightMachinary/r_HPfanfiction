Give authors a place to make comments about their stories or to their readers outside of the actual story. I know many authors include notes but unless it's pertinent to the story, it shouldn't be in there with it.

It's annoying to read "Sorry I've been slow on updating" or the author's answers to reader's comments at the top or bottom of a webpage. (especially 3 or 4 years after the story is done)

Provide a flagging system for stories that have the following words in their summaries "I suck at summaries" and give the author 2 weeks to change it or have their story deleted (I'm only semi joking)

Maybe differentiate between reader reviews and reader comments. I can live without seeing 477 people comment on how much they love the story but I love a good review.
