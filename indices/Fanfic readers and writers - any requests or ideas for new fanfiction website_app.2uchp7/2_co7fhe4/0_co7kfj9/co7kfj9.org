Thanks.

Agree about author's noted - we have couple of ideas about it. Maybe something like extra fields below/above actual chapter content so that it won't actually be shown in the same place as a text. About comments - since we are going to have comments and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2uchp7/fanfic_readers_and_writers_any_requests_or_ideas/co77ibu][per-story forum]] I believe it shouldn't be the problem.

Flagging - that would likely be part of the general flagging system which we'll be handling later on. I'll note summary thing down.

  Maybe differentiate between reader reviews and reader comments. I can live without seeing 477 people comment on how much they love the story but I love a good review.

Already mentioned, but we consider adding something like a [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2uchp7/fanfic_readers_and_writers_any_requests_or_ideas/co77ibu][per-story forum]] where users can have deep and meaningful conversations on anything story-related. Chapter Comments/annotations are more of a general discussion for the story.

Again, thanks. You have very good points.
