Thank you - very interesting points from both sides and all of it is totally going on todo list.

Reader interaction is one of our main battlegrounds. So far we've been considering:

- reviews (not the most favorite way)
- simple comments with @mentions (like on twitter)
- live comments (same as simple comments, but with live updates)
- inline annotations (mentioned it in the other comment. Good example for annotations [[https://medium.com/five-hundred-words/apple-the-oil-company-5b5983aa81e2][here]])

A bit about comments with mentions - whenever user is mentioned in the comment, he (or she) will get a notification and can reply right within the notification (kind of like here on reddit) or go to the comments page for the chapter and reply there.
