One thing I'll clarify is that the interaction system should facilitate /meaningful/ conversation. The mentions, notifications, Twitter-style @ system that you're nodding towards here doesn't really do that. There might be a lot of noise, but most of it is just that - noise.

Ideally, I'd like to see a system that was geared towards meaningful, fruitful, productive feedback about where a story's going, how it can be improved, what works, what doesn't, the nuts and bolts of the writing itself, etc. Once a story takes off, this kind of discussion takes on a life of its own and snowballs, to the point where the author can step back from taking a lead role in moving the conversation along and be more of a facilitator.
