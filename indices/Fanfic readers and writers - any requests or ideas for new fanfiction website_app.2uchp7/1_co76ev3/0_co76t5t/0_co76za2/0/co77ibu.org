I see. Thanks, you're right - it's good to have interaction.

Off the top of my head:

Besides simple comments each story can server as a forum/hub - people can create topics that are related strictly to that story to discuss anything in there.

Comments are still a good thing to have - quick general discussion. And if readers want to have deep conversations they can go to the story forum and talk amongst themseves in there.
