Things I'd like to see, as a reader:

- A way to track popularity in time, not just overall popularity. Faves / day, not just faves overall, that kind of thing. Some version of "trending."

- A way to interact with other readers of the same story, even if it's an old one. There's so much stuff out there, and not all of it is currently updating. Right now, there are, let's say 5 people who are discovering /A Black Comedy/ for the first time and loving it. There should be some way for them to discover each other and comment on their reading experience, if they want to. Make it more interactive, even for a story that's long finished. Maybe some kind of tag you can set as a reader to notify people what you're currently reading, and then a temporary, flash message system? Something like that.

As a writer:

- A better editing system. If I notice a typo in one of my chapters, I have to make a new Word doc for it, upload it to FF.net, jiggle the formatting once it appears in the doc manager, then go in with a replace chapter command. That's just ungodly annoying. Like someone said below, it should be as easy as editing a Word doc - just go in, make changes, save.

- A better way to interact with readers. The FF.net review system is kind of dry. Forum-style interactions with a back-and-forth dialogue is a better alternative, but there's probably something even more elegant out there.
