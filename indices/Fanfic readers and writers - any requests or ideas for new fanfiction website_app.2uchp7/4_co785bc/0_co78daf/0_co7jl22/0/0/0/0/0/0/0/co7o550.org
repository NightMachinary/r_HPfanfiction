We aren't exactly well funded company - just a group of friends that shares the same goal. I agree that having a lawyer is a good idea, but we will have to prioritize.

Besides that monetization is by no means in our priority list and I doubt it'll even be available at launch. After main development is complete we'll carefully consider available options and at tha point might find a lawyer to help us understand what can be done and what is a 'no-no' thing.

That way we can concentrate on the project at hand instead of some uncertain future.

Thank you for your comment!
