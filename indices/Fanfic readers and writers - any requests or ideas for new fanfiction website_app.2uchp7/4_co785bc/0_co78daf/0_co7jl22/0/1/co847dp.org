That would be a super cool idea. I had this idea a couple years ago, but didn't feel like doing anything with it. What if you had two popular authors do a write off? They could have a pre-written story ready, and as each chapter gets put up, everyone puts money toward their favorite...and at the end, all the money goes toward the winning author's charity. If you need more help, I'd love to join. I know how to get in touch with HPA people and such.
