Others have mentioned it but a good way to discuss fics. Like I love reading reviews but there's no way to interact with people who leave them.

Personally I think a good way would be to set up a review system where you can leave Good Job! and technical nitpicks for the authors benefit and then a seperate discussion bit on each fic. Heck have it work something like this, you have a Thread (Fic Chapter) that people can comment in and then up/downvote and reply to.
