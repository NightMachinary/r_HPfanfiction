Something i really miss is a good search/selection system. Something that allows me to find every fanfic with X characters and without Y characters that is rated T or above with at least 50k words and that has the "Hello" in the title and was published in the last 5 years and is complete would be great. However sometimes you don't really want to have to go through all that to just find a random fic, so maybe have 2 diferent search systems? A simple one that is on by default, and then if you want to go for a more complicated one with way more options?

Also, a way to keep track of which chapters have been read in which fics (color coding would be nice, Green for all read, Orange for New chapters since last read, Purple for unfinished, Red for unread)
