Yup! Whenever I want to quickly browse, I use AO3 instead of FFNet because you can just type in character name and then sort by kudos, which is much easier than any method on FFNet to rule out obviously bad fics. It does artificially favor older fics though, so if there was a way to search recent updates + most likes, and also limit to >10,000 words, that would be ideal.
