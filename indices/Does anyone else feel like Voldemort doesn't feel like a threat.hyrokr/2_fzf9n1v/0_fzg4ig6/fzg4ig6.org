The thing is, half of what Voldemort does is outright copied from the Thrid Reich. Umbridge's committee, the Snatchers who actually kill, Azkaban as concentration camp for a racial minority arbitrarily blamed, the Order playing "BBC Radio for free Europe" and so on. It is neither cartoonish nor very generic.

The narrative however completely ignores those parts in favour of Horcruxes.
