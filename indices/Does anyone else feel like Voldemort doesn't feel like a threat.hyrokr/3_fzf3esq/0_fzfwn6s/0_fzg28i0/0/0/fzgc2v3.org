That perspective is pretty common nowadays. Traditionally, societies judged trangressions on the eye for an eye principle. Nowadays we deal justice through more the idea of "making the victim whole, rehabilitation, safety to society as well.

An idea gaining transaction, but has really always existed is punishment according to identity group. For example. A women being more or less responsible and deserving of punishment for sexual abuse allegations or more or less depending on socioeconomic status or race.

Circling back to Voldemort. You could claim that due to his circumstances that he has the moral culptability of a savage beast.

but Even if this is true, it is still in societies best interest to put him down quickly and humanely to prevent more damage. We can agree that his actions are wrong, and we do not want them to continue. So a punishment may need to be in order to discourage others from taking the same course of actions even if Voldemort does not personally deserve them but for the good of society as a whole.

ergo, Voldemort did nothing wrong because society failed him.

Was that what you were looking for?
