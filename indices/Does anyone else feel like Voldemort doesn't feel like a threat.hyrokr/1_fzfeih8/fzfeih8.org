I think the trouble is a lack of scale, in the second war anyway. Sirius told Harry that in the first war Voldemort had vast armies at his command which would be scary, but second time round it feels like it's just him and a couple of dozen Death Eaters. Even though he wins the recruiting war with the giants, as far as I can recall we don't see them in battle either.
