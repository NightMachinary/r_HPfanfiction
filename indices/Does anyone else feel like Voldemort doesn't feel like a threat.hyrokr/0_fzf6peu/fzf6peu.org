Voldemort was scary when I was a kid. I will never forget how scared I was when I read "Flesh, bone and blood" for the first time, and how exciting it felt to finally have Voldemort back in the story (for real this time). But as I grew older, he became a sort of cartoonish villain? And the fact that the Order was, literally, useless doesn't help to build him up as a real threat.
