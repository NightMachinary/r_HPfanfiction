He falls into a ravine in one and goes to sleep and wakes up at Hogwarts in the other, so he ended up there completely by accident.

In ‘Short and Unique, but not Magical', he's grateful for the hospitality and everything, but quickly gets homesick and desperate to return to Middle Earth. He spends most of his time in the library researching ways to get home and how and why he was there in the first place.

‘The Small, Mysterious Creature at Hogwarts' is only 3 chapters long and for the majority of the fic Bilbo is panicking about going back.
