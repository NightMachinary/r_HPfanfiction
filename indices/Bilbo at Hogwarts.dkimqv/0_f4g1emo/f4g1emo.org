My view of Bilbo is that he's a very intelligent and pleasant person. The kind of person who Dumbledore could go to for discussing non-magical matters. The kind of person whose perspective and insight could turn someone like McGonnagal into a person who actually listens to people. I can't imagine him 'at Hogwarts' like that.

How do these fics characterize him?
