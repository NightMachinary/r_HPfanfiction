I'm sorry, but I have to side with Ron here unless I get more information. Unless the fossils were found on private property or protected land (like reserves, parks, etc), the land's contents don't actually belong to anyone and so, fossils, not belonging to anyone, can be dug up and used however the person or people who dug them up want. What is petrol but liquid fossils used to make money by powering cars among other things?
