I want to write a legal dissertation on how on Earth magical British law works, at some point, because it's all just a big mess.

You can claim mind control and don't need to provide evidence (Lucius Malfoy) Minor child discipline matters require the entire House of Lords (Harry's underage magic trial) There's very little separation of powers (everything dumbledore does) There are no privacy laws (Moodys eye, Rita Skeeter) or just laws about the press in general (Rita Skeeter)

How does citizenship work? If they're British citizens, why is Azkaban legal? If they aren't, why do they have to inform the British PM of everything? (I have so many questions about why the PM. He's busy with his own country - why can't you talk to the ministers?)

It's a rabbit hole.
