I think the whole Lord thing is more like a bunch of magical clans, and the queen/king and prime minister don't have any control over the magical world, only the right to be informed as they have basically the same territories, and some of their citizens become magical citizens. Since the queen has no control, families can gain lordships, but I think it is based on influence, power, wealth, age, "purity", etc, and the other existing Clans vote on it, and sometimes a Wizengamot seat comes from it
