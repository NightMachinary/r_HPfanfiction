Totally, even more so because we see it from the perspective of teenagers who doesn't really try going through the legal channels of his own initiative, meaning that things like Rita Skeeter and his trial could easily be or not simply illegal and we would have no clue. We are never actually given an explanation for most of Dumbledore's titles and jobs, so he could be anything from the power behind the throne of magical Britain to the tired and exasperated babysitter whose jobs is only to keep the adults responsible for the running of the country from diving the nation headfirst into a volcano or kill each other over cauldron bottom thickness. And to say nothing of the fact that historically on England the authority, land and power of the lords comes from the crown, so either there is no House of Lords /at all/ in the wizarding world, they are somehow beholden to the Queen despite having their own nation which is by all appearances independent from muggle Britain or there is some kind of wizarding royalty we are just never told about.

And the whole thing with the PM is really confusing, neither Scrimgron nor Fudge seemed to be under the PM's authority in any way, shape or form, in fact the whole meetings are reminiscent more of a diplomatic encounter between heads of state rather than anything else, but they were still having the PM take a guard they choose for him /and/ keeping him somewhat abreast of the way the war is going. My best guess is that there is /some/ cooperation between the government to get information about magical criminals hiding in the muggle world and trying to keep crazies from using the imperius on the higher-ups of the muggle government to start a nuclear war or something of the sort, but this is more of a head-cannon than anything actually said about the situation through any means (also have on about there being a curse on the PM's position like the one for DADA teacher to make them keep to the Statute, only way I can think of to explain why /none/ of the many people who held the office decided to blow the Statute wide-open, even if there was a rational explanation the simple fact is that not everyone that got elected was rational).
