I wish. There are a few PC apps that can download one fic at a time, but that's about it. FF even happily blocks web services that offer to download fics for people. So anyone trying to make an archive like that would get banhammered so fast it'd make their head spin. FF wants you to look at the ads; that's why they refuse to even include download options on individual stories, despite the fact that almost every other archive offers this, and people have been asking for years. Sorry, do I sound bitter? Well, it's because I am.
