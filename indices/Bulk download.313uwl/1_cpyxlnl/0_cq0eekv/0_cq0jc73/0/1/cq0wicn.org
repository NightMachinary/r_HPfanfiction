You'd have to limit each IP to something hardcore, like 1 chapter a minute, so as not to catch the notice of FF administrators, so at that point, even with several thousand addresses the functionality of the site shouldn't be affected. If only FF would let you download stories themselves, this wouldn't even be a discussion. But no, they'd rather hold communities hostage for ad money.
