Depends, if you had access to say 256 IP addresses and made 10 requests an hour each, that would be entirely reasonable. You could probably make that 100 requests an hour with no issue. They certainly wouldn't have the limit lower than that, if a user decided to read a bunch of one-shots in an hour they could hit that.
