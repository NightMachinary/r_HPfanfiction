Yeah, but they'll ban any IP that makes X number of requests consecutively over Y days. And X and Y are highly variable; I think they just have thresholds and then a human comes and takes a look at your traffic. So making a spider and limiting it to X requests per second isn't going to help. I guess if you have a large pool of IP addresses, you could probably mirror the entire site eventually, but that's likely to be beyond OPs resources.
