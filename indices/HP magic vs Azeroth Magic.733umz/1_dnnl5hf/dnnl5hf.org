Azeroth does have conjuration and transfiguration--Mages can conjure food and drink and turn you into a sheep or a pig. Warlocks can conjure soul stones. Priest Healing, depending on if you're Holy or Disc, will either have some instants (Holy) or be mostly cast-time based (Disc). I recall Shaman healing being heavy on the cast times and Druid healing being chock-full of instants. One thing Azeroth has that HP doesn't seem to is the concept of cool downs on spells.

I played for 10 years and got a little statue, but I haven't played in a really long time and it's probably all different now.

I would imagine a Disc priest's Shield would counter an Avada Kedavra--I know it's saved my ass from many a one-shot! :D
