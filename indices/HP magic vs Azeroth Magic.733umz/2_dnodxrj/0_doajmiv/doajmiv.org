Hm...if you go by that then any soul-destroying warlock spell should mean instant death as well, but they don't (maybe all that magic infusing Azeroth gives beings there a little resistance? So maybe the AK is damned dangerous for them, but not a one-shot?

And it can probably blocked by shields - not only the ones mages/priests/paladins cast, but also by physical ones and maybe even by full body-armor (if the spell doesn't actually hit the body, then it can't affect you...hell, I sometimes ask myself why nobody in HP has tried that, because physical objects seem to help with the AK, so why not a knight's armor or even something like the Iron Man Armor...hell, even Police Riot Gear should at least be able to take one hit...even more if you count those ballistic shields!)
