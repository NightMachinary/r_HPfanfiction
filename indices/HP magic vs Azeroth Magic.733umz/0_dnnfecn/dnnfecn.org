If you go by game logic, then the average hero is a literally immortal time-traveling, universe-hopping, nameless godslayer.

In the normal lore, the universes would probably be evenly matched at the lowest levels. Past that, it's kind of hard to see HP universe having any sort of effect once you start reaching power levels like the Lich King, Elemental Lords, Old Gods, and planets being literal incubation chambers for celestial beings.

As for comparing solely by magic, transfiguration is mostly limited to animation and shapeshifting (e.g. elementals and druids, respectively). Conjuration exists as well, and is presumably less limited than the HPverse, as mages are able to conjure food.
