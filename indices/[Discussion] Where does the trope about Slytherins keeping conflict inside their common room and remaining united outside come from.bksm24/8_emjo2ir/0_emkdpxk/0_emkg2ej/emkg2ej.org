Well, why can't they say so in public? Especially in the early years, when Dumbledore is still the most respected wizard in Britain? "House unity" vs. angering the most powerful wizard in Britain?

Why can't they say anything in private? Especially when Draco's using slurs like "mudblood"?

If you want good Slytherins, you're better off not trying to preserve canon. Make them known, make them stand up, oppose Draco publically - from Harry's first year on.

Don't introduce Daphne Greengrass and her friends as the totally good, not evil Slytherins who simply couldn't say anything until 5th year, when Harry Potter discovers the truth about pureblood culture.
