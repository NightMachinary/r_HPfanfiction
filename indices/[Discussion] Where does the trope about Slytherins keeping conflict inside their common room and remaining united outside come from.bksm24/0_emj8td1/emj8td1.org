Well, I'll admit for my own fiction, I realize that the fact that no Slytherins turn Draco into a smear on the ground or disagree with him... EVER, means either they all are as sycophantic as Crabbe and Goyle... or there's another reason. I simply surmise the reason is conflict stays within Slytherin.

Now granted, it pretty much goes to JKR wanting all Slytherin's to be stereo-typically antagonistic, and there are practically no character development angles for anyone outside the core three, Dumbledore and a little on a handful of others. Certainly no one in Slytherin beyond Draco and Narcissa. And I can't entirely blame her for that, given that she could have spun off books and books if she gave development to all the characters that deserved it. Especially since the only female character she developed was Hermione. /endminirant.
