People might be taking the Sorting Hat's promise of "you'll make your real friends" in Slytherin a little too literally. I also think the fact that Slytherin has a strained relationship with all the other Houses could play a role:

  “Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little change of decoration.” (PS, Chapter 17)

If Slytherins feel that the rest of the school is against them, then I don't think it's much of a stretch to assume they'd react by uniting internally - having a common enemy is very good at bringing people together.
