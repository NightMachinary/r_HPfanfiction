It could also be because at the time Slytherin had been winning the cup for 7(?) years in a row. Meaning that every student at Hogwarts at the time never saw a different house win. Teenagers being teenagers, loads of Slytherins were probably being smug about it. Honestly I can see why the other houses would celebrate.

I always saw the Slytherin vs other houses as following. We see the events from Harry's perspective. He moslty interacts with Draco and Friends. (No redeming factors here) Also he is part of Gryffindor house AND a star member of Gryffindor Quidditch team. With the Gryffindor/Slytherin rivalry being what it is, it makes sence that he would not have positive interactions with Slytherins.

However we never see what is going on outside of what Harry does. We know there are different clubs going on, like gobstones. It is very unlikely that not a single member of Slytherin would take part in any club. There they would meet students from other houses.

I can see a Ravenclaw becomming friends with a Slytherin at debate club or a Hufflepuff bonding with a Slytherin during a match of gobstones.
