It's a fanon thing born partly from the fact that absolutely nobody oppose Draco when he is a jerk in canon, though, considering the fact that Harry never talk to any Slytherin except Malfoy, people may talk to Draco while he doesn't know about it, at first anyways. And starting year 5 it's easy, you have the Chosen One that says that the Dark Lord is back, pretty much at the same time you have entitled little shit son of a supposed "Imperius Victim" who become even more smug at the same time than other children of "victims". Either you are with this guy or you make sure to not cross this guy.

Also, I can totally see Snape ordering his Slytherins to either deal their problem between themselves or to get to him so he can make sure they do not loose points, just for the House Cup.
