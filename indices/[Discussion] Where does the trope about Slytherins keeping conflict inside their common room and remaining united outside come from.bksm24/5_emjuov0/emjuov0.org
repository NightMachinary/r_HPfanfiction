I think it started as fanon, but when I did the original pottermore house sorting I was put into Slytherin and that was one of the things that you were told as your introduction to Slytherin on the site (I think by Snape? idk it's been a while). I was surprised because I had been wondering where it had come from too and figured it was one of those fandom head-cannons that just caught on but I guess as one point it was technically canon? Or still is? idk man, it's just one of those things people don't really think about anymore
