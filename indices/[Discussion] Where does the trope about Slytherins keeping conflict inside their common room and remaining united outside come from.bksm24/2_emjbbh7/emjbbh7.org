I abandoned a WIP many moons ago, where it was less keeping the conflict internal and more keeping it hidden entirely, even within the House. Cunning little bastards gotta keep their potential scandals under wraps to pursue their ambitions. Trouble was that 11-year-olds are not realistically good at it. As a writer I couldn't come up with something authentic enough.

Maybe I should revisit that little murder-mystery plot bunny...
