I /think/, given how they are nearly the winners of the house cup almost every year, they choose to settle arguments between themselves rather than have a teacher find out, deduct points, and keep the whole house from that shared glory.

Kids tend to band together and try to sort things out for themselves before involving an adult. The whole "don't tell mom and everything will be okay?" I think that's Slytherin's thing, with a little "we got ourselves into this, we can get ourselves out of it". Whereas with the other houses, Gryffindor would be the house that's too wrapped up in its own destruction to hide their tracks, Hufflepuff would sensibly know when the right time for an adult to step in, and Ravenclaw would /kindly/ turn on each other with a "we need adult guidance, how else would we learn?"
