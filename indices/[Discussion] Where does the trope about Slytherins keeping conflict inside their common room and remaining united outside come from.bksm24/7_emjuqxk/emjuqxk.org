Probably because we never see them fighting and because the other Professors aren't kind to them (Snape my favour them, but McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout, Vector etc. do NOT), not to mention that the other students generally don't like them!

Hell, it would fit Snape to institute such a policy (if there wasn't one already!) because of his experiences being bullied (without the teachers stepping in!) by James Potter and the other Marauders - note: It's just funny that Snape did never realise that he kind of turned into (a young) James Potter!
