Agreed, he's my favorite character and I hate to see fanon butcher him. I love him in canon for his complicated, contrarian personality - cruel, arrogant and callous yet a thoughtful and supportive father figure - and it's sad to see all these layers gone in fics with an otherwise interesting premise.

I really loved his portrayals in this universe linkao3(11914698)

Also in this linkao3(13281801)

He's not a POV character in this IIRC but I also liked him here linkao3(5986366)
