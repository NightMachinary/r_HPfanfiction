  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus...Regulus is alive.No-one is more surprised than him.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.
