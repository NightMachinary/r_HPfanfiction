I feel it can very much depend on the circumstances. What little we see of Sirius in canon is a) when he has spent nearly a year on the run after a decade of wrongful existential torture and is nearly revenging himself on his betrayer and b) a year later for a month or so when he is in a house with high implied childhood trauma and faced with the war restarting. These are not kind moments to him.

Often in fanfics, firstly there are many where he never goes to Azkaban, secondly, especially if he is official found innocent, he gets medical and mental treatment for his imprisonment. I feel in both these cases it is legitimate to portray him differently. Also, in many fics he is either taking a more active role in supporting Harry, so actively tries to hide the dark parts of himself, or someone else takes that role (normally the family of ship) and he has decided to be the dedicated clown, at least partly to help himself.

As for the flashback, that is a single, out of context incident from the perspective of Snape, and Incel so bitter that he was happy to let Pettigrew, Lily's true betrayer, go free so that he could get Sirius and possibly Remus murdered.
