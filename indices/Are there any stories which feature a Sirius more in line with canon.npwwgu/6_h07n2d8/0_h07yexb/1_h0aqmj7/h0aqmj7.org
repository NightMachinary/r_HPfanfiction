I wouldn't say there's any Dumbledore bashing in the linkffn(Innocent) series. Sirius escapes from Azkaban five years early and retrieves Harry from the Dursleys, so initially he's at odds with Dumbledore and everyone else just because everyone believes he's insane and kidnapped Harry to hand him over to Voldemort. But there's no special Dumbledore enmity beyond that. I really like how Sirius is flawed but trying his best for James' son.
