To be honest even if he never went to Azkaban I find it difficult to imagine he'd end up like his fanfic self. But yeah I completely take your point that he'd obviously be a very different person.

I wouldn't mind a story where Sirius tries to take care of Harry but unfortunately it always puts him at odds with Dumbledore who is inevitably portrayed as criminally negligent / stupid which is something I hate.
