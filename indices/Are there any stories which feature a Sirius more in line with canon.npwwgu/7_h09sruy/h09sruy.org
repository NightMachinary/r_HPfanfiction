This is a bit out of what you're looking for, but it's a pretty unique take on Sirius. He's quite a bit darker than he usually is in fanon, and definintely ruthless (but not grim-dark-unrealistically violent). It takes place directly after third year, but in this universe he doesn't go to the tropics for some recovery time, but plunges head long into searching for Peter/revenge. I thought it was a pretty realistic and nuanced portrayal of how his (lack of) recovery from Azkaban could go, and a darker side of him as a guardian.

Hermione is the main character here btw, in case that's not something you're into.
