  I'd also be interested in finding out how this portrayal of Sirius became widespread, I guess just because people associate him with the Marauders? Even in the school flashback his personality doesn't match up to his fanon one.

You've actually answered this in a way already. Basically, I've seen many fics (even from way back in the day) turn Sirius into Fred/George 2.0., irrespective of whether or not he's been exonerated. I'm not sure where, exactly, this portrayal came from, but it goes right back to some of the earliest fics that tried to explore the what-if scenario of Sirius being a free man.

I think part of it stems from the difficulty of getting Sirius spot-on (and finding a purpose for him in the plot once he's been freed). He's a complex, multi-layered character, in that he:

- Can't help but feel the urge to get up to his old antics/adventures again, hence the scolding he gets from Molly at the table in book five (in that he sees Harry as James/a pal at times).

- Is a bit immature, yes, but also surprisingly mature as well.

- Still bears his old grudges, particularly against Snape.

- Hates sitting around doing nothing, and sometimes 'lives through' Harry and the younger generation (which Hermione mentions in book five).

- Cares deeply about Harry, and sulks when being separated from his godson for extended periods of time. (He locked himself up with Buckbeak when Harry was about to return to Hogwarts in book five, which Hermione said was unfair as it was almost guilt-tripping Harry into staying at Grimmauld Place.)

- Resents Crouch Sr for not giving him (Sirius) a trial, even though Sirius, himself, didn't make it easy by laughing and saying that he killed the Potters back then.

- Hates his mother, scoffs at the memory of his 'stupid' brother, and basically hates his whole family except for Uncle Alphard, Andromeda, Nymphadora, etc.

- Hates Bellatrix and isn't proud of being related to her, yes, and yet he fools around and taunts her during their duel. It's almost as if Sirius was enjoying his little skirmish with his evil cousin, rather than going all out and trying to kill her (funnily enough, I don't think either of them actually threw any fatal spells at each other, in the short time that we see them duel). And yet, Sirius was perfectly willing to murder Peter in book three.

That's just some of the layers to Sirius's character. No offence to other writers out there, but it's all too easy for the average fic to struggle with Sirius's characterisation, especially by focusing mainly on his 'Marauder' side (which is often overdone in fanon). Thus we end up with:

- Silly, prankster Sirius.

- Nickname-calling, i.e., 'Pup', as the author tries to show Sirius's caring side.

- That clich√©d moment when the Weasley twins go "We are not worthy!" upon discovering that Sirius is Padfoot, with Sirius then doubling down on his prankster ways even more.

- Sirius trying to set up a new generation of Marauders.

In other words, it's a long-standing trend to simplify things by focusing on Sirius having been part of the Marauders. Too bad that's probably one of the least interesting parts of his personality by the time he breaks free from the Dementors.
