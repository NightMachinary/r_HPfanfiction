I feel like the immaturity you mentioned can easily be extrapolated from canon by authors. Considering he got out of school, spent 3 years in a war and a further 12 in a prison, I think it's safe to say that he hasn't had the experiences that lead to maturity. Although it could be argued that war brings maturity and I can understand that, I think there's a difference between war/trauma maturity and actual ‘I can live as an independent healthy adult' maturity.

So considering that, I reckon authors tend to think of him as ‘stuck' in his school personality, in which he was mainly described as a prankster. He didn't have a chance to grow out of it.
