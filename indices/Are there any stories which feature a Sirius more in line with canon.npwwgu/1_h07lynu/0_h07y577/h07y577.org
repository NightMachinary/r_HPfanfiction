Very good analysis! I completely agree Sirius is surprisingly complex when you dig a little deeper and he's probably my favourite character in the entire series. I absolutely hate any fic that uses variations of "Pup" or "Pronglet" it just makes me cringe on a deep level. The real shame is the point you made here :

  Too bad that's probably one of the least interesting parts of his personality by the time he breaks free from the Dementors.

It's sad to see such a character with such potential reduced down to a single character trait.
