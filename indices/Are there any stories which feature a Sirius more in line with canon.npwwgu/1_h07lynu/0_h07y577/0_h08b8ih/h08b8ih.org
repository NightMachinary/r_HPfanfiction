You have also got to understand that many of the writers of fanfiction are amateur writers who maybe themselves don't understand human nature all that much other than what they witness from day to day. Writing a proper Sirius is just as difficult as writing a young Dumbledore because I assume most of us have not been or have not met a child prodigy or a young Tom Riddle who is a charming sociopath because even if we came across one, their power lies exactly in the ability to appear normal and likable.
