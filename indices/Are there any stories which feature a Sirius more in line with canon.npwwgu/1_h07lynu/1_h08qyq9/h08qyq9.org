  In other words, it's a long-standing trend to simplify things by focusing on Sirius having been part of the Marauders. Too bad that's probably one of the least interesting parts of his personality by the time he breaks free from the Dementors.

I think even during schooltime he wasn't only the silly prankster everyone pictures. He came from an abusive household (at least verbally abusive if you consider Walburga and Kreacher), he was raised by people who thought that most of the wizarding world are not worthy to live and his only supportsystem were his friends and an estranged uncle (estranged is a guess, but he would have gone to him and not the Potters if they were close)

We also see him very ruthless (in telling Snape to face a nearly grown werewolf), a little bit sadistic (he is bored so James starts bullying Snape to cheer him up) and also very reckless - running with a werewolf at fullmoon and risking other people trough it.

I know that the marauders are often pictured as the forerunners of the Weasley twins, but I don't think that's accurate. The marauders were much darker with Sirius and his disfunctional family, Remus and his "furry little problem" and Peter constantly being overshadowed by his much more talented friends (and being made fun of, even if I think most fanfics blow that part out of proportion).
