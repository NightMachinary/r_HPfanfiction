A Half-Blood who was pretty much hidden away from the wizarding world and raised as a Muggle ends up becoming a family friend of the Weasleys when she's hired by Arthur to fix his car. During this time, she's accidentally exposed to magic in a way that indicates she's a witch, and the story follows her attempts to catch up and integrate into wizarding society with the perspective of a person who grew up as a Muggle.
