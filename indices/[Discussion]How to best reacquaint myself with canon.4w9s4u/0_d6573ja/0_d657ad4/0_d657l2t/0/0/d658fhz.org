I would focus on "an /adult/ who grew up as a muggle" - otherwise it's rather close to the canon series since Harry was raised a muggle.

Also, you need to decide how wizarding society looks to an adult muggle, instead of an impressionable young kid who wants to leave his relatives. Not a lot of that has been defined in canon.

Is it a democracy? Is the Wizengamot elected, or are the members chosen like those of the House of Lords? If there is a democracy, is there "one man one vote", or are votes weighed, or is there a minimum income or land ownership you need to be allowed to vote? Or some minimum proficiency in magic? Or some "Magic culture" tests? What's the stance on human rights? (In canon, the use of dementors pretty much proves that they don't care about the prohibition of torture.) How does the economy work? What kind of jobs are there in the magical world? How do people live and pay rent if they work in the muggle world and have a magical house? What about culture?

It's rather hard to decide if your character actually wants to integrate in a society much less how if those fundamental questions are not covered. And canon doesn't help there at all.
