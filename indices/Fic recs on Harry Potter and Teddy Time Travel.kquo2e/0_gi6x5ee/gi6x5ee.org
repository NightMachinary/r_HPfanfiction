If it is Harry and Teddy time traveling you can try The Disorder of the Phoenix by JacobApples (aka AppoApples) though the story linked is a rewrite. It seems he deleted his previous version. In this story Harry, Teddy,band Andromeda are brought back in time from 7 years after the war to Harry's 5th year.
