You have to read into the Arena. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270/chapters/10164680]])

It breaks me. Absolutely breaks me. Teddy is completely adorable I love him with my whole heart. He wears the goggles and has a bag and oh my God I love him. It's funny and cute and you'll bawl your eyes out at the Grimmauld place chapter.

It's decently long. Very very well written. Somewhat unfinished but it rounds itself off ok enough. But please. Please read it!! It's so good!! And Teddy is so so good I just, oh he's amazing. it's worth it just for Teddy
