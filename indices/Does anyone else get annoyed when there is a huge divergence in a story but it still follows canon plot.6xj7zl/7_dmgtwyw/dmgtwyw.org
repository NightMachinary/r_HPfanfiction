When something ends up being the same after a big difference, you have to ask a couple of questions: how much impact on events did the big difference have, and which events are too solidly set in stone to be affected by anything?

Take a Slytherin Hermione story for example (I've only read a couple of them, so this is an example only); even if Harry and Ron don't become friends with Hermione because of house separation, Harry and Ron at least would have ended up in the 3rd Floor Corridor contraption (in some stories it's Neville that goes with them, sometimes it's somebody else). In most stories, what's to actually stop the basilisk from being released? So the question becomes what the big difference is and how it should logically affect the RESPONSE to the Basilisk release. In Applied Anthropology, it's Hermione who gets ahold of Riddle's Diary, who then gives it to Neville, and Neville becomes the "heir of Slytherin" instead of Ginny. But it was still logical for Harry to end up down there in the Chamber of Secrets, but it was also logical for Hermione to be there with him instead of Ron. Sometimes people change things wildly because they're not interested in being even semi cannon compliant, other times things include certain events because they are looking for it to semi follow cannon. There can be lots of reasons things do or don't stay the same.

However, sometimes things following along just so with very few differences when there should be is just lazy writing, but I've always found those times easy to spot with a little writing analysis.
