It Doesn't really bother me just it bores me most of the time. I understand that somethings are ought to happen because the Harry might not have imput in them. Like a Harry dating Ginny since before the yule ball won't change the tasks. So I allow it in the very first chapters.

But later the butterfies (as the unexpected and usually unpredictable changes in the timeline that are caused by the divergence; as we call them in alternatehistory.com) should make the plans of Voldemort and other people change, so perhaps he wouldn't want to steal the prophecy or might look for the elder wand earlier or something like that.

So, while canon consistency is necessary at the beginning, after some time the story must change and it shouldn't be canon rehearsal
