I disagree with you on that. There are some rather interesting options for year 1. Better yet, they're not mutually exclusive and there's so many ways each can go. (And yet people rehash things anyway...)

| Change                                | Potential Immediate Effect                                                     | Potential Long Term Effect                                                                    |
|---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Harry Time Travels                    | Harry arranges for the stone's safety and/or Quirrel's early exposure/removal. | Threat of Voldemort identified earlier. Subtle canon derailment.                              |
| Harry is Greedy                       | Harry steals the stone for himself.                                            | Shenanagins involving alchemy/the Flamels. Subtle canon derailment.                           |
| Harry is Oblivious                    | Harry goes about his business, but Voldemort gets the stone.                   | Early Voldemort return; total canon derailment.                                               |
| Harry is "Dark"                       | Harry uses the stone or knowledge of it to bait Voldemort into an alliance.    | Total canon derailment.                                                                       |
| Harry is in a Crack!Fic               | Uhhh...                                                                        | Uhh...                                                                                        |
| Harry is in a Porn fic                | The author gets arrested for writing child pornography.                        | N/A                                                                                           |
| Harry is "Secretly" OP. (Edgy option) | Harry defends the stone in more permanent manners.                             | Harry becomes even more OP, Voldemort is out of action for longer/forever                     |
| Harry is openly OP (Lighter option)   | Voldemort is scared off/driven off.                                            | Harry continues to be OP. Death eaters reassess their plans. Canon subtly goes off the rails. |
