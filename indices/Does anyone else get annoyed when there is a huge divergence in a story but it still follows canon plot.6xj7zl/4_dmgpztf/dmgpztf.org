For me, the relevant pet peeve is the Troll Incident. You can completely rewrite Harry's, Ron's, and/or Hermione's upbringings and personalities, Sort them into different Houses or keep them out of Hogwarts at all, but on the appointed date, at the appointed time, in the appointed place, Hermione /will/ have an encounter with a mountain troll, in far too many fanfics.
