Yes. Absolutely. It's the exact kind of thing that people always have characters talk about in time travel fics ('we can't change the past or the future might be different') and yet it's not consistently addressed in fics where something is COMPLETELY different. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't mind canon rehash, but if it's going to stay more or less the same despite significant changes there's gotta be a good goddamn reason.
