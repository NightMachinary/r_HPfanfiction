It depends on how it's done. I don't mind canon rehashes if it's a character-driven story. For eg: The Changeling by Annerb is pretty much a canon rehash but I'm not reading that story for plot, but because it's interesting to see how a Slytherin Ginny might view canonical events differently and as an exploration of her character.

But like you said, if you're writing a plot-driven story and you've gone out of your way to create a major divergence, it doesn't make sense to keep things canon. This is especially true for time-travel. It's extremely annoying to read a time-travel story where the protagonist wants "preserve the time-line" and "not change things too much" etc. What's even the point of going back then? It feels contrived and unoriginal.
