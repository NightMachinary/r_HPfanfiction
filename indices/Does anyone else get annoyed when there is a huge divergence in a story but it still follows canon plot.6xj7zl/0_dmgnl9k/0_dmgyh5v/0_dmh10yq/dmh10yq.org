I think they're pretty much the same thing to be honest, except an example of canon-compliant might be a story of Neville's POV of Year 7. Same events, different perspective but no new additions.

To me a canon rehash is when you introduce a major change in the storyline (slytherin ginny) but that change doesn't influence the overall plot and you still stop at canon stations despite the fact that you might take a different route to get there. Like I said, this works in The Changeling because it's character-driven. Ginny being in Slytherin will mostly affect her but it doesn't have to affect the overall plot. It's about Ginny growing and developing as a character and the effects it has on Slytherin house, but major plot-points like getting with Harry in sixth year, Sirus, Dumbledore, Snape, Remus etc all dying don't change. In that sense it is a canon rehash. It's not a bad thing and some of my favourite fics are rehashes. But when your story is dependent on the plot and you've tried to derail it, like a time-travel story, it doesn't make sense to come back to the canon storyline.
