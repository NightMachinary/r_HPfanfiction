While it is almost entirely canon plot compliant, I never thought of the changeling as a canon rehash. Those are the fics that shove the main character in all the major canon stations with scenes playing out the same way with exact same dialogue with no almost no difference from the books.

One thing I liked about it is that it doesn't get Ginny involved in a lot of important scenes and just mentions them in passing or has her act as an observer. It mostly seems to be about her life and her struggles rather than defeating various Voldemort enemies/challenges. Troll, quirell, etc. scenes are completely skipped over only getting a few sentences of how she heard about Harry doing something. For me, the changeling has always been an example of how to do a fic that follows canon without it being a canon rehash.
