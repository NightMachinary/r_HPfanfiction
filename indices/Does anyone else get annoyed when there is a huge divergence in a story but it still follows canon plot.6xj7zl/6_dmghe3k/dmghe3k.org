It's not that annoying to me, it just gets really old having to read a lot of fics relying on the very same conflicts the Canon posed. We all know by now that Moody is a fake in 4th year, the tasks are no longer a surprise, we've suffered through Dolores and Fudge's persecution already in 5th year. I really love it when the author adds different tasks in the tournament, like in "The Lie I've Lived".

What I don't like is when the author dumps long passages straight from Canon into the fic when they decide events are going to be the same anyway.
