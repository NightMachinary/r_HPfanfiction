Some events are going to be the same regardless. Like in my fic I'm working on, Sirius escapes a year earlier and Dumbledore wants to hire Remus then, because everyone thinks he killed Pettigrew just for kicks, so Dumbledore thinks Remus might be in danger and wants him safe at Hogwarts until Sirius is caught.

So I guess... it makes sense for certain events to trigger other events, even if the timeline has changed.
