I very much agree that certain decisions were made as a consequence of what happened earlier. In the case of hiring Remus, I tend to think that Dumbledore hired him when Sirius escaped because he'd be the best person to defend Harry against him; it wasn't to protect Remus so much as to have Remus protect Harry.

Similarly, the TriWizard Tournament could be a consequence of the growing threat of Riddle's return- more than a publicity stunt, it was a chance for Albus to assess possible allies in Europe as the Dark Lord's return became more likely.
