No, my point is regardless of the prophecy, and since neville was also viable candidate regardless if it's self fufilling one, banking on the date of the world on a single teenager was a dumb plan, hence all things going into it and the end result can be laid at dumbledores feet. You have a group of adult wizards with mixed skill sets available to you in the form of the order if the phoenix, one senior aurora in moody, most likely a few others, snape is a potions master, spy and arguably extremely good a offensive magic. You have the hogwarts staff, a healer, a transfiguration professor, a charms expert and duelist. I'm not saying train harry if it were possible to reach even the same level as a grown wizard in a fraction of the time, let alone be able to face voldemort. But the whole notion of the power of love, and the little clues and the whole horcrux hunt seemed like a stupid plan. I mean if was a worry about leaking info, dumbledore literally had access to a pensive, and could have extracted all the relevant info to show to harry in a few sessions. Instead most of a year was wasted on harry fumbling around with ocolomncy training, and suspecting draco, and trying to get a single memory from slughorn.

  Dumbledore literally gave Harry to his next of kin, which makes sense when his parents, grand parents, and godfather are all dead or in prison. As a plus, he gets what we are told is inbeatable protection from the people who want to kill him. That seems like the most logical choice. Who else would raise him?

Blood protection only extents to direct phisical tough from voldemort, mental intrusion, or magical attacks, though that last one isn't quite clear. It's never stated how far this protection extends from harry, does it cover the entire property of #4, the entire block, is it only his person. So no I don't see the protection being unbeatable, as he clearly can still be heavily injured and killed from outside means, like a falling to his death from a broom jinxed by a voldemort possessed quirll, a basilisk bite, being kissed by dementors. He can also clearly be affected by phisical forces or spell work from others, what was to stop quirll from giving harry a poison, a toxic potion, or just summoning or transfiguring a rock and bashing his head with it in the first book.

And even if they were area based, as is hinted in waiting to his 17th birthday when the order waits for it to expire before they leave #4 it's not like he would spend every minute of every day inside private drive. And although we don't know exactly how two dementors tracked him, it's made clear it was somehow related to umbridge, and if he didn't know the patronous charm his soul would have gotten sucked out.

In essence the entirety of Dumbledore plan as it was constructed was based on so much speculation, improbable circumstances, luck, hope, vague interpretation of a prophecy, and convoluted events it sheer dumb luck and arrogance on voldemort's part that saw him loosing. There a myriad of example in the actual books where voldemort had ample time to try various methods to get harry killed it abducted. Voldemorts need to personally kill harry and his need to know the entire prophecy are what led to his downfall... eventually.

  You say Dumbledore raised Harry to die, and yet he didn't have any idea what Horcruxes even were until at least the end of 2nd year. They're very obscure. It would take time to research what they were, and then even more time to realize Harry's scar was one. If I had to guess, I would say he realized in 5th year, when Harry was getting visions

And yet he knew the entire prophecy since before Harry was born, and the basis of his plan before he knew about the horcruxes was that Harry Potter had to be the one that defeated Voldemort specifically because Voldemort was the one that chose him and marked him as the equal, therefore Harry would have a "power he knew not" and neither couldn't live while the other survives.

The power being harry's capacity to love and rally people behind him. His plan only required harry to die when he realized harry was also a horcrux. Yet this all still hinges on a teenager being the linchpin of an entire plan.

  but guess what he did the very next year? Started teaching Harry, and hunting down the Horcruxes.

I'm sorry if that's your definition of teaching, showing him a few memories every couple of weeks really good teaching. Not only should it have been obvious after the first few lessons about Harry not being good with the mind arts but then when Snape stopped teaching him Snape never told on the door oh yeah I'm not teaching him anymore and everybody just assumes that Harry learned ocolomncy, and rather than inform harry about all his gathered info on the horcruxes, that he was already dying, that he already knew about malfoy, his plan, and the possibility of the elder wandb playing a role. Nope let's keep harry in the dark so he can have a happy child hood and not worry, even though harry at this point already knows he has to defeat voldemort. Good plan.
