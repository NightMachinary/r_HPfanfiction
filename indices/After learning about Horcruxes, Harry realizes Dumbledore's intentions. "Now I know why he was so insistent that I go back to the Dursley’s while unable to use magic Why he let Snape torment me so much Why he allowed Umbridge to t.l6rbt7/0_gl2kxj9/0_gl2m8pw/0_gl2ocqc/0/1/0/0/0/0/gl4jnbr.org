  Why would he be triumphant about Voldemort overcoming Lily's protection? That's a loss.

Probably because he realizes Voldemort's new body can anchor Harry to life in specific circumstances. Or because it's typically a bad idea to use blood sacrifice in such a way - Dumbledore has shown to be disappointed at Voldemort when they've fought and when he broke into the inferi pool to retrieve the faux horcrux. I don't think he had confirmation about Harry's horcrux until the "but in essence divided" thing he does with his instruments by book 5.
