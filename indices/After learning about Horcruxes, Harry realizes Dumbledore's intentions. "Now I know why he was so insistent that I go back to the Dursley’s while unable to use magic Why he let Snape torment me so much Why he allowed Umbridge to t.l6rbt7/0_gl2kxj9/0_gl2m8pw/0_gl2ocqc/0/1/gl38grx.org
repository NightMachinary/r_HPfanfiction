I think you've been reading too much fanfiction bud. Dumbledore literally gave Harry to his next of kin, which makes sense when his parents, grand parents, and godfather are all dead or in prison. As a plus, he gets what we are told is inbeatable protection from the people who want to kill him. That seems like the most logical choice. Who else would raise him? Dumbledore had no idea he would be abused. And while he probably realized when Harry came to Hogwarts that he didn't have a very good childhood, he was alive. So it was worth it.

You say Dumbledore raised Harry to die, and yet he didn't have any idea what Horcruxes even were until at least the end of 2nd year. They're very obscure. It would take time to research what they were, and then even more time to realize Harry's scar was one. If I had to guess, I would say he realized in 5th year, when Harry was getting visions. He couldn't really do much with Umbridge, but guess what he did the very next year? Started teaching Harry, and hunting down the Horcruxes. What was he supposed to do? Harry literally had to die for Voldemort to be defeated. Full stop.

People think Dumbledore is some all knowing dude. He's just a very smart old man. He knew Harry had to defeat Voldemort. But he wanted a Harry to have a childhood. That's a good thing. And really, what was he supposed to do? Start training Harry as soon as he came to Hogwarts? He could barely lift a feather, and you expect him to be learning battle spells? That's crazy.
