Didn't harry complain about umbridged to his head of house and she told him deal with it, keep ur head down and shut up. And on context alone it's clear that snape had a hate boner for Harry, I'm sure the only reason he "protected" Harry was guilt for Lily's death and his fidelity to Dumbledore, who basically holds his leash but prevented him from being tried as death eater. Not only does snape make it clear he hates teaching, but if he's forced to he'd rather teach defense against the dark arts, but he has been continuously denied the position. It's also blatantly clear based on canon comments from dumbledore that A: he knew Harry grew up with a rough and unhappy childhood being mentally abused and treated like a servant, B: was making sure Voldemort would be defeated by Harry letting Voldemort kill kim. C: wanted harry to act his age and have a childhood, hiding things from him as in book 1, 2, 5, and 6, but still made sure he would fufill his "destiny" and even to the end not being sure Harry would survive.

If two things aren't made clear about canon dumbledore is that while he is well meaning, and seeks the defeat of Voldemort, he is willfully manipulative, caring for the end result more for individuals no mater how he claims otherwise, and that he likes holding all the information to his chest, not matter the reason.

A lot of fanfic focuses on these facts, and arguably a better outcome in the war if dumbledore actually trusted more people with essential information, or got actual help rather than relying on a clueless untrained teen and his two friends to save everyone.

Unbreakable oaths and Fidelius exist, so it's not like he couldn't make sure the people he trusted info to didn't betray him, especially knowing the weakness of the Fidelius in hindsight.

Harry has all the reason to bitch and be an angsty moody teen, and by the end of the series I'm surprised he's not more fucked up or traumatized.

What I really hate is the fact he names one of his children on the man that basically made it so he was raised to die (some weird variation of stockholm syndrome, dumbledore edition) because he still thought of the man as a personal hero. And he names his second kid after the man that tormented and mistreated him for years, blatantly hated his relationship to James potter simply because he saw the man's memories and realized snape was working for dumbledore all along, and he always loved his mother. Like that excuses his treatment or his sins somehow, regardless of reasons.
