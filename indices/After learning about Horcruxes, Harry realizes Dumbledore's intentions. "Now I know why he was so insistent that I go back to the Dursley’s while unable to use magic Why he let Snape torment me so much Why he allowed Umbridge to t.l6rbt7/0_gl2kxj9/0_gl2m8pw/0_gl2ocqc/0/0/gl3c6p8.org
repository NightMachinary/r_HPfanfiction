He complained that she didn't teach them Defense. He absolutely refused to complain about the punishments even when Hermione begged him to.

Snape was a dick and a bully to Harry and made no effort to hide it but Harry never went forward either to complain about his behavior in class. I don't know how things have changed, but going to school in the 2000s, some teachers behaved worse than Snape (calling students stupid, humiliating them if they passed notes by reading them publicly and being unfair with the grading) and no one really did anything about it, mostly because nothing would be done about it since it was your word against them... so I guess that's why I'm not too shocked by Snape's behavior. Other than book 1 which was supposed to be a children's book with a mean and ridiculously unfair professor, he only takes points and gives detentions when students step out of line.

With regards to the Dursleys it also needs to be understood that the story was written in a time when child protection laws might have been a little looser. In the 80s it was still quite socially acceptable to smack your kid if they did something bad, but the level of abuse that is presented in fanon is a few notches taken too far from what we see in the books. Sure Harry lived in a cupboard for most of his childhood and was never bought anything and asked to help his aunt around the house, but they put a roof over his head and didn't send him to an orphanage which would likely have been worse. He had no other living relatives so where were he to go? In his world, not only did he have a target on his back but being a child celebrity would have not necessarily turned out well, as real examples show us, even if Sirius were to not go to prison. Leaving Harry with the Dursleys was not out of malice but out of lack of other options.

I'll admit Dumbledore's plan is quite convoluted and the explanations are not really clear but it's stated that Harry had to walk to his death willingly and accepting in order for the sacrificial love spell to work. I believe that Dumbledore's intent as character was not to be a manipulative mastermind but to be the teacher who teaches Harry values such as humility, love, friendship, sacrifice and help him grow as a hero.

Finally, I prefer the Harry in the books because I read the books to read about a hero. If I wanted to read about the life of every whiney self-entitled teenager/young adult, I'd just open any of my social media and read people's posts.
