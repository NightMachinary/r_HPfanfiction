Why Dumbledore didn't have a plan B? Probably because JK didn't think it through, but I'm sure he would have had one if JK would have written herself into that corner. I agree that looking from an in-universe perspective at it, it seemed kind of stupid that Dumbledore didn't anticipate that Hermione and Ron would go with Harry in his quest. But it also made sense why he was so secretive about it. Voldemort had proven that he can break through some of the most powerful memory charms, as well as the Fidelius... so even if there was an Unbreakable Vow, as you have mentioned in your previous comment, what would have prevented him from torturing his victim until they caved in and decided that breaking the vow and dying is better than dealing with the torture? And from the way he reacts when he finds out about the Horcrux Hunt (even if his victims have no clue why he's killing them), it was most certainly the best move to keep as few people as possible in the light.

Also from an in-universe perspective, even if Voldemort was scared of Dumbledore, he is still pretty much on par with him, to the point that it's stated in HBP that the duel from the Ministry left Dumbledore shaken. Furthermore Dumbledore doesn't know a lot of things such as what or where Ravencalw's horcrux is or where the Hufflepuff one is, and he also gets wrong the location of the Slytherin one (although not through a fault of his own). So he uses the best weapons that he has at his disposal: the twin wands, the sacrificial magic and Voldemort's inability to keep his thoughts straight when it comes to hunting down Harry.
