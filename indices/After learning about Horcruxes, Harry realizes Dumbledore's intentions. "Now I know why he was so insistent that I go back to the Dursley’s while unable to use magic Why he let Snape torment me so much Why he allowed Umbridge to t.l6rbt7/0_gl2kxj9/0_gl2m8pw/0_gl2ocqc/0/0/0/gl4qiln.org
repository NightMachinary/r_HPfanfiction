  I'll admit Dumbledore's plan is quite convoluted and the explanations are not really clear but it's stated that Harry had to walk to his death willingly and accepting in order for the sacrificial love spell to work. I believe that Dumbledore's intent as character was not to be a manipulative mastermind but to be the teacher who teaches Harry values such as humility, love, friendship, sacrifice and help him grow as a hero.

But that precisely it, his entire plan hinged on the fact about this power of love thing and the prophecy being fulfilled and etc etc, but there was no specific contingency plan, there were no backups, no one else was informed except Harry who told two friends, who are also teenagers. There were literally so many opportunities and instances where everything the plan relied on would have simply failed had certain things not happened by sure dumb luck or happenstance.

I'm not saying dumbledore is a willfully a manipulative evil type character but you'll have to admit the fact he kept so much information to himself is what led to a lot of the problems especially in the last three books a lot of things could have gone so much more smoothly had he just informed Harry Potter exactly the information he needed to know. the whole concept of relying on the idea of the heroes journey not as a metaphor but as a literal path for Harry to take so he could fulfill the prophecy seems like a big role of the dice and it's not like Harry Potter hadn't already proved himself or that he was not already a hero.
