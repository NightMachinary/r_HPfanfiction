Voldemort didn't do worse, though. All he sent Harry was memories of people being tortured.

Wiki says that Harry eventually learnt how to block the connection with Voldemort by focusing on feelings of love and grief, no Occlumency.

Snape was totally a shit teacher. Seriously, Bellatrix trained Draco's Occlumency in the break between 5th and 6th year, and he became capable of blocking Snape's probes.
