Hermione doesn't have to learn mind arts? All she has to do is point a wand at Harry's head and say 'Legilimens!' like Snape.

Memory magic doesn't seem that difficult to use. Hermione rewrites her parent's memories and sends them off to Australia with the False Memory Charm. I don't think she got much practice with that spell.
