We have very little idea of what's actually involved in Legilimency, except that Snape angrily rejects the analogy of reading a mind like a book. We can also infer that it's difficult enough that vast majority of people, even those, with secrets to keep, don't bother with Occlumency. But, even if we suppose that Hermione can cast the spell, at best that may enable Harry to eventually learn to fight off Legilimency from a beginner like Hermione---not someone even close to Voldemort's calibre.

Like I wrote, I would /love/ to see more fics in which Hermione picks up Legilimency. A fic in which, say, Hermione approaches Snape asking him to teach her so that she could teach Harry would be awesome (particularly if it affects the rest of the story in interesting ways and doesn't end up in a Snape/Hermione 'ship), but we are talking about canon.

Memory Charms and False Memory Charms are spells with a specific purpose and are therefore easier to cast than something flexible like Legilimency. Analogously, Draco could cast Serpensortia---a spell that does exactly one thing---in his second year, but Conjuration in general isn't taught until much, much later, and Draco gives no indication of being a Transfiguration prodigy.
