  Hermione doesn't have to learn mind arts? All she has to do is point a wand at Harry's head and say 'Legilimens!' like Snape.

She is not so intelligent that she knows how to use a spell just by its incantation.

Aside from the outlier of Harry immediately using Sectumpsempra and Levicorpus without knowing what they do, any other instance of learning a spell involves studying about and practicing it.

Legilimency involves navigating the mind. She doesn't know how to do that without studying about it.

The Memory charm, on the other hand, is used to remove a memory or a lot of memories. At least, you will need to know what memory you are removing. At most, you can remove a big chunk of memories that it can cause the target some mental damage (ala Bertha Jorkins).
