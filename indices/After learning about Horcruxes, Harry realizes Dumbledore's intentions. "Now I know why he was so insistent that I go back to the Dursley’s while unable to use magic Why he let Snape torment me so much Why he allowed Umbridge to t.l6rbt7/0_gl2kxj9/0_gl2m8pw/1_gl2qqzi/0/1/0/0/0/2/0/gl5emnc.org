  The Memory charm, on the other hand, is used to remove a memory or a lot of memories. At least, you will need to know what memory you are removing. At most, you can remove a big chunk of memories that it can cause the target some mental damage (ala Bertha Jorkins).

My headcanon is that the Memory Charm has two targeting modes:

1. *Temporal mode* It erases the most recent memories---e.g., the last 5 minutes. This mode is easy to cast, but it becomes exponentially more difficult as the time period erased increases and the memories become more integrated. Trying to erase 5 minutes is easy and reliable, but trying to erase the prior 24 hours may well turn the target into a vegetable. Therefore, it's mainly useful for Obliviating Muggles, as well as the Death Eaters at the Diner. Occlumency does not help.
2. *Legilimency mode* It can be used to erase any memories, but it requires successfully using Legilimency to locate them. Therefore, you can't really Obliviate an Occlumens without them noticing.
