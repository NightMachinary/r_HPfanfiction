Much as I'd love to see more fics in which Hermione gets into the proverbial mind arts from a young age, she does not appear to have had that skill in canon.

I mean, one could kinda-sorta make an argument that Hermione picked up Occlumency at some point. If Bellatrix taught Draco (as Snape speculates), that means that Bellatrix knows Legilimency. However, despite the time pressure, Bellatrix had to resort to torture to interrogate Hermione. Does that mean that Hermione was able to resist the initial Legilimency attempt? (Of course, a much simpler explanation is that Bellatrix's sadism worked against her: she was so eager to hurt the Mudblood that she lost track of her goal.)
