There was one Peggy Sue fic, I can't remember the name. Dudley got blasted back through time--by accident--and was eleven years old again. He got magic through the time travel, and is desperate to make amends with his cousin. He goes straight to Dumbledore about the whole thing, and at one point, I think he beat up Malfoy.
