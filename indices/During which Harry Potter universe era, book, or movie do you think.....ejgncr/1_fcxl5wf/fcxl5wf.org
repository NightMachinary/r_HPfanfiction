That depends: do you mean in universe (i.e. able to change the world but without considering the wider storyline of the HP books) or narratively (i.e. on a meta level it would ruin the story being told by the seven books and all its themes and arcs)? Considering how broad your categorization for an OC is too, thats really tough to answer on both parts because most OCs in such a case are usually SI as well, which invariably affect (and dare I say ruin) most fanfics.

In theory, the more meta/narrative level ruination would be in Deathly Hallows, since most of the story had already been laid out and has arguably the most reliance on chance and circumstance out of all the books (perhaps tied by Chamber of Secrets).

Within the story, that really depends on the OC you want. If, say, you had someone in the first book, for example an OC death eater, find Harry's location and simply kill him before he goes to Hogwarts, it would drastically affect the HP universe. In this case, the ripple affects are nearly unpredictable, which makes the premises behind so many time-travel fics of repeating canon so ridiculous in the first place.

I guess the obvious point here is that you might want to constrain the question a bit more if you want a more interesting discussion.
