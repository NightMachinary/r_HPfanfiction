Yeah, like [[/u/XeshTrill][u/XeshTrill]] said, it's really pretty easy to fuck anything and everything up with OCs, that's like half the fun of the self-insert fics. So the question is too open ended.

It's like if someone put a blank canvas in front of everyone and asked them to draw, hardly anyone would draw anything because it feels too daunting. The way to cheat this is of course what we've been doing with prompts and challenges for quite some time.

Edit: BTW, I really do like the kind of vibe you were going for. I was pretty excited to answer until I realised there was just too many ways this could go.
