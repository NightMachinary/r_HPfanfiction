I mean, there are the Weasleys, but they just feel very trope-y to me. Each has one quality, but other than that... Neville is the Mary Sue of Fanfics, and we've just run out of male characters.

Sure, you could go with a random background character, but there is even less on them than on the "second rate" women (Tonks, Fleur, Bellatrix, Luna, (Ginny)).
