Oh, that's someone inserted into the HP-verse, but not as Harry Potter. Don't know what I was thinking, linking that...

But, No, he changes to many things to quickly and the timeline implodes, and the world ends. And then the devil, that's suddenly there, takes him to a new world that's in 4th year, via a TARDIS, and he gets to change more things.

It's a real blindside. It may as well be a different story from that point on. In fact, it would be much better if the first one ended and a new story started and that particular chapter didn't exist. That's my opinion, anyways.
