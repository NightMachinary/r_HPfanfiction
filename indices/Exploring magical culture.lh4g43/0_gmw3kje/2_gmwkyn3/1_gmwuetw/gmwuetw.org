Yeah, I definitely wouldn't want to read 100 stories in a row where Harry acts like this, but it's the only one I ever read, and variety is the spice of life.

I do think a well written badass Harry fic will be nice as a palate cleanser afterwards. It's been a long time since I've read The Lie I've Lived, maybe I'll read that next. I think that Harry had an overabundance of spine.
