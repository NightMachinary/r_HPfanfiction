The Perfectly Normal series by BrilliantLady is this. I should say that this Harry has god awful taste in roll models, and spends a lot of the series /thinking/ that Dumbledore is evil (basically just taking the least charitable interpretations of Dumbledore's canon actions), but he is not and Harry learns this eventually.

The first (very short) fic is entirely pre-Hogwarts and serves to set up Harry's character as being more damaged by the Dursley's abuse and much more non-confrontational and manipulative. He starts participating in solstice rituals at Hogwarts in the second fic, which covers his first year (also pretty short). Currently the author is publishing (1 or 2 chapters a week) the fourth year fic, which I think is the sixth fic in the series since the summer between third and fourth year got their own fic.

Anyway, enough blabbing, here's the link.
