My #1 favorite in terms of technical skill combined with interesting storylines and compelling characterization is hands down Colubrina. I feel like Slytherins tend to get a bad rap, so I love the way she explores and expands on the canon Slytherins and makes them into well rounded (and only /sometimes/ evil) characters.
