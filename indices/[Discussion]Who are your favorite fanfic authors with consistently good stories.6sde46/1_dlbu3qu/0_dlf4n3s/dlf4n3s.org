Even without updates, Northumbrian has built up a good library of great fics to read, many of which are completed. And her two major WIPs, Strangers at Drakeshaugh and James & Me (I think that's it's name), are both still worth reading even if updates come very slow.

The Mind of Arthur Weasley is one of my absolute favorite one-shots.
