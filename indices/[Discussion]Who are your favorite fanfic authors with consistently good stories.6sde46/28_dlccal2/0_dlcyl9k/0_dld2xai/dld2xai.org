Honestly, I prefer the other series (Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link + Amulet of the Moon), because I think it's more original, but both series are great. I love the author in general because the characters are well thought out, realistically developed, and internally consistent throughout each story, even if it's not canon. In both series, Harry is a bit more thoughtful and self-reflective as a leader than canon-Harry. Events are explained not just in the context of Harry's life, but in the context of Wizarding society. In short, I think both series are really well written and avoid cliche tropes. The grammar and spelling is great, too.

I won't spoil the story of Veil of Mysteries, but you should know that it starts off with Dumbledore asking Harry to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, while still a 6th year student. Dumbledore is more supportive and Malfoy is more evil than in canon. No horcruxes. There's a great explanation for Snape's behavior in the second story.

tl;dr the writing is really good and at least give the first chapter a try.
