One of my all time favorites is linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon), an HP/Firefly crossover, full of comedy and the crew of Serenity.

I've always liked linkffn(Make A Wsh by rorschach's blot). The whole man on a vacation is an accidental hero thing was a fun read.

One of the first fanfics I read, nearly 15 years ago and go back to is linkffn(Mastermind Hunting by Louis IX). It's a crazy, far out there story. Harry discovers a magic at a very young age, Dursleys are loving, but he and the family go on a wild globe trot after one of the family members is kidnapped. It goes off the rails some way through, but was fun.
