I rec the following a lot, but I also reread them.

There is the whole Dangerverse starting with linkffn(Living With Danger). I love Harry raised by others, which initially drew me to this fic. The OCs actually have flaws. There are a lot of main Hogwarts kids Characters, but they all get some level of character arc eventually. It covers pre-Hogwarts and Hogwarts years so it can bog in about year 4, but I think the series is worth sticking with. The further along it goes, the further it gets from stations of cannon, and the better the world-building gets.

There is also [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]], which is a different take even for an AU. It gets a little wordy sometimes, and the names are slightly off (which my brain ignores), but I love it for how unique it is, it's good characterization of Ron and its world-building.
