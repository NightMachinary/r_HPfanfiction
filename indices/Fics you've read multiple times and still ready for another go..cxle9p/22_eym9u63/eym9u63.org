So I know this is the HP fan fiction sub, but linkffn(The Victors Project) is a real quality piece of Hunger Games fanfic. It's got its problems but is definitely the best I've read in that fandom (along with the other works by the same author). My main complaint is that it whitewashes a lot of the "careers" and tries to make as many of the victors into decent human beings as possible. It doesn't stretch things to the point of being absurd, but there's literally only 1 Victor who isn't redeemed or shown in a very sympathetic light in some way. I've reread it probably 5 times in it's entirety. It's just a fascinating bit of world building and is far more believable than most HG fanfiction.
