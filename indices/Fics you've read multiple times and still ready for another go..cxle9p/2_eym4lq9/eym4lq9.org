The first fic I ever read was also the best, so it's like my gold standard - Memories and Dreams, a series by Paganaidd, that's on AO3, and FFN. It's after the 7 books, deals with Harry reuniting with Dudley and adopting a young wizard boy named Tim who was brought up in an abusive home. It's perfection, despite elements I usually frown upon like supernatural stuff (I mean besides the magic which is just a part of the world). The characters are true to themselves in the books... but also change reliably as the books take place in Harry's middle age years. I cannot recommend it enough.
