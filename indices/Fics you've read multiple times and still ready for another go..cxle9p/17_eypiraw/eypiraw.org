One of my all time favorite fics and an amazing crossover [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568][There May Be Some Collateral Damage]] By metisket

Summary:

Ichigo's been ordered to go undercover at a magic school to bodyguard a kid named Harry Potter, and this would be fine, except that he's about as good at bodyguarding as he is at magic. And he considers it a good day, magic-wise, if he hasn't set anything on fire.
