The lost fic I'm looking for is, a fic that was set in the afterlife with Hermione being the guide and Harry getting to know his family, they were also going through Harrys lifes events and nuvan clarified that it was not the one with the toasters and that they had houses

Nuvan speculated a lot of it so that could be the reason for it to be hard to understand
