What if the veil in the department of Ministrys is a portal but there was another veil that got destroyed and so the people falling into it get lost since the other half of the portal is gone.

Also I once read a fanfic where you could create a portal on a wall through runes but it was mostley out of use.

My personal interpretation of the trope would be that portals are very hard to be kept open and stable and need a lot of focus and power but they can cover literally any distance. To stabilise it you would need at least one person at each side of the portal. The can only connect you from one point to another and a portkey is much easier to use if you want that, not to mention apparation. It would be cool if you used like Stonehenge as a place of power where a portal is much easier to control and all the stonerings around are there to draw power from the ground and feed it into the portal. I guess it would be used if you want to take a Dragon from like Gringotts to another country or so.

But what I really like would be the expansion of what I read in that fanfic. Imagine that portals could be only opened through runes written/scratched onto a surface. It is open as long as the runes exist but it can be closed from the other side. The advantage you'd have, is that you wouldn't need a wand to create it and it would be untraceable. Maybe you could even key it to a person. You could have written a bunch of runes on a surface and leave the last line alone so when you need a quick escape just scratch that last line and jump through.

What I could imagine if we keep close to canon, is a wizard who would create a portal as a means to travel just to be dramatic. Portkeys and apparition would of course still exist
