Yeah. I mean, when I don't like a story, I stop reading it. Then I make a note in my "stories I've read" spreadsheet that I didn't like it, because obviously something about the blurb drew me in, and I'd prefer not to have it draw me in again.

I'm not confrontational enough to go after the author, though.
