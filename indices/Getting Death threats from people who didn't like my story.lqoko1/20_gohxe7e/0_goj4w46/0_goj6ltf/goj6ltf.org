Telling someone to kill themselves is not a death threat. You're not threatening to actually do anything yourself, you are are telling someone to commit suicide. An actual threat would imply a risk of the victim being murdered. It's still an shitty thing to do, and anyone doing it is an awful human being.

That said, there are actual death threats in OPs reviews, all seemingly from one person. And yeah, anonymity can lead to lowlifes like that reviewer harrasing people onlins to feel better about themselves
