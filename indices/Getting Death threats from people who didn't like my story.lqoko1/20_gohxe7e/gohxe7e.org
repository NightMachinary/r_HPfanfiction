I mean, don't get me wrong, its undeniably a shitty thing to do, but are statements like "go die" death threats? Its not like they are threatening you. When i think of death threats, I expect something a bit more specific like "I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna kill you". Overall, I think reviews have a lot more of the former than the latter.

Broadening the definition like that will lead to lessening the credibility of actual death threats, which are already not taken very seriously by some people, especially in the online context.

That said, I do not personally write fanfiction, but I've seen statements like that in a lot of reviews. Its not even specific to fanfiction, its basically a part of the "online experience". Anonymity lets you release a lot of pent up anger without necessarily feeling guilty about it. Couple that with the younger reader base on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and you get a lot of childish, aggressive and negative reviews,
