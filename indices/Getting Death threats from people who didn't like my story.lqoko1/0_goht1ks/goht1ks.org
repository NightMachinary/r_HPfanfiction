[[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]]'s anonymous reviews make people think that there are no consequences to what they saw when in reality, it just makes you look gutless. I've seen people trashing my fics for all kinds of reasons and it hurt at first. But eventually, you get over it by remembering "why should I care what this no-life thinks?" I mean, they're spending their time trashing a fanfiction lol. I shouldn't care what they think.
