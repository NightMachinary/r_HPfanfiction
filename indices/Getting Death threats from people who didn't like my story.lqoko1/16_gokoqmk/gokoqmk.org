Never received death threats or anything telling me to die (yet), but I find the best way to shut down trolls (other than ignoring them completely) is to engage them taking their comments at face value.

For example, I posted some photos of my canvas art featuring Mario characters over on [[/r/Mario][r/Mario]]. Most comments were complementary, but there was one that just said "it's trash", no context, no explanation.

I decided to take the high road, and responded "thanks for the feedback! Anything in particular you think I can improve on?" Or words to that effect.

They never bothered to reply, so I think trying to bring them up to your level is a good way to make them uncomfortable and stop.
