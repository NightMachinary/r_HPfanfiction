I had a nasty troll about a year ago and have since just eliminated the ability to receive comments (ao3 user only) because I don't want to risk going through that again even though positive comments are so nice and I miss reading them. Definitely I'd recommend, if using ao3, to block the ability to leave comments without a registered account. People are much more respectful when they can't hide behind anonymous.
