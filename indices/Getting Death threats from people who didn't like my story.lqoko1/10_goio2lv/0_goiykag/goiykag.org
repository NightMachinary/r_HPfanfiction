Yeah, I've heard archive of our own has a better community, unfortunately, every time I decide to finally join and request an invitation, by the time the invitation actually comes, I've forgotten about it, and I have to wait for another few weeks to a month to join, and I forget about it again...it's a never ending cycle. I have a horrible memory lmao
