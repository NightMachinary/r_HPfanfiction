  Harry Potter wasn't stupid nor naive. He grew up having to look out for himself. Why would that suddenly change in the Wizarding World? But a snake in lion's clothing wouldn't reveal itself until it was to late to stop him. He wanted freedom, and he would get it. No matter what Dumbledore, the Ministry or Voldemort might think. Alternate from Order of the Phoenix

  "From his own experience, Harry knew that luck had never been on his side. At that moment he decided that he wouldn't rely on luck to solve his problems, he had to become smart, beyond the norm and talk his way through life. That's the only way he could survive." Also reposted onto webnovel by ME.

  ABANDONED On that Halloween night, Harry saves his twin, damaging his magic; Left on Privet drive, he grows up on his own; When he is eight, he starts doing freaky things that he can't understand; Discovering Merlin's hologram at Glastonbury Tor gives him a real family, and changes the fate of the Galaxy; Squib!Harry, Telekinetic!Harry, Pic is basic model of Hermes class ship

  What if Harry woke up to his underperforming before his third year and decided to take his studies more serious? What if he was more observant and also decided to find out how Hermione got to take all classes offered? What if he took things into his own hands properly for once and didn't mess around so much? The answer: A wizard awakes to his true potential.
