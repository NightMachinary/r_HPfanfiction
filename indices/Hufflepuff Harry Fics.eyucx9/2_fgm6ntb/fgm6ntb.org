Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts) has a Hufflepuff Harry who could really be in any of the houses, and ends up in Hufflepuff because of his willingness to really put in hard work. He isn't particularly supported by other Hufflepuffs (even though he does use them from time to time, and they're generally helpful when asked for help) as he's a bit of a loner and a bit of a cynical prick, but he'll take care of his own when they're in trouble, and he's a vindictive, manipulative bastard.

It's kind of a "Hufflepuffs aren't doormats" type of characterization of the house.
