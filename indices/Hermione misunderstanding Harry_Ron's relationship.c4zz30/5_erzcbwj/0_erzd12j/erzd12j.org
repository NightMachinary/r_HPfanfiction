Yep. Referenced in another thread just a bit ago. Made it four chapters before I had to throw up my hands. About the time Harry started demanding everyone call him by a title. And that was after a whole bunch of unnecessary flashbacks. I was trying to make it to the point in the fic referenced in the thread (Squirellmorte), but apparently that was way later.

It was almost painful to read. It was close enough to english that my brain was trying to force it to be coherent.

(Before anyone asks, No, I will not link it. You can go find the other thread if you really want to know)
