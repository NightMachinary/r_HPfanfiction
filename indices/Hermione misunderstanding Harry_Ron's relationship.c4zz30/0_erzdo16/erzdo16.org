Hermione's eyes shot up in surprise at Ginny's unexpected revelation.

"Y-you're pregnant?" she stammered.

"Yep!" the redhead replied, with a smile of smug satisfaction that lit up the room. "Harry and I figured it's about time we had one. With the national season put on hold due to the World Cup this year, now's a good a time as any since I won't be missing any matches."

"Well congratulations, Ginny," replied Hermione. "You're really dedicated to your part."

Ginny gave her a puzzled look before letting out a giggle. "Harry and I are /married/, Hermione. It was a joint decision. We both always wanted a child and before the year is out, we'll have one."

Hermione couldn't really describe how impressive their dedication to hiding Harry's relationship with Ron was. Instead, she hugged Ginny extra tight, hoping her feelings would be better conveyed through her actions rather than her words. Ginny returned the hug, but after the first couple minutes she began to squirm. "Don't you need to get back to work?" she asked.

Hermione broke the hug and spoke, looking at Ginny directly in the eyes.

"I love you both and I want you to know that both of you are so /brave/. If you two need anything, anything at all, let me know." She spun around and with a crack, disapparated, leaving a very confused Ginny in her wake.
