Because.. this wouldn't be about them, it'd be about Hermione? It isn't like HP Fanfiction is lacking m/m romance or something o_o.

Misunderstanding a situation is classic comedy. Can easily be done on hetrosexual relationships as well, as long as the person has reason to think someone would hide their relationship.

However, with the trio, this would be the only way it would work:

Ron misunderstanding Harry/Hermione's relationship? You are looking at an angst fic, given the cannon issue with this.

Harry misunderstanding Ron/Hermione's relationship? Well, they are together in cannon so what would this even be.

Hermione misunderstanding Harry/Ron? Possibility for comedy.
