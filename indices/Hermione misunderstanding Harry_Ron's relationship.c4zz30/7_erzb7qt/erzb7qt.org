why not make it an actual serious romance fic? seriously why the fuck is gay men being in love always some damn punchline? just some joke? there's plenty of movies like that out there already too, and it's demeaning and trivializing real guy's relationships (major one being that movie /i now pronounce you chuck and larry/)!

i mean shit, of course they can't really be gay, it's just a big misunderstanding haha! because funny to think about two guys in love!

it doesn't damn help shit that people want to reduce gay men to JOKES all the time like this, and then add in a good helping of fucking flamboyant stereotypes because SASSY GAY GUYS LOL! make it a real serious fic, give it as much weight and detail as you would a hetero romance or a lesbian romance!
