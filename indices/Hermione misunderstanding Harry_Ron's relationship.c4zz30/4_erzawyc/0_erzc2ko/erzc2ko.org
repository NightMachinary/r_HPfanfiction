That would kind of defeat the point wouldn't it?

Could do a good bait and switch though. Say, Ron/Draco:

"What do you mean you and Harry are not together?"

"I'm telling you 'moine, we were never a couple"

"But what about the... when you..."

/Ron raises his eyebrows/

"So does that mean you are not Gay?"

"Oh no I am. Just not with Harry. I could never think of him like that"

"Oooiii! I can hear you you know!"

/shifty eye ron/ "Anyway, you know how I was hurting after the final battle when Bill died?"

/Hermione nods/

"Well, Draco was dealing with losing his father, and he had just helped us at the end after all, and one thing lead to another"

/Hermione BSOD/

Edit:

Hermione: Harry! Did you hear Ron? /Harry comes in with Ginny/ Harry: Oh I've known about this for a while. Have to say, I didn't think much of Draco in school, but you know, we share such good taste in significant others, we kind of get along now
