this one is a "Draco Black raised as a Malfoy" i definitely enjoyed it although the Dramione pairing ruined it a little for me

​

this one's a little more Sirius-centric, here Sirius adopts Harry and Draco. i loved the Narcissa backstory. sadly, it's incomplete. (slash)

​

this one's a cute little WolfStar raising Draco one-shot, honestly i keep going back to it.
