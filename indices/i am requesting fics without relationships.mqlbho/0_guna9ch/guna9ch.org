Unfortunatly, while I read fics which aren't all too focused on romance, most of mine still have (slash) pairings in them.

Here are some gen fics I found

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10588629]]) This one is really amusing. Highly rec

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/790488]]) This one is really really good. Highly recommend. Very plotheavy.

If I could perhaps interest you in this fic which is romance but very unique. Brilliant woldbuilding. Doesn't seem like it would work, works brilliantly.

Lavender Brown/Tom Riddle Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19949440]])

Also this is really good. It's a wip and so far no pairing is really written into this but there are signs so perhaps not exactly whatcha lookin for. Soo good. Brilliant worldbuilding. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278]]
