linkffn(The Arithmancer) and it's trilogy, for sure, for everything except for Dark!Harry.

Hermione's the MC, she starts as a math protege that goes into Arithmancy in Year 1, it takes a bit for her to get going but she invents all kinds of terrifying things over the trilogy. Wonderful view of Arithmancy and how it influences Magic (not to mention the third in the trilogy for world building), and the Enemy is suited to put up a fight, to the very end. Harry's more grey then in Canon; he's not stupid by any means, but he's more light than dark.
