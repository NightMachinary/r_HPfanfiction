Voldemort is quite the capable antagonist in my AU story "Patron". For example, he only had Harry forced into the TWT as a distraction for Dumbledore so he could prepare his resurrection ritual without trouble while Dumbledore was forced to protect Harry. Of course, should the boy die in the tournament, that would be a bonus. Dumbledore, though, had his own plots going, to counter Voldemort. There's also world building, but mostly focused on France, Bulgaria, the Balkans, Turkey and Jamaica.

Another AU story of mine, "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", features the adult trio as curse-breakers, searching for the ruins of Atlantis - across Northern Africa, Turkey, Brazil and the Caribbean Sea, with a trip to the US as well.

Most of my stories have a more proactive Harry as well.
