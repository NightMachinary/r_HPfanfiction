Fate by TheTrueSpartan on FF.net.

The enemies are overwhelmingly strong, the spells are new and interesting (moving protego's, blinding people by levitating sand, firing face lasers, ect.) and the main character is both very dark and somewhat light. (A desperate need to protect his family combined with learnt psychopathic tendencies)

The main character is also Ron Weasley, which is very interesting. Just prepare yourself because this story does NOT pull punches. And Ron has a particularly fucked up life.

It's also 2.6 MILLION words long, which is neat.
