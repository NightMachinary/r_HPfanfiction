Because bashing, or also the opposite, favoring a character is something bad to do! :( I see people comment about it all the time in reviews and yes stuff. Even about actual books like game of thrones and lord of the rings. People always go "that character got way more screen time than the main one," and like "they should have been dead but the author just couldn't let them go." So yes it's bad to do in either direction. It overtakes the actual storytelling I think if it goes too extreme.
