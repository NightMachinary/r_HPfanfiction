Why do you /have/ to bash Ron? Really why? :( Writers are supposed to be like unbiased and stuff! Just because you don't /like/ a character doesn't mean you should be totally immature and irritating by starting to /bash them!/ Just don't do that. Just leave it out. It will make lots of people enjoy your story for what it is, instead of getting annoyed or exasperated whenever the bashing happens and that ending up overshadowing any other feelings about the story. :( Seriously how hard is it to just /not do that?/ I don't even understand why anyone feels compelled to do that.
