Um...what are you actually referring to? The worst act of prejudice I remember from Ron is that he backs away from Lupin after the latter's revealed as a werewolf.

And the worst he does in 4th year is give Harry the silent treatment for 3 weeks (Really, I checked. Heck, Harry's more obnoxious to Ron during that time than vice-versa).

He's not really lazy and un-academic either, he got the same OWLs Harry did, and he's pretty adept as a Keeper in Quidditch once he gets his nerves under control.

Also, keep in mind he's brave enough to a) go after Voldemort in his first year, b) go after a basilisk in his second year, c) back up Harry in the Ministry in his fifth year, and d) stick with Harry for the entirety of his not-seventh year (excluding one snit triggered by a horcrux's negative influence, and immediately after being removed from said horcrux he starts trying to get back to Harry/Hermione non-stop).

If I may suggest; don't bash Ron, use him as a mouthpiece instead. The Weasley-Prewitt family might be poor, but they're kind and competent; dragon handlers, curse-breakers, Ministry masterminds, brilliant entrepreneurs, Auror (even if retired), and Quidditch player/sports correspondent. And apparently, they're all quite fecund.

You could use that; have the pureblooded Weasley/Prewitt clan demonstrate what kind of bloodline abilities they have, their family animal and family magic. Let Ron do the explaining about what the Clans are, and what kind of inheritance Harry could potentially have.
