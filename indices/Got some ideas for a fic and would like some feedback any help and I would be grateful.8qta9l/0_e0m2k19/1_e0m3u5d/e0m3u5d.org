I probably wouldn't have bashed him since he would be on the story for like a paragraph or so but ron is lazy,immature, prejudice and jealous, something that doesn't fit in with the harry I'm writing so yes I will keep him out it. But it won't matter since it might be just a flashback to him ruining the friendship over a act of jealousy in 4th year, and in my story Harry actually gets motivated to train after the death of Cedric and a childish character such as Ron just doesn't fit in, so I wouldn't actually call what I'm doing bashing. It was more of an example of cliche but don't thinking about actually doing it
