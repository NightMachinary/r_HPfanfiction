I don't think I'm in stage 2, my dislike of Ron isn't from the bashing's in fanfic, it's from the books so I will push for Ron and Harry to have a falling out but not write Ron as a death eater or stealing his money or other dumb shit people write him like. Like I don't mind if Ron and Harry are still friends in any docs I read, but i still dislike him. Plus I hate evil manipulative Dumbledore ( I admit that I like ones that show he has flaws and has made mistakes but is still light not some manipulative bastard) aswell I hate the whole molly and Ginny love potion stealing money cliche, I still like them. It only ron a dislike from the canon books so I don't think I'm stuck at stage 2
