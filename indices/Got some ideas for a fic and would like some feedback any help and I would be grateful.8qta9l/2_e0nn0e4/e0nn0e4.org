  Will have some cliches like Ron bashing
#+end_quote

Your story sucks before it is even written.

Now, that was harsh, but hear me out: Bashing is shit writing. Period. It robs a character of its depth and portrays them as 2-dimensional caricatures. No other character besides the protagonist is as important as the characters antagonistic towards the protagonist. Sidekicks, mentors, side-characters - all of them are less important than the antagonists. So if you want to write Ron as having broken the bonds of friendship with Harry */make it interesting/*. Ron must have a reason, feelings, desires and hope to gain from breaking with Harry. So portray him like that.

To end this part of my comment I repeat: Bashing is shit writing.

  I think I don't think any fic I've read has it but if I'm wrong please tell me
#+end_quote

Entirely depends on how you're gonna write it, to be honest. Its by no means a revolutionary idea, but it doesn't have to be if its well executed. The family magic thing is one of the oldest tropes I know, and can easily be overdone. Honestly, I truly think your fic would be better off if you scratch that and just focus on politics and the aristocracy you formulated. Kill your darlings, and all that.

  Dark Extremists, Dark, Neutral, Grey, Light, Light Extremists
#+end_quote

I always disliked these names. First off: Nobody calls himself an extremist. Nobody. If you are an extremist you do not believe your own views to be extreme, you believe them to be /right/. Maybe you just meant that as "these are the parties alignments, names follow", but in case you didn't, please consider to think about something like my own make-up of the Wizengamot ([[https://imgur.com/lrWDrHg][link to imgur]]).

I just find it unbelievable that anybody would identify by "being dark". If you look around you, not a single political group that could be considered non-extremist identifies with "known evils". Everybody tells anybody else that they have moral high ground. Nobody goes ahead and just tells everybody /by name/ that they're the bad guys.

  Have a major rivalry with Tom riddle
#+end_quote

Why not get rid of him then and there? If Myrtle dies, Harry /knows/ what happened. Why not deliver the greatest Dark Lord to ever be to the authorities for being literally the only one capable of controlling a basilisk? Or /at least/ tell Dumbledore so the professor can dial his suspicions about Riddle up to a hundred and start to keep an eye on him much sooner.

  Walburga Black

Could be fun if you manage to get her character to be interesting.

Plotwise I think you should lean more towards diverging from canon. As I read it now, Harry seems to have almost 0 impact on the world and that, in one word, sucks. The protagonists actions need to have weight. If everything he does just ends up dissolving into canon, you may as well not write the fic at all. When you make Harry powerful, make him use that power. Let him deal with Voldemort soon(er). Let him be the one to face Grindelwald before the man lets the world dissolve in war. Make Harry's impact on the world a big splash.
