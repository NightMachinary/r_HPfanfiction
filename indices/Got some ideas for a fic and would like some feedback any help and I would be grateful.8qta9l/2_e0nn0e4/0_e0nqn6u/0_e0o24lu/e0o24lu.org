As I said: Its all about execution. Clans and Houses may as well be the same thing as it stands now. Its up to you to make it interesting. Family magic, his rivalry,... all up to you.

One thing that I still think is an issue: You pack */way too many/* ideas into your fic. Way too many.

You gotta choose. Do you want this to focus on the Clans and Houses - the british political landscape, do you want it focused on Harry becoming this incredible mage, do you want it focused on the wars, on Tom Riddle / Voldemort, on his world trip... on what?

You described 5 fics (6 if you count his relationship with Walburga) that you plan to pack into one. One definite outcome of that is that none of the stories told will be good. 100% guaranteed. Many have tried, the vast majority has failed.

Kill Kill Kill your darlings. Reduce it down to one, conscise idea. Because chances are you aren't capable of writing half a million words to credit every single one of these plotlines with enough time. Try writing a 50 to 100k fic with just one (maximum 2) of these plotlines. Believe me, the feeling of finishing 1 idea, is better than failing at writing all 5 of them.
