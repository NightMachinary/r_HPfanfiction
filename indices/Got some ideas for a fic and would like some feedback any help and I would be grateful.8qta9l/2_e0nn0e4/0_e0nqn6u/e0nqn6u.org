Well first off I only used the ron bashing as an example of cliches that are generally found, wasn't actually going to do it. I'm not a big fan of bashing either.

For the house and Clan idea, I was only referring to the Clan idea for not seeing it in any other fics (should have probably said that in the first place). The main reason I want to put something like this into the fic is because I love history, I like seeing the role and main achievement that the family have had in the Wizarding world I found it interesting what the author can come up with.( That what I like about passageways is the reputation and infamy that is related to the eveningshades).

For the family magic, I wasn't sure if I wasnt even sure about doing without directly ripping off someone else's work so it was 50/50 if I was going to include it. Main reason I was thinking about doing was to explain how harry would be head of the peverall Clan while the potters couldn't, were potters over the centuries were head of the Clan but it can't be passed down to an heir the family Magic's would have a choice for who is the head and if there is a direct family that has been head of the Clan for 5 generations then it allows the headship to pass down to heirs but once the direct Clan dies or the family magic absolutely refuses to pick an heir as the head then the branch families can then try forge headship(I'm not sure yet just came up with it now but will change once I start to worldbuild seruously)

For the Wizengamot titles they wouldn't refer to themselves as that but the other would refer to their group as such but I liked your set up of the Wizengamot so if you allow me, I would like to use it.

For the Tom riddle rivalry, I came up with this as I wrote it so I came up with this whole fic basis in looks 30mins to an hour so I was just adding shit without really thinking about it, but I'd probably work out a whole bunch of the world building and what I wanted to do with the rivalry and go into the nature vs nurture thing, I probably make Harry save Myrtle now that I think about it and then lead to a duel between Tom and Harry which forces Tom to flee the castle then build into him joining Grindelwald as apprentice or some shit.

With the Walburga pairing I thought it would be jokes as and could work out, she will still be a blood supremacist but as I was planning to make the blacks an ancient and noble house and peveralls an ancient and Noble Clan (which Harry will be head of) so he is a higher standing so she won't outright dismiss him but it will be a slow build to taking down her prejudices, I would still make her intolerant of muggles, indifferent to muggleborns and halfbloods but nowhere near as bad as she was as a portrait.

Plot wise I probably did the worse summary basis ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚, at the time I was just focused worldbuilding but I guess for the Tom v Harry I would make it a competitive rivalry for the dueling tournament that will be in the first year that Harry arrives(since Tom hasn't actually did anything that requires killing him otherwise it would be murder in cold blood since he actually hasn't done anything yet), then it will get into a main rivalry once Tom starts releasing the basilisk, Harry confronts Tom in the COS and they end up in the duel and harry gets the upper hand and Tom releases the basilisk to flee since he has been heavily injured by harry. Then it will go into the seventh year after which will be mainly just training, Walburga and harry romance( which I probably can't write for shit but will still try) and once he is of age; the Wizengamot sessions(but only show important trials, bills, alliances and elections). After seventh year a montage of training in mastery's around the world deiscovering different types of magic and then becoming a battlemage. Then will going into the grindelward wars were harry will play a big part in being the leader of his on regiment and pushing his way through the army of Grindelwald, maybe have a duel with Grindelwald which is close but Grindelwald gets the upper hand and curses harry that forces into the long recovery which he meets walburga again while he is make in Britain and they reconcile and then he proposes and they set up a marriage contract between them and then when he rejoins his regiment, Dumbledore has joined and his the head of his own regiment then join together to siege the final base of Grindelwald fuels and battle happens. Dumbledore wins, both harry and Dumbledore get order of Merlin's for there victory in war. Then goes into a montage of harry and Walburga marriage and children then leads up to the time he has a child that is in the same year as James and goes into the Voldemort war (will be more destructive then last time, I'll research ancient mythologies and go info associating them as actual creatures people in the magical world). This is where harry will come into his own and make a big impact in the war that leads to Harry beating Voldemort in a duel.

I'll do the specific plot after I finish the world building,

I'll probably make the gods of the several pantheons to be actually wizards with there own type of magic that explains why the muggles correlate a god with a certain ability such as Zeus and he will be a lightning elemental.

For the the world tour for 2 years , probably spend more time outside the European Continent, he will spend maybe a month in the major countries such as Italy,france Germany, Russia learning they Magic's but I'd imagine the would be similar with some differences. Then he will go to Asia ( figure out there Magic's when I'm World building) then Africa mainly Egypt, then Australia which he will learn from the small group of aboriginals, then the island countries around Oceania, then the americas and lastly Middle East.

Also I'll probably go into actual God's and goddesses, such as the lady of the lake, the rainbow serpent will be one that can only be communicated to by the aboriginals only, go into it more after researched it more but like I said I million time before all be done once I properly start worldbuilding and shit like that

Hopefully this is a better basis and I would also like to thank you for the feedback has helped me a lot,
