Don't bash or be overly nice to characters. It destroys the best of stories.

Don't put to much emphasis on the clans and houses. You are writing a story on kids, kids don't care. So if you put a lot of time into that it makes the kids seem like adults. If you want to put emphasis on this do it when they are older.

Don't do the time travel thing. It makes a good plot seem ridiculous most of the time (especially because Harry up until he moves trough the Veil has never heard of any of those clans or houses). The plot becomes a lot better as an AU born in that time and with a different politcal spectrum.

Family magic CAN be fun (in the Heritage series as a very minor plot detail for instance) but is mostly just a boring cliche (but if you want to put it in? Fits more with an AU world than in a time travel story).

Harry a Ravenclaw sure but make him into one.

Tom Riddle rival only works in an AU because with the knowledge of the future he will just make him pay for the Chamber thing and gone is Tom Riddle.

The story has a lot of potential!
