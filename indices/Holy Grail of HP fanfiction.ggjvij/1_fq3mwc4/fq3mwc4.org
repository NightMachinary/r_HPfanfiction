Northumbrian on ffn has some really good fics. I haven't read them all but I glanced at most. My favorite is "Strangers at Drakeshaugh" which tells the story of the Potter's moving into a Muggle town through the eyes of their neighbors. I really like that it explores the strangeness that Muggles must sense when they encounter magic.
