Rest in Silence By Rewrite Paragraph on ao3

(Sorry, but I don't know how to copy links.)

Oh, there are many things I could do with you Harry.' The undertone of his words rang through the air like a crack of a whip and Harry flinched. ‘And with the Horcrux embedded within you.'

‘Try it. See what happens.' Potter seethed.

Then Voldemort charged forward in a blink.

After they both danced upon the bones of his father, Voldemort discovers Harry Potter is the seventh Horcrux he never intended to make.

This changes everything.

A ceasefire is agreed, Harry Potter is collateral - the target of Voldemort's newest, most potent obsession.

And, Death has come knocking.

 

This fic is bloody awesome. Plain and simple. It also isn't what you expect and sadly, it isn't finished yet. The last update was nearly two months ago. And this is among my favourite Tomarrymort (my OTP) fics. Though I understand how this story, and pairing, is not everyone's cup of tea. And be warned, there will be smut and plot twists. It also gets worse before it will get better. Be warned.
