The fact that no-one's yet mentioned [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2345300/chapters/5171522][The Very Secret Diary]] is criminal.

It's Chamber of Secrets but told through the writings of Ginny and Tom in the diary. Starts off mundane, slowly goes horribly wrong, and then gets rather sad and dark by the end. It's a foregone conclusion, really.

(It's very old though, so it calls Ginny ‘Virginia' instead of ‘Ginevra', which threw me at first. But it's well worth it.)

Another one I commonly recommend is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance Of Sally-Anne Perks]] as it's a great mystery.

Harry remembers a mysterious child from the sorting who disappeared. Now in his third year, Hermione and him search for the fate of the missing girl, and discover at the end of the tale, a saddening but also important moral to not dwell on the past.

(Well worth a read, go into it knowing literally nothing as it's better that way.)

Finally, on the slightly more... weird end of the scale, I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13132217/1/Pranking-The-Tournament][Pranking The Tournament]] as it's a fun read.

It's a story in which Harry decides that his entry into the Triwizard Tournament is an opportunity worthy of some antics, and so decides for a bit of a... change-up. There are some unforeseen consequences and opportunities for a laugh or too along the way.

(Note: if a feminine Harry isn't your thing, avoid it, although read it anyway because it's funny and him (her?) taking down Snape is glorious.)
