I shit you not I have a list for just this occasion. Just saying that these are all Drarry fics, some are slash but others the relationship in minimal or a background story.

Firstly, my all-time favourite fic Evitative ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461]]) this is slytherin!dark!Harry but not evil!harry by any means. He's resorted in his 5th year, so you get to see the Harry we know well rather than a completely new person which often happens with slytherin!harry fics. It's written really well, paced amazing, 200K words and an AU of OotP, they explore dark magic amazingly, I think it's based on the author's pagan religion but I'm not sure. Anyway, big time suggest.

Okay this is a very close second, and it's probably been mentioned already but, Hermione Granger's Hogwarts Crammer for Delinquents on the Run ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7331278/chapters/16653022]]) This also has a well done podfic if that's your thing. Harry for some reason doesn't end up at Hogwarts and Hermione and the squad are on a mission to track him down and teach him magic in the hope he can help with the war. About 100k words and the characterisation, 90s feel, British references and amazing humor this fic deserves an award honestly. Draco and Ginny are done amazingly also Desi!harry and Black!Hermione which was a really nice touch. It's a story of spice girls, underage drinking, queer youth protection, uni life, floral rice cookers and so much more, it's one of those really special fics.

Another of my favourites, but if you're not into slash might not be for you also is heavy on the angst in Temptation on the War Front ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594/chapters/9926705]]) Written amazingly, like not a fault with that at all, they keep characters close to canon well and makes sense to the plot. It's a DH AU where Malfoy has defected and is dumped on the golden trio while at Grimmauld Place. As I said heavy on the angst, physical violence, not a 'happy' fic, especially in the beginning, but the relationships between the characters and how they all interact feel so genuine, with 180K and so it's one of my favourites.

Okay next is Running on Air, I really sweet fic, kinda sad but nice ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378]]) Harry's assigned to Draco's missing person case and discovers a lot about Draco and himself. Beautiful descriptions and scenes that make you want to get in your car and drive everywhere they've been. I really nice fic 75k and worth the read.

Lastly Hidden in Plain Sight is another great fic ( [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/984156]] ) worth reading for the setting alone, makes me want to visit Ilfracombe very badly, I love the south of England. A really sweet fic, quite slashy but worth the read at 56K.
