Linkffn(To Be a Slytherin by Morgana Deryn) This fic is my absolute favorite fic of all time. Twinfic, Has female hp twin Lorena Potter paired with Draco. One of the reasons that I think I love this fic so much is that I identify strongly with the character, and it provides a different perspective and new events while not being outlandish. In addition, it's super long, and Snape is the freaking best in this.
