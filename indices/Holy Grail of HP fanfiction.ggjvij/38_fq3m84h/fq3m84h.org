linkffn(Benefits of old laws) - does a brilliant job of handling a Voldemort working his way back to sanity and becoming a decent person, all while Harry comes to terms with being adopted by the man who murdered his parents.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]]) - first of a 3-part series in which Harry, Ron, and Ginny go back in time only to find that not all is as they remember, and someone else has come back with an agenda of their own...

linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) - a classic in which Harry goes back and a bit sideways in time. It has some very dark stuff, and also some hilarity and zany antics.

linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches) - Lunar Harmony fic, the three go back in time to 1995 and start robbing the Death Eaters blind, with a brief break for a bit of Shoggoth-wrangling.

linkffn(Harry Crow) - It's got some issues, sure, but it also manages to make everyone's actions make sense in-character, and has more characterization and character development than the entirety of canon.
