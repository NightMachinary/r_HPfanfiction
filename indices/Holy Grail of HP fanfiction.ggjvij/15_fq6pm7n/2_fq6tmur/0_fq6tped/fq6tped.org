  It's been eleven years since Harry Potter brought an end to Voldemort; eleven years of peace, eleven years of recovery.But not every wound can be healed. Teddy Lupin is loved and wanted by his family, adored by his grandfather, welcomed in the extended Weasley clan, and happy that he's about to start at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but he still feels the loss of his parents and the last lingering traces of the war.As he begins his Hogwarts life, he finds connections to his past that he never suspected... and manages a bit of mischief as well!
