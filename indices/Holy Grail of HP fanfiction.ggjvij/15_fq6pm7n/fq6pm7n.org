Unfortunately, I've long lost my old accounts with favourite fics but here's some decent ones, ones that stuck out - perhaps because they are different to my usual tropes.

A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles:

It says what it is on the tin, really. The author keeps Snape's character in line with canon versions, but with added background. I think it's quite a balanced take on him.

Text Talk:

This one is superb. I gave it a chance following a rec, as a dip out of my genre. So, it's a non-magical AU with characterisation that fits canon (fanon?). I know slash is not so popular on this forum so I should warn for that.

Azoth:

In all, I would say that the premise of the fic is slightly mad and I feel it shouldn't work, except that it really does.>! Harry decides to become a potion master, tutored by the dead Snape's portrait and assisted by a bargaining Malfoy.!<

My core recommendation for this fic is the way the writer creates emotional tension by allowing post-war young adults to work through the transition from war to peace time. It focuses primarily on Harry's difficulties adapting to a world in which he can make choices out of preference rather than necessity. Yet the author also manages to develop other characters in the back. The transition to Harry/Draco is done with sufficient character development that it feels natural, rather than forcing the reader to dive right in.

The Second String:

If you're into LONG fics, then this one is for you. It's a different take on time travel, slightly weird. I have to admit I didn't have the stamina to get through the whole thing. It's one of those fics that feels like it could have been separated into a series, so I felt I had come to a natural conclusion.

A New Kind of Normal:

I like this one because I think really shows perspective taking. It's clear to the reader where misunderstandings arise, but the author carries through with the information each character has so you can see how characters come to their own conclusions - to their own detriment. If I remember correctly, it's told from Harry's perspective for the entire or almost the entire fic.
