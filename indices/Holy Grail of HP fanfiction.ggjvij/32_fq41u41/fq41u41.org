And it's sequel

[[https://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunrise_Over_Britain/index/]]

I have no clue how folks post the links with the summaries, so I'll copy/paste for Sunset:

"Harry's life at the end of his 5th year was in utter chaos and his life was not going to get any better any time soon. From the flames, a brotherhood thought dead will reemerge, a family will break, trust will be destroyed, an enemy will change their path, a father will finally be found, a love will bring hope, and a hero shall rise from the ashes to become the legend he was born to be."

Just FYI, it is a Harry/Hermione story (with a crapton of side-pairings), and is very much an independent!Harry tale.
