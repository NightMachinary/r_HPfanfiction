As for why I love these stories: 1. It was nearly a year ago that I read AP, but the characters and the plot twists stay with me even now. The characters are amazing, their motives are believable, everyone is so deep and relatable. I can't divulge any specific reasons I like it without spoiling things, but... just trust me. It's a masterpiece. 2. AQ is another one. It's set in the US, and builds the world of Magical America amazingly. It feels alive, and dare I say the worldbuilding is better than the original books. It also really makes you wonder which side is the good side, and which side is the bad side. The characters are from a variety of different backgrounds, and each one feels so real. The best part is that the main character, Alexandra, is very flawed. In the first books, she's very childish and rambunctious, and sometimes even annoying. That is what I live for: imperfect protagonists.
