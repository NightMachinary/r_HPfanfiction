*More canon-compliant ones I LOVED:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][*Hogwarts Houses Divided*]] <--- */AMAZING./* The children are children, the adults are believable, the descriptions are on-point, the use of the goblins is fantastic, I LOVE IT. I started reading it and the sun and moon shifted around me for hours until I stopped and realized like two days had passed.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/A-Little-More-Time][A Little More Time]] <--- Pretty neat, I liked it, good take on Teddy Lupin, good take on time travel, funny jokes, weirdly heavy sometimes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] <--- Fucking /fascinating/. Very well done.

*Weird Snape shit that isn't everyone's cup of tea but also I didn't expect to be my cup of tea and it ended up being pretty great:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6329597/1/Snape-s-Memories][Snape's Memories]] <--- Solid take on child abuse, which I didn't actually expect, putting aside a minor faux-pas wrt autism in the last few chapters. Weird, but interesting.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4400517/1/Ananke][Ananke]] <--- To be honest, this is just the only thing that's made "Snape/Lily" not creepy in my eyes and I think that's a fucking /feat/ of writing. I mean, that's basically the one ship I find myself most instinctively repelled by that doesn't involve anything actually illegal (which I think is reasonable because Snape is an incel who emotionally abuses children in his care, but for people who /like/ Snape/Lily, I think this fic does it incredibly well).

*Honourable Mentions:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer][The Arithmancer]] <--- Badass math Hermione being badass and math and Hermione.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4380964/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Dungeon-of-Merlin-s-Mist][Albus Potter Series]] <--- It kind of goes off the rails after a while but for the first two books or so it's pretty great. I haven't read past the third one, though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10847788/1/Goldstein][Goldstein]] <-- /Orthodox Judaism/. Ravenclaws. Everything. It's amazing in its handling of religion, which... I never expect from fanfic (and I didn't think I cared, not being religious myself, /but still/).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7779108/1/The-Master-of-Death][The Master of Death]] <--- This one goes weird places but I'm here for it. Only crossover in the list.
