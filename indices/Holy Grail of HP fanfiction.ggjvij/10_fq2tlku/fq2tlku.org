Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay, by Saphroneth. The title sort of tells you everything but it's really well written and addresses quite a lot of plot holes, gives Dean, Seamus and Neville, and Blair for that matter, much bigger roles in the narrative (making the Golden Trio more of a Golden Class) and also introduces a couple of really fun OCs (I wish Tyler and Anna were canon they're wonderful).
