Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Time of Good Intentions)

Very long, and super weird, but strangely great!

Also, Isolation by Bex-chan. Best Dramione fic I've ever read.

Edit: I've never read The Psychic Serpent, so HP & the Time of Good Intentions (sequel) can definitely be read on its own, but maybe it would be worth checking out.
