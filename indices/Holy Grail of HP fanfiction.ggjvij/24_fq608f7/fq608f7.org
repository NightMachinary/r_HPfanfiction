It's gotten me through many dark days with multiple readings. The Resonance Trilogy by GreenGecko. Harry defeats Voldemort, but Snape is the only one who appreciates how Harry is still suffering. Eventually they become a family as Harry moves on into Auror training, his powers still growing to the point where he can cross into alternate realities. The third story was abandoned with just a few chapters to go, but so much had been resolved that you could see where it was going. I took her notes from her website and added it to the material at fanfiction.net and made it all available for offline viewing with these files:
