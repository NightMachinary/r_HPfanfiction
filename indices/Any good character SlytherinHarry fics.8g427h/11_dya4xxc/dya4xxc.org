Linkffn(the pureblood pretense). It's kind of a crossover with Alanna the Lionness, but no knowledge of that universe is required. Fem!Harry wants to be a potion master, and desperately wants to study under Snape. However, Hogwarts doesn't allow half-bloods to study there; so she and her cousin (Sirius' son) switch places.

It's long, detailed, and excellent and I wait with baited breath for the next installment.
