- Unbroken Saviour is if you like timetravel combined with a lovable Dumbledore, though there's some grim aspects to this story.

- Gryffindor's Girl is in my opinion one of the best, if not THE best femHarry that stays as close to canon as possible, but being different enough that you'll never mistake for it. Its not a canon rehash by any stretch of the imagination.

- Intersecting realities is really fun and I wish there were more fics like that. Rent a Hero is pretty similar to it, but incomplete. Also fantastic, great use of Divination.

- Keystone has 2 different femHarry's, Marigold (she's actually one of Harry's twin) and Rose. There's 5 total Harry's across 5 different realities that have a mental link to one another. Its a fantastic read, where you get 5 different perspectives based on their different personalities. Nature x Nurture in some cases, with nice humor, some angst, and few cliches, surprisingly.

- Victoria Potter. Boy, this fic is a treat by our beloved [[/u/Taure]]. Imagine if you read HP for the first time, where you get that magical feel and everything is new and interesting, the world is fabulous and mystical, where there's always something else to understand about magic itself, without being repettitive like you get after a couple hundred fics in your system. This is it. Great character dev, no Bones cliche with her aunt, amazing world building, its funny, has so much depth to the story so far, the plot isn't shoved in your face. Overall, top tier fanfiction.

- By courage and Love is obviously an Eragon crossover, so if you haven't read the Inheritance Cycle, you'll be lost, unfortunately. I really doubt you'd get 100% of what's going on, though the author takes the time to explain shit, because Helena doesn't know what's going on. You could try though. Its based on another fic with the same premise, called Slowly and All at Once.

- Swords and Sorcery is another crossover, but with the Nasuverse. You really don't need much knowledge about it, its pretty self-explanatory, but if you've watched Fate/Stay Unlimited Blade Works, that's good enough. Even if you haven't you won't have much issues at all. The good thing about an anime crossover is that you can get the description for characters in images, so there's that.

- Mistakes is ok, with some heavy Dumbledore bashing early on, though it fizzles out aroung 60% in. Timetravel, femslash romance, Necromancy and Albumancy, some elemental magics based on both spectrums, some abuse, lots of angst, some rape, OP characters, lovable Snape, Politics. Not everyone's cup of tea. Its fairly enjoyable, at least for me it was.

- Son of Potter... I've read that a long time ago, so I may say something wrong or not remember at all. Sirius as a parent, pretty much, Harry is a metamorph that changes gender at will (after training) and eventually they make the change "permantly" to the society, though no one knows Harry is Melania(?) except their friends. Its enjoyable, lovable Sirius, Tonks is wonderfully funny, some angst. sadly its incomplete and hasn''t been updated in a long long time.
