It's more like a parent who went through trauma and is trying to make things right, but is neglecting his daughter in order to achieve his goal of a better world. Paired with I'll advice from people he believes he can trust in.

I was the neglected child. My brother had a bad accident when I was young, almost died and our parents did everything for him, sadly they forgot that I was there too and my brother almost died. So I understand how it works and feels. And I think this story has some of the psychological aspects it needs to feel relatable.
