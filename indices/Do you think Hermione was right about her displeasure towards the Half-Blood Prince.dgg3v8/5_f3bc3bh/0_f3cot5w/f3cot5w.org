The regular text book didn't do anything to teach them how to brew the potion correctly either, it just had instructions to follow that were different from the ones Harry followed.

The only justification for not following the prince's recipes is they might be dangerous since obviously no one else checked the recipes. Where as a student approved text book should have "safe" recipes. (At least if this were a normal school / chemistry class, However cauldrons explode in Snape's class on multiple occasions from safe recipes so you can't really argue to much about student safety in potions class)
