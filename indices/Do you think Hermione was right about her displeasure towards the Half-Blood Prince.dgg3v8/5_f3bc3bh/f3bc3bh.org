The point of the potions class is not to make the best Elixir to Induce Euphoria, but to learn how to brew different potions, understand the theory and apply it to practice for this and other potions in the future. Harry used the shortcuts and improvements and got better grades, but he didn't understand why they work, so when, for example, he was asked to create a custom antidote, he failed because he didn't have a ready recipe. He still got praise from Slughorn because he used the bezoar, but it doesn't change the fact that he didn't have nearly enough knowledge to support his grade. Since he needed Potions to become an Auror (and would presumably continue them in Auror training), he was ultimately shooting himself in the foot. So yes, I think Hermione was right.
