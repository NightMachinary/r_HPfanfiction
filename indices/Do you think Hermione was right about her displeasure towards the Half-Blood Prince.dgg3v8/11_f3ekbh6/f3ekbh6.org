The charitable reading of Hermione's actions---and, IMO, the one best supported by her canon speech and most consistent with her character elsewhere---is that:

- Using the HBP book was cheating. Throughout canon, Hermione has a very strong sense of justice and fair play, and Harry getting credit for something he did not earn was something she judged him for. (Notice that when Harry offered to share, she declined.)
- Using the HBP book was reckless. Even throwing around Dark spells aside, Harry did not have the competence to know which of the Prince's suggestions had been tested, nor whether they only worked conditionally (e.g., only during waxing moon), nor whether they required more manual dexterity than he had, nor whether there were omitted steps because the margin was too narrow and HBP had assumed that the rest was obvious. In fact, nowhere did it say that HBP was successful: for all they knew, one of his ideas had severely injured him and those around him and he had to drop out of Hogwarts.
