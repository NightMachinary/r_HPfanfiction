Bah! It's only her jealousy rearing its ugly head!

Seriously, Hermione works hard for her grades and she can't stand the thought of somebody just using an old book with stuff scribbled into the margins to "cheat" their way to the top!

Hermione would however also have resented people like the Marauders (who were good students, despite not spending a lot of time learning! Hell, their rule-breaking alone would tick the rule-worshipper Hermione (she only breaks them if not doing so leads to worse consequences than obbeying them, while the Marauders break them just because they want to and because they can!), who have good grades without effort!
