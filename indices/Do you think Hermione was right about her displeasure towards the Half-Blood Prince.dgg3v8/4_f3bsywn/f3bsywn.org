I personally blame the pedagogy of potions class to be the main issue here. I cannot recall them ever being taught /why/ whatever they're doing works in potions class. Just given instructions to follow, maybe a homework assignment to talk about the properties of one of the potions they're making or one particular ingredient. It makes complete sense that Hermione would get annoyed at Harry for not following instructions in /following instructions class/ when not following instructions properly can result in extremely dangerous accidents. At NEWT level you would think they would know the basics of reactions and be able to start putting together potions for themselves. Hermione of all people should be able to read the notes on better methods, maybe cross reference it with something out of the library and go "OH! I see what that does, that's actually brilliant". Instead, because their potions education has been unmitigated garbage for 5 years she has nothing to go on /but/ the instructions.
