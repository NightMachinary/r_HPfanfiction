That's true, but potions has a lot of other actual reasons in-text why it's an awful class and Snape should have never been allowed to retain his teaching position. I generally have an issue with the way the other classes are shown to be taught as well, but potions particularly seems substandard. There's something to be said for Harry being an unreliable narrator who is resistant to actually applying himself in class, especially when he's not interested in the subject, but it's things like Hermione's reaction to the prince's book in book 6 , (or Neville's goddamn boggart in book 3) that make me think it was actually a pretty trash class from an educational perspective, not just Snape's shitty demeanor.

Saying all this I know it's mostly just because Rowling didn't feel like fleshing out the technical aspects of her magic system and didn't really explore what makes a good educator outside of "good person is good teacher. bad person is bad teacher." I really really enjoy fics where education is a deep focus and you see more of the classes than "an essay on cheering charms due Monday"
