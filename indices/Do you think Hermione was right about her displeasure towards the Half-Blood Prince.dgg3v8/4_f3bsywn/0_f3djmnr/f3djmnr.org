  I personally blame the pedagogy of potions class to be the main issue here. I cannot recall them ever being taught why whatever they're doing works in potions class.

You could say the same thing about every class. They're never told why a certain charm works the way it does with Flitwick. They're never told why transfiguratons work the way they do there either. We never see much of the classes unless something relevant to the plot or character development happens.
