Hermione is jealous about being outperformed in potions, but tries to frame her feelings about the book being about the spells. Ron even comments on it.

It does come across as hypocritical, considering she's definitely used "non-ministry approved spells".

Rowling did write Hermione with flaws... It's just a shame people rarely call her out on it in the books.
