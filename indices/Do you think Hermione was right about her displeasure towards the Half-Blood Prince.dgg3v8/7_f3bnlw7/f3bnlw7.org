In what way are we talking about? Obviously the Half Blood Prince was an unknown (who turned out to be right). However the way I see it is, a part of who Hermione is (and a part of being the deliverer of exposition) is her intelligence. That is to say she derives alot of her self worth through being smart and right.

She puts alot of faith in authority figures and certain books. The Half Blood Prince challenged that. Add onto the fact that for perhaps the first time outside of DADA, she wasn't the smartest one out of she, Harry and Ron.

Honestly, it's a very human reaction. Maybe not the best, but human.
