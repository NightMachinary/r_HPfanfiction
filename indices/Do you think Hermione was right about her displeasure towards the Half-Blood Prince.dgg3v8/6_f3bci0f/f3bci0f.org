Hermione is absolutely right. What kind of idiot follows untested NEWT standard potion making methods. The potion can either turn into deadly poisonous gas or blow up whole class. Harry is not a first year student and had experience with dangerous books like diary horcrux. Yet he acts like a ignorant firstie. Half-blood Price can be a dark wizard who wants deadly poisons from existing ingredients. Harry is just plain stupid and stubborn.
