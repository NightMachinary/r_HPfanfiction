This is actually an issue in all the books, JKR wrote scenes and sometimes those scenes had characters doing things that didn't make sense from a character perspective. In the case of book 6 she wanted more conflict between Harry and Hermione so they fight about the book and about Malfoy regardless of how little sense it makes.
