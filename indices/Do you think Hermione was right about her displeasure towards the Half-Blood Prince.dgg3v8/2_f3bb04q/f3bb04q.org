I have said this before, and I will say it again. The best way to understand is not so much that Hermione is /jealous/ (its possible, maybe even probable, but not the most important factor). Hermione is experiencing what you might call [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance][cognitive dissonance]], though this is only part of it.

As a person she is heavily vested in the value of authority, in this case the author of the potions book (hehe), and since its what was recommended in the class by a credible teacher it must be the correct way to make the potions. On the other hand, some random student in the past wrote all over the book critiquing the authority. What's worse is the results are /better/, and she knows this - Slughorn's praise is only a validation of this.

And so like most people experiencing cognitive dissonance, she rationalizes the problem. The Half-Blood Prince must have been bad or wrong or something like. She ended up being right, but in the end this was an ad hominem style attack to try and nullify the fact in her mind that the Libatius Borage was inferior to the Half Blood Prince at Potioneering.

Frankly, if this sounds like its I am criticizing her its not: I am /defending Hermione/. She is rationalizing and trying to deal with her conflicting perceptions and world views - something everyone goes through and usually respond in similar (or much, much worse) manners.
