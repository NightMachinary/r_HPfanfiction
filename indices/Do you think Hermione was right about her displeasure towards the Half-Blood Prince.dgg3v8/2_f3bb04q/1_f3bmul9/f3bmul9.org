You're right. The very first time she asks Harry why his potion is better than hers as they're brewing, she seems stressed but at least willing to listen to whatever trick he'd come up with. It's only when he tells her that his vandalized book has alternate instructions that she digs her heels in.

It even makes sense! Why would someone with better recipes not publish them and get the textbooks changed? Then everyone could have better potions and the guy could have a big pile of gold and go down in history as a brilliant innovator?

You and I know it's because he was a little occupied being a slightly-reluctant terrorist, and probably wanting to keep his head down afterward, to keep teaching at Hogwarts rather than having people beg him to run a lab or whatever. But with what Hermione knows, it doesn't add up.
