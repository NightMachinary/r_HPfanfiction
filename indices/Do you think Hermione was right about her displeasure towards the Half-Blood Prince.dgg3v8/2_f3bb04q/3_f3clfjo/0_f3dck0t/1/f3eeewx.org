  Harry actually offered to share the book. If she were just jealous, she would have taken him up on it.

Unless she's jealous of the Half Blood Prince himself, as opposed to just being jealous of Harry. After all, Harry is just following someone else's notes. What does she have to be jealous of? Harry's ability to cheat? But the Half Blood Prince was presumably just a student, like her, and yet he was so brilliant that he could outsmart his own textbook and edit it with corrections.
