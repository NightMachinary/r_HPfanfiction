  Harry actually offered to share the book. If she were just jealous, she would have taken him up on it.

I didn't say she was /just/ jealous. As I said in addition to jealousy she hates admitting when she is wrong. Using the book would be an admission that her initial reaction was wrong...so she digs her heels in.

She admonishes Harry several times for pretending to give Ron Felix Felicis but hand waves him off when he tells her he knows she Confundused McLaggen.
