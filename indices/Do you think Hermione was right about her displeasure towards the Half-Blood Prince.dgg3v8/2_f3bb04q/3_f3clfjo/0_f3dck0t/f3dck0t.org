But jealousy doesn't work well as an explanation either:

- Harry actually offered to share the book. If she were just jealous, she would have taken him up on it.
- It's not in character for her to be jealous or envious in academic matters. She never resents Harry for being better at DADA, is not in any particular hurry to learn the Patronus Charm, for example.
