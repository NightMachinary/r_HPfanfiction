I think you are jumping through mental hoops so you don't have to admit Hermione can be jealous and extremely reluctant to admit she is wrong. It doesn't make her a bad person...it makes her human with flaws. For some reason JK chose to turn her flaws up to 11 in HBP.

It is clear to me at this point Hermione had read many 'authoritative' wizarding books and listened to many authority figures that she immediately discarded based on her own opinions. Never forget...she kept Lupin's secret in POA. Based on the wizarding world's overall opinion of werewolves I guarantee most of the things Hermione came across in doing her research painted them as dark and dangerous. Hermione, at 14, disregarded all of this and trusted Remus based on her own judgement.

Umbridge was a picture of authority. She immediately sussed her out and pushed a movement to learn from an uncertified student. She actively subverted the rules in place to make it happen. From what I remember she never felt conflicted or remorseful about her choice.

She confunds someone simply to help a fellow student make a sports team. Someone who had such a strong personal conflict in defying/not trusting authority would have never done that.
