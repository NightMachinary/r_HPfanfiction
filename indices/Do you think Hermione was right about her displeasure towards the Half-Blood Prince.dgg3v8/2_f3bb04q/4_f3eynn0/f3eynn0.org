I agree with this. It is an issue of perception.

Harry (and Snape) are interpreting the set task as: Create the specified potion (in the best way possible)

Hermione (and the rest of the class) are interpreting the set task as: /Follow the set instructions in the book/ in order to create the specified potion

Hermione is, in my view, in the right to the best of her knowledge. She /could/ verify with Slughorn what the parameters of the task are, and then would probably be able to adapt her methodology if the paramters (to her) changed, but as is, her perception is that by not following the assumed rules - /and not disclosing to the teacher that he is doing so/ - Harry /is/ cheating in terms of not doing what the task requires. Why would she verify, when Snape's instructions, the only she has had in Potions for five years, have always been explicit?

I feel that if Harry himself felt he was in the right and not 'cheating', /he/ would ask for clarification on the task parameters, instead of using a different method under the radar and passing it off as if he is not.

Moreover, in terms of social weight, I think Hermione is right to be a bit miffed, too. Harry is already a celebrity who will do well through life no matter what. But Hermione is disadvantaged in the magical world. Being The Best through sheef grift and hard work and by following what is asked of her in class to the letter is her way of mitigating that. By outshining her in Potions, Harry is threatening her record - and by extension, her status. And he doesn't show any recognition of /why/ that is so important to her.
