I actually think Hermione was justified in being annoyed at Harry's Bezoar praise. But based on the descriptions of everyone else's effort basically the entire class fails just as badly. It sounded like Hermione failed as well by overthinking the problem.

I also think you are understating the amount of critical thinking that happens in the first five years and exaggerating how much more critical thinking is involved in year six. The Bezoar lesson happens in January/February which means they have sat through 4-5 months of instructions with no apparent threat to Harry's image as a potions genius. So either the class has been just as mindless or Harry understands potions better than most.
