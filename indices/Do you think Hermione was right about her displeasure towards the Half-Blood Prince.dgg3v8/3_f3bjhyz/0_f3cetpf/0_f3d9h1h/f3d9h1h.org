  The potions and the spells are totally different things in my mind.

Agreed, I unfairly conflated the two.

As for the cheating, I still think it is cheating in that Harry clearly abuses his better instructions to present himself as a potion genius. Even though he didn't initially intend that, his neglect to correct Slughorn's belief is academically dishonest. It's certainly not illegal and probably not against school rules but it is morally wrong.

Regarding his understanding of potions I did exaggerate, but I personally believe that before 6th year the potions class did not require any real understanding of potions. During classes all that happens is brewing potions, which merely requires the ability to follow instructions and perhaps some skill in preparing ingredients properly. The practical O.W.L exam is also just brewing a potion with given instructions. We do not know exactly what the written exam encompasses but we do know that one question was regarding polyjuice which Harry believed he got full marks for because he could describe the effects. That does seem more like a knowledge test than actually applying any understanding of potions. The first time students are really asked to show their understanding of potions is when Slughorn wants them to create antidotes for blended poisons, at which Harry fails utterly.

The point of the class was simply to make potions until 5th year. The point of the Advanced Potions class that Harry is in is definitely not just to make potions but to /understand/ potions so that unknown potions can be analyzed, antidotes can be created based on such analysis and perhaps even new potions can be invented. There is a reason that Aurors are required to take that class and it's not that they have to be even better than their peers at mindlessly following brewing instructions.

Regarding the amount of learning being done, I didn't claim that either of them were learning anything from following instructions. Harry just generally learns less and understands less about Potions than Hermione, regardless of which book he uses.

Hermione not wanting to read the book is IMO completely OOC for her but perhaps I just didn't understand her character as well as I thought.
