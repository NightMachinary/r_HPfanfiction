The potions and the spells are totally different things in my mind.

I agree with Hermione totally about the spells...trying a spell with vague or no explanations is irresponsible and dangerous. But you justifying Hermione being upset about the potions notes by citing the spells isn't fair. There is no possible motivation for the Prince to write worse ways to prepare the potions...and his tips work from the start and get better results. Is Harry supposed to want to make worse potions?

And I think you saying Harry doesn't understand the slightest bit about potions is unfair as well. He received an Exceeds Expectations on his OWL's despite the fact that he was taught by someone who despised him. Hermione received an E on her Defense OWL. Would you say she knows nothing about Defense?

Finally, the Prince's potions notes are an incredible learning tool that actually provide explanations. Take the first instructions Harry uses from the book:

/Crush with fat side of silver dagger, releases juice better than cutting./

The Prince not only describes what to do, he explains /why/. Harry is learning from the instruction.

The second bit of instruction says to add a clockwise stir at the end of the suggested counterclockwise stir. The standard text and the Prince are both giving basic instructions...the same amount of "learning" is being done in both cases.

Ron says it perfectly when Hermione tells Harry he wasn't getting praise for his own work. /He only followed different instructions to yours./ Hermione was doing the same thing as Harry...blindly following a set of rote instructions. The same amount of learning was being done. The only difference was Harry had a better teacher and was learning more useful information. Information he offered to let Hermione use as well.

The point of the class is to make Potions. How is it cheating to follow instructions that make a better potion?
