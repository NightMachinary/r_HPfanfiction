She wasn't "right" about her displeasure towards the Half-Blood Prince, and in fact her personality up to that point suggests that she should be interested in learning about his alterations to the potions.

But she is definitely right in her displeasure towards Harry using the book like he did, both because it is an extremely bad idea to just trust what some student once wrote into the margins of a book (as we see when he decides to use Sectumsempra without even before testing what it does) and because Harry uses the knowledge from the book to get better grades without understanding the slightest bit about potions which is basically cheating.
