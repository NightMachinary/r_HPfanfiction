No. Science moves forward when people try new things. I love Hermione but my problem with her has always been her rigid manner of learning. She's the kid in class that had to memorize everything to be smart while the slacker kid in the corner aced things because he understood why things work as they do. She's clearly intelligent and it seems like she's threatened by someone who is able to tweak instructions and get better results.
