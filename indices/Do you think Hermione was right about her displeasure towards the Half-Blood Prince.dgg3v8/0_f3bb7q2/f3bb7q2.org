If you are talking very specifically about like her reaction to the different approach to Potion making then no. This was clearly information she didn't have access too. So if anything it would be reasonable to read through it and get a new perspective. With her interest in magical knowledge it would have made sense. It seemed like she was kinda just bitter that someone her age was able to do something she hadn't thought of first.
