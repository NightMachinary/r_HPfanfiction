The author has addressed this, and confirmed that his Harry's interpretation is in fact wrong. What's /really/ going on, he says, is that there is a /Muggle/ gene, that suppresses magic, but is sometimes damaged, producing wizards. Squibs happen when the Muggle gene is successfully repaired by the relevant enzymes during creation of the gametes.

Of course, there is an argument to be made that this is just a post-hoc justification, but while I do agree that Yudkowsky may not quite understand quantum physics as well as he thinks he does, I think it's a spectacular show of bad faith to seriously propose that he would make such a beginner's mistake.

At any rate, though, I refer you to [[/u/AutumnSouls]]'s comment below on the fact that not understanding genetics does not necessarily mean that one is phenomenally stupid, even if it /would/ be concerning if Yudkowsky, in particular, could have misunderstood them so (due to his being a professional scientist, though not in the field of biology, it's worth pointing out).
