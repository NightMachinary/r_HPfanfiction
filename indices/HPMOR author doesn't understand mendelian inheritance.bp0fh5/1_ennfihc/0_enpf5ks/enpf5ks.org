Harry makes street smarts errors. Harry makes interpersonal errors. These things can't be studied easily. Harry, however, studies. He does not get basic mendelian inheritance wrong. His character flaw is that while he's a genius, he makes critical mistakes when he isn't dealing with things he reads in books. That's where the character development in the past 23 chapters have occurred.

Getting something basic wrong doesn't even make for interesting character development when it has no consequences. You can't pass it off as character development when the author doesn't use it in the story to create conflict. It's a fucking excuse.
