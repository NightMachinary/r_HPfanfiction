Even so, there are boundaries. When you call someone “a fucking retard”, you've crossed them and it is a personal attack. There are ways of addressing alleged incompetence in a way that isn't one, but that is not one of them.

Going with your earlier example, it would be like hearing a rumour that something is wrong with Donald Trump's tax declaration and immediately proceeding to call him a fucking retard on some forum that he may not frequent but that does have people interested in politics. I don't like the guy and I do think him stupid, but that ... yes, that would be a personal attack.

No, I don't like Yudkowsky. He has proven himself an arrogant person with something of an ego, and one who does make mistakes from time to time. I enjoyed bits of the story but as a whole I could not get through it. But of all the ways to criticise him, did you really have to pick the one that has no actual grounding in anything and is just crude name-calling? Especially when by doing so you're actually opening yourself to the same insult, as inability to recognise the fact that a character not knowing something is not the same as the author not knowing it generally puts the person in question fairly low on the comparison scale.
