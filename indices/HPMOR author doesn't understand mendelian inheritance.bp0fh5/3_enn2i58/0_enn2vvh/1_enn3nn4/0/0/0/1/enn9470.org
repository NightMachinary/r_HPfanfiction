And if you'd framed it in reasonable terms like “off-putting”, that'd be one thing. It's the “insults” part that we mostly take issue with.

And to reply to your Donald Trump example --- /Donald Trump is a tax evader/ would be a statement of fact. A politically controversial one certainly, and therefore an unadvisable thing to bring up on a non-politics forum; but not a personal attack. Whereas if you said, in a non-joking context, /Donald Trump is a f---ing criminal and people who support him are brainless monsters,/ then /that/ would be a personal attack.
