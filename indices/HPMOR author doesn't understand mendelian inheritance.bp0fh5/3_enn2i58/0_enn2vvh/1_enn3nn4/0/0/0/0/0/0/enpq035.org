And if you actually knew what you were trying to achieve here, instead of writing the whole thing to insult someone whom you don't even known, you would have been aware that ad hominem attacks can be personal attacks and thus one cannot claim that it cannot be the latter because of being the former, just as you would have been aware that the moment your argument devolved into name calling it stopped having anything to do with fallacies.

It would be an ad hominem attack if I wrote that as someone who hadn't written anything of the sort you have no right to critisise Yudkowsky, and it would be ad hominem because of me attacking something that has to do with you rather than the subject matter (which would in that example be your capability to deliver a critique). If I wrote that you cannot criticise him because you are a fucking retard, then it would be nothing more than name calling, just like your ... whole of everything, really, here is, and it would be counted as such regardless of the fact that by now some people could argue truth of that statement based on your comments displaying lack of learning capability (which, in case you do not know, is a possible criteria for a medical diagnosis of retardation).

Now, no, it may not be assault, no, at least not if you want to speak legal definitions. But it certainly is a bad thing to do and it certainly is something you are incapable of defending as a decision. In general it's very hard to defend the use of such loaded and vulgar and denigrating phrases because in doing so you are causing other people to stop giving you the benefit of the doubt and start treating what you write as what exactly it appears to be, hateful name-calling.
