I just think that if the author didn't understand, or couldn't be bothered to understand the concepts he wanted to include in his fic, he shouldn't have risked embarrassing himself by trying and failing to explain them. Just go the usual route and mention the general area of study in passing.

That review seems pretty good. Thanks ^{-^}
