I should state that linked review is a terrible way to construct an opinion about HPMOR. If you already hate it - then sure, have a pleasant read. But if you have not read HPMOR or only starting, you should keep in mind that more than half of what is said there is simply wrong, but in a subtle way you may not be able to catch even if you check. I will give one example, chosen at random, from the review of chapter 25:

#+begin_quote
  this is the terrible idea meatball) Using literally the exact same logic that Intelligent Design proponents use (and doing exactly 0 experiments), Hariezer decides while thinking over breakfast:

  Some intelligent engineer, then, had created the Source of Magic, and told it to pay attention to a particular DNA marker.\\
  The obvious next thought was that this had something to do with “Atlantis”.
#+end_quote

If you have not read HPMOR, natural conclusion to draw would be that Harry made up a stupid, ad-hoc theory on the spot, immediately believed in it as a religious fundamentalist, and never checked. (And this is supposed to be a story about how to do science!)

If you check the chapter, Harry does, indeed, think about that hypothesis. But if you keep reading, you will find out that Harry immediately noticed it does not help to explain fake-latin-sounding spells and this is the end for that hypothesis. It would never be seriously considered again and was said to be wrong by the author in the comments. The rest of the chapter is about how some problems are just way too hard to solve on the spot. Chapter's name is "Hold Off on Proposing Solutions" to make absolutely sure you got the point.

The whole review is like that.
