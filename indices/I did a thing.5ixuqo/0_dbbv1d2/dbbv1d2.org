Alright so two main concerns of mine, I'll start with a bit of a Brit-pick, the golden trio would not refer to Malfoy as Draco to their face, especially as enemies. They would call them Malfoy. Secondly, I'm not sure why you're writing a F/F, genderbending a male character, keeping their name but exclusively referring to them as a new middle name.

I would also encourage you to increase the length of your chapters generally, but that's only if you're comfortable doing that. I feel like there is a lot more you could expand upon, fill in blanks if there's differences in the timeline from Canon, etc. Best of luck in future chapters, though, not intending to be attacking, just not sure I understand.

Edit:. I'm on my phone, so I'm not conveying my question very well, I'm cool with a gender bent character, I'm just not sure I understand the alternating between Draco and Dres seemingly at random. I mean at that point you might as well make it Hr/Pansy and you'd have the same set up. Slytherin who hates muggles/muggle born, in a rival position, etc.
