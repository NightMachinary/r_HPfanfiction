Two (and a half) things I noticed in chapter 1:

Draco is referred to as Dresia. I get that you want to genderbend him, which is alright. But don't refer to her with her middle name. Rewrite her name into, maybe, Dresia Draco (would be the easiest solution, as you could just keep the rest of your work almost unaltered)? Or make it Draconia Druella - Draca? I don't know, but referring to her middle name is kinda weird.

Hermione Granger referring to Harry, Ron and herself as "The Golden Trio". You write in her thought, or at least use her perspective for exposition. Hermione would /never/ use this term (not to mention that it is a completely fan-invented term with only referential roots in canon, much like "Leader of the Light" is). I'd advise a rewrite of that part of the last paragrpah of chapter 1.

Just a pet peeve of mine: Characters who sneer a lot. Draco does it almost every time you describe her facial expression.

To chapter 2:

Yeah, get rid of the term "Golden Trio". It made no sense in Hermione's perspective and makes no sense in Draco's. In the scene when Draco's Mark is seen, maybe use "Potter's cronies" as a better term?

And if Hermione remembers seeing Draco leave the Hall and following her, with only black in her mind after it, wouldn't she be able to conclude that she had been obliviated? If yes, I'd add that conclusion to Hermione's written thought process.

Anyway, I like it so far. I'll follow it and hope you continue with it.
