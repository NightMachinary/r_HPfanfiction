These are really great suggestions, and I appreciate it!

I think I'll go back and edit Draco's name to make a bit more sense, because you're right about it seeming a bit off.

I meant to use the reference to them as the "Golden Trio" in a more sarcastic manner, but editing it out may be the best bet here.

Again, really appreciated!
