The best Snape character arc I know of is probably linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions). Unless you want it to be canon compliant, in which case, linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles).

I /love/ the character arcs for Sirius, Remus, Snape, Draco, and Harry himself in the Innocent series, but only the first four books are complete. It's still over a million words and actively updated, but if you only want finished works, it's not ready yet.

Similarly, Northumbrian has many completed stories, of varying lengths, but also some incomplete ones. linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) stands well enough on its own, though, and has a really great depiction of Harry and Ginny raising their family.
