Note that Methods of Rationality is first and foremost a primer in rationalist philosophy, with the story being the vehicle for that. It's still a complex, funny, and thought-provoking story in its own right, but a lot of people find Harry obnoxious or the occasional lectures boring. Others love it all. Most readers can agree that it has a fantastic antagonist, though.
