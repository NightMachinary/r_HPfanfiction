I applaud you and I don't know whether or not I hope you finish this. I certainly tried, but I couldn't make it past The part where PL decides Harry needs his own village or something and he spends what I remember as like 3 chapters mentally wanking about how awesome the village and its defenses would be. In particular, I remember multiple paragraphs on the warding of the doors an how Harry had thought of every possible way to break down a door and came up with the perfect countermeasure for each At that point, it stopped being funny and I just couldn't anymore. Best of luck(?) to you.
