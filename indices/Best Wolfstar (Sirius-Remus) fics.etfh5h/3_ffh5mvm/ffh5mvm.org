I really liked [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4787432][Fractured Skies by Orphan Account]] - it features a deaf Sirius and the way signing is portrayed seems to really capture the poetry of the language. The story beautifully conveys the challenges of living on the fringe ... the otherness (not just Sirius, but also Lupin). Also, I loved how the Marauder's story was made mundane (not magical) with links to the original stories woven in. It is slash and has a sequel that is also good.
