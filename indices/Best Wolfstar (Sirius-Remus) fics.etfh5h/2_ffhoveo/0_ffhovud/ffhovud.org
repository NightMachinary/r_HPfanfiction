#+begin_quote
  When Harry wakes up in an alternate timeline--a timeline where Voldemort was defeated long before the first war--he discovers everything is different. His parents, his godfather, his friends--and him. Harry must deal with the consequences of who he would have been if he had been raised by his parents, and figure out where he stands with his casual hook up, Draco Malfoy.

  Harry Potter grew up at Number Four Privet Drive. Harry Potter has never known his parents. Harry Potter is a wizard.Harry Potter is not the Boy Who Lived.--The Thrown Pebble is Book One of a whole-canon reimagining wherein Neville Longbottom, not Harry Potter, was the one targeted by Voldemort. This changes many things, and other things not at all.(TTP is complete; the series is a WIP. Tags will be updated as chapters are posted. See series notes for more details.)

  In 1978, Sirius Black almost becomes an Auror. Turns out even he can't fake his way through the mental health assessment.So what. He has better things to do: Remus Lupin is one. The war is another. He spends weeks at a time undercover for the Order while Polyjuiced to the gills. It's probably his new favourite thing.Little does Sirius know that running from himself will send him on a collision course with his ephemeral brother, but life is funny that way.
