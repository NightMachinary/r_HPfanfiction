I can't help but think the best way to do "character reads the books" is not to do a chapter-by-chapter reaction and commentary thing; but open with them finding them, skip over the time it takes for them to read them, and then pick up after they've finished reading the last book as they try to come to terms with what they've read, and what (if anything) they can do with their newfound knowledge.
