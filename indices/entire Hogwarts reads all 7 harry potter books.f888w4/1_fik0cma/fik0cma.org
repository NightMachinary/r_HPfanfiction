I think the problem is that writing of this type of books becomes so horribly boring for the author they gave up usually. The best I know of this trope is linkao3(A Dramatic Reading by White_Squirrel;A Sensational Story by Srikanth1808, White_Squirrel) and even the second author passed out in the beginning of the second book.
