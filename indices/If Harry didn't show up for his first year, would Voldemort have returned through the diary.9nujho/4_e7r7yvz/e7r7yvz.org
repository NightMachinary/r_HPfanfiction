Well, that is one of the biggest mistakes in HP. Without Harry Voldemort would not have returned during canon time, maybe never. It would have been better for the wizarding world if he would have died of measles or sth. Remember that besides Harry finding the diary, Wormtail would have just stayed with the Weasleys without causing any harm. Sirius only broke out because he saw a picture of "Scabbers" in the newspaper, that was only taken, because the Weasleys wanted to cheer Ginny up by traveling.
