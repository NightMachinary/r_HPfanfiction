[[/u/InquisitorCOC]]'s point below about how Harry was the one to find the Diary after Ginny chucked it into the loo is a good one. Perhaps it would have stayed lost for years. Or perhaps the Great Basilisk would have stumbled upon it and helped it somehow --- who knows? There's infinite possibilities.

I don't know what your brother is thinking, but there's little doubt that Ginny's life would have been enough to complete Diarymort's body (he was nearly complete when Ginny was nearly dead, after all). The climax makes little sense if he /didn't/ come dangerously close to getting a full body.

Note, though, that there's a big question of what Diarymort would have done afterwards --- some think he'd have sought out the main Voldemort in Albania (it seems like Rowling's intent that the Horcrux-Voldemorts would have been subservient to the original), while others think he'd have just let him be and taken over leadership of the Death Eaters himself (his "my past... present... and /future/" does suggest he intends to /become/ The Voldemort).
