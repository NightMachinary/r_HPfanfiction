its established that one of the ways it happens

but nobody has ever made a weaponized Horcrux that's designed to get its own body

and hell, it could not even be a merging but a swap with Voldemort's soul that's wandering around replacing the diary chunk in the body

the idea of Voldemort with all his power, with the reflexes of youth, is insane and he instantly gets back his charm

you could be right as well

but I doubt Voldemort would want such a visual connection to his past walking arround
