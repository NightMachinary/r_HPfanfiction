You need to remember that Diarymort was /not/ meant to get his own body. The way in which Voldemort "weaponized" him was that it was designed so that it could hoodwink, and then possess, people into opening the Chamber of Secrets for him in the future. Diarymort himself says as much --- his original self's purpose for creating the Diary was so that "someday, [Diarymort] could lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work". Draining the puppet of their life-force entirely and building a body for himself was Diarymort's later improvisation, born of his learning through Ginny that his original self was gone and there was a Harry Potter in need of some quality killin'.
