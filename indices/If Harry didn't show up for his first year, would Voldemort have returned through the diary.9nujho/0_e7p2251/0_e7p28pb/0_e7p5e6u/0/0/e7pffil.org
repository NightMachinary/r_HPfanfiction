No, I don't think that's what she meant when she said it "would have strengthened Voldemort considerably". Diarymort merging with Voldemort wouldn't make much sense, since it's established that remerging the broken bits of soul in Horcruxes takes true remorse and excruciating pain. My belief is that the true meaning of the statement is that it would have made the Horcrux Hunt (and thus, killing of Voldemort) /much/ harder if one of the Horcruxes hadn't just been a static, albeit cursed, object, but instead a flesh-and-blood Voldemort clone who could fight for his life with all the magical prowess of the original.
