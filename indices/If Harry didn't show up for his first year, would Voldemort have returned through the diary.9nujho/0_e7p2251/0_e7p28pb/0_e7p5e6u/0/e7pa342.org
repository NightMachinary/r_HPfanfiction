Rowling also said voldemort would be stronger if diary riddle had come back

so I picture, old tom would merge with diary tom

and you would have the older tom riddle, in his younger body which means he would have way faster reflexes and stuff and he would have his good looks back

and who knows what draining ginny would do for him
