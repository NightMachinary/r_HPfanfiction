The Voldemort in the Diary was a different splinter to the Voldemort who attached himself to Quirrell. So his actions would have been the same regardless of the success of the other Voldemort's plan. The better question is, would Harry not being there have had any influence on /Lucius/'s decision to send out the Diary? That, I'm not sure. But possibly.
