I'm wondering of Voldemort might have succeeded his resurrection during - or father before - Harry's first year of school if Harry hadn't gone to Hogwarts.

Quirrlemort broke into Gringotts trying to get the stone and I ain't sure if Dumbledore would have moved it to Hogwarts of Harry wasn't expected to start school.
