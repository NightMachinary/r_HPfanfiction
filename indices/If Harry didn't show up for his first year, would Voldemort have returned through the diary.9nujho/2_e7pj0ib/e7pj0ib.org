I'd also point out that the moment Lucius put the diary in Ginny's cauldron was almost set up by Ron and Draco sniping at one another, and while the Weasleys and the Malfoys don't get on, it's possible that if Draco hadn't insulted Ron on the first day at Hogwarts, and without the resentment Draco holds for Harry 'choosing' Ron and the Weasleys over him, then the Diary may have been given to another student or Lucius could have just gotten rid of it another way.
