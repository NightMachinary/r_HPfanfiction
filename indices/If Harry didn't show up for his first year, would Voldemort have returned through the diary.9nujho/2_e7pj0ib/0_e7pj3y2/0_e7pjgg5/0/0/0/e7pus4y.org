In CoS JKR tells us about Malfoy's motivation through Dumbledore:

  ‘A clever plan,' said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr Malfoy straight in the eye. ‘Because if Harry here --' Mr Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look, ‘and his friend Ron hadn't discovered this book, why, -- Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn't acted of her own free will ...'

  I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen, because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master's soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends: *by planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley's daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur, have me thrown out of Hogwarts and get rid of a highly incriminating object in one stroke.*'

From what we're told here, it had little to do with Harry and everything to do with Mr. Weasley's work at the Ministry. So if that fight had not happened, Malfoy probably would have tried to find another way to slip the diary to one of the Weasley children.
