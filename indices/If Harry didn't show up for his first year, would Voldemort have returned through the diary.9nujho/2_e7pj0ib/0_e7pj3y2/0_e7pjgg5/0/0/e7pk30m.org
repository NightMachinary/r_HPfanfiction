Without Harry, Hermione and Ron most likely wouldn't be friends, and she'd probably be dead, and without Hermione and Ron being friends, Lucius couldn't insult Arthur for consorting with the Grangers. Could he have insulted him about something else? Sure, but that's where your own ideas would come in. It's also possible Lucius orginally planned to take the diary to another Deatheater and have them keep it. Voldemort said 'They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death' So chances are some of those that managed to remain out of Azkaban might know, as they're probably the smarter ones. The fight might just have been a spur of the moment thing.
