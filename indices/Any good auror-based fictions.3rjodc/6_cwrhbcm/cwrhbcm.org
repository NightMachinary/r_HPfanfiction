Snape has a daughter named Lilith, who's in danger and who also represents a danger no one but Snape fully comprehends. Or so he hopes. A widowed, cynical Harry, member of a Coterie and part of the College of Aurors, falls in love with Lilith after protecting her from an attack.

Lots of scheming, Auror shenanigans, Dark wizardry, and good characterization.
