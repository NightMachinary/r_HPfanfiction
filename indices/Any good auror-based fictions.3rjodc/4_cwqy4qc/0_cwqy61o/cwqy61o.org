  Deep within the Department of Mysteries, a clandestine unit dedicates itself to the destruction of Voldemort's surviving forces in the aftermath of the Wizarding War. This group, lead by Harry Potter, does not officially exist. But for those who fight the darkness that threatens to engulf their world, it has a name, heard only in the shadows: Operation Wrath of Merlin.
