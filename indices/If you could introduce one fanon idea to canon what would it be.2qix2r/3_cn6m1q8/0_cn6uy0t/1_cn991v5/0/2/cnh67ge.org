I'd say these are more passable than good.

Slughorn was a selfish old bastard, not exactly dislikeable but sly and self-serving. Yes, he duelled Voldemort, but running away would have destroyed his reputation and career. Never saw him showing genuine affection where it wouldn't benefit him ultimately too.

Andromeda Tonks we never see/meet in canon so its hard to judge what kind of person she is. Not-prejudiced is more a bare minimum of human decency than a sign of being a good person.

Snape...I dont know, he has ups and downs. Formed by circumstances, definitely, but he still bullies children under his care and is a terrible teacher who turns his back on the bullying that goes on under his nose. His whole actions are motivated on guilt of allowing his old (one-sided) crush to be murdered. I pity Snape but I don't think that makes him a good person - and even JK goes out of her way to show how unreasonably nasty he is for 90% of the books. Not only is he a poor potions teacher but he also royally messes up his role to teach Harry occlumency.

Regulus and the Malfoys... we never really see them going against the prejudices of their families. No, JK never conveys the idea of a moral greyness or people being any less than essentially good (Gryffindor) or selfish (Slytherin). The closest she comes is showing certain Slytherins to be 'less-bad'; but characters' prejudices against the snakes are never called out or challenged and the overall impression is of Slytherin house being at best a corrupting influence and at worst a child picked for that house as a moral judgement. I also personally find it uncomfortable how many of the Slytherin characters are described or portrayed as physically 'ugly' - a further implicit judgement on their immorality.
