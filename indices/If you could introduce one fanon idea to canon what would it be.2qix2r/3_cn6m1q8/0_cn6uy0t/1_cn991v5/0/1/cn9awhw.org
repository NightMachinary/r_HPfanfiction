Slughorn is a creep and a borderline pedophile with how he acts around kids. he also knows a lot of things about making horcruxes for a supposed decent guy...

Regulus and Snape were death eaters for many years (and thus committed several crimes while doing so). The fact that they wanted out for their own selfish reasons does not magically make them good guys. Snape especially is the biggest bastard in the series and definitely not one of the good guys.

Andromeda might be the only decent example you gave, but she is barely mentioned in the books and most of the evidence that she is a slytherin comes from other sources.

Merlin lived hundred of years ago! He isn't at all relevant in the story of Harry Potter.
