I think the unique part of the Fidelus was that the access had to be freely given. My head-cannon was that it ripped the location out of our reality, anchored it in wizarding space and kept the key to that dimension within the secret keepers soul.

It is the spell-onification of loyalty/trust, where the owner must trust someone else with the complete security of their home. Drawbacks include that the trust must be absolute, no secondary enchantments or fallbacks can be created, which is why it is not seen amongst the pure blood families.
