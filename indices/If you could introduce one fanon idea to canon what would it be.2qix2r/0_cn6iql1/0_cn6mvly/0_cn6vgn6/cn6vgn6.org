My headcanon is that that is how things like the Statute of Secrecy is /actually/ enforced and why people take the class at Hogwarts. You might not be a great seer or have "the gift", but the basic mechanics work for everyone who half tries and isn't a bored, 14-year-old jock taking it as a blow-off class, or a stressed swot who can't stand what is basically a humanities/social studies subject with a very slow roll-up to practical and effective applications.

Get a good NEWT in it, get a straight out of school job with the Ministry, detecting and predicting underaged magic and spells used in front of Muggles around Great Britain just before or after they happen. Think the movie Minority Report. The prediction goes in when the event happens, so long as it isn't blocked by some protective magic, then the DMLE (not Aurors) show up and clean the scene, erasing memories and setting things back to sort-of normal.

Because otherwise, how would they /ever/ find people breaking the Statute before things snowballed out of control?

It also works for other things. Instead of magical accountants and actuaries using number to predict things like spending forecasts, you have literal magical forecasts for fourth quarter spending, in both government and business. Personal finance means knowing your birthday and the alignment of Jupiter to predict sudden expenses -- a reason Astronomy is an important class to take, maybe, making it a sort of home ec class.

So say your star charts say tomorrow isn't a great day to take a test, but you can't reschedule. Better warm up that lucky clover amulet and look to your tea readings to avoid the worst of it.
