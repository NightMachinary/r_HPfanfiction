My headcanon:

There are "beacons" around the British Isles that form a layer over the entire land. If you perform any magic it warps it like planets and shit warp the fabric of space-time, and they can pick up on the general vicinity - if there's no known muggles living there and the magic is an effect occurring rather than cause and effect ("I want my teddy" rather than "Accio teddy") then you are investigated and marked as a muggle-born or something.

If you perform magic when you get a wand and there is no known mage living near you then you get a letter to appear before a hearing. How they know it was done in front of a muggle, I don't know (I can guess that muggle presence somehow affects magic after it's casting? Or affects the caster's magic?)

My headcanon for Divination without the /sight/ is effecting chance. One of the big things in my fic is that Divination is involved in smelling/aroma stuff which can make you more focused and . . . other stuff, I guess (really early concept right now).

I always figured Astronomy was important was due to some magical changes with the alignment of the other planets and that, with particular alignments being able to focus magic in very different ways, and change the very magic of the world, however lightly.

Interesting concepts to put in a fic anywaysss.
