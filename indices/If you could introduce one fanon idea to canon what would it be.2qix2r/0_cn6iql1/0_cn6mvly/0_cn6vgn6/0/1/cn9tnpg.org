My head canon:

A spell exists upon all magical children below 17, which reports any magic within their vicinity to the Ministry, as well as whether the magic was accidental or intentional. The presence of an adult wizard deactivates the Trace.

This explains how Harry could be given a warning for Dobby's Hover Charm, but not Tonks' Packing Charm.
