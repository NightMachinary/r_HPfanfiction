I thought the whole point of Divination being useless in the books was to give support to the idea that it's our choices that make us. The part about the prophecy only coming true because Voldemort chose to follow it made this pretty clear. It also showed how Voldemort was wrong by believing in magic above all else, while Harry was able to kill him using a first year spell because he had human values rather than just valuing magic.

Divination might be useful in some circumstances, but for this story it's important that it not be.
