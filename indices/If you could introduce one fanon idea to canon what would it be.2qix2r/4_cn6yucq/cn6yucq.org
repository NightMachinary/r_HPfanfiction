I know it would sort of defeat the point of Harry being "absolutely good" and a pure soul and all that, but I would have liked to see him struggle a little bit more against dark magic's temptation. He did a little bit, but just a bit more would have heightened the tension and made it all the clearer just how precious his integrity really was for the story.

This comes up a fair amount in fanfiction, and it's really interesting.
