Out of curiosity (not that I read H/Hr ever, so these cliches are new to me) what in hell does Ron have to offer Hermione? He has one skill (chess/quidditch strategising) and other than that, is jealous, petty, lazy, and insensitive. I could never figure out why they put a brilliant girl like Hermione with what was basically a deadbeat?
