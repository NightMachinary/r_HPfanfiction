Ahem:

1. Calmer under pressure: has Hermione cast fire at Devil's Snare

2. Genuinely caring when the chips are down: cf. Reaction to Petrification of Hermione, reconciles with Harry after seeing the danger of the Tournament

3. Stands between a man he thinks is a mass-murderer and Harry/Hermione, /on a broken leg/.

4. The DH incident is grossly misrepresented. Ron Disapparated in anger (under the influence of a Horcrux that was targeting him) and tried to immediately return, then after escaping spent his time trying to get back.

Ron is a goddamned human being. Hermione is not a saint.
