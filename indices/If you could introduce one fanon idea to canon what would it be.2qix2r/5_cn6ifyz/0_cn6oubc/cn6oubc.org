I'd quite like a bit more H/Hr in canon, in a kind of "best friends who may at some point give it a go, but it doesn't work out" kind of way, but Harmony? Not with a ten foot pole lol.

"Oh, Harry, I've loved you since you saved me from the troll, and here's a ten page mini-essay in which I explain away all previous occurrences over the last five years to reinterpret them as supporting the thesis of my love for you!"

"Hermione, I feel exactly the same way! Here, have my own dissertation on the same topic!"

"Goodness, Harry, your punctuation is awful, but I love you nonetheless! I can't believe we've wasted all these years acting like human beings instead of automatons! Now, all you need to do is put this collar and leash around your neck and you can have me forever!"

"Yes, Hermione! Gladly I will take your collar and leash, for though we only just recognised that we have romantic feelings for each other, already we must declare our undying love for one another. Let there never be any conflict between us, nor meaningful interaction of any kind, for we are perfect partners who cannot have separate identities, beliefs or ambitions!"

"Marry me!"
