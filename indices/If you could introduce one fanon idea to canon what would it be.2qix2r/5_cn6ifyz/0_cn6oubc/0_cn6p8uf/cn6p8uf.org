There's a lot of room for them to awkwardly kiss/bone in /The Half-Blood Prince/:

- To get back at Ron in a petulant and more grown-up way.

- To go with the flow (Ginny/Dean + Ron/Lavender etc...)

- Because the war has started and they are afraid.

Any one of these can be portrayed legitimately quite well in a novel, hell, it could be done in a one-shot narrative with no dialogue because we already know books 1-5, they would only need to connect a few dots through introspection from either's POV.
