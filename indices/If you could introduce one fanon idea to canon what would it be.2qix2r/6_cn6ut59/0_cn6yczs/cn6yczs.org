you joke but honestly I would have liked both more grey areas and definition shown in Dumbledore. Even if it was shown after he died I think it would have added to show the wool coming off childrens eyes.

Obviously we learn more about his past with Grindelwald and some questionable leanings in youth and some regretful decisions. However to add to that - say he was in Slytherin. This would have been great because while I am not fond of manipulative Dumbledore he did sort of get Snape on board and led Harry to fulfill the plan and got people like Mundungus Fletcher on board and all sorts really. Also I think that would have worked really well with his past- being and outsider as "son of Percival Dumbledore, who scarcely a year previously had been convicted of a savage and well-publicised attack upon three young Muggles." from wiki. I think that combined with questionable youth would really have shown the impact of decisions and second chances make and what a good and powerful Slytherin might be like.

To add to that, more in the realm of my thoughts that common fanon ideas, I would like if it was shown why Dumbledore is the "most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters" or "greatest". The former coming from Elphias Doge, his oldest friend, and the latter from Dobby. I know he is powerful, intelligent, basically defeated two of the greatest evil wizards ever. I don't like the whole manipulative Dumbledore thing but wish it was shown or told in canon why he was a good headmaster and the import of the position etc. ex. Dumbledore says that his weakness is power and turn his life to teaching/education. He declines becoming Minister of Magic three times but is Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump- why? This isn't bashing I believe there are good and interesting reasons but becoming MoM isn't the same as being corrupted by Saurons ring so what are these interesting details? I won't hold heading OotP or becoming headmaster against him but IMO he provides a poor education for the children (a very poor teacher in a ghost, a barmy Divs professor for a position that close to being cut, a very skilled potion master with questionable teaching ability, not to mention a caretaker not capable of magic, and professors of the admittedly troubled position of DADA). I simply think these are opportunities for interesting world details. Some poor examples- Finances cut- options are either poor muggleborns like Creeveys get a free spot or their family gets some mind alterations to not notice 'incidents'/block self realization or pressure from ministry/board means that the replacement of a poor teacher would have far worse consequences like a Tom Riddle Jr. having free access to manipulate thoughts and attitudes of generations, and continued access to the vast knowledge Hogwarts holds etc.

Basically add things like why he did or didn't do this or that and the alternate even worse consequences. Similar too but /outside/ of some difficult but understandable choices regarding the Dark Lord- which has getting Snape to become Headmaster so that he can hold things together as long as possible and prevent the absolute worst etc. Snape and Dumbledores trust looks horrible in the publics eye but is then shown to be a good move. Things like that- just show and tell a bit more.
