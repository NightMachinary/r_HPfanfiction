I think a huge part of Harry Potter is magical power as well. Instead of just economic power, Voldemort's magical power would play a huge part in foreign relations as well. Sure, France might be laughing at the state of Britain's economy, but they won't be laughing when Voldemort threatens to personally attack their people unless they pay Britain "reparations". What is France going to do with their extra money? Hire untrained citizens to die?
