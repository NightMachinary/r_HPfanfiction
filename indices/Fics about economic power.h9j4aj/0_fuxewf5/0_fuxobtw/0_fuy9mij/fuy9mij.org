And if every country formed a coalition against the US, the US would be smoldering embers. Yet that will never happen. Voldemort can slowly take over one country at a time, as the rest wait around hoping he'll stop. Hitler did fine pissing off other countries without trouble and Hitler couldn't take on entire militaries by himself. And it seems like if they did, chances still would be good for Voldemort. There were massive international coalitions to hunt down Grindelwald and Grindelwald still managed fine.

Grindelwald did fine against in an unideal situation against at least 20 aurors, the elites of magical combat. Dumbledore beat him and Voldemort equaled Dumbledore. At a certain point, the number of bodies one can throw at a problem start hindering one another, not helping.

Swap the US for Russia for China for Iran for Voldemort. There are reasons as to why countries ruled by dictators remain in power.

Not to mention, you overestimate how much money is needed for Britain to function. Money is pretty much spent on food and luxury goods as well as paying for services you yourself are unable to pay for in Harry Potter. Infrastructure isn't as expensive when you can force labor or transfigure a street yourself.

Now that I think about it, I have my doubts as to how damaged Britain's economy would even be. Voldemort didn't exactly do that much damage to the ministry and he seemed seemed to do just fine paying for bounty hunters, expending resources on surveillance, prosecuting muggleborns and creating a new secure way to enter the ministry.
