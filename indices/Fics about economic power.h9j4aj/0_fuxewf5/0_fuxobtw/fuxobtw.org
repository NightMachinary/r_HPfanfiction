That's one way to piss off all other countries. France might decide to pay a bit, but that won't be enough to fix Britain's economy, not after most of the highly talented non-purebloods who would have no problem getting a good job somewhere else decided that staying in a country ruled by a dark wizard isn't worth it and left. He might ask other countries for money too, but that can only go so far until the other countries decide that enough is enough and invade Britain. Voldemort is powerful but I doubt he could singlehandedly defeat all the world's best fighting wizards.
