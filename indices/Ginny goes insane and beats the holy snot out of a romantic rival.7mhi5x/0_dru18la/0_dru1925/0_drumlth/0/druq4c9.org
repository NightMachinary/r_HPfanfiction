Thanks for the heads up! I've seen this recommended before for other topics, and I will admit I'm interested in seeing /HP/ with a sci-fi twist.

Although you know what might be even more interesting? A /HP/ / /Dune/ crossover. I'm interested to see how the two "Chosen Ones" of Harry Potter and Paul Atreides would interact if they met.
