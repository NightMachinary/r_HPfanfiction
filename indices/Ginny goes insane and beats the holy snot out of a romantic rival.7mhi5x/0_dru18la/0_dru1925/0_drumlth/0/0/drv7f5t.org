That would be really interesting! I generally love crossovers, just not when they come completely out of left field. As for HP with a sci-fi twist, that's absolutely what I went into this fic expecting, and the first few chapters didn't disappoint. The beginning was genuinely compelling and had a fascinating concept of magic/sci-fi mechanics, but IMO it went off the rails after that. I'd love to see more of what this fic started out being.
