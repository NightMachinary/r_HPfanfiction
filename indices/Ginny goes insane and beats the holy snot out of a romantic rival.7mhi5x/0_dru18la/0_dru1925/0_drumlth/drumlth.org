This fic starts out interesting, gets weird, gets /uncomfortably surreal/, and by the point you're really just hanging in there because you're in too deep to quit before seeing how it ends, it [[/spoiler][sidelines you by becoming an unannounced Star Wars crossover and ends on a cliffhanger]].

It has a sequel that feels bizarrely disconnected from the original story while also being inexplicable if you haven't read the first one.
