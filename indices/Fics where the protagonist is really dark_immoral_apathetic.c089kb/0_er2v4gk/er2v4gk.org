Linkffn(Lesser Evils): Harry, among others, are noticeably more jaded and brittle. The author took quite a bit of inspiration from PotDK.

Linkffn(The Sum of their Parts): arguably the protagonists are better than the government, but like everything its just a bunch of shades of gray here. But nobody is really "good" per se.

Linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher): you ever watch the old James Bond films? Harry is kind of like one of the villains from there being whacko and immoral but also extremely intelligent. You learn how as you go. Technically Hermione is the protagonist, but the story is really about what happened to Harry in the past.

Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): Harry time-travels into the past, with the intent to speedrun and slaughter/maim/destroy his way to victory.

Linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School): Harry, as a result of his life-style at the new Hogwarts, really only cares about being the best and victory.

Linkffn(The Lies That Bind): the beginning of this fic start out canon-ish, and is sweet and sacharine, but takes a massive heel turn pretty quickly, and can get downright brutal by the end. Enjoy for revenge junkies.

Linkffn(The Denarian Renegade): pretty hard not to say make that judgement about Harry in here too, though one can somewhat understand the why of him being so vicious and arrogant. Has two sequels.
