linkffn(Circular Reasoning) it features a fairly dark/immoral/apathetic Harry. Very well written.

linkffn(The Lesser Sadness) my personal favorite OP!Harry fic, though he has /slightly/ more morals than the other works I'm recommending. After dying at the Battle of Hogwarts, he makes a bargain with demons to bring him back in time more powerful than in the past. In exchange he has voices in his head that encourage wanton violence and destruction. Sadly unfinished, but totally worth it.

linkffn(Echoes in the Fog) Features the most Evil!Harry I've ever come across. Canon!Harry and Grey!Harry, with friends, find themselves in an alternate world ruled by Voldemort, with Evil!Harry has his second in command. Grey!Harry comes from the author's brilliant short fic linkffn(For Lack of a Bezoar) and Evil!Harry comes from the author's Downward Spiral Saga, which I never read so I didn't link here, though perhaps you'd like that as well. Echoes in the Fog is a fantastic read and I highly recommend it.
