I am fine with people asking for recommendations and saying "no slash", as long as they leave it at that. Same with saying "no het", "no mpreg", "no HP/GW", etc.

If they have to say, "No slash, I'm not homophobic", there's where there starts to be a problem, because they are trying to explain away something. The same with if they ask for fic centering around Slytherin characters, and then say "No Blaise, please, I'm not racist or anything".

Right now, I'm reading a bunch of WBWL and twin-fic, if I ask for recommendations, I might list some criteria like "No Lily & James still alive" but I certainly don't need to say, "I don't hate parents or anything"!
