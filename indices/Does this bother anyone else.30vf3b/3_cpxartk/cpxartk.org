I think I'm the one who's post you saw and I meant that I don't like reading about my favorite characters in gay sexual situations I'm OK with it if it isn't not to overly sexual and full of detail about the situation. I guess I didn't express myself clearly enough, I'm sorry if I offended anyone and I'll try to be clearer next time I want good fics.
