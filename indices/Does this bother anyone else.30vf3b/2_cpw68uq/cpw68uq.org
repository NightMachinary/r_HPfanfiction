I have no problem with somebody recing slash, but I wouldn't read it for the same reason I wouldn't read Snape/Lily. It's icky. Now if there's a tasteful slash relationship between two side characters then that's fine.

I dunno there might be a slash pairing I'm ok with for main characters, but most slash I've seen involves Snape or Malfoy and I dislike both of them.

I'd read something like Sirius/Remus before I'd read Snape/Hermione or Draco/Ginny, but I don't particularly want to read any of them
