It does bug me too. I've seen the ‘no het' occasionally but seeing the ‘no slash' tag in a summary of the fic or whatever pretty much makes me think that a 13 year old is writing it and shouting ‘no homo' every time Harry and Ron do so much as talk.

I don't mind it in requests. I mean you request something you want and there's nothing wrong with not wanting slash (or het) when your looking for something to read. But seeing ‘no slash' or ‘no het' in in a summary of a fic is a turn off got me. It's like the author is answering a question I didn't ask.

It's just not a big deal to me, slash, het, who cares? If it's well written and a well thought out plot, I don't care if you pair Harry with Dumbledore. (I'd not read any sex scenes there, but hey I'd try it if it was recced to me.)

Edit: Clarity and grammar.
