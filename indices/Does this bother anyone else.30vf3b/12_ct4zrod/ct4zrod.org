I'm hopping onto this thread so late, but I just discovered this thread and I figured I'd tell the abyss of reddit my opinion.

It's actually really weird for me to read through all of these posts on this sub with primarily het recs or preferences. Mostly because when I started dabbling, I began on ao3 which is essentially all slash. Plus my fanfiction reading spawned from being obsessed with the TV show Supernatural, which anyone can tell you is only guys. If you want a het pairing there, you really have to stretch for it.

So for me, I'm the opposite of a lot of the commenters here. I'm straight (and female) and prefer slash. Not that I have a hand in my panties while a Hogwarts-wide orgy occurs or anything, I just often hate the way female characters are written romantically. I've read far too many bodice ripper romance novels that I fear the het romance genre of reading holds no surprises. And I don't mean this in an anti-feminist manner at all, because I love strong female characters. I just have gotten so sick of the innocent giggling virgin girl trope, that having both characters be gay males makes everything a little more fresh.

Once I started reading slash heavily, then het just felt unsuccessful. Unfulfilled. I struggle with reading Harry/Hermione because they often don't have nearly the chemistry of Harry/Draco. I tend to avoid all Harry/Ginny stories because they tend to stick so closely to canon that I can predict all of the plot points.

Tldr; sorry for posting when I'm sure everyone is done reading this thread. I just find it amusing that I'm biased in the opposite direction, avoiding het stories even with the strongest recommendations.
