I don't mind people having certain tastes. I personally prefer stories with het relationships. (Mainly because they're more relatable to me). That being said, I've read and enjoyed the occasional story with same sex couples. Generally, though, I find that the story writing for the main slash fics (HP / SS or HP / DM) tends to be subpar, or not very compelling.

Overall, I don't think certain fics should be discounted, but I'm not really going to begrudge someone for not wanting to read a specific story.

On a side question - I thought that 'slash' referred to any relationship. The posts here seem to imply that it refers only to same-sex relationships. Which is the correct usage?
