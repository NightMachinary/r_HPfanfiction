Equal in terms of opportunity, not in terms of numbers. It's like saying that a black people should be equally represented in the government. Nobody is saying that the amount of whites to blacks should be 50-50, they are saying that race, creed or sexual preference shouldn't hold them back from achieving that goal.

If you don't think homosexuals shouldn't have equal opportunities to straight people then that seems pretty homophobic to me.

Although I do agree with you that equal opportunity and equal representation are two different things. The amount of representation should be somewhere near the demographic representation.
