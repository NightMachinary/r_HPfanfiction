It bugs me. Part of it is for the same reason that all pairing warnings bug me--if a pairing is written well enough, I shouldn't need to ship it to enjoy the story. The romance should develop naturally and in a way that, even if I've previously never imagined it possible, I don't doubt that within the confines of the story it makes sense. Whether that's gay, straight, or anything else.

But no lie, part of it bugs me because I'm queer and more often than not, the phrase "I'm not homophobic" comes out of homophobic mouths. (*Disclaimer:* And before anyone wails on me, I'm not saying everyone who says it is a homophobic arse.) It's not always "urgh gay people are /gross/ and /wrong/ and you all need to kill yourselves" homophobia, but "it's fine as long as I don't have to /see/ it" and "not in front of the children!" homophobia. It's this idea that gay people aren't quite as normal as straight people and shouldn't be out in the open, and it fucking sucks. Straight romances are shoved in our faces constantly on TV, books, adverts, walking down the street--gay people should be equally portrayed and those that don't like it need to deal with it.

*Just to be clear* I don't mind if people don't want to read slash. Requests are meant to be about our preferences and if you want to list slash alongside the do-no-wants then fine. I wouldn't consider it any different than my adding a request for no Harry/Hermione or something. But if you insist on adding that you're not homophobic my first thought is going to be, "Well if you're not, why did you feel the need to mention it?"
