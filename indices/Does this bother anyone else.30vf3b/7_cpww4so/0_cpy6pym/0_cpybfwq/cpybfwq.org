  I'm bisexual, and I've said things very similar. Are you going to call me homophobic?

Not necessarily, which is why I said "chances are". Though if you believe being bi makes you incapable of being homophobic you're mistaken.

It depends on the context obviously, if the spirit of the rest of the post is /"because I don't like those pairings"/ I don't see a problem with adding that little disclaimer to cover your ass from the spoiling-for-a-fight crowd, but if it's just a polite way of saying /"I don't like to see characterX as gay because fags/dykes are icky"/ then yeah, that's a bit fucked up, and adding /"I'm not a homophobe tho LOL"/ doesn't make it any less so.
