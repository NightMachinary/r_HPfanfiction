Personally I'd much rather have people say "I don't want to see characters I like being gay", because at least that doesn't feel like bullshit excuses. You're being honest about your preferences, and that's fine. Your real-world friends can deal with whatever that says about your lack or presence of homophobia. For people who say "it's not realistic".... It's like sandpaper. I can't stand it. Because that is that reader's opinion superimposed over everyone else, and telling them what they should or shouldn't find valid. "I don't enjoy reading about gay people" is about you and no one else, unlike "it's out of character!" Honestly, people who dismiss anything on the grounds of OOC absolutely baffle me. If you want them to behave exactly as they do in canon, then why on earth are you reading fanfiction. Anyway .-.

Can we spread the word to replace the words "no slash" with the word "het"?! I loathe when authors put "no slash" in summaries because it messes up my search results. If it's not slash, then I don't /want/ your story in my search results, so please don't include the word in your summary! Plus, I totally agree with [[/u/DandalfTheWhite]] about it being like answering a question no one asked. It makes me feel like the author is personally against being in any way associated with slash and really needs to chill.

Edit: So I just bumped into the post that prompted this thread .-.
