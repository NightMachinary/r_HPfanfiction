I think the only thing wrong with that quote is the "I'm not homophobic or anything..." part. I'm not interested in slash, but I'm also not going to bother explaining myself to strangers on the internet that I'm not homophobic either. Who cares what the people behind the bits thinks about my fanfiction choices?

However, to answer your question, no. It doesn't bother me for the reasons above.
