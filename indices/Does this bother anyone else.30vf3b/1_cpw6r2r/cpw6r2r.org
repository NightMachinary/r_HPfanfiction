I don't read slash ever. It's not that i'm homophobic, it's not that I have issues with gay people, it's just not something i'm interested in. Books for me are brilliant because you can see inside someone's mind and reading a book with a gay character doesn't bother me in the slightest if the character is just gay and it's a story.

I take issue with romance and gay characters. To me it's just not interesting, i'm straight and have no desire to read a gay love story because there's just not really anything there for me. Now like I said if the main character is gay and it's not entirely romance orientated that's wonderful and it's not an issue.

Unfortunately in fanfiction there's little point in making Harry gay if it's not going to be a romance story as otherwise it changes nothing. I'm not interested in reading about Harry wildly falling in love with Draco or whoever, I just don't care. I also won't read Hermione/Snape. I vaguely get the appeal, it's just not for me so I don't care about it.

Also Harry being gay would change very, very little unless it's a totally AU story it's the same reason i'll never read a Harmony story with no deviations from canon and many slash fics fall under one year stories that never go anywhere and skip most of the actual plot of the overarching series. On the other hand if the story is AU I don't see the point in Harry being gay and assume the author is and that's totally, totally fine and I get wanting to read about your sexuality (obviously from this post)...but it will likely lead to my next point...

I also have no desire to read a gay love scene, wouldn't read one on a fetish I wasn't into or one with an ex's name in the main story. It's just not something I want to read about from a POV perspective.

Most slash fics also have horrendously unrealistic pairings, i'm sorry but Drarry isn't happening even if they are both gay.

So all things considered it's just not worth checking out a slash story because I know there's going to be /something/ that I don't want to read in it. So when I ask for recs I ask that someone doesn't rec slash.
