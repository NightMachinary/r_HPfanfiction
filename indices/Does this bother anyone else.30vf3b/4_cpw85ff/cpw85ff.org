I only request it because I like the characters in this world, and I generally like for them to behave in character. There are no explicitly stated homosexual relationships in canon (other than an implied unrequited one-sided love for Grindelwald by Dumbledore) so I'm just not interested in reading them, unless it's a side relationship between OCs or someone whose sexuality is not explicitly stated.
