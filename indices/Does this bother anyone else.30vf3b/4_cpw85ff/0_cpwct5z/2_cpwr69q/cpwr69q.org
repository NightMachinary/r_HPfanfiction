Debating your word-choice, I hope you don't mind /;

Rant:

I think, Johnlock is practically canon, because it's acknowledged by the characters that John and Sherlock act like a couple sometimes, even though they're (theoretically) not.

Crowley/Aziraphale is practically canon, where they've been in each others' lives for 6000 years, have pet names for each other, go for dinner at the ritz together and feed ducks at the park together. And, especially, when they have other characters thinking they're /together/.

R/S, though, is a relationship between two best friends who have lost everyone else, and while the idea of them being in a relationship at some point in their lives is entirely possible and definitely dear to the hearts of many fangirls (and boys), it's not ever acknowledged in the same way by JKR. We never see Sirius and Remus going out for dinner or a walk just the two of them without the other marauders or order members, or at least I don't think we do (but I last read the books when DH came out).
