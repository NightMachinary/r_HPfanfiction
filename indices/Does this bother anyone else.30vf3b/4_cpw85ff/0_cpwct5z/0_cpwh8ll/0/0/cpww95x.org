Yeah, but saying "he could easily be X" is a far cry from "X is practically canon." I mean, Draco could easily have a sister that was never mentioned, too. Or, Sirius's middle name could easily be Trogdor.

Want to write a Sirius/Remus story? Go ahead - that's why fanfiction is a thing, so we can imagine a story in a different way. I just don't get why people feel the need to go all Twin Peaks on canon looking for evidence of H/Hr, S/L, evil!Weasleys, or whatever random fanon nonsense. If you're going to write S/L, just go for it. Do you own thing, reach for the stars! Just don't twist canon into a pretzel trying to "justify" it. It needs no justification - it's simply an AU and you get to change whatever you want via authorial fiat.
