No, I get that and I agree. I'm not one to say something is practically canon, but at the same time I don't like the idea of a single canon relationship completely nullifying the possibility of non-canon relationship. I get just as annoyed at the people who say "R/T is bullshit, R/S is true love forever!" as I do at the people who say "R/S is impossible, Remus married Tonks!" Just ship and let ship, y'know?
