Preference , i will not read anything slash for two main reasons :

I find it OC exept if it's dumbledore with a sensible partner.

More often than not is too graphic or too fluffy

Biggest reason of all it's not my cup of tea . I don't know how to explain , let me use an example : I'm all for gay copules but i won't purposely look at two people making out or shagging themselves silly. I know not all fanfiction is graphic , but you can be pro-gay without watching gay porn. I hope my point is clear enought.
