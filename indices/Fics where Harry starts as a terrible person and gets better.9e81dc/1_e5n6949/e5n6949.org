I second Kurinoone's series (as well as the above poster's evaluation of it.) I think most everyone has read it, but I'd also suggest /Brutal Harry/ linkffn(7093738) if you haven't.\\
It's not exactly what you're asking for, but it features a Harry who was tremendously affected by his treatment at the Dursleys' and has walled himself off (or attempted to wall himself off) from all emotion. There's also a sequel.
