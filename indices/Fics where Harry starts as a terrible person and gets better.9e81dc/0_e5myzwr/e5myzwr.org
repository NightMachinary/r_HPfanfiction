Writing quality of this starts off a bit rough, but by the end of the story it's perfectly good and well. Not to mention the sequels and fluff parts afterwards.

Keep in mind Riddle is altered a bit from his canon counterpart, as the series wasn't finished by the release of this fic. Still a wizard Nazi, obviously, just /slightly/ more humane due to actually raising Harry.
