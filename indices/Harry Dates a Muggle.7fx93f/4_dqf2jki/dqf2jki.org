[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): His muggle wife Ellie is a major character of the story and a force to be reckoned with. [[/spoiler][Especially after the conquest of Germany, she was fed up with his underhanded tactics and tried her best to exert her influence. Harry couldn't simply overrule her as she had the support of Neville, Sirius, and elder Potters, so he instructed his nefarious advisor Hughes to create 'diversions' all over the place. He went back in charge after Russia declared war on his empire.]]
