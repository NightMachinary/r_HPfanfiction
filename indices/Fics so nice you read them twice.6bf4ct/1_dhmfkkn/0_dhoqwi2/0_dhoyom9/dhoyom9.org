I absolutely love it for acknowledging where the originals left blanks in magic, and filling them in with the Devs as you said. I also find the politics of every book was handled well etc. And I just love the ending, it made me well up but that just shows that the characters were written well. This series absolutely is my head canon.

Also Alec is the best:

"Hey guys this book was written by Ernest Pupin." /Conversation ignores him and carries on for a paragraph or two/ "I could do with an ernestâ€‹ pooping."
