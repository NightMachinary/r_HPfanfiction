- linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh)\\
  My personal favorite fic, it's a very good read. The second read I had with wikipedia open, made for an extremely good read.

- linkffn(A black comedy by nonjon)\\
  Many jokes work on the second read, and while it wasn't as good, it was still enjoyable.

- linkffn(Oh God Not Again!)\\
