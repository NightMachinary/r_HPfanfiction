Sadly, the only Severitus I know are dad (biological or adopted) Snape, but, like you, I can't tolerate a story which just dismiss years of borderline hatred (if not downright). Nonetheless, I think the best rec I can make is this one:

linkffn(In Blood Only)\\
Best characterization and progression of a Severitus while keeping characters in characters. Summary is quite telling, and I think it's one of the best I can rec.

Honorable mention to linkao3(A Year Like None Other), although there was a bit of familiarity and bad blood brushed aside, but it is, nonetheless, very good too. If you feel amenable, I'd say to try it out too.
