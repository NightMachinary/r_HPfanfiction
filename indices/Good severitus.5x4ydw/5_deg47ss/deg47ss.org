probably the only Snape story I can think of ATM is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3160980/1/Hindsight][Hindsight]] by Loralee. there are other HP fictions with this title, but are not this one.

another is this:[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/Reboot][Reboot by Kallanit]] which is another of the Reptilia28 challenge, but it makes Snape a reasonably decent person. I recommend it.
