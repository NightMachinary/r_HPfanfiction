There are a couple of fics where the protagonist tries over and over but can't meaningfully change anything. They're less "fun" and more "nightmare fuel". Sisyphus by esama is one (but the bot never seems to find it properly), Getting the Hang of Thursdays is another, and perhaps Wastelands of Time.
