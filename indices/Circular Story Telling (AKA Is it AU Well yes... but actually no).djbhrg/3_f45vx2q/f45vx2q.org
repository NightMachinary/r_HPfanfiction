This is part of why I like Nightmares of Futures Past so much. The author seems to have properly thought things through, so things only stay the same if that's reasonably logical. Eg Barty Crouch Jr still sits behind Harry at the Quidditch World Cup (because there's no reason for his seating to change), but the Weasleys don't win the galleon draw and go to Egypt (because Harry has interacted with them a lot, so that gets butterflied away). And several times, Harry deliberately tries to change something from the first timeline, and somehow a variation on it still happens - and it freaks him out, wondering if there's some higher power working to keep the timeline on track.

Sticking with canon a bit too closely is the one thing that bothers me a little about Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions, but the author acknowledges up front that he considers time to be "sticky" and he writes well enough to more than make up for it.
