The sequel is decent quality, I would say about the same quality as Lack of Color. It is unfinished however, and he is a very slow updater, I don't think he's abandoned it yet, but it's not outside the realm of possibility, and you're going to be waiting a long time for it to finish if it is.

How have you liked the others so far? A Lack of Color was my favorite of those, besides Aorist, but the others are interesting in their own rights.
