[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]] and its sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24745156/chapters/59824753][mind the gap]], linkao3(8941561;24745156), are some of the best Harry/Ginny fics. They happen in a Muggle AU, so no Voldemort at all.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(10871795;4692717), are Hermione time travels to the Marauder Era. She took care of Voldemort early, so Harry gets to have a nice time later on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028), has no Voldemort, and Bellatrix becomes a cynical auror/detective, until she meets Hermione.
