He didn't quite never exist, but thus far Voldemort has not posed any threat to Harry at all in linkffn(Harry is a Dragon, and that's okay). Professor Quirrell? Stuck in the upgraded potions trap and abandoned by Voldemort. The basilisk? The diary was handed in to Dumbledore immediately, and the basilisk is now teaching Parseltongue to baby dragons. Peter Pettigrew? Found out by the kitsune twins, now rotting in Azkaban. Barty Crouch? Ambushed at the world cup by most of Harry's friends at once, also rotting in Azkaban. The Tournament? Proceeded perfectly normally, Harry helped operate a camera for the second task.
