linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3703435/1/Sighs-of-the-Neglected-Flower]]) - Harry uses Resurrection Stone at the same time as Lily and gets pulled to her dimension. Abandoned.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9504137/1/Hair-of-the-Grim]]) - This one is pretty nice. Drunken ritual results in Harry getting thrown back in time, taking over Sirius' body and getting his memories up to the 5th(?) year. Only 2 chapters, but it's still worth the read. Not updated in 2 years, but I really hope somebody will pick it up.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9762328/1/Throwing-Out-the-Script]]) - Judging by the writing up to this point it could be one of the better harem HP fics ever ever (at least I remember thinking so, I might've to reread it). Sadly, not updated in close to a year. As with Hair of the Grim, I'm still hoping somebody will pick it up or author returns to continue.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11517235/2/Dragon-Lily]]) - This one's a smut and not that great (or even good), but you can't be too picky when it comes to Harry/Lily fanfiction. Read if desperate, maybe you will like it.

I remember reading few more /readable/ Harry/Lily fics, but unfortunately I recently removed my Calibre library. I will post them when I find them.

One was definitely with Harry being his own father (don't remember how plausible that was), other with Harry making himself believe that Lily was Ginny and vice versa and some others that I can't remember premise of. They were pretty nice.
