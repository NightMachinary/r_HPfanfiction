There is no such thing as a "good idea", there is only "good writing". Anything can work if the writer knows what he's doing and everything can fail if the writer doesn't.

But yeah, I've once read a Naruto-fanfic about this specific idea. Where the main character crossed multiverses and met different versions of himself (including female ones). It can work, certainly.
