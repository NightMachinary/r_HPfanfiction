As has been noted, it's the writing and writer's skill that matter most. But an fundamental part of that is creating a good /story/ out of the /idea/. Note: they aren't exactly the same thing.

The original HP idea or premise is something like "there's a magical world hidden alongside our world" while the story is something like "orphaned kid has to grow up, suffer through adversity, and unlock the power the destroy the evil which killed his parents."

See the difference? The idea is rather vague and can have lots of different stories associated with it. The story is based on conflict and achieving some goal (one large, overarching one that is made up of lots of smaller, focused ones).

You've got an idea, but not quite a story. What's the central conflict that's motivating various characters' actions? What is the quest or goal that is driving the main character? What is our reason to care about whether they succeed or fail? Why is Harry Prime reading the books? What is he looking to achieve? How will he use any of his powers? What's your end goal?

People will start reading a fic that seems to have an interesting premise or idea, but they won't keep reading unless you demonstrate that you've created a good story on the basis of that idea.

Keep in mind that the idea you've articulated above is very complex and even convoluted. Usually they need to be somewhat simple, because the story is always more complex and detailed than the starting premise. And the more complex the story, the harder it will be write and the harder it will be to get and retain readers. It might be wonderful story, but even so, people will get frustrated or bored and drop it. I'd strip the basic premise down to what is absolutely necessary, then build the story from there, adding only what elements are necessary to develop the essential plot and character arcs.`
