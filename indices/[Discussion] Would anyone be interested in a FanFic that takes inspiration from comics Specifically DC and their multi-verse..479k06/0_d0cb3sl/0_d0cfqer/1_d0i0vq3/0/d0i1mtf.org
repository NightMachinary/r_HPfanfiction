I already have a rough outline done Thad goes through everything so typing it all out shouldn't take too long. My only worries is writing the dialogue, I'm really bad at that, along with figuring out a way to differentiate the multitude of Harry's. There's going to be chapters with five or more Harry s at one place interacting with one anther.
