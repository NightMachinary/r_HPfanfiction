Thank you for finally saying something that's not "There is no such thing as a 'good idea', there is only 'good writing.'"

The story's basically an exact copy of Super-boy Prime's story from DC comics except based off of the Harry Potter series. The central conflict will be first and foremost an evil Harry Potter that Harry Prime encounters during his universe hopping adventures. The driving motivation behind the evil Harry is that in his universe, a loved one (who won't be named until much further into the story) died seemingly out of nowhere. Her death, while unintentional, was directly caused by the actions/lack of actions taken by those the evil Harry called his friends and comrades. This led him to start a journey into Necromancy and other such dark arts which ultimately led to him being vastly more powerful than most of the other Harry Potters within the 52 unique universes.

The main character, Harry Prime, has to deal with not only figuring out a way back home, but also learning how to use his newfound magical abilities. Luckily, the first universe he traverses to is the canon universe where things aren't as messed up as the other universes. With his knowledge from reading the Harry Potter books, he and the Harry from that universe have an advantage over Voldemort and get rid of him in short order. Unfortunately, he has no idea how he initially crossed dimensions and has to find a way of doing so. My plan for this stage in the plot will be to leave Harry Prime to his devices while the narrative will shift to other Harry Potters.

Each new Harry Potter will take up to 5-10 chapters describing the point in time where their universe diverged and how they came to be the people they are today. Since each universe is different, some might be 20, 30, or even 60 years old. At the end of each mini-arc, the Harry in question will either wind up dead or be transported to another dimension while in the middle of an important event. For example, one of the Harry Potters will be in the middle of a rescue mission (Hermione was kidnapped and about to be used in a ritual) when as he suddenly sees Hermione, he disappears without a trace and she's sacrificed in the ritual.

Harry Potter, in Harry Prime's universe is considered to be the epitome of fictional writing. It is so popular that in that universe, J.K. Rowling decided to write 51 spin-offs to her original work with each having their own comic book adaptation, movie series, and even television series. At the start of my intended fanfic however, J.K. Rowling has just released her 50th spin-off to the Harry Potter franchise - with Harry Prime having just bought the newest issue before the events of this fanfic takes place.

Harry Prime was named Harry Potter because of his parents having the last name Potter and thinking it would be a good idea to name their son after their world's most famous fictional character. Don't worry, their names aren't Lily or James. Harry Prime's three main goals are as follows:

- Have fun - he just got the same magical potential as the characters he's been reading about for his whole life. He's going to do his best to learn as much magic as he can while enjoying it.

- Figure out a way home - while he may be in most avid Harry Potter fans' fantasy of being inside the Harry Potter world, he needs to get back home. He hopes with his newfound powers that he can prevent the tragedy which led to him having those very same powers in the first place.

- Figure out evil Harry's motivation and attempt to stop him - Harry Prime will eventually learn how to traverse through the multi-verse with apparent ease and discover that in many worlds, Harry Potter has either vanished without a trace or died a horrible gruesome death and realizes that he isn't the only Harry who has the ability to go to other dimensions.

My end goal is nearly the same as what happened in the DC comics. Harry Prime eventually BECOMES evil Harry. This might not make sense but it would be a lengthy process in the fanfic where we see glimpses of Harry Prime making decisions he wouldn't have earlier on and slowly becoming more and more focused on his goal before realizing that he himself, in the future, caused the initial tragedy. This might make zero sense but it's hard to explain without just writing the entire fanfic.
