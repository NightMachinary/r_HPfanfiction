thanks for the comments!!!

Definitely understand that from an audience perspective that it won't be well received! But I thought it will be nice to at least share the work in case there were slashcurious folks around.

I don't really have a strong replacement for A Most Disquieting Tea which doesn't have similar themes, so I'll just remove that entry for now until I get a chance to go through my notes again. Anyway I wasn't marking those as Beginner Friendly. I marked them as Experienced because of their complicated content.

I am changing the Primer to the Dark Arts link to Cursed Artifacts for Sale. this is a good point. The excerpt I quoted is actually from Cursed Artifacts!

I honestly didn't find more than 4/21 for the femslash fics for my criteria based on my reading. We should definitely as a fandom be creating and recommending more femslash content.

This is a subjective list so not good for any objective balance of fics! This is just 21 slash fics I selected from 21 years based on what I read. Nothing against Drarry but I don't want to be recommending anything I haven't read a ton of times!
