You can try hpfanficarchive it often has stories that are not in ffn or AO3

For instance the author Selector has a story called the Witches' Secret on fanfiction.net, the story is also found on Hpfanficarchive under his RotaryFile name. However, his story called Our Lady o'the Bless'd do over is only found on hpfanficarchive and not on fanfiction.net
