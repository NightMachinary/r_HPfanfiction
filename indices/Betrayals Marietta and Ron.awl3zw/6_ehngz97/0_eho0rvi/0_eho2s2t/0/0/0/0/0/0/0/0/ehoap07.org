Ron was wounded during a mission. Should we count how many times Harry was wounded during all his times in Hogwarts including confrontation with Riddle himself?

  Ron also has a family to worry about.

What? So is it alright for Harry and Hermione, because the first has his whole family killed already and the second had to erase herself from her parents memories to keep them safe? This is worst possible excuse, even not taking into account that Ron's family has more means to take care about themselves than Hermione's.

Getting together all your arguments: the war happened to be more difficult and dangerous than Ron thought when he agreed to accompany Harry and Hermione on the mission.
