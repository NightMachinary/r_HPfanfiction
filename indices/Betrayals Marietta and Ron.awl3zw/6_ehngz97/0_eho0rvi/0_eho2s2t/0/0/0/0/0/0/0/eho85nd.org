  Under the pressure of her parents Marrietta put several students under the risk of being expelled.

  She was permanently scarred for that.
#+end_quote

Was she permanently scarred? I can't remember. Either way, I've never defended Hermione for that. There were much more subtle ways of discovering traitors than that.

  (and let's not forget that under similar circumstances other two members of the team stayed and continued the mission).
#+end_quote

They circumstances were not similar. They all had to deal with the horcrux and living conditions, but that's it. *Ron was severely splinted and loss a ton of blood.*

#+begin_quote
  The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry's mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron's left side and his face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth.

  ............

  Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron's shirt. He had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this . . . His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron's up- per arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife. (Chapter 14)

Hermione couldn't fix the wounds completely by magical means either.

#+begin_quote
  “It's all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily. “There are spells that would put him completely right, but I daren't try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage. . . . He's lost so much blood already. . . .” (Chapter 14)

*Ron also has a family to worry about.* That's actually a big reason for the fight.

#+begin_quote
  “Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back away. “Didn't you hear what they said about my sister? But you don't give a rat's fart, do you, it's only the Forbidden Forest, Harry /I've-Faced-Worse/ Potter doesn't care what happens to her in here --- well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff ---”

  “I was only saying --- she was with the others, they were with Hagrid ---”

  “Yeah, I get it, you don't care! And what about the rest of my family, ‘the Weasleys don't need another kid injured,' did you hear that?” (Chapter 15)
#+end_quote

Ron circumstances are different from Harry and Hermione's.
