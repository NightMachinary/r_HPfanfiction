  Ron can't afford to give the horcrux hunt all of his attention. His ENTIRE family is on the front lines.

It just shows how he can handle pressure in mission critical situations. And it's not an excuse for leaving. Harry has literally weight of the whole Magical World on his shoulders.

  Even Hermione agreed with Ron on this front.

Hermione stayed, Ron left.

Ron did a huge mistake. During a war such mistakes often lead to people deaths. Statement "It's alright for others to die just because he's a human and worries for his family" isn't an excuse for me.
