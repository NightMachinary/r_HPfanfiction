  It just shows how he can handle pressure in mission critical situations.

There is no critical situation at this point. That IS the point. They are going weeks without finding anything. A fault that solely lies on Dumbledore's shoulders.

  Harry has literally weight of the whole Magical World on his shoulders.
#+end_quote

A weight that Hermione and Ron don't have to bear with him if they chose not to. However, they do.

#+begin_quote
  Ron did a huge mistake. During a war such mistakes often lead to people deaths. Statement "It's alright for others to die just because he's a human and worries for his family" isn't an excuse for me.
#+end_quote

His family, his blood loss, the horcrux, and the fact that he is told to leave.

At this point, you can either sympathize with Ron's plight or not. I just think that him and Marietta should not be in the same sentence. Ron is as loyal as they come. He has *two* fights with Harry in seven years. He's personally offered to sacrifice and/or has sacrificed himself for Harry or Hermione in at LEAST *three* separate occasions. (Chessboard, Sirius, Malfoy Manor). It's really not comparable at all.
