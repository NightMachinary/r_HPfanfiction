  Ron was wounded during a mission. Should we count how many times Harry was wounded during all his times in Hogwarts including confrontation with Riddle himself?

If you want. Harry comes out no worse for wear than Hermione or Ron usually do. I could argue that they usually come out worse than he does. (other than dying that one time. ok that's pretty bad.)

  What? So is it alright for Harry and Hermione, because the first has his whole family killed already and the second had to erase herself from her parents memories to keep them safe? This is worst possible excuse, even not taking into account that Ron's family has more means to take care about themselves than Hermione's.

Ron can't afford to give the horcrux hunt all of his attention. His ENTIRE family is on the front lines. From his parents all the way down to his little sister. That can certainly wear on a person mentally.

  Getting together all your arguments: the war happened to be more difficult and dangerous than Ron thought when he agreed to accompany Harry and Hermione on the mission.

Well as far as the hunt goes....yeah. Even Hermione agreed with Ron on this front. Ron told Harry during the their argument that he thought Dumbledore gave Harry more to go on than what they had. This is one of my biggest pet peeves about Dumbledore.
