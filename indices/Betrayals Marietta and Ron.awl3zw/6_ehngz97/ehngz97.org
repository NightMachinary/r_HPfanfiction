I think many people think Ron got off far too easy. That's one of the reasons we have so many Weasly/Ron bashing fics or fics where Ron gets the shaft in some way. For me he did not deserve to end up with Hermione. Now I'm a diehard Harmony shipper, but at the very least I'd think that Ron turning his back in DH would lead to an irrevocable break in trust. In my mind someone like Hermione can never get in a relationship again with someone like that. Friendship maybe, but not romance and certainly not so easily as in canon.

But I also think that in fourth year Harry has faced mockery and disdain for a long time when Ron comes around, so having a friend back is a big relief for him. For a person with few friends he might be much quicker to forgive. In DH it's a pretty desolate and desperate situation before and after Ron leaves. Him returning might bring enough solace to overlook certain things a little easier.
