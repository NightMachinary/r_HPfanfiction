  I think he got off too easy, but he's not a bad person.

This so much. Ron isn't some evil reincarnated with a pinch of Stalin's spirit. However, he does not handle pressure or his emotions very well and has rather questionable priorities. The Locket shows this very well. Instead of a "Dead Weasley Slideshow" like Molly's boggart, his biggest worry in the middle of a civil war is whether his best mate has shagged the girl he stormed away from. He should be begging for forgiveness, not worrying if Hermione sucked Harry's dick to put it bluntly.

I also don't like the undertone that there is just "the one" for everyone. And that this person happens to be your childhood sweetheart, but that's a different discussion.
