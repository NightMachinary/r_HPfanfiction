Interesting, if somewhat opinionated essay. I think the author makes a lot of good points, although some of the statements are mere facts that the author is referencing as opinion to prove a point. It's also missing some much needed balance since it argues from one stance only, dismissing all counterpoints as being signs of friendship. It also of course only covers the first five books. I think there are definite cases to be made one way or the other and the author provides very solid reasoning.

Although many won't consider it as canon, very understably so, the movies play a big role in Harmony. I think Emma Watson embodies the Hermione we see in a lot of fics more than book Hermione. And the movies really play up a possible Harry/Hermione pairing. Taking movie Hermione into consideration the possibility for the pairing becomes a lot clearer in my eyes, certainly compared to Harry/Ginny and Hermione/Ron.

But this argument has been done to death many times over. Luckily we have FanFiction to explore all the different options for us.
