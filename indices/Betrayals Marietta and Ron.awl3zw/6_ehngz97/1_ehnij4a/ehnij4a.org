I personally always found the Ron/Hermione ship to be really dubious. Their personalities clash horribly, and the only thing that really ties them together at all is everything they (and Harry) did in their adventures. I can, at best, see them try a relationship, but in the end realize that they really don't work well romantically together.

However, I'm not part of the Ron bash bandwagon -- I think he got off too easy, but he's not a bad person.

I personally don't ship Harry/Hermione, because it's pretty clear from the books that Harry never feels anything for her. They do, however, match decently personality-wise, so add romantic tension and the ship isn't implausible.
