Let's try not to forget one thing. Ron did not leave Harry and Hermione to go and report them to the Death Eaters. He just left, arguably to get a little space, and found himself unable to return, fought off a band of snatchers and spent every waking our trying to go back. Marietta could have just quit the DA. Nobody would fault her. But there was nothing pressuring her to report them.

Ron abandoned them, and even then there are factors to consider like the horcrux's influence and his Intentions. But Marietta betrayed them.
