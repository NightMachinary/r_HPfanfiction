Marietta probably has the scars because she believes she DESERVES THEM!

Magic in HP after all has an emotional component and if she even partially believes she deserves the pimples etc. then her magic will reinforce them and fight their removal! Frankly IMHO the scars/pimples etc. would only fully go away if she thinks herself redeemed!

As for the actions: Marietta could have simply lied (or not said anything at all and all would have been hunky-dory!), but she actively went to Umbridge!

Ron (as much as I despise this waste of perfectly good air and space!) was just an immature jealous asshole (and under the mental influence of the 'crux the second time he betrayed Harry), but he didn't go out of his way to snitch to professors and endanger dozens of students etc.
