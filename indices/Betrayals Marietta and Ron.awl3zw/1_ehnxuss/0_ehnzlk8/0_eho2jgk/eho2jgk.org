  What does it tell about Ron when he abandons it just because of an argument?

What does it tell about Harry when he spends his time wondering about Dumbledore's past and fantasizing about the Hallows for weeks and weeks, during the mission that decides the outcome of the whole War?

And let's not forget, during that period, Ron was showing much more leadership, strategy, and motivation, than Harry himself. So I'd say that he more than made up for whatever alleged wrong he did back in mid-autumn.
