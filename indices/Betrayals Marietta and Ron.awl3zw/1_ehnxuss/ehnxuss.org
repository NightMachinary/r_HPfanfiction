Because Ron did NOT "betray" Harry. Both of these were simple misunderstandings between best friends, the second one exacerbated by the Horcrux. That, and also the fact that Harry explicitly told Ron to leave at least twice. How is it that when Ron follows his orders, he's now an evul betrayer? Also, you forget that Ron wanted immediately to come back, but he wasn't able to because of the Snatchers, and by the time the danger had passed, Harry and Hermione had already left. This was more akin to Ron wanting to getting out of the house to get some fresh air after an argument, rather than intentionally deserting them for months.

And even with respect to /Goblet of Fire/, I'd say that it is /Harry/ who acted worse. As I've written here before, it is canon that the only one who cared about the "death toll" aspect of the Tournament, prior to the Goblet selecting the names, was Hermione. Both Ron and Harry explicitly expressed interest in entering before their fight. For example, Ron thinks that it would be "cool" to enter, and Harry agrees, with images of winning and Cho "showing admiration" in his mind.

Ron isn't aware of any plot targeting Harry (and Harry doesn't even bother to tell Ron of the potential plot brewing against him), he just has Harry's previous comments about the Tournament to go on. Harry expressly states how he would have done it and when Harry's name pops out of the Goblet, unfortunately Ron thinks Harry betrayed him. Harry doesn't even bother to say why he feels that someone would want to kill him, so Ron has nothing to go on.

Ron is clearly trying to be happy for Harry. But when Ron repeats Harry's own words back to him, Harry implies that Ron is stupid. It is only after Harry reacts less than positively that Ron gives up trying to actively support his friend. even when they are not talking, Ron is very concerned about Harry. When Harry breaks the conversation off with Sirius, it is Harry who overreacts: he decides he hates everything about Ron, throws a badge at his head and doesn't apologize for it, starts shouting at him, and storms upstairs to the dormitory. Ron just stands there and takes it.

And if we're to talk about "betrayal", that is actually Ron's main emotion during the fight (not jealousy, as Hermione asserts, which may actually have inadvertently prolonged the fight, given that after what Hermione said, Harry no longer wants to talk sense into Ron, but instead prefers to play the retrenchment card). Ron clearly wanted to "go-it-together" and to attempt with Harry to place both their names in. But that doesn't happen, and so Ron does not expect Harry's name to come out. Had they actually did it together, like Ron wanted, and Harry's name still came out, do you really think we would have seen the fight?

Ron obviously was wrong about what truly happened, but it definitely wasn't a betrayal.
