I don't think that's a good comparison.

Ron made decisions for himself. You can say that makes him a bad friend or an idiot, but it's not betrayal in the way of Marietta. If Ron had left, found some Snatchers, and then pointed those Snatchers in Harry's direction, that would be Ron pulling a Marietta.

Marietta had the right to leave the group, decide they're all crazy and call Harry a gloryhound. She took it farther though. She decided to turn the group in, reveal their secrets, and possibly get them all expelled. She didn't just 'turn her back'. She stabbed them in the back. Sure, it's a school club, but it's a school club that was created to help them defend themselves from a bunch of murderers. It's a school club that brought people together when Voldemort took control and contributed fighters to the Battle of Hogwarts. It seems like defending Marietta often starts with dismissing the importance of the DA because it's a 'school club', but it was important. She deliberately sabotaged something important.
