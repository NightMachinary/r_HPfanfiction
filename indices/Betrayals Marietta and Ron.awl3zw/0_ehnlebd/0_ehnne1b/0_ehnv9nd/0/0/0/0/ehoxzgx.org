The Ministry six managed to significantly delay the best of the inner circle while outnumbered 2:1. The trio dealt with the Death Eaters at the cafe with relative ease.

I'm not suggesting that the DA starts hunting Death Eaters, but the abilities you learned there would allow you and your family to escape against most Death Eaters. And then get out of the country.
