"HP universe" is also a children book series. The Good side won by default. Let's not use this logic and any foreknowledge.

In the 5th book Harry was just a student who taught some useful spells, nothing more. Yes, some of them were quite advanced, but it general he was under any good 6th or 7th year student.

If fact, in the 6th book he struggled with the DATA course. Yes, may be it's was because of Snape, but it also shows that he can't control his emotions in the serious fight and therefore not reliable in it.
