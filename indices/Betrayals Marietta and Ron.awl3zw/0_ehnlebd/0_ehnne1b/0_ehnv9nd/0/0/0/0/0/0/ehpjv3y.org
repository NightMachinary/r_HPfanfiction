Losses are surprisingly light all things considered. Even without the plot device, by the end only Voldemort is left standing. If you want an example for bad Death Eater skills, the Centaurs should have been slaughtered to the last fighter by even a few competent wizards.

And the Ministry was the best of the best, who should have wiped the floor with the order pretty easily, yet we only see Bellatrix do so.
