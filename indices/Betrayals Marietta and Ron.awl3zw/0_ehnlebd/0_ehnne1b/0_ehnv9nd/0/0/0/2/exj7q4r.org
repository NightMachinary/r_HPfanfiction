As if most DEs (we aren't talking about the inner circle here!) are actually any good in a fight! Most of them are badly trained (they only have defense lessons from school and no formal training!) cannonfodder!

Hell, even the Inner-Circle didn't look all that good when fighting Harry and the others at the ministry (sure they didn't want to damage the prophecy-orb, but frankly why they didn't summon it and then stomp the "children" is beyond me, unless they aren't all that great in a fight!)
