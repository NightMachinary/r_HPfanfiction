Plenty of countries are proud of their teenage fighters. Just look at the Polish Home Army (Warsaw Uprising) or the French Resistance. There's a huge difference between pressing children into action like some African warlord and teenagers voluntarily taking up arms for their country. Also, by the time of the Battle of Hogwarts, most of the fighting DA was 18 or older, so they are not child soldiers by any definition.
