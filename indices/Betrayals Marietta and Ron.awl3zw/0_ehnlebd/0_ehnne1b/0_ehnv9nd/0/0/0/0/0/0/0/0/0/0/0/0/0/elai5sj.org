Agreed!

Them needing the DA shows how BADLY the war had gone for the "light" side! Their leaving the bad guys alive and firing stunners, instead of killing curses didn't pay off! Even more so if you take into account that the average Deatheater is also quite crappy if you compare them to say a Delta-Force Soldier (or the SAS/SBS)!

Normally, without the "Idiot Ball" the good guys (they had the Aurors, which are at least somewhat trained, not to mention the veterans from the first war) should have won!

Fact however is that they didn't!

In fact without the DA (despite them fighting without any tactics! Seriously, I was never a soldier but even I know about choke-points, crossfires, ambushes, high-ground, fortifications, kill-boxes (a place with very effective crossfire of multiple weapons), force-multipliers (like the mentioned mandrake or magical-explosives) etc. etc. - ok, I do have an interest in military arms and tactics and I play strategy-games, but it's not like I truly studied military-tactics! Learning about this takes less than an hour and it can be easily implemented even with wands instead of machine-guns!), they'd have LOST!

So yeah, Marieatta's betrayal could be taken as helping Voldemort (indirectly and without wanting to, she isn't on his side after all!), because with the DA out of the picture? They lose! Hell, I doubt that Harry can't take most of the fifth and sixth years in a fight! They might know some more spells, but then again: So does Hermione and Harry would still obliterate her in an open confrontation!

As for her disfigurement: I think it's her own magic reinforcing the curse (she believes she deserves her punishment deep down! That's why she can't be healed/cured!), otherwise I bet a cursebreaker could lift the curse (it's not like Hermione is at Voldemort's level (DADA-Curse!) - far from it in fact!)
