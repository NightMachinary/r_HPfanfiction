Except that most of the Ministry was collaborating and the DA was direly needed as manpower. Most people seemed to be alright with Voldemort's reign. There was no open rebellion outside of the Order.

Their biggest mistake was not properly defending the walls. I mean, Mandrakes are supposedly lethal to anyone who hears their cry. So all you'd need is a single one to wipe out the entire human opposition.

Next comes the utterly wasted advantageous position. Hogwarts is a fortified hilltop with hundreds of yards of open ground surrounding it, with bridges possibly even funneling the enemies. All the defenders had to do was throw area of effect spells in the general direction of the Death Eaters and their assault would be stopped. Blow the bridges while the Death Eaters are on them for even easier carnage. Honestly, at least some of the defenders ought to know that kind of basic tactics. Tonks and Kingsley were trained Aurors. McGonagall had fought in the first war, Flitwick was a duelling champion. But their leadership was utterly abysmal. The only one who had the right idea was Sprout, but even she failed to utilise her "easy mode" weapon. Yes, the other side has magic as well, but the Death Eaters did not go into Battle with hearing protection and by the time they would have noticed the danger it would already be too late. You don't even have to throw the mandrakes over the battlements. Wait till the Death Eaters reach the gates, make one cry and GG, you just wiped out most of Voldemort's forces.
