Again, you can argue however you want, by the Battle of Hogwarts the DA was no longer made up of child soldiers. Their training was considerably better than most armies had throughout history since they had 6 years of defence lessons and the DA.

You can use the DA to shit on the rest of magical Britain for their inaction, but that is a different topic.
