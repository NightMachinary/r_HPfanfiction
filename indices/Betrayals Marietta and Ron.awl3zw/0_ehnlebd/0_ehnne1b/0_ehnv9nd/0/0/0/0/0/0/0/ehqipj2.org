If we remove “idiot ball” from the series, we won't have the series to talk about. In the canon Death Eaters were feared even with absence of Riddle. Harry didn't taught others to fight for their lives, he taught just some useful spells, nothing more. Any Auror would wipe the floor with him, he was advanced, but still a 5th year student.

It is unreasonable to suppose that he gave something critical to survival. For example, how does the Shield Charm protects from Avada or Crucio?

You know there's a possibility that Harry involuntarily guilty for students deaths during the Final Battle. If they didn't played fake heroes, escaped and left to (ex) aurors to deal with DEs after Riddle is gone, there were fewer deaths.
