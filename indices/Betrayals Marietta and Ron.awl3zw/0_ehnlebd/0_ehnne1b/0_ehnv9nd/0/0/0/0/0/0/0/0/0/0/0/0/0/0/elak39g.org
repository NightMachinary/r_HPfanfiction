Funny things about the Battle of Hogwarts:

- The light side has 50 losses to mourn. Even adding the remaining order and the DA, you fail to reach that number. Which means they called forth more fighters who pretty much just came there to die and did nothing noteworthy it seems (other than dying).

- By the time of the final showdown, only Voldemort and Bellatrix were left. So somehow, after being soundly defeated and only spared by Voldemort's ceasefire, the light side won the day.

- Therefore, the most effective weapon seems to be arrows, followed by kitchen utensils. One cannot help but wonder what would have happened if the defenders had access to some real weapons like machine guns or mortars, nevermind some of the more cruel tools of war (gas shells for artillery, napalm, ToT artillery barrages). Hell, I'd pay good money to see the Winged Hussars charge down the Death Eaters.
