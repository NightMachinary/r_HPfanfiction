Marietta is preventing the only effective training the Hogwarts students can get. Which can easily lead to a lot of dead families if we look at the average Death Eater and their mediocre combat ability. And everyone at the DA knew that Voldemort was back.

And that still does not explain why Marietta sells them out. "I am not coming anymore, my Mum might lose her job" would already cut it. But no, she goes to Umbridge and sells the DA out to the woman who has been torturing students and enforced arbitrary rules with an iron fist.
