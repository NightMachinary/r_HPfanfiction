As could Marietta's! No DA = Lost Battle of Hogwarts = Voldemort the immortal ruling forever and ever (unless someone rises to fight him and pull of a victory!)

As for "teenager under pressure": She was away from her parents for years (boarding school kids tend to mature faster) and in control of her life (sure she had to attend school, but otherwise she was pretty much free as long as she wasn't breaking the rules there), so she could have simply stayed away (return the DA-Coin and be done with it!)
