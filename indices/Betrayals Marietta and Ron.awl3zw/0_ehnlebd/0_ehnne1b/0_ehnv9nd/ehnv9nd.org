But Umbridge did not know that Marietta was a member. Marietta thought it would earn her some good girl points. Whatever her mother and Umbridge had going on, it was not related to the DA. That's why her betrayal was so severe.

She was not under pressure, she betrayed the DA in the hopes that it might help her mother keep her job in the Politburo, fully knowing what kind of people she was selling the DA to. I mean, Harry wasn't wearing gloves 24/7 and neither was Lee. Everyone could imagine what would happen should the DA be revealed to the woman who tortured her students over disagreeing with her and the +Party+ Ministry.
