  Why are Marrietta's scars justified, but Ron's actions were swept under the rug?
#+end_quote

Because Ron is a primary character whereas Marietta is a one appearance mook.

Nobody cares about Marietta (although the contract is very frequently used to bash Hermione when an author is out to get her), whereas a rift in the trio has big plot implications.

That said, the acne scars (were they really permanent? I don't remember that) are way too much punishment, and IMO Ron's punishment should have simply been being cut off from H&H's confidence for good (I wouldn't have taken him back, how do you trust him after that? Especially if you think it's the horcrux's fault, considering there were more to gather). It's not like he was duty bound to help them or anything, it was his choice of having confidence in his friends or not.
