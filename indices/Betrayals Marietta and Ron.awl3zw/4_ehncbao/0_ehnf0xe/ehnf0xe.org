Yes, I like Ron, but even I would have not let him back after that. NOT because of bashing or hating him or whatever, but because as a precaution against it happening again since he has clearly shown that he cannot HANDLE Horcruxes. It would be a risk having him back if it could influence him like that again - or worse. Like getting him to actually attack Harry, which I think Harry thought Ron would do with the sword when he saw his red eyes.
