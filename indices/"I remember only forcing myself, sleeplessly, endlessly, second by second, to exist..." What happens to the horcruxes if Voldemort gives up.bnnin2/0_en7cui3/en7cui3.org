  "That's a problem we're going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing or crushing a Horcrux won't do the trick. You've got to put it beyond magical repair."

  "But even if we wreck the thing it lives in," said Ron, "why can't the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?"

  "Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being."

  Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on, "Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn't damage your soul at all."

  "Which would be a real comfort to me, I'm sure," said Ron.

  "It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched," said Hermione. "But it's the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can't exist without it."

The soul pieces will stay inside and stuck to the soul vessel until the vessel itself is destroyed beyond magical repair. If it isn't, then it hangs around for eternity. That's the whole point of putting a soul piece into a vessel/phylactery.

I don't think it's in character for Voldemort to "give up". He doesn't give up. He is obsessed with immortality and viscerally afraid of the Next Great Adventureâ„¢. Even if his main soul piece is destroyed, killed, shoved through the Veil, etc, nothing will change the state of the horcruxes unless they are found and destroyed too. The horcruxes' entire purpose is to just... exist.
