I do think that what would have happened to Voldemort Prime if he had "given up" would be that he have lost his grasp of the mortal plane and gotten mired in limbo. This wouldn't have done anything in particular to the Horcruxes, I think --- continuing with the metaphor of the anchor, just because the tether that binds the anchor to the boat has been severed, doesn't mean the anchor is going anywhere.

  Could then any of the Horcrux soul pieces come back, only the Diary due to special enchantments, or no because again the main/true soul is departed and the fragment/anchor is stuck.

The Diary was optimized to possess people by Voldemort, but I think that any Horcrux could have done it given the chance. The Locket definitely seems to be in the process of taking over Ron when he pulls himself together and destroys it.
