Just saw Wicked last week and was thinking about it / looked at what was on offer. There are a few written but I didn't see anything "good". A lot of room for possibilities though. Would love to see an Elphaba / Hermione merged character. Perhaps an Elphaba is Hermione's mom... a Dermatologist! A HP raised by Elphaba / Fiyero has some great potential (Like they end up in Surrey after leaving Oz, rescue the poor abandoned child, so on). But yeah... of the few listed I didn't see anything worthwhile.
