You've probably read [[http://www.skyehawke.com/archive/story.php?no=2226][A Thousand Beautiful Things]] by Duinn Fionn. If you haven't...Lucius curses Harry and, after he dies, the curse manifests as Harry being extremely violent/insulting to everyone in the vicinity when the sun sets. Draco takes on the task of curing the curse. It's extremely wonderful.
