You could try aspeninthesunlight's immensely long A Year Like None Other trilogy - [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036][link to first story here]]. It's a long fic in which through various circumstances Snape ends up adopting both Draco and Harry. From memory, there is an incident (trying not to spoil) with Voldemort from which Harry is left terribly injured and Snape and Draco care for him afterwards. This is a large part of the story arc. Fic is very long but stick with it, it's worth it.

I'm not a fan of adoption stories normally but this fic is truly something special and there are no words to describe just how strongly I recommend it. Possibly the best fic I've ever read. Go read it :)
