[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1664852/1/Circumstance][Circumstance]] has Snape falling ill from a curse, and while the story is not about Harry nursing him back to health, they have to travel together. Although, Snape doesn't get cursed until around a couple chapters in (iirc). It's a pretty good story, in my opinion, and it gets better closer to the end.
