Dumbledore stood there in shock trying to figure out what the hell was going on.

"Can you say that again. At my age hearing tends to go out you know, surely that's what it is."

"I said I sold the brat the next day after we got him to some Russian Mobsters to pay off a bad loan."

Dumbledore could only facepalm as he spoke his mind.

"Bugger!"

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The Vladimir Putin Academy of Patriotism was a world famous magic school for a few reasons. Firstly it was the only one ran by a muggle head of state. Secondly they were the only one to accept only muggleborn or muggle-raised students. Thirdly they had the strangest entrance test anyone had heard of, namely drinking a bottle of vodka and not making being a quote unquote Little Bitch About It. Lastly they only accepted first year students from ages 5 to 8.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Dmitri Popov, Harry Potter was a western slave name after all, smiled as he looked down at the beaten and broken man below him.

Instructor Maxim had tried to tell him conjuring bears was not an effective strategy for defeating an enemy.

As Instrutor Maxim was currently having his limbs being eaten by said bears Dmitri knew he had won that argument.

Raising a deflty conjured bottle of Vodka he jumped onto the desk and took a squat.

"You see comrades, Instrutor Maxim lost sinply because he did not have enough faith in the Glorious Motherland!"

Taking a swig the Transfiguration class broke into cheers. Truly Comrade Dmitri was so slav he had blew past the gopniks and went straight to pure manliness.

Squat jumping onto the back of a bear he waved his vodka bottle forward screaming about death to capitalism. The class conjured their own bears, they had just seen about a dozen examples of how to do it, following him out the school.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Dumbledore was sitting in the waiting room when something caught his eye. One of those muggle TVs was showing something happening in Moscow.

A group of 30 or so young boys were riding on the backs of bears drinking vodka. They had stormed a military base and were presumed to be trying to get some tanks to work.

He had laughed at the silliness of muggles until on of the faces was shown close up. Those green eyes and scar gave away everything he needed to now.

Excising himself from the office he hurried away apparating to the portkey office.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Dmitri stood upon the front of the tank sword in one hand vodka bottle in the other.

The wind was causing his track suit to press against him making him look even better. Of course the bear sitting on it's butt beside him downing vodka from a bucket only helped.

His smile widened as the tank operator drove over an American made FORD. The screams of the capitalist loving traitor crushed inside ensured him he was doing the right thing.

A Lada pulling a band behind them on a trailer pulled up and began playing some serious beats.

Dmitri waved his Vodka bottle at them and they soon had a pile of vodka bottles at their feet.

The music picked up as the wizards kept conjuring petro for the tanks and the Lada.

They had ran over several dozen ministry of magic thugs and they had no intention of slowing down.

He summoned a giant illusion of Comrade Putin that led them across town. His heart smiling as there few tanks were joined by hundreds, thousands, and millions of vehicles from across Russia.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Vodka poured from the skies as the pride of Russia rolled through Paris. The unintentional Russian war machine had rolled over all of Europe in days.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Dmitri woke a blindly reached out for a bottle of vodka. Taking a swig he looked around and realized somehow he was on the moon in a domed military base.

Taking a hard look at his bottle of vodka he shrugged before downing it.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Hel'Op'I'Ksty The Fifth Orchestra Leader heard the report in given in pure terror. Already the Vodka Plague had spread across eights of galaxies. That it was already here meant it was surging faster.

The first drop of Vodka rain hit his outstretched tasting array. Suddenly he was filled with visions of war bears and heavy metal music. Seeing as his sketches didn't have any form of vision it wad disconcerting.

Screaming about the Glory of Communist Mother Russia he began attacking everyone that refused to accept the blessings of Vodka.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

Enjoy, got weird quick.
