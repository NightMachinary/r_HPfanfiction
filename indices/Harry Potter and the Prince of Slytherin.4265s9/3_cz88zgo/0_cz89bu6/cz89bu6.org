I've read quite a few stories where Harry has some form of sibling or twin, and most of them are terribly written. Characters do things that make no sense and they all seem to have the exact same plot. This story though really has some well development characters that don't seem to follow this exact trend. It may not seem so at first so I would say read like the first 10 chapters and hopefully you'll like and read the rest.
