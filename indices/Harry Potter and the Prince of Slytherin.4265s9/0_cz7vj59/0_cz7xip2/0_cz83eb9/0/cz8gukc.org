It should be noted that the author is actively /subverting/ a number of popular tropes. Obviously this doesn't mean that you'll love it or anything, just that you should try to hold back knee-jerk reactions to seeing certain things you associate with bad fics.

I'll confess that I have a certain amount of sympathy for trying to take old tropes in new directions, or at least treating them in new ways. I do the same with sould bonds, manipulative Dumbledore, and helpful goblins. Such stories might have gotten a lot better reception five or ten years ago before the tropes were run into the ground and started annoying everyone. On the other hand, sometimes such things need to be used until they're worn out before a different or unusual perspective can be appreciated.
