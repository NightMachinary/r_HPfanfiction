My ships are all over the place, I am WAY too easily persuaded. One person convinces me to ship Romione then I come across a Harmony shipper and they present an even better argument so I switch and then someone persuaded me to ship Hinny. I shipped every ship that not's slash or seriously messed up like Dobby/Sorting hat or Voldemort/Hermione.
