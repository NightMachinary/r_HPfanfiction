When I started reading HP fanfictions, I had minimal opinions on ships -- the one ship that comes to mind that I disliked even back then was Remus/Tonks, because to me it always seemed to be an objectively bad match given their interactions. As for fanon ships, I had no "special" opinions -- however, there has always been ships I've shied away from due to the mere idea of it sounding very dubious. An example of this would be Harry/Voldemort.

Over time, I developed some opinions on some ships. For example Ron/Hermione -- before I started reading fanfiction, I was indifferent to this ship. A result of reading various fics, alongside reexamining canon, led me to the opinion that it's a rather questionable match -- they seemed to spend the most of their interactions fighting about pretty much everything. Ultimately, my view on the ship is simply; I can see them try a relationship (because they clearly have feelings for each other) but I can't see it go anywhere longterm.

I think my biggest change of opinions of a ship is Jily. Before I started reading fanfics, my opinion of the ship was basically "seems like a decent enough match", I had rather little opinions beyond that. As I started reading fics, especially Marauder-era fics, I started to notice a theme: once James became a teenager (3rd year), he notices Lily and starts pursuing her. She is uninterested, and her responses get progressively more harsh as James simply doesn't stop bothering her. The fact that he kept harassing her friend for personal amusement didn't exactly help his case. Ultimately Lily caves in 7th year with them both being Head Boy/Head Girl, and because nobody else even tried due to James' relentless pursuing. I saw this in several fics, and most of the fics, being pro-James didn't really seem to consider this behaviour a problem. I did, and given how common this setup was, I started disliking Jily as a result and started to consider it a negative fic trait. Eventually, in an unrelated SS-centric fic reading spree, I developed a major interest in Snily, which, while not strictly a strike against Jily, reduced my interest in the ship indirectly further as a result. Then I read Veritas Omnia Vincit, a Severitus fic, which easily has the worst portrayal of James I've seen while still not making him utterly one-dimensional and thus leaving me unable to take him seriously, and portrays emotionally abusive Jily. This fic ultimately turned a ship that I was already disliking for other reasons, into a ship I couldn't stand at all, and for a while it became part of my "to be avoided at all costs" list (alongside stuff like Harry/Voldemort). Eventually I forced myself to read some fics that has it anyway, due to how common it is and me not feeling like removing a large chunk of the fanfiction archive, and I'm able to stomach it again -- as long as it isn't a main-focus of the fic, and my feelings on Jily hasn't really recovered since.
