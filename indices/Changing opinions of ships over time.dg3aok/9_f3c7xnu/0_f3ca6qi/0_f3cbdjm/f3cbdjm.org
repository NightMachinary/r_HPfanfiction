While I haven't really read a fic doing this, it's one of the more plausible ways of them ending up together that I've considered myself (with or without previously existing romantic affections for SS) -- but also one I find rather disturbing. As in, "James, in the process of trying to win Lily, gets rid of Snape, only to swoop up and 'comfort' her in the fallout". Worse is, James actually does this /twice/ -- he (and Sirius) is ultimately also the last straw in the breakdown of the Lily-Petunia relationship, by playing a magical prank during the Dursley wedding.

At this point, if I want to read a Marauder story, I'd much rather read one where Lily either isn't shipped at all, or is shipped with Remus (while my preferred person to ship Lily with is SS, that lends itself to a non-Marauder focus and thus not really useful in this case).
