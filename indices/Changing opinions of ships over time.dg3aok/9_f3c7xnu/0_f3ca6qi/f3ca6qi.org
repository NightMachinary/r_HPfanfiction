Eh I guess you don't like that kind of romance.

I don't think it is realistic either.

But I wonder if there are any Jily fics with a different set up? Where Lily found James annoying for a reason not even she could explain and disliked him until her view was completely changed when she saw James doing something extremely kind that was completely out of the ordinary. Or maybe they were in a playful prank war and others thought they hated each other? Or maybe one where she had a crush on Snape for the first few years and it dissolves when Snape calls her a mudblood and here she is very heartbroken until James comes and tries to comfort her - she gets angry at this as James was the one bullying Snape but soon in her eyes James proves himself to her. There are just so many set ups, and I am rubbish at romance, someone else think of other set ups.
