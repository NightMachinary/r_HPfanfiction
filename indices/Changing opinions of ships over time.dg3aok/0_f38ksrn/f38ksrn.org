For me I started out liking Drarry because of a well written fic I believe. And for a long while that was my otp but eventually I think I just got burnt out from reading too much. I don't hate it or anything but I dont go searching for it anymore. I'll still read a Drarry fic if the plot sounds interesting and it's well written. I'm actually reading one right now
