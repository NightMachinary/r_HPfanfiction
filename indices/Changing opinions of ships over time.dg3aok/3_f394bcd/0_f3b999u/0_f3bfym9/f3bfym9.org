That's the Slytherin Ginny one, right?

Does it have any of the following:

- R/Hr?

- Harry getting assimilated into the Weasley family?

- Positive depictions of Snape, Voldemort or Draco Malfoy?

- Hermione bashing?

- Positive depictions of Lupin, Lupin/Tonks?

Because that's my no-go list. And let me tell you, trying to find a Harry/Ginny fic without any of those has proven impossible so far (at least for non-explicit stuff)
