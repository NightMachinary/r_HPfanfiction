That's oddly quite a specific list? I can see why you struggle to find Hinny fics, but I'm curious why you're sticking to that criteria so much.

The Changeling is indeed the Slytherin Ginny one, and I'd say it doesn't have any of those elements. The only exception is maybe Harry and the Weasley family, but that's more just following canon. The sequels will have the R/Hr and the Weasley family stuff, but I'm not sure it's at all possible to avoid the Weasley family if you have Harry dating one of them.

I was more thinking of the author's standalone fics which are not based on her Slytherin!Ginny universe. 'gone was any trace of you' probably has slight trace amounts of Weasley family and R/Hr bits but mostly focuses on the Hinny relationship.

I could have sworn there was another fic I had in mind about Harry and Ginny being Quidditch stars and having a FWB relationship that turns into something more, but I can't find it now for some reason.
