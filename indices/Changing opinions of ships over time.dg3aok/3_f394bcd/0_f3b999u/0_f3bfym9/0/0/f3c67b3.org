  but I'm curious why you're sticking to that criteria so much.

Because any of those is a reason to immediately close the tab. I'm struggling to decide which was the more unconvincing relationship, Ron/Hermione who had way too much water under the bridge IMO or the trainwreck Lupin and Tonks were in. Which is the reason why I can't stand positive depictions of Lupin, as he was not there for either Harry or his wife.

At the same time, I like Hermione and therefore don't like fics which bash her any more than those who bash Harry's parents (WBWL, Snilly). And disliking Malfoy, Snape and Voldemort needs no further explanation I think.

  but I'm not sure it's at all possible to avoid the Weasley family if you have Harry dating one of them.

I think it's quite easy, especially after the war. Fred's death and/or Molly's overbearing nature would be enough to write a falling out.

  Harry and Ginny being Quidditch stars and having a FWB relationship that turns into something more

Was it the one where Ginny decided to randomly bring Harry to a family dinner or am I thinking of something else.
