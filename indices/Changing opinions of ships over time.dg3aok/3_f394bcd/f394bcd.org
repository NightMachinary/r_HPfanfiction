I came into HP fanfics looking for a "better" Harry/Ginny romance and more depth for her. And the first few fics I've read were great, but then the next few were exactly the same, and, after realising that I have ended up in trope hell and coming across a few better-written fics, my interest in H/G steeply declined.

That's not to say that I don't ship them, but I have yet to find an H/G fic with an actual plot which I enjoy. There is always some element I don't enjoy, the figurative hair in the soup. Most notably the Big Weasley family with 5413451453 children (to me, that would be in-law hell), R/Hr and Hermione bashing.
