I grew up as a Dramione shipper because Tom Felton was incredibly cute in the movies, and my teenage angst fell in love with the bad boy trope.

Now having grown up a bit, I enjoy Hinny fics mostly because the big-name authors seem to be fairly mature and portray a loving and emotionally stable relationship that my adult ass craves. It's like, the wish fulfilment went from wanting a more exciting life to just wanting a nice, loving and stable home life. Something about how they seem to get each other, how they portray a strong front but can get emotionally vulnerable with each other, and how bad ass Ginny can be while also pursuing a more light hearted career just seems very attractive to me.

Not gonna lie though, I have a soft spot for Hermione/Fred because Fred reminds me most of my current boyfriend. They're always goofs, trying to make people laugh and at times crossing a line (U-No-Poo anyone?) but in private seem like such a gentleman. I've become a sucker for the Joker with a soft side since I've started dating my boyfriend. Unfortunately I've run out of quality fics for this pairing so I just settle for a few binge reads when I miss him and need a hit of the fluff.
