I'm so over Drarry, mostly because when Drarry first became a thing Deatheater whitewashing wasn't also a thing. People mostly wrote about Draco falling in love with Harry and getting woke, or getting woke and falling in love with Harry. These days, it's this unholy combination of racism and classism and bad sex and just ugh. Fanon!Draco and fanon!Daphne have become interchangeable but for their genitalia. I seriously have no idea where Ice Prince Draco has come from, because canon!Draco has no chill. He's practically Gryffindorish in his pigtail pulling.
