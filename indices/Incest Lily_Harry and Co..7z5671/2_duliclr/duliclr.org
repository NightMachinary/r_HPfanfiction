It amazes me when people compare incest and pedophilia. No, they're not the same. There is no consent on one side when it comes to pedophilia. With incest, consent can be given on both sides. How can you not see the difference?

Take two consenting siblings and make them never have kids. What's wrong with it then? Where's the harm? People read them because it's taboo, but a harmless one.
