I assume fan creators picked it up from the movie, where Lupin is depicted with a pair of huge and visible scars across his face: [[https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/harry-potter-remus-lupin.jpg]]

I agree that it's unlikely that book!Remus had any major scars, though - Harry can be kind of oblivious at time, but I don't think he'd fail to notice scars that prominent, especially on a Defense Against Dark Arts teacher.
