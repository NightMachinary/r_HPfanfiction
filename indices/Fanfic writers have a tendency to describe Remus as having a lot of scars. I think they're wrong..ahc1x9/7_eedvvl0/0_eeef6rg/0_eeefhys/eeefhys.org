Yeah, but werewolves aren't wolves. It is not a natural animal. They are an unnatural creature born out of a disease that basically exists solely as a vector for the disease.

The werewolf attacks any human on sight and when there are no humans nearby it tries to hurt itself to get the human inside it. The Marauders turn into animagus to keep Lupin's Werewolf form distracted by dicking around with it.
