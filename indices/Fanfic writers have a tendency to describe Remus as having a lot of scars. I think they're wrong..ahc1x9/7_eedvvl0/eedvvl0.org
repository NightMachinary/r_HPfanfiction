"Although he could have eaten animals in the forest while running around."

Werewolves don't really attack animals unprovoked. It was the whole point of learning how to become an animagus for the Marauders.

Other than this, I don't really disagree with what you are saying.

Also, Werewolves are considered dark creatures and stuff involving dark magic or wounds by dark creatures are supposed to be harder to heal, hence Bill's scar. So even being a werewolf might not necessarily help with that.

I am sure that if you tweet J. K. Rowling about it she will retcon the entire universe while drunk and high on pills, so that might be worth a shot if you want a definite conclusion to your theory.
