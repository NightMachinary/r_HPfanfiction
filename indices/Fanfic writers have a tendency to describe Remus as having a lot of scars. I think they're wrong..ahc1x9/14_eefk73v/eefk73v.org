Remus's facial scars are a pet peeve of mine. However, I don't think he's imune to his own bites, so I thinke he has scars elsewhere, but they can be hidden. Werewolf bites are like dark magic, so I don't think they heal properly. But I might be influenced by against the moon, so i'll blame stoplight for this.
