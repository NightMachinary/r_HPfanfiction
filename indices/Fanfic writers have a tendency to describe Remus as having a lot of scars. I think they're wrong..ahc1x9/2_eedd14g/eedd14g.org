Also, it's never mentioned in Snape's werewolf assignment (from what I just skimmed).

And I think you're right- IF scars were routine (especially those as result of a dark creature, like Bill, though self inflicted) then it would be FAR more evident than a cold or other excused absence /hang on, the professor keeps sporting new dark scars at odd times of the month, hmmm/

edit- not strictly related, but funny how these thing happen. Rereading PS and look what I find

#+begin_quote
  in Defence Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating *werewolf bites*, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Philosopher's Stone if they had one.

which is interesting, given in they hadn't covered werewolves yet in third year, but I suppose werewolf bites must be deemed need to know information.
