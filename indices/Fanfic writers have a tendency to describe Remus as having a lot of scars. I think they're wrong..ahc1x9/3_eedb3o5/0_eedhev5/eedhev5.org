i think it's because in my youth i read a lot of really terrible marauder era stuff. I was super into fanfic around middle school through early high school and would read exclusively remus lupin fanfic. Like literally i would get home from school everyday and scroll through anything recently updated with remus.

it's actually only very recently that i've gotten back into it and i've been reading a much wider variety of stuff and also I'm way more pickier about how well something is written.
