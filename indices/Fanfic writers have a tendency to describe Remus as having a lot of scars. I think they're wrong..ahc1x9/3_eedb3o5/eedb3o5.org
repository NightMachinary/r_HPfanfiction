Must be dependent on the fanfics you read. I read a lot of fanfiction but have not noticed what you are describing. In fact, usually scaring isn't even discussed, much less how many there are.

As for the reality, it's not discussed in canon as far as I remember, and likely shows up primarily due to the movies attempt to make Remus look "rough" or have a subtle "dangerousness" to him. So perhaps some authors are following that cue? But you also need to remember that Remus is clothed in the scenes he is described in canon, so there could be scaring that Harry or the audience would not see.
