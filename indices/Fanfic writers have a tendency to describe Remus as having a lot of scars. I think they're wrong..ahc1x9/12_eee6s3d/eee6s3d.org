He definitely wouldn't scratch his face, that's a dumb movie design idea. It's a billboard saying "LOOK AT ME, I'M A DANGEROUS WEREWOLF!" And we know that even the unobservant Harry points out obvious facial oddities, like bulging or lazy eyes, new injuries, and Moody's missing bits, not to mention all the gross imagery of Umbridge and her toad face. I'm sure Lupin has scars somewhere, but they're not on his face. They're somewhere he can cover with ankle- and wrist- length robes.

It's the same problem I have with the people who insist on Lord Whatever in their fanfics. Come on, people! If Lucius Malfoy were a Lord, do you really think that in seven years of book canon, we would never have heard of it? He was interviewed for the /Daily Prophet/, he was arrested, he was a school governor, and this never came up? And Draco Malfoy never bragged that his daddy was a lord and one day he would be, too? It's probably because he's not a lord, then!
