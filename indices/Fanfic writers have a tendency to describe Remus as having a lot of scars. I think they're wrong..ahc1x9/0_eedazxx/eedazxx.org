Scars outside of the face are easy to overlook. As a professor, all that would be visible to a student would be he face, neck and hands. In my opinion, hands are easy to overlook, especially at a distance, but then, I've been known to be oblivious.

Any scarring elsewhere would be pretty easily hidden.

That said, it's entirely possible that the curse continually heals any damage he takes, or at least, heals any damage up to a point. It's almost traditional in some versions of the Werewolf myth for the human to wake the next day, wondering why he's outside and naked, but with no distinguishing marks on their body.

Be internally consistent in what you write, explain any major deviations from canon, and anything else is gravy.
