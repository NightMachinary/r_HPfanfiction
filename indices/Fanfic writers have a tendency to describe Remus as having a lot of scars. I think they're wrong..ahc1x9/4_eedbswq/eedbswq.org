I agree that there is unlikely to be any facial scarring, since that's something Harry does notice - I think he describes Moody's face as looking like it's carved from wood because of all its scars(?). But

  He claims he bit and scratched himself often when not taking the wolfsbane potion

Makes me assume that everything easily reachable by his fangs would have been turned into a mangled mess by now, at least in his wolf form.

The questions that would remain is in what way (if at all) scars are transferred between forms and are werewolf-inflicted wounds cursed even when they are applied to a werewolf?
