I probably ought to have specified that I'm asking specifically because I'm working on writing a "rational" fanfic. (if i understand the term correctly) Internal consistency is king, so for the purposes of this one particular story, things JKRowling says outside of the actual books are optional, and I'm going to err towards things making a sort of odd sense whenever I can.

"Because Magic is Magic" is very canonical, but not at all what I'm looking for in this one particular story.

Again, I forgot to specify. Sorry.
