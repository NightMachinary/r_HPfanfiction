You can still write a rational fanfic without making magical limits be related to mundane Physics and Chemistry which they are canonically clearly not. As magic is canonically mostly predictable, it does have laws. JKR just never explained them. I think a more interesting rational fanfiction would be one in which the laws and limits of magic are explained so the reader can predict the outcome instead of imposing mundane Physical and Chemical limits on magic.

I'm unsure how exactly to go about this in this case although wordhammer's idea is good but I don't think your idea in the second half of the post thematically fits with HP magic. Magic like in the OP would be interesting but it would not be HP magic.
