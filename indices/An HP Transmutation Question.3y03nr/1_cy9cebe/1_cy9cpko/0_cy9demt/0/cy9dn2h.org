Fair.

It would just require coming up with an internally consistent set of laws /from scratch/ to work with which is... daunting... and still leaves me wondering just /what/ is so special about gold to magic.

If it has nothing to do with chemical properties then... I haven't the foggiest why gold, and I think I want it to apply to silver and copper too since that explains the use in money handily.

Also: I think I /personally prefer/ (which is not to say that it's correct) the idea that the rules of the universe are consistent in a way across both the magical and the mundane, but that its the types of investigations that muggles vs wizards have conducted that yielded their different understandings.

Whats the analogy, three blind men and an elephant?
