Perhaps it's a certain combination of charm quarks and up quarks, metal density, and degree to which each metal is valued by the species attempting the transmutation.

If you want to go so deep as to understand wherefore those combined factors make each metal ultimate immune to transmutation, I have no suggestions. I don't think muggle even understand why quarks behave as they do, right?
