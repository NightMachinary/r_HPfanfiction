On Gamp's law I have several thoughts, but specific to the food question; there's something about living things that when consumed becomes spiritually sustaining. Conjured food or food transfigured from never-living things would lack that quality of being spiritually satiating. The end result is that conjured or transfigured food may fill your belly but steals away sustenance.

This may also explain Twinkies.
