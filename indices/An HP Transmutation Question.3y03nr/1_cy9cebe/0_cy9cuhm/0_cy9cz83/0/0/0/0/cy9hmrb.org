Which makes sense about why Sirius despite spending some much time in what amounts on Hell on earth recovers, physically, so quickly, but still attacks at Hogwarts with a knife, and does little to no magic in book 3 apart from changing to padfoot(he does not even attempt to find a wand and just summon Peter from the castle). His body is not so bad off, but his /magic/ is affected very badly. It might even be why the students in the ministry attack in book 5 can hold their own against the experienced death eater who have only recently been released from Azkaban.
