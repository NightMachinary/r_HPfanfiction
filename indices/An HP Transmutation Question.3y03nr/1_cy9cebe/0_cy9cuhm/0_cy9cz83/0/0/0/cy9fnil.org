Life feeds on life at every level down to the photosynthetic- muggles would be no different than wizards in their reactions to fake food, except perhaps that wizards would notice the lack more quickly. If you accept a second thought- that wizards need food to do magic even more than they and muggles need food to sustain their bodies, the wizards would be affected worse. Corollary thought: if you want to keep a wizard prisoner, starve them. They need to sustain their body before they can call for an intervention in reality.
