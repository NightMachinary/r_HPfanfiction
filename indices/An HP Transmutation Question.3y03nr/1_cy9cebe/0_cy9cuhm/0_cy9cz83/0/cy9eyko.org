Because I missed the edit: duplicating food distributes the spiritually nutritional value between the dupes. You can eat it (it won't revert to something terrible in your stomach) but it's not a sustainable cornucopia. Alternately, the duplication may be drawing other nutritionally equivalent supplies from the Vanish-space to make up the difference. I'm not keen on this as it breaks the whole 'conjuring nutritional stuff (that you didn't Vanish first) is impossible' and makes it 'conjuring food is a bad bet, because there's no way to tell if you've got the full value version or just a simulation of satiation.'
