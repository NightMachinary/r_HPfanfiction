Yeah... /something/ non-obvious is clearly going on in a system where you can't conjure/transfigure food, but you can make a desk turn into a pig.

Either its not a pig, but rather a flesh-golem type being that has no nutritional value (Or perhaps the nutritional value of eating a desk) Or there's some additional trait of [FOOD] that the pig would lack such as what you described which is very possible in a world where souls aren't just real but something you can interact with meaningfully.

Edit: but you can duplicate food that exists... which means what?
