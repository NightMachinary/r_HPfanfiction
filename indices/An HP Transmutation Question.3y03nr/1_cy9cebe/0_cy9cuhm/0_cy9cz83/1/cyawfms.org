Maybe it's that transfigured materials turn back into whatever they were before once consumed, which would be bad. Likewise, conjured stuff would turn to nothing which would also be bad. And duplicated food would have a diminished value (if you multiply it by two, it means you have two copies at half the value, with half of each copy being basically filler made with magic) so it wouldn't be good to eat it but at least it wouldn't shock your system that badly once it reverts, just ... turn from genuine food into something with nutritional value of junk food.
