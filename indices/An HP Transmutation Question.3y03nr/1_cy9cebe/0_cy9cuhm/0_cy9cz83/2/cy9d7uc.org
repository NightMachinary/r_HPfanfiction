The fun part is that conjured animals are effectively zombies- you're calling up the remains of a long-Vanished pig, which is why you always get the same one if you conjure one, but you get two different ones if you conjure a pair.

Vanish space may include the echoes of things disposed of in other ways, too. Perhaps anything burned up completely gets stored as well.
