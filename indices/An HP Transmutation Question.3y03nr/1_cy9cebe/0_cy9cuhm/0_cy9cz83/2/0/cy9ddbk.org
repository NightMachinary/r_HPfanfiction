I don't know, I've always been a fan of Dresden Files cleansing power of a goof fire.

I would hazard that if you transfigured desk into a pig, and then set it on fire, the fire would cause the pig to revert to a desk long before the pig was finished cooking.

If you're CONJURING the pig... Idk what would happen or in what order. Is it transfigured air, or did you pull a pig out of nonbeing that someone else vanished long ago?
