Well, that's what I think, but yeah, what you wrote. I mean, that would be what makes the potions actually have their place in the setting, since just charming something would make the magic go away, mostly or completely, once it's consumed, whereas potions would start their work then. And that's also what would make the power requirements on the unforgivables exist, as they do in canon, and still make the casting actually require a proper set of mind; at least as far as I see it, with them being just concentrated desire to kill, hurt, or control, attached to a big enough piece of magic.

Basically, human bodies do absorb magic naturally, and then either give it out as it goes or use it if they are currently casting a spell. And potions are special in that they take magic from the bodies rather than giving out their own magic the way everything else does. Because, you know, no magical cores or anything so magic is in the environment and human bodies are used to absorbing it and giving it out back all the time.

Of course, there's no proof one way or another since Madame Rowling did not really say anything on that topic (that is, with transfiguration, potions, and unforgivables; magical cores are most decidedly not a thing in canon). So for as long as you make it internally consistent, you are allowed to choose how it works and not care if others think the same or not.
