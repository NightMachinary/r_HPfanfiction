You are assuming that magic works with hard rules. It does not. All evidence suggests magic works poetically towards an end goal, it does not have one single effect.

You are also assuming that Chemistry is valid. It is not. J.K Rowling stated that magic bypasses 'mundane nature' (Physics, Chemistry, ect.).

Magic is limited only by magical rules which is why it takes the same amount of effort to magically levitate a feather as a Troll's club. Mass does not limit levitation.

It is therefore reasonable to state that the number of nucleons in an atom has no effect on the ease or possibility of transfiguration or transmutation, rather Gold, and the other substances mentioned in Gamp's law have a /magical/ property that prevents transfiguration.

So how does magic define Food (also mentioned in Gamp's law)? It does not do it with any Physical or Chemical property but once again with a Magical property that identifies that it is food.
