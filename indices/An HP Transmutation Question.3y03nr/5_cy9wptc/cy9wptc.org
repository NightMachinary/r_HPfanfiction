If you can't transmute iron, you can't transmute a pig.

But ... magic. It'd be just like magic to allow you to create something that can be /refined into/ gold, (or iron,) but not straight-up create a piece of gold. Much like you can create an animal that can be cooked and eaten (maybe), but you can't create "good food" from nothing.
