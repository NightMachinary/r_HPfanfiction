Someone mentioned Gumps law (that you can't transfigure food). Explaining Gumps law together with the impossibility of transfiguring gold would be economical in a good way. You know, trying to explain the most facts with the fewest assumptions. That's how, according to my understanding, science tries to do it.

Now, the obvious explanation for both is that JK Rowling didn't want magic to be too powerful. If magic can produce anything (including food), you don't need an economy, at least not one that resembles our own. If magic can produce gold, you can't use it as money. Something needs to be used as money (since JK Rowling didn't want the wizarding world to be too alien), so it might as well be money.

Now, those are out-of-universe explanations. But, since they are the true reasons, maybe the trick is to make them valid in-universe explanations. Both rules (Gumps law and the no-gold-rule) are there for a purpose. I know of two ways of how things with (apparent) purpose come to be. They get designed (by people or gods) or they are effects of selection (darwinian-evolution, antropic principle).

Maybe those are not the true rules. Maybe you /can/ produce food by magic, but there is some reason why wizards belief that you can't.

Maybe the reason gold is associated with money even in the muggle world is because you can't transmute it.
