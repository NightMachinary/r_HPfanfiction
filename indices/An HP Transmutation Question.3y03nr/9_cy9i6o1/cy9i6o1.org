I have seen before the idea that in fact there are no rules in magic, Gamps law and the no gold is simply what they are told is true, but does not actually apply. There are many reasons for this, but they come down to the economics. If anyone can conjure food, added to the ability to create space (via expansion) and heat (warming charms) even water, why exact would anyone need to work? If it is so very simple to create gold, what do you have for a basis of your monetary system?
