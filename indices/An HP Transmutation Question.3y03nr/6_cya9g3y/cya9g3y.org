In traditional alchemy (and we have no reason to think HP alchemy is any different except in that it works), gold is symbolic of perfection. It is the ultimate alchemical feat because for the alchemist to perfect physical substance they themselves must have reached an equivalent level of spiritual perfection. In pre-Christian alchemy this was gnosis, in post-Christian alchemy this was associated with salvation.
