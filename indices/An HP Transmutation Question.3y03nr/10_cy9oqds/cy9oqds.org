Scientific effects happen for reductionist reasons that ultimately have to do with molecules and chemistry and simple physical laws. You can't have a scientific device that can transform matter into anything except food or gold, because the only thing special about either one is that they're important categories to people; the universe doesn't really care that something is food or not. It's all made of atoms.

Magic doesn't work that way. Magic is based on the principle that the categories that humans use to divide up the world are basic categories upon which the laws of the universe work. Food and valuables are important categories to humans; if magic is real, they are also important categories to magic.
