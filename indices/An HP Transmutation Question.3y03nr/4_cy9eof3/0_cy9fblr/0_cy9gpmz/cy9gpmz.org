Ooh ooh, I got a plot here! That magic is why goblins hoard all the money for themselves. They have a way to use that magic... dun dun dun. That's also why they hate counterfeits, no magic there, and it would ruin their plans if everyone would just use money without magic in them, so they would get less magic. It explains everything.
