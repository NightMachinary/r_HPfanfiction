Easy. Gold could just be naturally magical in a way that would be very hard to reproduce with just transmuting. You need to add that special magic in, and the stone helps with it a lot. Would also be easy to explain why gold is the valuable metal in magical world.

I'm not sure why people don't just transmute silver or copper or diamonds or sapphires or whatever valuable if it's just to get money. :p
