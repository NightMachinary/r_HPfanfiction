Not to be rude, but I always thought that fics that mixed magic with our understanding of science were rather lame.

We got from canon that magic in the HP universe works with personal intent, values and emotions.

Heres my fanon: I personally always thought that the Philosophers Stone was, true to its name, a way for someone to overcome his ideas, values and prejudices to think from another perspective. Its was made my Flamel to help broaden the horizon of the people of the Enlightement but he had to withdraw it soon after since with the turning of their personl values, actual values changed as well for them. The Philosopher Stone made it possible to transmute gold from anything since it allowed the caster to ignore its value. It allowed to produce the elixir of live since it allowed the brewer to ignore the price of life.
