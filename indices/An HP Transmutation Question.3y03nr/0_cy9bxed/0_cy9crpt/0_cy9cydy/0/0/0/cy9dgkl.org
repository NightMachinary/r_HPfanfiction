True.

But there are a LOT of ways that the trio could have used magic to make sustenance fairly easy even without hacking the system this way. You can't conjure food, but you can (I think) summoning spell a rabbit to you and then turn the rabbit which is [food] into some other kind of [food] yeah?

In any case, the vanished/conjuring thing might also shed light on molly's wand producing cream sauce that one time.
