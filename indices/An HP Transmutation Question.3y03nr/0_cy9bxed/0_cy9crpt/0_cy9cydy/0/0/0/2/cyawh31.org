Yes, but you'd have to think of it.

So people who'd spent the last six years being fed and never before really had to think about what to do in a survival scenario, aren't likely to think about summoning a rabbit. Also, some people would have a fun episode (going green, retching, mumbling to themselves maybe) before they managed to prepare a rabbit that was alive just moments earlier for eating.
