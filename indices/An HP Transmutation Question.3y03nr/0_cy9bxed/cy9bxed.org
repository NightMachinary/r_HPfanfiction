I was trying to think of a good chemistry-based reason for the transmuting issue when a thought occurred to take a more thematic approach, as magic often does.

Transmuting may in some sense depend on previously-Vanished materials to make replacement matter in certain patterns. Finding leftover animal carcasses, broken furniture and blocks of collapsed wall would be relatively easy, but who in their right mind would Vanish gold or silver? Or even steel? As rare as many elements are in nature, they would be doubly rare in the Vanished stockpile for being valued.

That's the thought, anyway.
