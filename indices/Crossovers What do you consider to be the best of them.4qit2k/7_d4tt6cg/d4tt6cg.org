Martyrdom and Paradox By: UchidaKarasu: A Harry Potter/Death Note Crossover. It is slash (HP/LL), and I really like how the relationship develops. Aside from that is one of the only good HP/DN crossovers that I have managed to find (aside from some MoD = Shinigami King short stories). linkffn(5730598)

Madness at the Gate By: ZenoNoKyuubi: A Harry Potter/Stargate Crossover. I don't know much about SG, and I only really read this as it is a sequel with a Harry Potter that I rather enjoyed (mad scientist). linkffn(9261735)

Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens By: littlewhitecat: A Harry Potter/Warhammer Crossover. Thankfully, knowledge of Warhammer isn't needed to enjoy this story. linkffn(8400788).
