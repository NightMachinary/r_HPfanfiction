I've posted this before. Right now I'm in a PJO mood, so these. There are others from other Fandoms, but at the moment here are these

These are some of my favorite. I like the twice blessed challenge, but really I just like a demigod Harry. These are a fem Harry, so take that as you will. The author is quite good and I liked them. They are only the first part though. There are second parts being written. The idea for each is that a femharry is the daughter of one of the big three. The author wrote a story for each scenario. I like them all, but consul of the dead is my favorite. They ask feature a little crossover with Rick Riordan's other books featuring Egyptians and Romans. The reason I like this so much is because in Consul of the dead we see Harry grow into a person. We also see real family relationships between the daughters of hades. Yeah they might not seem possible because of the age gap, but the female goddess daughters of hades are portrayed as immortal college age girls. This has shown to be okay with the hunters and somehow the author makes it work.I'll admit there are some cliche moments and it's not for everyone, but I liked it.

This is a good one as well. It is a unique look on what kind of parents Harry can have. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11024296/1/Godling-Ascending]])

I was really into linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11715537/1/Pandemonium]]) and it's predecessor, but I have to agree with the author it is kinda cringe worthy at times.

I'm not sure what else to put. I know I have read read some others, but for the life of me they are escaping my mind.

I'm post more probably when I get home. They will be from different Fandoms.
