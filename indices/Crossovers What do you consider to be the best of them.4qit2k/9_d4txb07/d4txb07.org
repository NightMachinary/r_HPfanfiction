I haven't been keeping up with it but linkffn(deal with a devil) was pretty good, bit dark for my taste but interesting. It's complete HP/Dresden Files cross.

linkffn(a study in magic) I liked a lot, HP/Sherlock Holmes crossover. The worlds mesh really well. I think it's complete also. Literate and interesting imho. ymmv.
