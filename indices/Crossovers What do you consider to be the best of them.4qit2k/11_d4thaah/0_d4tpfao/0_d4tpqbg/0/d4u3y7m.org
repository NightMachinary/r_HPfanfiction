Posts like this have a place, in LF threads. But without context i tend to skip over them in recomendation threads since

1) i want a recommendation, and that involves more than just a title in my mind. Strong points and weak points, why i should read it anyway, etc.

2) summaries are often horrible at predicting if i would like the story.
