I just looked up the book and timeline; Ron didn't talk to Harry, because he was upset and jealous.

This state of affairs lasted for approximately three weeks (from the Goblet spitting out names to the First Task); aggravating factors were that he didn't know how dangerous the Tournament would really be, Rita Skeeter's article painting Harry as a glory-seeker (which even made up quotes from Harry), and that Harry was practically more antagonistic towards Ron than Ron was to Harry.

I will also note that during this time, Ron didn't do anything beyond refusing to speak to Harry; he didn't wear a Potter Stinks badge, he defended Hermione from Malfoy and Snape, and when he did talk to Harry the worst thing he said were a couple of sarcastic remarks about his publicity.

...Actually, re-reading the book, you know what I noticed? Hedwig was in a huff for that same time period too; she wouldn't take any mail for Harry. I wonder if there's any Hedwig-bashing fics?
