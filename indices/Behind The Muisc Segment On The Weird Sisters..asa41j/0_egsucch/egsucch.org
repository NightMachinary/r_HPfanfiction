Not really a reaction to the prompt but rather the observation that for a series that had a decent amount of music in it (Wizard radio, school song, popular band like the Weird Sisters and Celestine Warbeck) there are very few fics that do something with it. There are song fics, but those aren't actually about playing music.

I'd imagine with many muggleborn children playing instruments growing up and music being a factor in both worlds that there are people who want to play together. I've proposed this idea before but a fic about Harry forming a band with people from different houses in Hogwarts is really interesting to me.
