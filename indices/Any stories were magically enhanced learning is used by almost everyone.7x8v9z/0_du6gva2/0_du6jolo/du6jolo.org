Thanks.

And yeah I just want more daily life magic because I feel like in canon the students were being actively discouraged from useing magic even before umbridge came along in fifth year and did it more blatantly.

And in a lot of fanfiction the only magic that people seem to remember exists is combat magic. Which is quite boring
