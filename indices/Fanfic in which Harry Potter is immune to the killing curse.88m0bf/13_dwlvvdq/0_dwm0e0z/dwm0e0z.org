I think you missed the point of fan fiction requests. OP isn't asking for canon rules (which are fuzzy anyway), they are asking for fan fiction where a specific rule is altered. Telling them that what they are asking for isn't canon doesn't help anyone. If you're trying to be funny, it's coming off as mocking instead.
