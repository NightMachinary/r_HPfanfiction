Since OP's request is pretty vague and they didn't elaborate on specifics and I feel like reading something from a few years ago that fits the request:

I recall a fic where a bunch of death eaters attacked Harry, I think during the summer before sixth year at the Dursleys. If I recall correctly Harry ended up taking a killing curse to the chest and got a cross shaped scar or something like that, I'm also pretty sure it was Bellatrix who did it and he jumped in front of it to save Tonks.

I'm pretty sure shortly after at Grimmauld Place Dumbledore basically said it that the prophecy was literal and both Harry and Voldemort were unable to die to anyone but the other.
