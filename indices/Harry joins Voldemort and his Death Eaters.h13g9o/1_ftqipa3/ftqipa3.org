This is a Harry brought in from another dimension story, where he decides Voldemort's side is the better option. linkffn(Snake Pit by VicVivi).

When Harry is dragged into the new dimension, he of course doesn't know what's going on and assumes he's being attacked, so he starts fighting. The Order of the Phonix naturally fights back at somebody firing spells at them. A few Order members are killed and Harry ends up in the infirmary when they finally take him down. While he's in there somebody poisons him. He manages to escape. Between the summoning, fighting, poisoning and being held prisoner, Harry has no love for this Order.
