Yeah. It was a heavy info dump.

I think it turned into more of a "Here is a 12k long" Prompt.

I am playing with two different ideas as my next project after my Honks story and this was one of them. I am writing the other "One-Shot/First Chapter" of my other idea.

My long fic only has maybe 5 more chapters and maybe something like an epilogue kind of thing.
