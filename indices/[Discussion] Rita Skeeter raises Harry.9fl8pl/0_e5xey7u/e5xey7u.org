Omfg this is wild.

But actually tackling this properly and dismissing my immediate "ew", I realised this could be interpreted in ways that could be really interesting.

Like we know how she is with her clientele but clearly she's a very intelligent woman - she has to be in order to be so successful. And an animagus to boot.

She'd love her little Harry, almost everyone loves their kids.

I imagine her taking him to a somewhat high-profile event at one point and discreetly pointing out certain people and little bits of damning and humorous information she knows about them to entertain Harry. And then also pointing out what people were there for, their purposes for being at the event and their actions and how she knew. Their ulterior motives. Slowly transitioning from funny to insidiously insightful only to twist back on the one aura watching the banquet with rapt attention who had spilt wine on the head auras collar accidentally at the last event and had the rather unnecessary and boring job of eyeing the punch bowl on the off chance it was spiked. Or something better than that, I'd have to think on it.

He'd grow up knowing how to watch and collect information on the people around him and probably taught how to take on an animagus form to his advantage. Of course, it wouldn't be registered either. Harry knows the value of secrets, when to broadcast them and when to hold them close. Or even to take to the grave.

And when all of the dark Lord shit hits the fan, he's got a direct connection to the woman writing his headliners. Heir of Slytherin? Why, a connection to one of the great founders? What a privilege!

Is the Dark Lord back? Yes. Yes he is. Now let's slander him. Not like he can sue us with the fake identity and all. The death threat is worrying but the stories are selling like wildfire.

Anyone tries to get at Harry and he just brings out the receipts.

And when he's hunting for horcruxes or on the run in anyway shape or form, he's got the connections. Places to stay for free. Information to trade or threaten. It's risky but he also knows how to hide when at risk.

And Skeeta just prints false leads into the press. Sightings of him at Diagon Alley when he's at Godric's Hollow. Rumours of him acquiring portkeys when in fact he's got someone to apparate him. And of course she's not trying to mislead the public, how could you think so? She wants to find her child so desperately that she's hoping the public will look out for him. It's all true.

I don't know, I've not read the books in a while so I need to refresh the cannon in my mind and these ideas are just from the top of my head but I think a legit look into how this could work would make for a very interesting read.
