I made not one but two magic schools a long time ago while brainstorming during empty classes instead of doing homework:

1-) Tigadissi Institude of The Arcane

Location: Under the Red Sea, From the Coast of Yemen.

Organization: Tigadissi teaches their students for 12 years instead of the standart 7 years of ICW. Students are separated by gender, but there are no houses. Tigadissi allows an extra ten years of research time for those who wish to study wandlore and Alchemy.

Accepts Students From: North Africa, East Africa, Arabia and Indian Ocean Islands.

Famous Graduates: Herpo the Foul, King Solomon.

Other: Oldest school of magic in the world, constructed by ancient kings of Punt(a legendary state in east africa) around 3500 BC.

First wands were invented in Tigadissi, These first wands were carved from ivory of thousands of years old elephants and filled with clay made from phoenix ash and griffin blood for a core. Tigadissi, to this day owns the only public works on wandlore.

Since the burning of Library of Alexandria, most magical works in the library have been relocated to Tigadissi, giving the school, worlds third largest magical library in the world.

2-) Shehrazabad Academy of Magical Arts

Location: Hindukush Mauntains, Afghanistan.

Accepts Students From: India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bengladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan.

Organization: Shehrazabad teaches their students for the standart 7 years of the ICW. Students are sorted in their fourth year to one of three houses depending on their favored subjects. House of Umay takes up those that are good at hands on magics like herbology and Potions. House of Agni takes up those that are good at spell based magics such as charms and transfiguration. House of Mazda takes up those that are good at calculation based magics such as Arithmancy and Enchanting. Students are then educated further in the advanced forms of their respective fields.

Famous Graduates: Avicenna, Guru Lahimyo.

Other: Constructed around the School, and perhaps much more impressing than the refurnished old buddhist temple that makes up the main part of the school, is the city of Zinjabad, largest purely magical settlement on earth with an impressive 3 million population( all of afghanistans magical population and a chunk of pakistans).City is self sufficent, holding parks, zoos, libraries, temples, farms, even an army of 16000 strong hitwitches and hitwizards.

Shehrazabad is famous for pioneering the field of arithmancy and separating it from divination. The three domed ceiling of the main entrance is enchanted to show the sky, much like hogwarts. However, these domes use the weather patterns to predict future threats to the school and the city through complex arithmantic calculations. Revelations given from this calculations have saved the city from being sacked twice by mongols, and once by mughals.

Shehrazabad is the only magical school that is technically polylingual. There is an ancient enchantment over the school, carved into its very bricks. This enchantment automatically translates any language to listeners mothertongue. Parselmouths are known to hear everything in Parseltongue.
