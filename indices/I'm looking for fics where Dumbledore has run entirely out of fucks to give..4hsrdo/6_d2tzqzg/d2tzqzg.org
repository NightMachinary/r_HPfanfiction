So, the first thing that I want to say about linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond) is that it isn't a typical soul bond fic. The second thing I want to say about that fic is that it's possible that it's my favorite depiction of dumbledore. I'm not sure that I'd describe him as "no fucks given", but there's a STRONG undercurrent of "don't sweat the small stuff, and when you're 150, most things are pretty small". A lot more of the "alas, earwax!" and a lot less "dark and dangerous times are ahead, I fear".
