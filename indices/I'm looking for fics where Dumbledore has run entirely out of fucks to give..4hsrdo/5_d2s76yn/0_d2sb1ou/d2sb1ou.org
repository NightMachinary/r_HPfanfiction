I am imagining this Dumbledore in an otherwise completely serious fic.

"Oh god, Voldemort just kicked down the door! Headmaster, what should we do?"

"Send him the bill. And Tom, I know that you are almost certainly completely fucking insane at this stage, but can you please behave while you're here? We actually /do/ have competent students that could be a credit to magic currently here who, unlike you I might add, will most likely not be driven insane through an untreated inferiority complex, mostly because they almost certainly are already insane at this stage."

"But sir-"

"That's me covered as far as the board of directors goes. Now then, will whoever happens to be the current prophecied boy hero go and deal with this before Tom tries to kill me like the last five times he's been here for a job interview please? Disposing of your corpse is slightly easier than disposing of his usually is. Off you trot now."

"But... but..."

"... I see you are still here."

"You're the headmaster! Help me!"

"No. I am busy eating. An activity which, I might add, you are interrupting. So no, I won't help you deal with the greatest Dark Lord in living memory as you have come to Hogwarts to learn about how to deal with such things in the first place. This counts as this year's final exam, by the way. If you die messily, Hermione and Ron will have T's across the board and be forced to repeat the year."

"WHAT?"

"I am sorry miss Granger, are you deaf as well as dithering? I believe I just said to go deal with it yourselves. It's what you've been taught to do. Now go do it and leave me to enjoy this rather splendid chicken."

BOOM!"POTTER!"

"And there's Tom now." Dumbledore said, sighing. "Take this outside you lot. The rest of us are eating here. Miss Chang, will you kindly refrain from dipping your hand down your boyfriend's pants while I am eating? I swear if you end up needing yet another after-the-fact prophylactic I will start sending the bills to your mother alongside the photos-yes, the house elves are instructed to take photos and no, you cannot see them given that you are unqualified to do so and remember the events in question quite clearly anyway, so why would you need a reminder? On that note, please remember to pick up this year's Hogwarts commemorative calendar. I have been told that the contents are... interesting, to say the least. Any and all donations will, of course, be going towards the Committee for Promotion of Magical Prophylactics Among those Of Lesser Intelligence. Their cause is worthy and quite effective as I'm sure messieurs Crabbe and Goyle will be able to attest. Now then, Potter, Riddle and friends, please take it outside if you are going to keep being prissy towards each other. Everyone else, I will kindly remind you that you have ten minutes left before the House Elves collect all the food and I send you all to bed, so eat. That said, I'll tuck in now. No talking if you don't want to assist Filch for the remainder of the month."
