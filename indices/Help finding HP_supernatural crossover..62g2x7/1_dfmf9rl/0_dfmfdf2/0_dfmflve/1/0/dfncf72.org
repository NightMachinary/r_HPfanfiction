That's pretty much the gist of what I remember. It was set during seasons four and five of Supernatural so that was happening in the background. It's been a while but I remember a scene where they were saying "We need to find Death. We need Death's ring to stop this." and Harry says "I have it, it's safe." and shows them what was previously pointed out as the Resurrection Stone in the story. Of course then there confrontations of "Why the hell do you have Death's ring?" "Because I'm the Master of Death." I don't remember what happened after that.
