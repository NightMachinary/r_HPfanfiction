It's fanfiction, so it's entirely possible. I didn't know there would be two Harry Potter as some kind of immortal in Supernatural fics, but it's certainly plausible. In the one I read there was a major plot point that the Slytherin Ring aka the Resurrection Stone was Death of the Four Horsemen's ring.
