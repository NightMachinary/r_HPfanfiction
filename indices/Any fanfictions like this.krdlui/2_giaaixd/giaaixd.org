This is a pretty sad one, obviously, but I think it fits your request. To summarize, post-DH, pre-epilogue Hermione finds out that Ron gave her a love potion and raises hell about it, or she tries to. It turns out that love potioning is more common and more accepted than she ever knew. Ginny is potioning Harry without him knowing, but when he finds out he's initially ok with it because he likes feeling in love with her.

Edit: I think the bot didn't work because I linked the series page not a story page. Here's the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/592519][link]]
