there are a few nsfw bits but nothing explicit. it's very much an ensemble-driven piece, focusing on Dramione along with other pairings and characters. believable growth and healing from trauma/mental stuff. it's long, but the prose is good and it's in nice, readable chunks; it's one of my favorite fics and i plan to reread it on Thursday.

the author has a LOT of Dramione fics, actually. i'd check out The Green Girl (more focus on Slytherin!Hermione growing up, but the Dramione is there and it's great), Lady of the Lake (political, fake dating/marriage turns to love, heavy Ron bashing), or The Pretense (the Death Eaters don't stop after Voldy dies, Draco and Hermione get fake married to spy on them for the Order)
