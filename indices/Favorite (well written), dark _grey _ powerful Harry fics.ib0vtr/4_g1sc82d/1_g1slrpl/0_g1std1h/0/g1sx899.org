I know right? I love a good slytherin Harry!

Honestly-I have no idea! I probably upset someone by requesting something that is posted about a lot. For some reason people on this sub get annoyed if there are to many similar requests-like someone is making them answer or something ðŸ™„. Normally I'd just look for a another similar post-but I scrolled for a few minutes and couldn't find one with fics that I hadn't already read. Clearly it's just one person watching the post -because otherwise the downvotes would be in the negatives. Oh well lmao ðŸ˜†
