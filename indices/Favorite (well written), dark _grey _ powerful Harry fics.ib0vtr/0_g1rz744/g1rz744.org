My top 5 favorite fics all feature this kind of Harrys:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Hocrux]], linkffn(10677106): He even thinks he's Voldemort here. He also acts like Voldemort and has the power of Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): He started out as a vigilante revolutionary against the corrupt establishment, but readers can see him (and Ron and Hermione) getting increasingly cruel and ruthless. His preferred spell is Fiendfyre.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): His favorite spell is again Fiendfyre, he really likes manipulating people, and he doesn't mind killing his enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Initially he had some reservations joining Grindelwald, but couldn't resist his friends's enthusiasm. Besides, he really enjoys looting and war profiteering.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: This story happens in a non magical sci-fi universe with superpowers. Its Harry still grows up in an abusive household, and that shows in his propensity to solve problems with violence. The Trio may have killed up to hundreds in this fic.
