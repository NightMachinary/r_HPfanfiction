The main plot idea is not believable, though. Hermione gets banished for not snitching on DA members who murdered Death Eater prisoners, yet Draco gets off despite actually helping Voldemort and using the Unforgivables?

Yeah, right. That's not how Harry, Ron or anyone else in the books would act. It's an overly dramatic "Martyr Hermione gets betrayed by everyone and suffers for her friends who forget her" story that makes no sense.
