I second this. It's a very well-written fic that manages to be depressing in its tone through necessity, without being over the top grimdark stuff; any tonal shift in /either/ direction would have lessened the fic.

Also, what do you think was frustrating about the ending? I thought it was where it was naturally heading based on the tone of the rest of the fic; they're both still broken (heh) people who will need time to deal with what they've been through, but they can make a good start together. I will concede that the epilogue fic that was written was a massive letdown, however, and choose to disregard it.
