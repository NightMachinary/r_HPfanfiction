I never got around to the epilogue fic because I was worried that it would be a letdown.

The ending was just frustrating to me because I felt like there was almost no tangible progression in the buildup that took place throughout the entire fic. Like, I expected a huge ending where things just came unglued, but the last chapter was just like the last 30 seconds of a song where it fades out into silence
