Yeah, I'm not criticizing the ending or the author because I share the same ideas on it as you, but I do wish there could have been something more concrete. It just felt like there should have been more progression in their relationship than there ever was. I'm not big into the romance genre, so it may be par for the course, but it felt to me like the reason everything wasn't falling together was simply because the author didn't want it to fall together, rather than because there was something between them. I think they could have established something pretty solid by, say, chapter 28 rather than something intangible in chapter 35. I don't remember what was going on in chapter 28 or anything, I'm just using that as an arbitrary timeline.
