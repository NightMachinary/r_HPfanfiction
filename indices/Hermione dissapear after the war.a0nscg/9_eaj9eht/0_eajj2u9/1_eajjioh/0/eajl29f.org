The song analogy is an interesting one, and it sort of does just fade away at the end without a concrete picture of where they're going to end up. Which could have been useful for letting the reader decide for themselves what the future would hold, since there were definitely multiple ways that Draco and Hermione could have progressed from that point.

For anyone else reading, massive spoilers from this point:

I always thought that Hermione would have ended up spending some more time with Harry so she could tell him more about Matthew, while also re-kindling her friendships with the rest of the Weasleys, sans-Ginny. At the same time she and Draco would continue to be the primary emotional supports for each other while also stumbling through a new relationship that will end up being rather unconventional, but no less successful or loving. I also imagine that she and Harry would have eventually told the rest of the Weasleys about Matthew, despite the obvious awkwardness that that would create. Undoing some of her lies and trying to be truthful with the people she cares about was already something she had started on in the fic, and was likely to continue into the future.

And I don't think you would have liked the epilogue fic, it was rather mundane. Not that I would have imagined the future to be all wacky and action-filled or anything, but the epilogue left me thinking "....That's it?"
