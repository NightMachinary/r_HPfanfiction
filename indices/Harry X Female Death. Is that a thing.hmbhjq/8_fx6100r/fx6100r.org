I would love to see a fic where uniting the Hallows renders their master something other than officially mortal, specifically as a way to get around the limitation of the Endless being forbidden from loving mortals. Fair Lady seems to take a more indirect route on that front, and I was a bit put off by how many random digressions it took along the way.
