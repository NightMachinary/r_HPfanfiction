I've come across a few in passing that have a male Death (such as in Supernatural crossovers) too, but it's a thing, yeah.

There are very few fics that explore this, though.

Some have her as an OC: Others as Endless!Death, et cetera.

I remember one where Lily survives after making a bargain with Death, and Harry grows up with a pseudo love-interest/sister-figure/best-friend called 'Thana' (short for a name related to death).

Best thing is that it's implied Thana knows of her nature in an 'Orange and Blue' mentality while stuck in a human brain, and her body is made up of, er, 'repurposed' human body-parts from the scum of society, like Death Eaters.

She has ulterior motives for Harry, and Lily knows/dreads this, but it's obvious she loves him -- it's just mixed with Eldritch shit, lol.

Can't remember the name, though.
