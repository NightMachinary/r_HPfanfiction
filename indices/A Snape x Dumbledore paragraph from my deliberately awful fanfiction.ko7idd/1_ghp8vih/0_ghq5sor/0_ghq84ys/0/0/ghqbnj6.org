Oh I completely want to read it. I've thought nothing but how "Your seeing orbs are like 70% Lindt chocolate orbs" all night. Anyone who can describe such beauty in such specific detail needs to be appreciated!

"We go together like the catholic church an pedophilia" What was the quote? Grease strands blowing in the wind like foliage? "The slate bearded homosexual stretched his ulnas towards the oily obsidian locks of severus"

Genius. Glorious. Shrek and Donny will be so beautiful.
