He's definitely clever and intelligent. I think his cowardice and lack of loyalty overshadows that for a lot of people, and people hate him, so they tend to write him as a cowaring, backstabbing moron who is just above a squib in magical prowess. In reality, he's at least above average intelligence and magically gifted, able to keep up with the other Marauders in becoming an animagus and contributing to the creation of the Marauder's Map. He's just also fearful and only looking out for himself. He'd rather survive and support the winning side than die to protect his friends.

A really good characterization of Wormtail is in linkao3(A Marauder's Plan), which is also one of the most well-written fanfics I've read. He outwits Remus and Sirius a few times, using their emotions against them, and somewhat plays both sides by leaving them some clues to try and get on their good side in case they win against Voldemort. Voldemort actually tells Wormtail to send them those clues, but Wormtail includes more information than Voldemort technically told him to send. It shows him being a lot more intelligent, strategic, and manipulative than most fanfics, and really canon too.

Also the fic is like 800k words long and only covers 4th year. It covers a lot of information and subplots, though, so it doesn't drag on (at least for me).
