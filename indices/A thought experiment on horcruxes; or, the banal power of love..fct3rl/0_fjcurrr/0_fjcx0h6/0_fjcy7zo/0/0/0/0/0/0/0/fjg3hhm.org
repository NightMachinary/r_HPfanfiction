Yes... Somehow I view wormtail as what could have been Snape if Lily weren't around to be his 'conscience '(his only redeeming quality for me. But even that is questionable for me too). It's a shame that wormtail don't get spotlight often when even Bellatrix gets a reformed/good guy fic.

Thanks for the recommendation, btw
