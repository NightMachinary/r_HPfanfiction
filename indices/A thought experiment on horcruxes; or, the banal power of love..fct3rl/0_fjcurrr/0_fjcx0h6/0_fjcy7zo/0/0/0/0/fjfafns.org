I can't remember exactly how he knew to look in Albania (I think he went back to Albania after Philosopher's Stone, and that's where Wormtail found him). It's possible he overheard it during his time at Hogwarts. But I believe it's mentioned that he tracked him down once he was in the area because Voldemort was possessing animals, and Wormtail could communicate with/sense the distress of the rats in the area while he was in his animagus form. They were running away out of fear of being possessed themselves.

I need to reread the books, it's been a while, so I don't know how much is accurate canon info.
