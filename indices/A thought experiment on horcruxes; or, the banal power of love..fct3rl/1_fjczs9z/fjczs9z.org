Bellatrix, Crouch Jr. and I'd imagine a lot of other Death Eaters would have revived Voldemort within the week if they knew how. The real kicker was that he was too paranoid to tell them how he was really going to beat death. I wouldn't say paranoia and lack of love are necessary to come hand in hand, or else Moody would be an even bigger sociopath than Voldemort.
