In theory yes but I think Harry couldn't have created a horcrux that said I don't think you can truly love and create a horcrux. A horcurx would require you to value your own life and yourself more than anything else. And even if somebody else would love you, it would be a twisted love as the one that Bellatrix has for Voldemort. So, I would say the power of love is that it keeps you from creating a horcrux in the first place.
