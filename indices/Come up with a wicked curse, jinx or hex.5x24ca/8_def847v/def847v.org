/Daemo Visio/ Aka Boggart sight hex

The hexed individual sees all individuals and/or objects as their worst fear. Neville would see all people as Snape. Harry would see all people as Dementors. It can be fought off the same way you fight a Boggart, the first thing you successfully /ridikulous/ reverses the hex.
