Aedemio - causes the target to swell into a bloated sphere, somewhat buoyant. Target is unable to grip anything, limits range of motion... and it looks really funny, too.

Prongus - target suddenly grows horns anchored to their skull, until the structure is so heavy that they can't keep their head up.

Purgatorio - forces target to vomit in disgust; for reasons, cannot be blocked by a magical shield or deflection.

Constrixio - causes targets clothing to bind them up like a straightjacket
