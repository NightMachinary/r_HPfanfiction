*Aegis Fidelis* - Removes parts of the body from existence so they cannot be targeted. Utmost care is advised to never use this spell on bodyparts requiring an active connection to the brain (the eyes, for example). When speaking the spell, all who hear it will be the secret keepers of the Aegis Fidelis in question.

*Persephones Wrath* - Creates fissures in the ground from which spectral claws emerge. The claws will begin ripping and tearing into any living matter around them and drag it down with them into the fissure after the spell is canceled. The caster is urged to not stand too close to the claws as they cannot be controlled.

*Falx* - Cutting Curse that slices clean through flesh and soft material at impact. Can be blocked by physical means and Shielding Charms, however it will "hook" into either blocking method and pull the opponent towards the caster, with the intent of unbalancing him.

*Occuladetras* - Eyeball Melting Curse. Starts to dissolve the eyeballs at impact. Impact areas include the entirety of the opponents body.

*Kronokis Abysmas* - The Black Void Hex. Creates a center of extreme gravity at impact. The center will drag in everything around it until it reaches "full charge". The Charge will then implode and create a shockwave of lethal power.

*Villuvultus* - The hairdo charm. Adding the name of the hairstyle after the incantation makes the hair targeted rearrange itself into the ordered one. Imagining the exact hairdo will reduce the randomness of the spell. Also works with beards.

*Maxanidate* - The vanity curse. Will increase the vanity of a person and simultaneously worsen their perception of their shortcomings. Attention: Can cause such things as rubbing through skin and muscle to get rid of bad acne, starvation due to perceived overweight, death through exhaustion due to perceived lack of sexual prowess and many more.

*Secupanem* - The breadcrumb charm. Must be cast at the destination first (may include abstract goals) and then on the target person. The charm will drive the target towards achieving said goal by making the target see single steps clearer. Care is advised: Being unable to reach the goal (due to personal reasons or the nature of the goal) the charm may be depression inducing.
