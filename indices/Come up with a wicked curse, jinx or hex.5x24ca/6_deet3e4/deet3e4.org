Parvus Tondendas (tiny shear): initiate a tiny amount of nuclear fission in the air between you and your target and directing the resultant nuclear radiation at them. This curse will be completely without signs of being cast, save for the wand movements and incantation. However, the target will, at the very least, be sterilised, and likely get cancer. Because wizards have no idea about fundamental forces, they'd be at a loss of how to treat it, and it would have no magical signature (as the radiation does the damage, not the magic itself), so this is a good curse for causing long-term harm to an enemy. Just weave it into a spell combo in a duel, and even if they do catch you casting it, they probably won't link it to their metastasing liver cancer a year later. They'd just feel a small wave of heat at most, and probably assume it came from a failed incendio or something similar. An overpowered version of this curse would case nuclear burns all over their body, destroy their genome and let them spend their final days in complete agony from extreme radiation poisoning. There's a story out there about a nuclear engineer who was kept alive in such a state for months, in extreme agony, but I won't link it.
