The contraction curse would be a very painful way to die, assuming it's not just the conscious muscles that contract, but the unconscious ones. Not only are your tendons shorn off their anchorings, with the mother of all cramps, your intestines have ruptured themselves, you've wet yourself, your circulatory system has ruptured (miniscule muscles in artery/vein walls contract together with the heart, severely raising blood pressure) and you've probably broken more than a few small bones.
