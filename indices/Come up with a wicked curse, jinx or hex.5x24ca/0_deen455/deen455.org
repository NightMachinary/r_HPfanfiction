*Marrowspike Curse*

This spell, if it hits a target, causes little spikes to grow on their bones, which push outwards and break through the victim's skin. The bone spikes don't grow inwards to avoid puncturing lungs, the brain, or other vital organs, but it is incredibly painful when they burst through the skin, and the ripping apart of muscles ensures your victim doesn't move again for a while. Combining it with a wide-angle bonecrusher curse makes for one gruesome fatality.
