A curse I use in a lot of stories is the Flame Flaying Curse. It slowly burns away skin a millimeter at a time across whatever portion of the skin the flame covers. It can take a very, very long time to die.

Though that's less casual duel and more honor duel to the death level magic. Definitely a dark spell.
