I used to make up really gruesome spells when I was bored! (mainly used/created by one of my characters xD)

1. A Scythe impales the target and instantly retracts, cutting and ripping through the skin. Possible to pull off limbs.

2. A Curse that slowly turns the targets blood into magma. The process is highly painful and very slow. You slowly burn from the inside.

3. A curse that melts the eyeballs.

4. Pulls the spine from the body. There's another spell that forces it into someone else, as well.

5. A spell that removes all bones, causing the target to just become a sludge of skin and organs.

6. A spell that makes the target hear Justin Bieber/Jacob Sartorius all day, no reprieve.
