I have a bunch to say on this, but given the tone of response so far, I'd say folks aren't into the concept as presented. Probably because you referenced source material that suggests that Harry will be learning 'gamer-wank crossover style' Kung Fu.

I think the books have very physical fights, and the wizarding population demonstrates a high level of durability (or at least repair-ability) such that transfiguring your enemies into immobile piles of goo is considered vaguely funny and not at all worrisome, long-term.

I guess my short-answer recommendation would be to think of all the ways and times that the books show someone (particularly Hagrid) being kinda superhuman, and riff on that. Keep in mind that Harry isn't a genius reincarnation of anybody, so if he's inventing it himself, it'll be clumsy but surprisingly effective. If he's learning it from some other master, assume that Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore have known about it for a while and have a direct tactical counter for it in most situations (disapparating being the most obvious solution).
