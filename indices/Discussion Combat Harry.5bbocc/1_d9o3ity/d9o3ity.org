*Harry Potter and the Sun Source* linkffn(4532363) Has a Harry that was picked up off the Dursley's doorstep and raised by a society that pretty much started training him as soon as he could walk.

Warning: You may be offended by the attitudes in this story if you haven't read the Destroyer series books or seen the films, and might still be offended if you have. It has some very tongue in cheek satire that may not have stood the tests of time (source material was written in the 70's, I think?) I had no problem with it, but again, that's me. Your mileage may vary.
