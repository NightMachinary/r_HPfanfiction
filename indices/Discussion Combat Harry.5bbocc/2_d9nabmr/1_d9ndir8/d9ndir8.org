Well, swords are sharper than sticks.

That said, considering that the poster cited Mortal Kombat as their inspiration for the whole “martial arts” thing, I think we are supposed to think about something at least somewhat supernatural in regards to the term “martial arts” here, maybe not to the extent of bending in the Avatar universe (which is more magic realised through martial arts than martial arts proper, as far as this comparison goes), but at the very least something you'd expect from a Wuxia movie (where people can jump 20 metres down without risking any injury because they are martial artists).
