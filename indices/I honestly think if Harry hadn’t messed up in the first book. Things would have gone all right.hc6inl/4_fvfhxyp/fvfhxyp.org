So I completely understand where you're coming from with this and there's a lot of background evidence that if that was the plan than it would have worked. A layer of traps that regardless of the trio making their way through are all either deadly or at least dangerous. With the crucial point that all of the traps had quasi obvious solutions that someone as arrogant as Voldemort could have reasonably chalked up to his own superiority. Finally the mirror seemed almost perfectly designed to capture someone who was so violently afraid of death /and/ so convinced of his own intelligence. I can absolutely picture Voldemort wasting away there, enamored with the vision of his own final victory and immortality.

I'll even go as far as to say there was probably a point i'd have completely agreed with you as well, much in the same way I used to think if Shinji (Evangelion in case that's not obvious) should have manned the fuck up and fought some alien monsters. The problem with that is that there never should have been a trap (if that was the plan) or test for Harry in the first place. The fact that a benevolent and kind teacher/leader essentially drew a psychotic madman into a school full of children on purpose is horrifying.

We're all aware that JK didn't actually have most of her world building worked out until she actually wrote each book. That doesn't mean that you can't apply things she made up later to show how horrific the early books are from a (Reasonale) adults perspective. Voldemort was active in a school for basically an entire year, diminished yes but with a follower in full control of his abilities. What if he'd put a bunch of children under the imperious and sent them on a killing spree on that final night to cover his tracks? Just one or two from each house with orders to sneak a knife out of the great hall and slit some throats. He goes about his business under the assumption he's gonna get the stone and leave with the hope that all the dead kids means everyone's too busy to listen if Dumbledore reveals him.

We know from alter that people under the imperius can be made to act like everything's normal, we also know that there are no "Wards" or whatever that detect their usage in Hogwarts. I don't disagree it would have been a good trap, but Dumbledore keeping the stone in the castle at all? That should have gotten him up on charges for child endangerment at least. (Not that the wizarding world seems to have child protective laws)
