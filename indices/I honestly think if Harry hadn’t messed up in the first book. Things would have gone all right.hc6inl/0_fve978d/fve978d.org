Except its fairly apparent that Dumbledore intended for Harry to face Voldemort.

  “Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. “You /did/ do the thing properly, didn't you?"

  “And the Invisibility Cloak --- do you know who sent it to me?”

  “Ah --- your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.” Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. “Useful things . . ."

  "We met him in the entrance hall --- he already knew --- he just said, ‘Harry's gone after him,hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.”

  “D'you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your fathers cloak and everything?“

  /"Well,/” Hermione exploded, “if he did --- I mean to say --- that's terrible --- you could have been killed.”

  “No, it isn't,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. . . .”

The most generous explanation is that Dumbledore planned on being there to ensure that Harry was safe the entire time, but that he hoped he could fulfill the prophecy and end Voldemort once and for all when Harry was still young, remove him from the Dursleys as the blood wards would no longer be needed, and give him plenty of time to have a happy childhood.
