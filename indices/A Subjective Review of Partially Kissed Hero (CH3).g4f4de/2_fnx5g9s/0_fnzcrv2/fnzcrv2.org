Let me see what I can rummage through my list, though I tend to focus on very narrow parameters when I call something 'good'. Taking SPS as an example, the story has its problems - it treads way too close to the stations of canon at times, for my liking at least, and sometimes I find Hermione's angst a bit excessive. The reason I exalt it as much as I do is because it's literally the best fic I've every read, from a purely technical standpoint. The kind of prose I would want from a published work, and a really good one at that.

That said, let's see... Swords and Sorcery is the best example of Fem!Harry I've found, though the crossover aspects of it (with Fate/stay Night) can be a turn off for some people. I would still recommend it, though the focus tends more towards the crossover character rather than Iris for the first few chapters, before it settles into a more mentor-apprentice relationship.

Another crossover, this time with the Elder Scrolls, is Knowledge Comes at a Price. The basic premise is that various Daedric Princes (think eldritch abomination) make contact with Harry Potter's world - Lily makes a contract to save Harry with Hermaeus Mora, prince of knowledge, fate and other miscellaneous stuffs, and throughout the fic he makes a series of deals with him for knowledge. Despite my lacking description, it has more of a comedic slant to it than a grimdark cosmic horrory one. I especially enjoy Cedric's adventures as a thief/antihero figure. I would recommend this even without knowledge of TES.

The Mind Arts is a fic I enjoy more for the magic in it than the actual plot, though that's not to say it's bad. It has a very interesting dynamic between Harry and Dumbledore, where the more you read the more apparent his similarity to Riddle becomes, and since he's aware of it a lot of time is spent wondering how much this colors Dumbledore's own thoughts about it. It has some pretty iffy parts to it, especially considering Harry's own magical focus on Legilimancy and the mind arts in general, but it's of generally good quality and the action is quite vivid.

Democracy is a pretty short fic, but a very interesting one. It's a Neville PoV, set after the war, and it's based around the conflict between the traditional oligarchy of the old families and the progressive democracy proposed by Hermione and supported by the minister.
