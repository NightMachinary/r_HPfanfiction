My headcanon for this (disregarding the dumb fucking "oh yeh they shit on the floor for 900 years" comment by JKR because the chamber is connected to the plumbing and I doubt some random plumber just wouldn't say anything when stumbling across a large cave carved in a snake motif with bones all over) was that Salazar had a little daughter when he was still at Hogwarts, and she thought putting a super secret entrance to the snakeden into a toilet was the funniest thing she'd ever seen.

I still don't understand /why/ he got one. He switched his electives, didn't he? two to three electives is normal and possible, but /all of them/ is what causes the conflict.

Also, I refuse to believe that the Ministry (or at least the unspeakables) give out pocket-sized time machines that can actually alter the timeline (early versions could make people disappear) and destroy the universe if misused without having some method of controlling their use. Like, time agents that break your knees if you try to alter history. A large nexus that reroutes any travels longer than 24 hours into DoM containment until the timestream normalizes. An arcane tether that pulls you back to the present if you fuck with your time-turner.
