I reread chapter 3 out of curiosity and I just have to comment on this:

#+begin_example
       "Although why anyone would want... I mean, rats pee over EVERYTHING! Even your hands if you pick them up! Which, if you think about it, Ron was handling him all of the time, and NEVER washed his hands before eating, and didn't use utensils much, just grabbing things to put on his plate or into his mouth..."
#+end_example

Harry makes this comment after he's done talking to professor McGonagall, and I just found out it infuriatingly blatant.

First of all, rats can be litter trained and I'm pretty sure one that lives with Molly Weasley would be.

Secondly, we don't actually know when Ron washed his hands in canon, but you're not being subtle PL, quit making Ron out as a disgusting slob who eats rat piss.
