#+begin_quote
  After winning the war and defeating the Dark Lord, Harry thought he was finished being fate's chewtoy. He wakes up 14 again and has yet another date with the triwizard tournament. Now he's stuck in a time loop, trading his sanity for amusement, and the universe will never be the same. Includes: sex, violence, swearing, lunacy, bashing, and probably some silly tropes as well.
