Depends on your philosophy of magic, I suppose. The magi are human with access to magic. From my schema, most magical creatures use magic to sustain their abilities, and being stripped of it would effectively give them radiation sickness -- systemic failures as if normal regenerative processes had been broken. They wouldn't die instantly, but the sickness would be nearly immediate.

Magical constructs stripped of their enchantments would just stop being enchanted. I don't know what that would do to Riddle's manufactured body, but I'd think the Riddle-baby would be more at risk than the form he was restored to in the Graveyard. I would assume that the null magic field is only a filter space in that it doesn't remove the magic so much as mute it. Once removed, the enchantments in living beings and Cursed objects would return, whereas simple charms would be lost but reasonably easy to recast.

It's your story, though, so you make the rules. The important thing is to know what they are and be consistent in applying them. Even better if you can maintain that consistency without ever having a character explain what the rules are. Let the readers suss it out.
