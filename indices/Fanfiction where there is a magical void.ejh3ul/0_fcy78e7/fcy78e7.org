This is probably the point where I bring up that one D&D post, where a gun-user got his hands on an anti-magic ring. Instead of wearing it, he welded it to the end of his gun, then got a mage to shrink down a bunch of cannon balls to bullet-size.

Presto, as soon as they leave the barrel, they're restored to their true size, moving with all the speed the 'bullet' was. You now have a handheld siege weapon.
