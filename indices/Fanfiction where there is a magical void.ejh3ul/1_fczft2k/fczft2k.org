For the bag thing, it probably depends on two things: How the bag does it and how the void does it.

If the bag is just a fold or dent in space that allows for more "surface volume" accessible in a small opening, then it's gonna spill out.

If the bag is a portal to a cut-off piece of space to store stuff in, then it'll all be lost in the ether.

If the void works to slowly unravel all magic, even that shifted into higher/lower dimensions/metaphorical constraints within, then the bag will slowly unravel, either spilling out or dissolving into the ether. It would also be able to rob the Fidelius of its power, coincidentally, and most likely destroy a Horcrux.

If the void works to aggressively cut off the flow of magic from source to enchantment, then most things will just de-power. Brooms stop working, Wands become inert, etc. Most likely, the bag would just break, spilling its contents both into the ether and the world as its enchantment fails.
