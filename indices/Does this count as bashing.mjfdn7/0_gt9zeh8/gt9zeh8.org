That doesn't strike me as bashing because we never meet Audrey in the books, so it's just how you're developing her personality with no prior information other than her marriage to Percy. Bashing, to me, is when you manipulate, fabricate, or selectively focus on negative traits of a character to make them look bad.

Unless you're asking if this is bashing Percy? In which case, also no. I think it's very reasonable to want to protect his kids from a mom that walked out on them. You don't need to make your characters selfless saints to avoid bashing; it just has to be a well-rounded and fair portrayal.
