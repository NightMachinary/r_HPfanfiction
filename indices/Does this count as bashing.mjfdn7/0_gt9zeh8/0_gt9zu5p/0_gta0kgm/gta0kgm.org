That's what I thought. So yeah, I think that's totally fair, and I also don't really think anyone would consider any Audrey portrayal to be bashing because we have no idea who she is.

But even if it were with someone we know well like if Ginny left Harry with the kids, it's still not bashing if Ginny is well-rounded and portrayed sympathetically even if she's made a selfish decision that she's unlikely to have ever made in canon. I think if you respect the characters enough to worry about bashing them, you likely are not bashing them.
