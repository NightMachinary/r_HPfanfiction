Ficwad is having some sort of malfunction where it marks stories for deletion. All my stories have been set at the index as deleted by author, but I didn't delete them and they're still up there, including [[http://ficwad.com/story/227774][Holly Polter]] which has a Harry-Hermione thing as OP requested.

Here's the link for the other story: [[http://ficwad.com/story/168679][Harry Potter and the Emerald Coven]]
