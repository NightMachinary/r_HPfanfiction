Him calling her "little girl" is mainly him mocking her out of his own frustration. He's a Slytherin in this and a lot of people think he's a blood purist because he hangs out with all of these prejudiced pureblood Slytherins, most notably Draco Malfoy.

And yes, I'm definitely doing timeline shenanigans. In the fic, Harry and Theo are sent ten years to the past to right before their first year at Hogwarts during one of their investigations as Aurors. This scene will most likely take place around third year, so while Hermione is technically older than Harry, Harry is mentally ten years older than her. Also, he's not going to be a little shrimp, either, because he'd have taken supplements or whatever to get rid of most of the malnutrition damage.

Basically, before Harry's dialogue here, Hermione basically called Harry a blood purist or some such. I haven't actually written that part. This little scene was just an idea that came to mind when I was writing the fourth chapter of this fic.

Hermione's also not really friends with Harry, she's more of an acquaintance, and from what I've got planned, she's not going to find out he's from the future. She'll just take it as him mocking her because he's upset that everyone keeps thinking that he'd ignore the fact that his mother was Muggleborn, which is what this scene basically is.
