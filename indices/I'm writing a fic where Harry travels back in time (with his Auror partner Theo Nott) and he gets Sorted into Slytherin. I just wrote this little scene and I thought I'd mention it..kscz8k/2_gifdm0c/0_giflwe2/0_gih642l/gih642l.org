I'd side with Hermione here. She's s muggleborn that gets called mudblood. Why would she not think that he's a blood purist when he hangs out with them, when there are plenty of half blood like Snape and Voldemort that were both half blood and bloodpurist.

If you're surrounding yourself with openly racist people (calling for death of muggleborn level), I'm going to assume you're racist. Saying your mother is muggleborn would be just an excuse if you can tolerate the people that would want to see her death enough to be friends with them.
