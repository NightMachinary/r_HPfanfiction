I see from your other comments that this is a time travel fic, which is one of my favorite tropes so I'll definitely check it out. In my opinion, the interaction between Harry and Hermione would be more impactful if Harry's response was less angry and more controlled. Considering the fact that he's mentally so much older than her, if she'd been rude to him previously, it would be like a little kid insulting an adult, which is not very threatening and less likely to induce anger. I'd expect this response from a teenage Slytherin Harry, but from an adult, I don't buy it quite as much.

Others may disagree, but I feel that the scene would come across better if he simply stated his viewpoint as though it were obvious and she was dense for believing otherwise, rather than getting angry (or showing his anger outwardly, at least).

Just my opinion, based on my personal preferences.
