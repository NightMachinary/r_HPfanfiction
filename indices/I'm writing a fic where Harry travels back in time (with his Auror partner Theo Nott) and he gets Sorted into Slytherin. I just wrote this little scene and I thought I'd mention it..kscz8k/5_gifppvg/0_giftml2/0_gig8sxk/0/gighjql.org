I can understand Harry acting like a teenager when he's an adult being odd. I just randomly got an idea for the scene and I wanted to see people's thoughts on it.

I said in another response that Harry's emotional state is with him in his mid-to-late teens so that kinda corresponds with his response. Harry's pretty much frustrated at this point and Hermione pushed him just a little bit too far. (Basically, the time travel stuff messed with his mind, kind of regressing his emotional state a bit, and he's also going through puberty at this time, which is not only affecting his emotions but also his magic, which is something he's so in-tuned with.)

I'll definitely make a note of him doing it differently. I still want to have him holding her wrist since she was going to slap him and that would gather her full attention, though. It's also a little scare factor, which I want him to use to get her to listen. Him mocking her slightly while sounding so serious and as if it's obvious is a really good idea, though.

How about this? (Also, please be aware that I just cranked this out without reading it over.):

  Harry grasped Hermione's wrist in his hand as she went to slap him, his green eyes staring coldly into her wide, surprised brown ones.

  "Listen here and listen well, Granger," said Harry seriously, tightening his hold on Hermione's wrist when she tried to pull her hand out of his grasp. He paid no mind to her other hand, which was beating against his arms and sides in frustration as she failed to get him to let go of her. He continued in a flat, almost mocking tone, "Do not presume you know me or my ambitions, because I will only say this once, you /do not/. I may be a Slytherin, little girl, but that does not mean my ideals align with what your ignorant little mind /thinks/ what the other Slytherins think about you and your parentage.

  "You say I dislike Muggleborns and that I belive that you're not smart enough to be in this school, but you would be /wrong/. You don't /listen/ when people tell you things, do you, Granger? You only hear or read one opinion or book and make up your mind. You hear 'Slytherin' and automatically think 'prejudiced purebloods', do you not?"

  Harry stopped talking and watched as Hermione's lips thinned. She had stopped hitting him when it became clear that she wasn't going to get out of his hold until he was ready to let her go. Her cheeks blotched red at his mocking comments and tone but she didn't dare to speak.

  "You need to /understand/ why many witches and wizards, not just purebloods, think that Muggleborns shouldn't be included in the wizarding world. It's not because they think your blood is dirty---though I won't deny that there are those who certainly think that, as idiotic as they are---it is because Muggleborns either don't care to learn wizarding customs or because they /refuse/ to learn, even when they're given the chance.

  "And Muggleborns, they /think/ that /we're/ the backwards ones. They and who the old families refer to as 'blood traitors' think that it is /all right/ to remove our customs. Have you ever thought about why Hogwarts, a /magical school/, celebrates /Christian holidays/? No? Well, I'll tell you.

  "It's because Albus Dumbledore, champion of the Light, believed that /our/ customs, the pagan holidays, are not /welcoming/ to Muggleborns like you with small, little minds. That our praying to our chosen gods or goddesses, that our celebrating the solsitces, that us doing /harmless/ /rituals/, are /wrong/ and /dark/ and /backwards/. And if we want to celebrate them, we have to celebrate them in /private/. And yet the everyone else can openly celebrate those holidays?

  "Do you think that is fair, Granger?"

  Hermione had started to shake half-way through his cold, intense rant and her eyes were glossy with unshed tears. Harry's dark, unkind eyes stared unsympathetically into Hermione's. He might feel bad about scaring Hermione later, but she /needed/ to hear the truth. She was a very intelligent girl, somewhat open-minded, too, but all she wanted to do was /change/ the wizarding world; because she believed it was /backwards/ and /wrong/. She never thought that perhaps things were the way they were for a /reason/.

  "Do you think that is fair?" Harry asked once more, tugging Hermione's wrist to make her react. She shook her head mutely.

  Harry continued softly, "Good, because it's not. It's not /fair/ that people think these things based on a few comments they heard. It's not /fair/ that people make up opinions based on the rumours of others. It's not /fair/ that you think that I, /whose 'Mudblood' mother sacrificed her life for mine/, think that Muggleborns aren't even worth the dirt beneath my shoes."

  It was Harry parroting her words back to her that made Hermione's tears finally fall. Her shoulders hitched up in a silent sob and Harry let go of her wrist and stepped away from her. He watched blankly as Hermione grabbed her fallen bag and ran off without looking back at him.

  He stood there for a moment longer before picking up his satchel and walking the opposite way to the Great Hall past Theo---who'd stood beside him silently during his whole rant---without a single glance.

  He wasn't feeling hungry anymore.
