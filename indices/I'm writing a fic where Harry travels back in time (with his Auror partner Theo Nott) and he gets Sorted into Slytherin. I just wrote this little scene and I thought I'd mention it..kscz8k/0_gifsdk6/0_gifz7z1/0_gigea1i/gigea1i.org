I loved the "I may be a Slytherin, little girl", but what I really would love is a sceptical Harry being sold to the travel back in time plan with his auror partner by the unspeakable telling him that "Harry's future conscious or whatever would be put into his younger body."

And maybe another reason than dealing with Voldemort for once, but rather preventing the makings of the dark lord they have to deal with when Harry is in his 30s or 40s, or maybe that Harry is selected for the time travel because the Dursleys abuse made him into a high functioning obscurial, and they hope that if he is young and solid enough they can prevent that clusterfuck from really happening.

I used to love time travel fics, but somewhere along the line it became a paint by the numbers dealing-swiftly-with-horcruxes, or how-to-do-canon-hogwarts differently, and they started to bore me to tears.

Bonus points if time traveling Harry doesn't need to go to Hogwarts at all but does something completely different while avoiding everyone looking for an errant child.
