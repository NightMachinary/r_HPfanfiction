I can't remember the name, but there's a legit time-travel one where Harry goes back in his adult body and basically adopts his younger self after saving him from the Durselys. He does not become a professor like most. But actually works behind the scenes trying his utmost to give himself a "normal" childhood. Pairing is also something you don't see everyday. Harry/Amelia Bones. Idk the pairing for his younger self though. Incomplete as far as I remember though sadly...
