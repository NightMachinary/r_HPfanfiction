I didn't mention it, but the only reason he's got her wrist is because she tried to slap him. He's only holding onto her so he could get the point across. He's also not in the best mindset because he's pretty frustrated that everyone keeps making generalizations about him just because he's a Slytherin, which wasn't really something he thought would get to him when he chose to be Sorted into Slytherin. He thought that the comments would roll off his back due to the events in the past (everything that happens in the books).

So, while not letting go of her when she tried to pull away could have been seen as a bit much, it was just a way for Harry to properly get Hermione's attention so she doesn't continue her frustrated/angry rant that led her to trying to slap him in the first place.

Also, like in most time travel fics, Harry's future conscious or whatever was put into his younger body. He was almost twenty-one when he got sent into the past and he "woke up" in his almost eleven-year-old body, so to speak. So even though he's mentally an adult, he's physically the same age as Hermione in this and Hermione's fourteen here. Due to this, no one who saw the whole scene (i.e. Hermione going to slap Harry and Harry grabbing her wrist to prevent her from slapping him) is going to think him grabbing her is wrong. They'll think that him grabbing her wrist to stop her from slapping him is justified. The only people who will see it as wrong are the teachers, and that's only because he's a boy grabbing a girl/they didn't see the whole scene/he should have let go of her right away or when she tried to pull away.

There /is/ about a nine year difference here mentally (which could be considered a lot since she's a teen/he's a young adult) but Harry's emotional state kinda regressed a bit due to the ritual that sent him to the past (and because he's going through puberty again and the fluctuating hormones/emotions that causes), so while he's got twenty-three years of memories inside his mind, he's more-so around the mindset of a sixteen/seventeen/eighteen-year-old.

Objectively, Harry knows that he shouldn't have continued to hold her wrist and should have let go when she tried to pull away from him, but he was doing it for a reason. Also, this version of Harry isn't particularly as "chivalrous" as he was in the past (the book version of him), so he doesn't mind using a more forceful method to get his point across it need be. He'll have done something similar to this in the past during confrontations with older Slytherins who thought he shouldn't have been in Slytherin.

And the way I'm looking at Harry holding her wrist is sort of the way a parent would grab a child's hand to stop them from doing something or to get their attention if they're doing something wrong/potentially dangerous. It's not to physically hurt them or anything, it's just to forcefully grab their attention and to stop them from doing something.

Hope that clears up any misconceptions here.
