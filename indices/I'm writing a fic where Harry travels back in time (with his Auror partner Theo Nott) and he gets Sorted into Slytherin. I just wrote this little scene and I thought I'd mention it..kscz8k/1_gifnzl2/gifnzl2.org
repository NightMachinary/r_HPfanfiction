If you're going for anti-anti-Slytherins, maybe don't imply that all the other Slytherins just inherently believe it.

Of course, I'm reading this out of context, and it would make perfect sense if Hermione said something to spark this response. Like:

"Oh, what do you know? You're a Slytherin. You must hate that a /mudblood/ like me is allowed to go to Hogwarts."

I've read the story and I like it, looking forward to new updates.
