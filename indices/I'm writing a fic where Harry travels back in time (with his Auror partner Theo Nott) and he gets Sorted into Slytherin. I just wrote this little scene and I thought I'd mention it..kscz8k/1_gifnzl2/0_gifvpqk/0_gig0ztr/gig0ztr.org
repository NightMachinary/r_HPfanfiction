A slap? Ugh, muggle dueling. I understood where you were coming from on the Slytherin quote as soon as I wrote the Hermione line, but I felt that it was more honest to include my initial thoughts, as you were asking for my opinion. I like the option of you're thinking like a muggle, I think that's a good way to point out the issue without implying either group being inherently superior. It makes a lot of sense. You might want to make him a bit rude though or possibly give her a reason to have a heightened reaction. Otherwise she could come off as unreasonably aggressive or illogical and you have what seems like a tamer Hermione. I recommend going with Harry being a bit mocking. Still looking forward to it.
