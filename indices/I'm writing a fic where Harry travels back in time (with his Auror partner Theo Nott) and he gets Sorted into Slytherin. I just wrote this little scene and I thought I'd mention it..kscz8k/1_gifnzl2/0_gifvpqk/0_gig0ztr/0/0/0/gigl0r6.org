It only repeated a few times because I kind of "repeated" the scenes, so to speak, or more like the gist of them. I also liked the analogy. Only one or two of the scenes will be used. All of those scenes were just me feeling-out Harry's thoughts on Hermione, really. The last scene was what I had an idea of that will actually go into the fic, as well as the second one. I wrote the second first.
