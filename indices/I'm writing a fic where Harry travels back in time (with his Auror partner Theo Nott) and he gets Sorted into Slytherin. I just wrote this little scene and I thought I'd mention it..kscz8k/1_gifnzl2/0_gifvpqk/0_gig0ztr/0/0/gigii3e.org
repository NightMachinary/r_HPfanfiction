That's fun. You might want to use the cat-tail analogy less though. Avoid repetition and all that. I think the fourth might be the best written. Or at least most scene-specific. I don't think it's out of character unless there's a different lead up to it than the other scenes. They're some interesting scenes. Again, can't wait to see it continued.
