  A slap? Ugh, muggle dueling.

No problem with telling me your thoughts/opinions, either. I practically thrive on discussing my ideas/fics with people. I actually made a whole ass essay a week or so back discussing my fic and the ideas behind it, along with two other essays of me replying to comments in that thread. These sorts of comments/replies are usually how I plan out my fic, believe it or not.

And I'm definitely planning on making Harry seem rude. This little bit of dialogue didn't really show my thoughts behind the full scene (because I didn't actually write the scene, lol) or even the reason behind Hermione slapping Harry or whatever. Harry will definitely be acting sort of like a snob (but not snobbish, if that makes sense? sorta just like a pureblood, I suppose) because he can't show his "real" self or anything. Like, he's the /Boy-Who-Lived/ in /Slytherin/, he can't be seen as a total Muggle-lover or anything (and he's not a Muggle-lover, actually, but he could be seen as too friendly with Muggles from the purebloods' point-of-view).

Harry will also totally be antagonizing Hermione on and off during third year and after. I've actually written a few different scenes explaining how he has a "perverse sort of pleasure" out of antagonizing Hermione. They're not really connected or anything as it's just me feeling-out Harry's relationship with Hermione in the later chapters of the fic. I'll just copy and paste them below, lol.

The first scene:

#+begin_quote
  For some reason, Harry took a perverse sort of pleasure out of antagonizing Hermione. He'd thought dearly of the girl (thought of her almost like a sister) the first time around before they went their separate ways, but there was just something about the way her hair would puff up like a cat's tail or how her face would turn red in anger that would greatly amuse him. It wasn't cruel, the way he teased her---he certainly hadn't started to become a blood-purist during his time as a Slytherin---though some would probably say it was rather unkind.

  He just loved to rile her up, especially in front of the other Slytherins. They possibly thought that he was picking on her because she was Muggleborn, though Theo knew the truth. He knew it was because Harry knew Hermione more than anyone thought he did and because he had changed from that kind, shy boy he'd been in his actual youth.

The second scene:

#+begin_quote
  Harry leaned lazily against the Slytherin table, watching through half-lidded eyes as Hermione marched up to him. Her hair was frizzed up like an angry cat's tail and her face was splotched red in a mixture of what he assumed to be anger or frustration. Hermione completely ignored the semi-hostile eyes sent her way from the other Slytherins (his progress in reducing prejudice was a bit slow-going) and Harry had to admit it---his old friend had guts. She may have refused Ravenclaw's House like he'd refused Slytherin the first time, though there was no mistaking that she was a Gryffindor. She practically /bled/ fearlessness and bravery.

  "'Lo, 'Mione," Harry drawled as the witch stopped in front of him, posturing her hands on her hips as she tapped her foot in annoyance. Hermione narrowed her eyes at Harry and he merely smiled back. Harry knew that Hermione hadn't really had friends before Hogwarts---and she certainly didn't have many /in/ Hogwarts, either---and so she hadn't really had anyone who gave her a nickname before.

  She probably thought that the shortened version of her name that he'd taken to calling her was him mocking her (and he definitely was mocking her, though it was more of him teasing her rather than him meaning anything malicious about it), no doubt from the insecurity she'd carried over to the wizarding world when her Muggle classmates used to tease her for her unique name.

  "Don't call me that!" Hermione hissed sharply before saying, "What is this, Potter?" She followed up her question by shoving a piece of parchment in Harry's face.

  "A piece of parchment," said Harry dryly with a raised brow. Hermione bristled in annoyance and her hand twitched, as if going for her wand, something Harry knew she only did when she was really annoyed. A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips as he watched the girl with dark, amused eyes. She wouldn't dare to pull her wand on him here in front of the school; he knew it, and he knew that she knew that he knew it.

  That was probably why she was so annoyed, if he thought about it.

The third scene (which is pretty much a rewrite of the first one):

#+begin_quote
  Harry took a sort of perverse pleasure in antagonizing Hermione, he'd come to realize. He didn't know why, but he loved the way her hair puffed up like an angry cat's tail or the red splotches of colour that painted her face in frustration and annoyance. Now that he thought about it, he'd loved to rile up Hermione during his first round at Hogwarts, so this certainly wasn't a new thing. He just rarely backed off now and already knew what buttons to push to really annoy Hermione, unlike the first time around where he'd merely teased her before backing off in fear of her retaliating via well-meaning nagging or refusing to help him with his school work.

  He certainly hadn't needed her help with his schoolwork back then, either, but he had become co-dependent on the girl due to his worry about Ron's feelings if he would suddenly rise to one of the best students in their year. He didn't need to worry about that anymore, though, and so he took Hermione's glares and spitting comments with a grain of salt.

And the fourth scene (it doesn't really match the personality of the characters, but I like this one the most):

#+begin_quote
  Hermione reared her hand back and slapped Harry straight across the face. Harry's brows rose slightly in surprise. He knew that Hermione could be a little violent at times---he certainly hadn't forgotten the slap she'd dealt to Draco or the time she'd locked Rita Skeeter in a jar for a few months or even when she'd led Umbridge to the centaurs---but he hadn't anticipated Hermione slapping /him/.

  The girl had guts.

  Hermione froze, wide-eyed, her no-doubt stinging hand hovering in the air (that had been a /hard/ slap, no matter the fact that he hadn't reacted). It was as if she hadn't expected to /actually/ hit him, especially for something as simple as annoying her. (Though he had to admit, he might have taken it too far with that last comment.)

  Harry stuck two fingers in his mouth and felt for the stinging in his lip. When he held up his hand to show Hermione the blood on his fingers, he commented, "Not bad."

  "I---I didn't---" Hermione stammered, lowering her hand. The flush of anger and frustration in her face had faded to a pale colour in her shock.

  "You didn't mean to slap me?" said Harry dryly. He waggled his fingers at her and Hermione's brown eyes locked onto the red smear on them. Harry wiped them on a handkerchief he Conjured before he Vanished it. He wasn't about to leave his blood lying around; he'd learnt that lesson during Voldemort's resurrection the first time around.
