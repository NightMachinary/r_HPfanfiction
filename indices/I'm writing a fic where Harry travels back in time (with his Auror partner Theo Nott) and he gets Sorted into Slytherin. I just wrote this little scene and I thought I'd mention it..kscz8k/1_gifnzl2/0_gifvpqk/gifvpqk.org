I don't plan to imply that all other Slytherins just believe that all Muggleborns are Mudblood trash because their parents weren't magical or anything. The quote you made up for Hermione is pretty much what I plan for Hermione to say, except it's going to be more aggressive, if that makes sense, because Hermione's so upset at the prejudice she's facing and she'll think that Harry's mocking her or teasing her or whatever.

(I haven't really decided where this dialogue will take place, but it'll probably be in a scene where Harry says something about Hermione's intelligence when they're doing a project together or something. It won't be rude, he'll probably mention about how she's trying too hard or she's thinking too much like a Muggle or something and she'll take it the wrong way. She'll try to slap Harry because she thinks he's mocking her or something and that's why Harry's got Hermione's wrist in his hand. Again, I haven't a clue about this. This little quote is al that came to mind.)

I can also see how his reply makes it seem as if he believes that all Slytherins believe in blood purity, but he was mainly referring to the Slytherins who treat Muggleborns badly, and not just because of their blood. It'll become clearer in scenes after this one that while some people believe that Muggleborns are the dirt beneath their shoes just because their parents are Muggles, most dislike Muggleborns because they either refuse to learn about wizarding culture, they want to change it, or they refuse to let go of some Muggle ideals and stuff. Hermione will become something between an acquaintance and a friend to Harry and she'll learn this. He only said, "I may be a Slytherin, little girl, but that does /not/ mean that I buy into that blood purity nonsense" because he's referring to her ignorance about the matter.
