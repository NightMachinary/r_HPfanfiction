I'd say around once a week. I had a bit of trouble working on the third chapter and that took about a week an a half/two week to write, but my average is around a week. I've already started on the fourth chapter, so I'd say within the week. I know it's not often, but I've got a lot of school things to catch up on and I don't have the clearest outline of the first few years. I'm also trying to revise my original fiction book which will take a while since I'm changing exisitng scenes.

And thanks! I hope you'll enjoy the future chapters.
