Lol, no. I think my average is about three-ish chapters a month if I'm really into the fic, but there may end up being the occasional one or two chapters a month. I don't have a set schedule and the chapters get out when they get out, so you might get one on the first of the month, then the eighth, then the seventeenth, and then maybe on the twenty-fifth or something.
