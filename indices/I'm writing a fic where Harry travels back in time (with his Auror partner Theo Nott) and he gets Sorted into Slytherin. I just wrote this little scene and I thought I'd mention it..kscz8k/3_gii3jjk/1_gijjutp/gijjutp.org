Everything is pretty much canon for the first time around, save for a few changes like the Dursleys' abuse being a little more extreme and a few other minor details. Almost everything in the books is canon, and i'm intermingling a few details from the Epilogue (such as Harry being an Auror) and a small detail about Theo that I read from the Cursed Child. I also took Harry being a Parseltongue still in the Cursed Child, as well.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione broke apart after the war and became really distant with each other. They went different ways, and while they tried to patch up their friendship, it just didn't happen. They still see each other every few weeks, but that's if they cross paths. Harry hadn't really interacted with them by the time he was sent back in time (three years after the war) and this little scene takes place three years after that in third year. Harry and Hermione are acquainatnces here but Harry and Ron just aren't in the same circles (I'm going to keep Weasley bashing to a minimum). One of the reasons they split apart was because Harry got into darker magics after the war because he became obsessed with going back in time to save everyone; Sirius, Fred, Tonks, Remus... He accepted the darker part of him and his friends didn't really understand and they broke apart because of that. So that's why he seems so AU in this and a little bit is because he's so frustrated and stuff.
