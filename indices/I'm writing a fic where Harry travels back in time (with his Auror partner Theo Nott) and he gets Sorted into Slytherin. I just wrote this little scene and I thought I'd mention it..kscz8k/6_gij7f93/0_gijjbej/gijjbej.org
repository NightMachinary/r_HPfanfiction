Thank you so much! I'm really enjoying writing this fic even though it has me struggling a little. Chapter four has yet to be posted since I'm still writing it. I'm struggling a little to decide how to write it because it jumps to when Harry gets his Hogwarts letter and I'm not sure about how to go about it. After this chapter, though, the ball should start rolling and we'll get into first year. I'm only about six hundred words in and I need a minimum of three thousand, lol. Luckily, I've got a cool little scene that I wrote up a week ago that'll fit in. I'm so excited to write that part!
