My minimum used to be a thousand words but then I looked over it and that was barely three minutes of reading and it looked so short. All of my chapters were a thousand words long and there was no diversity in chapter length. So now my minimum is three thousand (I moved that up from two thousand a few months ago) and the longest chapter I've written so far has been nine thousand words. I've written over ten thousand words a day before sometimes, and I think I hit thirty thousand once.

Harry is definitely going to be in Slytherin, because if not, then I'm going to have to do a full rework of all the planning I've already done. However, I will be rewritiing my fic where Harry's in Gryffindor, if that makes sense.

I discussed this in one of my other posts (it was a long discussion of me discussing my fic and the thoughts in it and I responded a few long-ass essay comments that helped me figure out my fic), but Harry will sorta be forming a "Marauders" kind of friend group. He's not going to pic up his father's bullying habits, but he's going to have a somewhat close friend group in Slytherin that will remind everyone of the Marauders (especially Lupin), and the group will be of him and Theo, as well as Draco and Blaise. Draco and Blaise will find out about them travelling back in time. Harry will also be somewhat friends with other people in Slytherin, as well as from other Houses. Hermione will be an acquaintance and so will Neville.

And no worries about asking me questions! I love it when people do that because that's how I work out what I'm going to do in my fic.
