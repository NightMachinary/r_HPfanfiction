Ah okay! Thanks! I'm pretty sure you said this before but Ron is like not gonna be here right? (I had to rewrite the word Ron like seven times cause I kept writing Ton).

And I'm really excited to see the relationship between Harry and Theo (and perhaps the one between Blaise and Draco?). And I love how you showed Harry as a ward master and stuff like that! Its always annoyed me how he never looks into magic like that! Also I like the way you portray Theo! It's exactly the way I've always thought he would be. And he and Harry have always seemed perfect to me!

Sorry if I've bothered you! I tend to do that a lot! Have a nice day/evening/night!
