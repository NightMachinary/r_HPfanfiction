He's already delved into them. He got into them when he was searching Grimmauld Place for time travel spells and rituals, and he also got into them when he studied in Alexandria, Egypt (because Egyptians studied time travel). He read some about Necromancy because it interested him in a weird way but he didn't try any of the spells.

Harry will be pretty intelligent in this fic. He was intelligent in canon, he just didn't try as hard as he should have. In this, he's going to rival Hermione and Theo in the matters of schoolwork because he already knows it, but he'll be taking completely different classes in third year so he will be challenged a bit. I made him become interested in warding, spellcrafting, and curse-breaking after his studies for time travel and he's had conversations with Bill about them. He also learned a bit about spellcrafting from Hermione during the seventh book. So, yeah, he's going to be really intelligent, but he's still going to be challenged a bit and he won't know everything.

Fred and George are also totally going be friends. They're not going to be best friends, necessarily, but Harry won't be on bad terms with them. He'll be funding their experiments and he'll also give them money for their shop, but it's also for a trade. They'll help him out when he needs the help and they'll also be giving him the Marauder's Map.

What types of fics are you looking for? I've got plenty.

Here's the link for the discussion: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/khrgdh/im_looking_for_peoples_thoughts_on_the_first/]]

And I recommend these fics:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/chapters/31970736][souls touch, and the future changes]] and its sequel [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24096307/chapters/58001593][right under their noses]] (Harry is put in an orphanage, it deals with a lot of politics, Voldemort's dead.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24096307/chapters/58001593][Burning Red]] (Harry's hair turns red and he befriends Draco in the beginning. He's still a Gryffindor, but he plays around with Slytherin politics so Draco doesn't have to deal with befriending a Gryffindor/the Boy-Who-Lived. He's also a prodigy in Transfiguration.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22327684/chapters/53334382][draw me after you (let us run)]] (Harry gets one over on Voldemort during the Department of Mysteries fiasco and he goes on the run early to get the Horcruxes. It's really good.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20049589/chapters/47480461][Evitative]] (Harry is reSorted into Slytherin after he is accidentally expelled from Hogwarts after the Dementor thing.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24410095/chapters/58886953][The Boy Who Lived, The Brightest Witch and The Boy Who Wasn't]] (Harry and Hermione become good friends with Neville after Ron thinks Harry put his name in the Goblet.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9067051/1/Of-Lies-and-Deceit-and-Hidden-Personas][Of Lies and Deceit and Hidden Personas]] (Harry/Tom fic where the "Golden Trio" aren't so golden. It's really good.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1646416][The Silent Ally series]] (Harry gets a pet snake)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4877764/chapters/11183125][Lord of Time]] (Harry/Tom when Harry goes back in time to the forties)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19162495/chapters/45546637][Harry Potter gets smart and takes control - The Goblet]] (Long fic where Harry "turns dark" after everyone turns their back on him in the fourth book. It's really good when you can get past the first few chapters.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25174291][we're not who we used to be]] (Harry/Ron oneshot)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1144601][Grounding Magic series]] (This series has, quite possibly, the best world-building I've ever seen and it doubles as Harry coming back in time. It has yet to actually start Hogwarts, but the little "skits" are very good.)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155/chapters/15133504][Full Circle]] (Harry and Tom are soulmates and they've lived multiple lives together when they get reborn into their first lives as Harry and Voldemort.)
