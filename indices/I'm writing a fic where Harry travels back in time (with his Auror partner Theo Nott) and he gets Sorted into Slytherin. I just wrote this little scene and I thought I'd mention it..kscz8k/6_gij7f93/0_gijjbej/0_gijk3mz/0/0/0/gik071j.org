Ron's pretty much going to be a minor character until fourth/fifth year. He's going to be an asshole during the Goblet of Fire and his family is still going to hiding out in Grimmauld Place. Other than that, no, he's not really going to be in the fic. Just a few mentions.

I'm actually kind of planning for Blaise and Hermione to potentially get together when Harry and her go past the acquaintance phase and more to the friend phase. I'm pretty much planning for the relationships to be Harry/Theo, Hermione/Blaise, Remus/Sirius (I'm still iffy on this, it might become Remus/Dora and when Sirius gets exonerated, Sirius/Amelia), and Draco/Astoria. I figured the last one would be funny if Daphne hated Draco (kinda) and Draco really wanted to date Astoria, or maybe Blaise trying to be a wingman for Draco or whatever, lol.

I'm excited that you like how I'm portraying Harry and Theo! I was always a little annoyed that Harry didn't show any interest in magic other than Defense. Like, he was so excited for magic in first year, so why isn't he interested in learning more of it? I've always seen Theo as more of a quiet, blunt person who wants to stay out of the way. Theo's going to be Harry's shadow, pretty much, and he'll be doing things in the background for Harry (and himself).

You're not bothering me at all! I love discussing things!

(P.S. If you want to read that other discussion I mentioned, I could link it. It's another Reddit post and I discussed a lot of my fic in the comments.)
