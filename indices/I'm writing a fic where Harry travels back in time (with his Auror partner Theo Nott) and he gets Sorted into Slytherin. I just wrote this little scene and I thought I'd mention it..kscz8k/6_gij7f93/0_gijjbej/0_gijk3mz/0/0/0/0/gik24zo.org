I would love for you to link it! I'm on Webnovel trying to find anything of interest and all I can find is just bad grammar and sexism.

Also have you been foreshadowing Harry delving into the Dark Arts? Or has he delved into the Dark Arts? I feel like there have been some mentions but I'm not that good at picking some stuff up.

Is Harry gonna be like super intelligent in this Fic? By that I mean like beating Hermione in the subjects because he already knows what there talking about. Well, I guess he does have to watch out for Theo though as well.

Completely unrelated but do you have any fics you can reccomend? I really need to take my mind off of 2021.

(Fred and George and Harrya are gonna be like best friends arent they? I dont know why I just feel like he could help them and get business from it.)
