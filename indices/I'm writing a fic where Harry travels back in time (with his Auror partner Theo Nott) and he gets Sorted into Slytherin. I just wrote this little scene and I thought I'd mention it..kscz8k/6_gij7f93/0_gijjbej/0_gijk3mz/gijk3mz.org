Three thousand? How do you write so much? My minimum has always been one thousand. Eight hundred if I convince myself that YouTube sounds like a better deal!

Harry is planned to go into Slytherin, right? Because I freaked out when I found this Fic, it was like so perfect and well-written.

If he goes to Slytherin is he planned to be friends with Draco or just have a small bubble of friends like Theo and Daphne?

You dont have to tell me any of this btw!! It does kinda count as spoilers so if you sont want to share it's completely fine!!
