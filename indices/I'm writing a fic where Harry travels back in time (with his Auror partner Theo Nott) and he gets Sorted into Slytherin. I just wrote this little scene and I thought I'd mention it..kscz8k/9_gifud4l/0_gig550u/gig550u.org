I plan for Harry and Theo to become sort of a couple around fourth year in the fic, but I don't plan on having the fic be based around their romantic relationship. There will be a lot of platonic relationship stuff going on, though, since that's pretty much what I know how to write. I'm not good at writing romantic relationships so the fic will mainly be based on the plot, though I do have a few scenes planned that will contain them being couple-y (such as everyone's surprise when Harry and Hermione, who acted a lot like James and Lily did, don't get together but Harry and Theo get together and potentially Hermione and Blaise getting together). I'm not that big into writing smut, either, so there will most likely be none of that, so it'll mostly be something that's not mentioned much. Hope that answers any of your questions!
