Since I grew up looking at the Movie Posters more than the book covers, I have a slightly slanted view on the characters. I almost wish I could wipe the movies away from my mind when I read.

Harry: Similar to the movies, only with a leaner and taller build starting third year. Harry by Deathly Hallows appears to be the same height as James, who himself is described as tall. I also assumed he would have extremely pronounced green eyes since that's pretty much his defining characteristic in book next to the scar.

Hermione: Large Bottom, more petite top (definitely not over a B-cup). Emma is too flat all around, but the face is pretty dead-on to how I imagined it.

Ron: Surprisingly he's the only character I imagine radically different from his movie counterpart, but that's mainly due to the radically different description for the character. Tall, lanky, etc...

Fleur: Always had the feeling that she was one of those "all the right curves in all the right places" types, even without the Veela Enchantment.

Ginny: Large Breasts, toned bottom due to the sports, always imagined her hair as a more pronounced red rather than ginger, akin to how Harry's eyes are an extremely pronounced green. It would almost make sense, as his Wand is Holly and Ginny's is Yew as well, furthering the parallels to The Killing Curse and The Disarming Charm, and Harry's eyes and Voldemort's eyes.

Voldemort: I always thought that the Handsome mask would still be there for Voldemort, like he wasn't as far gone as even the books and movie portrayed him, but still enough to show that he's changed (red eyes, extremely pale skin, and much taller and leaner frame that doesn't seem to have a shred of fat on it).

Dumbledore: Longer Beard than portrayed within movies, more imposing fellow in general.
