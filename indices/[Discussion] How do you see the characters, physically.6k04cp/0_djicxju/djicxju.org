The Jim Kay illustrations are really fantastic; I wish I had seen them as a kid reading the books the first time. They're faithful to the book descriptions and not influenced by the movie portrayals. Harry is thin and small, Hermione is plain but brilliant, and Ron is lanky and fun. They look more like characters from a wacky weird wizarding world instead of movie stars.
