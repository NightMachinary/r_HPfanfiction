[[/r/hp_casting][r/hp_casting]] shout out.

*Hermione Granger:* I actually have two different mental images of Hermione that I flip between. One is a petite girl with little in the way of curves. The other, perhaps inspired by the idea that she doesn't get too much exercise as a library-dweller, is a slightly curvier version which relatively large breasts and a curve to her stomach. Either way I picture her as having a relatively pretty face and big, frizzy brown hair.

*Ginny Weasley:* petite frame, freckles, hair more ginger than red, very pretty face.

*Fleur Delacour:* Fleur is a very hard character to have character models for, because she's supernaturally beautiful so any given real life person will fail to live up to her. On top of that she's meant to be sexy but is also described as willowy, which I feel rules out both the skinny and curvy ends of the spectrum. She has to be in the middle somewhere: womanly but not voluptuous.

And on top of /that/, most pictures of blondes will be unsuitable as the popular "sexy blonde" is very sun-kissed and golden, whereas Fleur is paler, more silvery. She's the Moon, not the Sun. So she's the most difficult character to find models for.

*Pansy Parkinson:* For some reason I have always associated Pansy with having an epic ass/hips. I think it might be an association created via the idea of her wearing a pencil skirt from the office scenes in the fanfic /Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)/. So I imagine her with a relatively curvy figure but not large breasts. And of course her distinctive nose. Despite that nose, however, I still tend to think of her as quite pretty in a girl-next-door kind of way. Not "model pretty" but eye catching with a "sex on heels" kind of figure. Black haired.

*Luna Lovegood:* dirty blonde, petite frame. Big eyes.

*Susan Bones:* slightly below average height, hair mid-way in the ginger-red spectrum, large breasts, curvier frame, girl next door type, either no freckles or light freckles.

*Daphne Greengrass:* blonde, very pretty, very petite.

*Lily Potter:* average height, hourglass figure, hair closer to red than ginger, no freckles, pretty face.

*Parvati Patil:* Indian ethnicity, toned body and stomach, long black braided hair, medium sized breasts and relatively narrow hips. Also applies to her twin sister Padma, though I picture Padma as less toned.

*Lavender Brown:* brunette, girl-next-door type, medium-to-large breasts.

*Cho Chang:* Chinese-British ethnicity rather than fully Chinese. Slim, small chest, pretty.

*Angelina Johnson:* athletic figure with a bit of muscle to her, but also with some curves. Black.

*Katie Bell:* Dirty blonde, almost brunette. Cute face, almost pixie-like. Slim/sporty figure.

*Men and ugly women*: wiped out by Voldemort.
