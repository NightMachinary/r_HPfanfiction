Major characters (relative to their movie depictions):

- *Harry Potter*: skinnier, with less jaw. And, of course, with black hair and green eyes

- *Hermione*: plainer and longer-faced. As much as I love Emma Watson, I feel Hermione is stronger without the good looks.

- *McGonagall*: much younger and sourer than Maggie Smith.

- *Snape*: younger and faster-talking. More spite and fury.

- *Sirius*: younger, without the moustache.

- *Dumbledore*: I like Gambon's Dumbledore, but Ian McKellen would have hit the mark -- intense, but without Gambon's physicality.

As for characters more often featured in fanfic:

- *Amelia Bones*: an unfortunately masculine looking woman (not at all helped by the monocle)

- *Theo Nott*: a typical teenager -- all limbs and slouch. Long brown hair

- *Daphne Greengrass* a very attractive, fine-boned blonde. Let down by a terrible personality.
