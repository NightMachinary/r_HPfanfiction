'Likeable' and 'perfect' are very, very different. While the fandom has a tendency to iron out the flaws in some characters (Harry, Hermione, Draco most commonly), Daphne's /usually/ worse because she doesn't have any in the first place -- she's entirely a fan creation and fandom created her in many ways to be the perfect Slytherin.

I'm sure there are great Daphnes out there, both likeable and flawed (I haven't found any and would be interested in recommendations). Overall though, fandom has yet to agree on any flaws for her.
