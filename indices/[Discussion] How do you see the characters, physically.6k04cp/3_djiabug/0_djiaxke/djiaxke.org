  Harry Potter I imagine as skinnier than Daniel Radcliffe, with less jaw. And, of course, with black hair and green eyes
#+end_quote

I see him a bit that way, too, with more lines to the face, maybe, and a more intense look.

  McGonagall as much younger and sourer than Maggie Smith. Snape as younger and faster-talking than Alan Rickman. More spite and fury.
#+end_quote

Younger would go for the entire adult cast, as far as I'm concerned, since wizards age slower.

  Ditto for Sirius. Also, without the moustache.
#+end_quote

That's interesting, I actually liked Gary Oldman as Sirius, although it's not one of my favorite characters.

  I actually quite like Gambon's Dumbledore. I think Ian McKellen would have been better though -- just as intense, but without the physicality.

I didn't think of McKellen, I liked the idea of Christopher Lee.
