ehhh as said before it's mainly because she doesn't care about how she looks, she does the necessary hygiene to not be dirty but she doesn't do up her hair or put on make up every day. The reason she took hours in my head is because of her OCD like need for the night to be perfect and thus she took hours to make sure she looked as good as possible. Hell, I'm a dude and I don't really care about looks, but when I went to prom for the first time I spent HOURS getting ready, I ironed my suit, cut my hair, showered for longer than 2 minutes (being a boy scout you only need like a 2 minute shower to wash and get out since hot water doesn't last long at summer camp), i clipped my nails, brushed my teeth for 3 minutes instead of 2, had my mom deal with any blemishes on my face, had my dad help me with my suit, and so on. that took about two hours and I'm a guy. Imagine a girl who is going to go to her schools equivalent to Prom with literally a super star, she'd try to look her absolute best.
