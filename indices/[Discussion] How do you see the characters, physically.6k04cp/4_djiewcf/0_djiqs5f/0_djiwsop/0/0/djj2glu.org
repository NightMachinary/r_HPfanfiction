Hermione description in the books are bushy hair and long teeth making her look like a beaver. Don't take me wrong I am not someone who care about appareance but it really bother me when in fanction author describe her as a beauty. She isn't. I'm not saying that she is ugly, but she isn't a beauty either. Besides, as I said, the only time Hermione was described as pretty was when she took 8 hours. Meaning that she isn't much to talk about the other days.
