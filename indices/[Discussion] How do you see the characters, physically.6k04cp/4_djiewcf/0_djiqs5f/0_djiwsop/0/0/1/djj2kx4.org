In the first three books she wouldn't be, and I agree that she wouldn't be seen as good looking. In the fourth-final book I think she finally starts to grow into her looks like most teenagers do, don't get me wrong I'm basing most of this on real life and not the actual books since I haven't read them (only seen the movies) but even from what people are saying, it makes sense for a relatively meh girl to grow into her looks and really start to care about how she looks as she gets older.
