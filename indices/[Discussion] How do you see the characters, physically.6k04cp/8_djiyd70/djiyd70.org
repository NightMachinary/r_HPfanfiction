For me, I see Snape as being closer in appearance to Adam Driver than Alan Rickman. In the first book, Snape is about 30 while Rickman was ~54 years old, making him almost two and a half decades too old for the part. While Rickman was an amazing actor, part of the tragedy of Snape's story was missing just because the actor was too old. Driver, especially as seen in the role of Kylo Ren, embodies a lot of Snape's character, both physically and personality wise.
