  The only characters I feel like the movie really got right were Luna and Hagrid.

I didn't see Luna like this at all, curiously, although it worked well. I saw her a bit bigger, with broader shoulders, for some reason (as there ae no hints of any of this in the books), and with a completely different face. Hagrid was very well casted indeed.

  The age thing really was a recurring problem, as they seemed to remember and forget that wizards and witches aged slower, only when it was convenient.

Absolutely. I didn't see the Weasley parents like that at all.
