The only characters I feel like the movie really got right were Luna and Hagrid. some of the others were okay, but others were severely misscast from their book counterparts (though that doesn't mean it didn't work out). Example, McGonagall is described as spritely and blackhaired older witch. Maggie Smitch did a great job, but truthfully McGonagall should have been played by someone 15 years younger. Snape had the same problem. First book, he's like 31ish, so he should have been portrayed by someone half of his age. The age thing really was a recurring problem, as they seemed to remember and forget that wizards and witches aged slower, only when it was convenient. Like in the epilogue especially, where they are 37 years old, but instead look like 45, whereas they should have been made to look like 30. Older than the books, but not run down and downtrodden.
