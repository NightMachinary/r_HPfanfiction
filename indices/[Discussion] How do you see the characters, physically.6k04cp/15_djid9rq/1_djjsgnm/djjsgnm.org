Actually, you know who would have made a good McGonagall? Kate Duchêne, who played Miss Hardbroom in the 1998 Worst Witch TV series.

If you've seen that show (or the new Netflix Worst Witch show that premiered this year, or even read the books that the series was based on) Miss Hardbroom is not unlike a much harsher McGonagall, and Kate Duchêne's portrayal is excellent.

In fact, she was asked to audition for "a role rather similar to Miss Hardbroom" for the Philosopher's Stone movie, but turned it down.

So if things had been different we might've had a younger McGonagall in the movies!
