By description, you'd think Snape looked more like how Karkaroff appeared in the fourth movie. Casting-wise I've often thought that Tim Roth would have been a better fit.

Karen Gillan would be ideal for Ginny Weasley.

Bill Weasley as portrayed as Ewan McGregor would be neat. While it's difficult to capture Fleur's ethereal beauty, Keira Knightley might come close.

Stephen Fry as Dumbledore would have been better than even Richard Harris (and would have survived to complete the series, which is a bonus). Already he's tall, gentle-spoken but with a capacity to intimidate, and his nose is already broken. He might have needed to shave off a few pounds for the part, but those robes can cover a multitude of sins.
