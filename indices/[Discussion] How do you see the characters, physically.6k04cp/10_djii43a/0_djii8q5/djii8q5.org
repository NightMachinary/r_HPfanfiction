  Stephen Fry as Dumbledore would have been better than even Richard Harris (and would have survived to complete the series, which is a bonus). Already he's tall, gentle-spoken but with a capacity to intimidate, and his nose is already broken. He might have needed to shave off a few pounds for the part, but those robes can cover a multitude of sins.

I never thought of that. I should have. Stephen Fry would've made a great Dumbledore.
