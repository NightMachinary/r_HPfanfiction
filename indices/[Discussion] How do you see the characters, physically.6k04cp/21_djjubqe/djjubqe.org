*Harry:* Messy black hair (not dark brown, /black/), very pronounced green eyes, very lean and average height (which is more of a headcanon because I know he is described as tall in later books). For some reason I kind of imagine him as having a sort of sharp look about him

*Draco:* Tom Felton, but a little pointier and with grey-ish eyes. Always pictured him with thin hands and long fingers for some reason.

*Ron:* Very tall, very lanky, very freckled. Really light blue eyes and hair more ginger than red

*Neville:* Dark hair, dark eyes, gets relatively tall but is always sort of chubby

*Hermione:* Very bushy hair, average height, not particularly curvy. Dark eyes and thin wrists.

*Ginny:* Tall and athletic build, hair long and wavy and more ginger than red, freckled.

*Luna:* Pretty much Evanna Lynch to be honest, maybe more of a dirty blonde though
