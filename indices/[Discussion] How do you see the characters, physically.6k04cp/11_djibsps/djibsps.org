I can only speak for the Trio. But the thing is, that the body changes (height, muscles, skintone, etc.) is more just a Short Note in all Books and after that the Text doesnt consider their features anymore. As i saw the trailer to Philosophers stone, i thought the Goblin in Gringotts on the Desk would be Dumbledore ^{^} Harrys Green Eyes and his Scar are his trademark, so its easy to imagine/remember him with that (maybe his Wild Hair). Ron is (according to the Text in the later Books) Taller than Harry and has Freckles. Its very easy to imagine Ron with his Red Hair, but the Freckles were details, that i always forgot, unless of course, the Text mentions it.

I dont know, how i imagined Hermione before i saw the First Movie, but i know that i couldnt imagine her with her "Bunny-like" Frontteeth....in all Books. She speaks very clear and if they are really so large, than it would affect her talking, wouldnt it? I think Her Hair in the Movies fit the description in the Books, especially the first 2 ones. In Later Movies, her "Bushy" looks are disappearing, but maybe its because Emma was growing and her Hair stayed on that Amount/Volume of the first Movies.

But, despite their Book descriptions and Movie appearances (when Order of Phoenix came out as a Movie, Deathly Hallows came as Book, so i imagined The Trio partially on their looks in the Phoenixorder Movie), it was very often so, that i imagined them in their First or second Year appearances, yep, even in the last Book. When Hermione kissed Ron and he "throw" her arround i had some "Dirty dancing"-like image in my Head and said "seriously?! How smutty are they?" (remember, that i imagined them in their younger/childlike looks). Same was in the Locket destruction scene, Harry and Hermione from the first Movies were kissing. Even in the Epiloge i couldnt imagine them that much older, despite 19 Years in the Future.
