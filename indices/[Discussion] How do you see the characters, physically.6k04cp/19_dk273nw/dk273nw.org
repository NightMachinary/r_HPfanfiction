I have two headcanons about Harry's appearance:

The first is that he has a sort of sharpness to him. The Dursleys couldn't have convinced everybody that a normal little boy was a criminal, so I feel like he would have a somewhat darker and rugged look about him (I got the idea and a wonderful illustration [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/2d/77/45/2d77454fb0ddce616fb925c884b9ab82.jpg][here]]).

And the second is an idea going around the fandom where Harry's lightning bolt scar actually looks like a lightning bolt, like in [[http://68.media.tumblr.com/7660e475cbcdabdb85eed9377b3b59ee/tumblr_na9dt7IlMz1qem0fvo2_r1_1280.jpg][this extraordinary fanart]] that I think is a very good portrayal of the character.

Actor-wise, I personally feel like the closest Daniel Radcliffe came to a physical portrayal of Harry loyal to the book description was [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/61/91/59/619159942a54cc71a36e6f8cfd6eaade.jpg][in Prisoner of Azkaban]].
