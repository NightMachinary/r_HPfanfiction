I really like [[http://scroogemacduck.deviantart.com/art/Leaky-s-Widget-pics-46664400][these designs]], but they're not all what I think of unconsciously when hearing the name of the characters:

- I see Harry as an "elongated" Daniel Radcliffe, basically --- with a thinner face and less prominent jaw (and, of course, the green eyes), but with the same nose and hair (plus the same voice).

- I can't help but see first-year Hermione and Ron as their film counterparts (even though Ron doesn't quite fit), but in my mind they grow up a bit differently --- Ron gets thinner and taller to match his book counterpart and Hermione doesn't end up as generally handsome as Emma Watson did.

- I see Voldemort as really tall and thin, with a face that is sort of skull-like and red irises. As for his voice, I find that Ian Hart nailed it in /Philosopher's Stone/.

- Moody, Lockhart, Percy and McGonagall's film counterparts have permanently contaminated my internal vision. Hagrid, mostly, but with the same height as the books (the films had to cut it down a bit for practicality) and maybe a bigger nose. Pettigrew's good too.

- I see Snape as looking generally like his Rickman version but with a more prominently crooked nose, and possibly slightly hunched. I didn't imagine his voice quite so low-pitched, either.

- The above-linked illustration's Draco and Lucius Malfoy are definitely my version, as is Professor Trelawney for that matter.

- Dobby's [[http://www.encyclopedie-hp.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/08/c18-dumbledores-army.gif][book illustration self]] is close to my mental version, though I don't see his eyes quite so far apart.

- My Dumbledore is also based on the aforelinked artist's version [[http://makani.deviantart.com/art/godric-s-sword-was-practical-25173685][seen here]].

- My mental Lupin is brown haired with a thin mustache, shabby hair, and definitely no facial scars.

- I follow the movies' Sirius and Lockhart, and movie Bellatrix is just impossible to forget.

- Daphne Greengrass looks... kind of like a more dignified Film!Luna, actually. Tracey Davis for some reason I always imagined as having very short black hair and a large nose.

- My Flitwick is similar to his /Philosopher's Stone/ self --- the later, neat-mustached one never felt right.

- Salazar Slytherin looks just like his movie Chamber of Secret statue --- e.g., with those huge mustaches. Not the vaguely Mongol-like guy we saw in the later movies' flashback.

- Movie Lily and Movie James do the trick, basically. I never thought about them much. (Not crazy about Marauder-era fics.)

- Grindelwald looks like [[http://img10.deviantart.net/2b43/i/2007/215/4/f/hp_grindelwald_quickie_by_homarusrex.jpg][this]] --- or, if not this, then anything /tall/ and /dignified/, as opposed to his ridiculous Johnny Depp portrayal. Really, between this and "Nyeeeh-heh-heeeh" Ralph Fiennes, what is it with the casting of the great dark wizards as clownish idiots?
