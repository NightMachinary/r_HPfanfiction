Ah, it's not actually in the movies, but in /Forbidden Journey/. The fact that high-quality pictures of that appearance are used on the wiki tricked my memory --- I vaguely thought it was shown when the Locket was introduced. Been a while since I saw the later movies (mostly because I didn't like them). The image in question is [[https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/2/2b/PR_007_005-e1313269785740.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140615154545][here]].
