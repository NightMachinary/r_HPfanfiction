*Marauders*: Younger than they are in the movies. *Sirius* has shoulder length dark hair and a slightly piratey fashion style. *Lupin* has lighter hair with some gray in it, generally wears old-fashioned 'smart' clothes, tweed jackets, that kind of thing. Both Sirius and Remus have stubble; not clean shaven.

James Potter I rarely think about. *Lily* has a shock of red hair nearly down to her waist, and it's always an unnatural red, maybe due to her magic or maybe she started dyeing it at an early age. She likes to wear red, orange and green, and usually skirts instead of pants.

*McGonagall* is younger than she is in the movies. She also likes to wear green, I'm unsure if this is in the movies or books, but I've often imagined her in a bottle green trenchcoat-like woollen robe.

*Ron* looks nothing like the character in the movies, being tall and lean and stretched-out looking. *Fred and George* too, similar to the books' description, in my mind they're shorter and stockier than Ron, not taller and broader. All the Weasleys have a similar hair color to what the movies give them. *Ginny* wears shorts over leggings and boots, and has a slightly punky fashion style when she's not in her uniform.

*Neville* is chubby for longer and never loses it that much, instead converting some of it into muscle and becoming The Big Guy. His mother, *Alice* I've always imagined with a practial pixie cut. *Gran Longbottom* has a wand inside a walking cane, like Lucius Malfoy's.

*Tonks* has a short haircut, not a pixie but still quite short, which makes it all the more shocking when she changes its color. She is younger than in the movies and less self-assured looking, but instead is overenthusiastic. She wears heavy boots which only make her clumsiness worse.

*Bellatrix* is much dirtier looking than she is in the movies, and wears more classic evil witch/old crone clothes than the sexy Goth style Bonham Carter gives her.

*Fleur Delacour* looks nothing like the girl in the movies, having more of the look of a rich girl who loves her horses - very high-society and elegant and beautiful, but also able to be very practical too. Similarly, *Krum* looks older than he is and more like a male model, because the characters are meant to be surprised he's still in school and he's meant to be a teen idol.

*Narcissa Malfoy* is fully blonde, and a more elegant ice queen, grown-up Regina George than we get in the movies. I will say that movie-verse Lucius and Draco were pretty accurate to how I imagined them, though, although I didn't see their blonde hair as /that/ white-blonde, they were more natural.
