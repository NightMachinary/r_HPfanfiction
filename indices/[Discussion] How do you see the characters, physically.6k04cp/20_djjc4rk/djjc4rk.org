Harry I always pictured (when he's younger/eleven at least) being very pale and small, general features as having very black curly hair. I don't mean small ringlets but more like large curls and cowlicks (which when you have short hair makes it looks very messy and impossible to keep flat). When he's older having darker tanned skin, around 6 foot or more tall especially by age 17, also his eyes as /almost/ unnaturally green - or at least light enough that they stand out. I'm also one of those of the opinion that Harry isn't only caucasian. Same with Hermione who i've always imagined fairly dark (for someone living in england lol) and 3c hair.
