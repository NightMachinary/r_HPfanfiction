I'll just note some of the characters I think we see alot off, I mostly think of them as they were at Bill and Fleurs wedding as that is their last hurrah.

Harry - about average height around 5'9"-5'11", wiry but with growing well defined muscles, squared shoulders. Wild hair that is just long enough that he can tuck it behind his ear when trying to smooth it out

Ron - Very tall 6'3"-6'6", very thin as all the food went to his bones. Slightly rounded shoulders, A "more on top" hair cut, huge wing span and long tall legs, and large hands. Not overly defined

Hermione - short 5'2"-5'4", average body shape, soft stomach showing her easier life style, bit of a rounder... Bottom. Short legs and arms. Very long and curly hair.

Ginny - Slightly taller than Hermione, 5'5"-5'7", thin dancers like body. Slightly lacking in curves but she is very fit having some nice muscles. Long legged even for not being extraordinarily tall. Pin straight hair cut short around her ears.

Fred and George - 5'7"-5'10", thick brawny bodies with what you would call Barrel chest. Not very defined but with large beaters muscles. Noticeable cuts, burns and callous on their hands. Straight hair that ends at the Top of their necks, shaved sides of their heads

Neville - 5'11" - 6'2", tall but squared shoulders. Huge biceps but soft stomach, even with a bit of pudge still there. Long torso average limbs. Long hair tied back

Draco - 5'7" - 5'9" very thin and wiry, avoiding working physically left him with a lack of muscle tone, long nosed and a bit pinched in fact. Slicks hair back around the tops of his shoulders.
