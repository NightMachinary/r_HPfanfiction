The Jim Kay [[https://19818-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/803/4c/DracoJimKay.jpg][Draco illustration]] is very close to how I picture him. I think the chin should be a little pointier, but this is from the first book, so as he got older, I could see him getting more angular.

For Luna I kinda picture Allison Harvard, since she has the [[https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G9UmdTiTOWw/UAM9Gm0qaQI/AAAAAAAAAR0/nsIhO6DiUws/s1600/allicat.jpg][quirky look]] and the [[http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/33600000/Allison-allison-harvard-33613190-500-500.png][massive eyes]], but with dirtier blonde hair.

For Snape I see someone like [[http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/14000000/Tim-Roth-4-tim-roth-14098174-400-505.jpg][Tim Roth]] but a bit thinner-faced, and perhaps with [[http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.447407.1314595275!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/alg-adrian-brody-jpg.jpg][Adrian Brody's nose]].

For Sirius, I like [[http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1506980/images/o-BEN-WHISHAW-facebook.jpg][Ben Whishaw]].

Ginny I see as someone with bright/lively eyes and face. [[https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/2013/09/11/164/n/1922398/6172ce55ae14f23c_180334541_10.preview.jpg][Liv Freundlich (right)]] could be a good fit.

I think Hermione was cast perfectly.

I can't find someone who resembles the Harry or the Ron I see in my head.
