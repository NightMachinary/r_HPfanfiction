Would it be pointless of me to say that I mostly liked the movie actors? I don't get people who harp on movies for not getting some canon things just right. A movie is an adaptation, it can never and shouldn't try, imo, to be a 1:1 translation of the source material.

A few nitpicks. Daniel Radcliffe was too short starting with OotP.

Snape's problem wasn't even Alan Rickman's age, it was the shape he was in. Fitness has a huge effect on how old you look (compare say Laurence Fishburne to Tom Cruise - same age). I always thought of Snape as perhaps not athletic, but slim. The movie look got especially egregious in the 6th film. Otherwise, Rickman was great.

James and Lily were obviously miscast with much too old actors. I used to hate Remus' casting, but the actor captured the haggard, tired look rather well, so I don't mind it so much anymore. And I'm sorry, but Sirius' hair and pornstache make him look like a disco pornstar. All that's missing is bell bottoms and a Bee Gees shirt. So yeah, I suppose I actually hate Sirius' look in the movies. Not the actor, mind you. Just that fucking hair.

I love that meme where someone took a frame from The Hangover of the wolf pack walking down a hallway and labeled Cooper as Sirius, Bartha as James, Helms as Remus and Galifianakis as Peter. I like it not so much because of looks of the actors (though that doesn't hurt) but I think it works pretty well with regards to connecting Hangover characters with the Marauders.

Apart from height issues in later movies (and acting notwithstanding, we're just objectifying people itt), I liked Radcliffe as Harry. I liked Grint as Ron. I find nothing wrong with Hermione growing up to be a looker. Clearly, Ron was onto something! (btw, everyone who's ever said that "it's inner beauty that matters" must be shown the inside of a human. We're all fucking gross under the skin)

This one seems to tick people off as well, but I liked Gambon's Dumbledore. And on that note, I liked his interpretation of the character, even more than the - apparently more canon-faithful - Harris performance. We've all seen that meme. "Dumbledore said calmly vs DID YOU PUT YAR NAME IN DA GOBLET OF FIYAH" . Let that be cemented here. I liked that portrayal. That was Dumbledore with character, Dumbledore who has issues, as one would expect him to, not the mellow fellow from the first two movies.

Fleur shouldda been hotter tho

I am never not going to be creeped out by how much thought [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]] put into his post, it's not the first time I've seen it. Creeped out not so much by him reaching those conclusions as by him being willing to openly share them with strangers. Call me a prude.
