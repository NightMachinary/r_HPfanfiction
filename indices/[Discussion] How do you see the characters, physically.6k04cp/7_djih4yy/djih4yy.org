I imagine the characters pretty much like film cast, with some exceptions like Dumbledore (Gendalf's face will always outshine the Gambon's in my imagination), I also can't stand Daniel Radcliffe from 5th film onward, so I imagine Harry as if Daniel aged differently, his jaw was just awful and the way he acted made Harry look stupid and impassive.

I read the first 3 books before watching the films, but can't help often imagining them as in films even though I dislike some characters because of the actors. Like Ginny (too meek) and Remus with his awful moustache.

I try to picture Remus as a bit like James McAvoy, Sirius slightly like James Franco (I mean his "I don't give a fuck" expression), Ginny as maybe young Lindsey Lohan or something like that. Snape as just younger. Andromeda I imagine a bit like younger Meryl Streep I don't know why. Daphne as thin, haughty with average hight and not very curvy, blond hair, kind of severe beauty.

But usually if I don't see characters as film actors, than I don't really focus too much on their appearance, only vague impressions.

Edit: I see Zabini looking Middle Eastern, maybe Moroccan.
