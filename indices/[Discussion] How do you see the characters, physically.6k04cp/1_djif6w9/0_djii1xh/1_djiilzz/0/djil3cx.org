She's meant to be plain looking. She got Krum's attention from always being in the Library same as him and yet not fawning over him like a fangirl. For McClaggen well, by the sixth book Hermione Granger must have been well known and have an interesting reputation. He'd be after the reputation rather than the girl. Harry is the chosen one and she's one of his closest friends. For him its about being able to look in the history books and say I tapped that.

In the Goblet of fire it took her four hours of preparation for Harry to deem her pretty. Parvati was described as very pretty and we don't really hear much about her at all. She's also described as shrill and a few other less flattering comments. Lets be fair, before she got hexed in goblet of fire she looked somewhat beaver-ish as well.
