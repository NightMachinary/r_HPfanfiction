  Teen Hermione should look like Helena Bonham Carter in A Room with View.

Maybe a bit too good looking, otherwise, spot on.

  Ginny should look like this cosplay on [[/r/HarryPotter]]. Nothing against Bonnie Wright, but I think she's not pretty enough as Book Ginny.

Spot on as well.

  Harry Potter should absolutely have MESSY black hairs and GREEN EYES, as these characteristics were plot essential. Dan's height also left much to be desired, as this photo clearly showed.

Sometimes, I'm reminded of the messy black hairs and I can't help but see San Goku. Can make a fic funnier than it really is.
