Teen Hermione should look like [[http://31.media.tumblr.com/13514be53f797fa1312c2b91d91dfc86/tumblr_mumpzmCS4b1qdylzoo2_1280.jpg][Helena Bonham Carter in A Room with View]].

Ginny should look like [[https://i.redd.it/y4v4ajwukbwy.jpg][this cosplay]] on [[/r/HarryPotter]]. Nothing against Bonnie Wright, but I think she's not pretty enough as Book Ginny.

Harry Potter should absolutely have MESSY black hairs and GREEN EYES, as these characteristics were plot essential. Dan's height also left much to be desired, as [[http://static1.purepeople.com/articles/4/56/81/4/@/417874-bonnie-wright-daniel-radcliffe-et-emma-950x0-3.jpg][this photo]] clearly showed.

Rupert Grint is ok as Ron, but taller version of him would be better.

Lily's actor was way too old since Hollywood people apparently didn't think 21 years olds looked 'parental enough'. [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f4/10/ef/f410efc4253f9de383f7d0add16b6f89.jpg][Karen Gillan]] is often picked in the fandom as model for Lily, although personally I think she's more suited for Ginny, because of her flaming red hairs and brown eyes. In addition, some people like [[https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d2/a8/a2/d2a8a2950b287ae8313182b74208a84a.jpg][Aaron Johnson]] as James Potter.

Richard Harris or Ian McKellen were both more suited than Michael Gambon.

--------------

I'm generally happy with the pick of most other adult characters. Matthew Lewis as Neville was great, and Evanna Lynch was perfect as Luna.
