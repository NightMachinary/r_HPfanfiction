I remember reading a fic called in the name of being honest. I can't say as to how Mary Sueish the OC was, but she did have some of those traits. Maybe you'll like it. It covers the first wizarding war but it's told through flashbacks. The ending is sad, though. I feel I had to warn you about that.
