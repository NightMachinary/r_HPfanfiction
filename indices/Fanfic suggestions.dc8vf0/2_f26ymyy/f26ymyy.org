Ooh I've been waiting for the opportunity to recommend this fic!! Linkffn(The Good Morrow; Witchcraft by A Picture)

Witchcraft by a Picture is the prequel to the SB/OC fic and it's not itself SB/OC but after you devour Good Morrow you HAVE to read it!

The premise of the Good Morrow written by the author in the summary is not even comparable to the amazing writing and content inside, so don't be put off by the summary that sounds cliche
