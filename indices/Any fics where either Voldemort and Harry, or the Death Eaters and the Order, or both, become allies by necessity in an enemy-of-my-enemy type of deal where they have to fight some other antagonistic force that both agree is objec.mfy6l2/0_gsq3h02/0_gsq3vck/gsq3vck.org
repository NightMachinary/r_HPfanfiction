An idea popped into my mind where the mutual enemy could be the Department of Mysteries and the Ministry more broadly.

The DoM and the Ministry could for example spy on citizens and kill political opponents or some such, or create and experiment with unthinkable magic.

Or try and bind powerful mages with Ministry jobs. This one I've seen before.
