If you think this sounds cool, I cannot recommend zeitgeistic enough! Shibboleths has the most creative plot I've ever read, and she pulls it off beautifully, and The Hush of War, Azoth, and Antediluvia are also brilliant (as are all of her other works like she's a writer who does some serious fckin research and planning but then doesn't rub it in your face). You can have yourself a very fun month if you haven't gotten into her stuff yet. It is all drarry, and I do enjoy reading drarry so I can't say for sure, but I bet it's gripping even without an interest in the ship.
