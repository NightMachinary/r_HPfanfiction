Fair enough- I don't write drarry or ship them in canon, but it's so popular that it's attracted some really great writers. Out of curiosity, do you mean you only read gen and canon ships, or you're fine with fanon ships as long as characters aren't interpreted as gay? I've just never heard anyone phrase it like that. I hundo p understand the flaws with drarry itself, but are you not into ships simply because they're slash?
