That's a good idea! I always liked when the Ministry were the villains more than I did Voldemort and the Death Eaters. I think the Ministry's surveillance abilities were really understated in canon, like the idea of the trace implied to me that they know when magic occurs anywhere.

The Ministry is also a joint enemy in The Hush of War. From what I remember, Harry makes a mutual non-destruction pact with Voldemort around the time of Order of the Phoenix, which I think has more to do with his own personal burnout, but then there's something going on with a huge breeding of dementors that he and Voldemort fully team up to stop them and simultaneously the Ministry is trying to make the Wizarding World increasingly insular, which makes Hermione worry that she might get cut off from her muggle parents. The best part for me is when a muggle-born dies, and you see the Ministry Obliviating him from his parents' memories so they don't remember anything about wizards. Voldemort opposes the Ministry in the sense that he's not anti-muggle-borns themselves but rather thinks wizards should be raised surrounded by wizards, so he and the Death Eaters form an initiative to adopt newborn muggle-borns and give them to pure-blood parents. It's the only gray Harry concept I've ever enjoyed.

Are you designing a fanfiction? I like the idea! Feel free to DM me if you want to bounce ideas off someone.
