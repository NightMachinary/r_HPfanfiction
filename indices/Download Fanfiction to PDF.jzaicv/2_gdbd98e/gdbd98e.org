Why don't just install an epub reader on your tablet? On Android I can throw any format to [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.obreey.reader][PocketBook]], if this is an old tablet or no support for Playstore, you can sideload [[https://www.apkmirror.com/uploads/?q=aldiko-book-reader][old version of Aldiko]]. If it's an iOS, Apple Books supports [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201478][adding your own ePub]] or you can just use [[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocketbook-reader/id805488884][PocketBook]] that doesn't involve jumping through hoops.

I noticed you mention "or text", I just tried [[https://ficsave.xyz/][FicSave]] and [[https://fanfictionloader.appspot.com/][FanFictionDownLoader]] to download the text version from a short FF.net fic with 6 chapters, both work well (though FicSave is way faster). Keep in mind FanFictionDownLoader will definitely die soon due to GAE billing changes.

You can also use one of those online epub to PDF converters, though I really implore you to use epub instead, pinching to change font size directly, using custom fonts, any background and text colors, etc, they're far better than PDF.
