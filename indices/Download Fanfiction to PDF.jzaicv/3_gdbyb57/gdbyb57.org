I don't know how to do it on a tablet directly but if you can get access to a PC then a program like fanfiction downloader which does PDF and other formats, would work then connect the tablet to the PC with the USB cable and copy the PDF to it.

If it's an android tablet it should show up and be accessable like a USB stick or hard drive but if it's an iPad it's a little more diffecult but I'm sure there are planty of youtube tutorials.

If you have a mac I'm not sure if the software has a mac version but you can check the website.

Sorry I couldn't be more help,
