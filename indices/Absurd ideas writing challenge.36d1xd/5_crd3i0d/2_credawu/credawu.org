Edit: The story:

(also avaliable on fanfiction [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11259111/1/Draco-Malfoy-tries-to-grow-a-moustache]])

Draco Malfoy had everything he could ever want, whenever he wanted it.

Draco Malfoy was of good families, and he was, by comparison to his fellows school mates, with which he shared the castle of Hogwarts, of good blood. He felt that that meant that he should be able to do what he wanted to do.

He had never seen his father with the object of his desire, and though his mother side of the family had some epic beards and mustaches, it seemed the proud Malfoy lineage had taken over in genetics, and he wasn't able to grow out a mustache.

He wanted the moustache for one simple reason. Girls dig moustaches, and though he could get in the pants or skirts of most girls in the Slytherin house, or wasn't he a Malfoy, he felt that his sex appeal would increase a lot more if he was somehow able to grow a moustache. Or an epic beard, or ideally a combination of both.

To add to the mockery his best mates (or muscle for hire, which he wasn't actually paying) Crabbe and Goyle had already have a magnificent tuff of hair upon their faces. It was embarrassing for Malfoy to be upstaged by the two taller and beefier boys. Sure they were swimming in testosterone, but they couldn't pull the look.

No, it was up to Malfoy to grow a tuff upon his lips, that with time would turn into a proud string of hairs which he could stroke cordially. They would be blonde. -- He had decided. -- And they would give him the looks that he so desired.

But he couldn't just wait for puberty to do his effects, the 14 year old boy had had grown hairs in his armpits and chest, but those hairs weren't seemingly appearing on his face, instead preferring to grow in the most embarrassing of spots.

But he had a plan, a serious plan, a devious plan, an ingenuous serious devious plan.

He'd just drink the testosterone inducing potion that he knew Professor Snape prepared for himself, when he went to Hogsmeade for companionship. Hey, even a man like the teacher of potions with dubious alliances needed to relieve his urges. Not that Malfoy cared. He'd just steal the potion once the professor was asleep.

He had heard rumors that his lifelong rival and Gryffindor (dork in his opinion) Harry James Potter had an invisibility cloak, that, as the name indicated, made him invisible. Well he had no such things, and he wasn't about to ask his dad, who'd probably just laugh at his reasoning for why he needed a moustache.

His training and teaching was average, but nothing particularly advanced. He was just a normal student. Except in potions, since that was his best discipline. He couldn't do the testosterone potion though, since he didn't have the ingredients.

He tiptoed, trying hard to avoid noise, and Filch. The Slytherin rooms were pretty close to the potions dungeon and if he could only walk the short distance. He would have one moustache just as the ones from the 70's animated images of naked people his dad kept hidden but which he had found.

The testosterone would flow! Draco Malfoy tip toed, carefully, not wanting to be caught by that cat, or her owner.

The truth was, the Draco Malfoy epic moustache would make everyone else jealous of him, he'd be adored by the ladies, he'd be lying himself with different girls so many times that legends would be made about him, that he would become the Hogwarts Casanova, coincidently also a wizard.

Unknown to him, Snape hadn't been preparing the manliness and testosterone potion that month, since he was too busy reminiscing about Lily Evans, a muggle born that he had loved. He got like that sometimes, he enjoyed the physical pleasures but then immediately felt guilty for "bertraying" his darling Lily, even if she had married another.

So when Draco Malfoy finally arrived at the potion's room and found the potion that was on top of the table, not yet purged, then he had no idea that that was the wrong potion, and the effects that potion would have on him.

It wasn't the first time it had happened to him, and it hadn't come from transfiguration this time, but it was still embarrassing, Malfoy felt the familiar touch of his limbs morphing and he knew immediately what was happening. He cursed to himself, it seemed that his vanity had taken over his good senses. Who drank a magical potion that they didn't know about? In the middle of the night?

If anything at least Malfoy had his wish come true , after all, the small creature had a moustache, or, at least, whiskers. Malfoy, the ferret, was back, for a second time.

He would never be taken seriously again.
