Hermione was sitting in the library, searching for ways to breath underwater, when the person sitting across of her started twitching like mad. First she thought that maybe he was itching somewhere and trying to get rid of the itch, but the twitching suddenly evolved into violent spasms, and she knew that something was wrong.

„Harry, I don‘t want to get thrown out of the library, so you better... oh my god, Harry, what‘s wrong? Are you getting air? Should I call Madam Pomfrey?“

Harry‘s body was revolting, the muscles on his whole body stretched all the way, way more visible than they normally were. His mouth opened and closed, but no sound escaping, he clearly wasn‘t getting any breath.

Hermione jumped up from her chair, ready to use some spells on Harry or maybe even the Heimlich-manouver, when Harry fell over, hit his head on the chest and suddenly inhaled loudly, before sitting back up abruptly. His pupils, which had started to shrink went back to normal size, and the spasms stopped immediately, as if they never happened.

„Harry, are you alright? What was that?“ Hermione asked, concerned about her friend.

Harry didn‘t react to her at all, instead he suddenly jumped out of his chair and stared at the table in shock. He whirled around a few times, looking at the library as if he had never seen it before, confusion written all over his face.

„What, where... what?“

He continued to twirl around a few more times, and almost hit his face into the edge of the desk when he missed a step and stumbled forward. Even more confusion started to fill his face, mixed with a bit of surprise. He now stared at his shoes as if they were somehow not what he expected to find when looking at his feet. When he tried to touch them with his hands he looked even more lost than before, looking at his hands as if he was on some sort of drug-induced trip.

„Harry?“

Harry jumped at this, as if he hadn‘t noticed another person standing in the room. His eyes fell on Hermione and immediately widened in a mix of shock, surprise, confusion and some other synonyms of basically the same emotion.

„What is... Hermione, is that you?“

„Yes, who else am I supposed to be? Harry, you are starting to scare me, what is going on here?“

Harry now walked towards here, and stared at her, stared at her hair, clothes, the book she was holding and into her eyes. If Harry‘s behaviour hadn‘t been so incredibly creepy, Hermione might have blushed from him staring at her so intensely, but her current reaction was more along the lines of becoming incredibly still, getting goosebumps and almost acting dead.

„But... You look so young?“

Hermione was about to interject that this was unfair, and that she looked fairly mature for her age, when his eyes suddenly started to widen, and his head snapped back to the book in her hand.

„Wait, what? Why are you...“

Without asking Harry grabbed the book and ripped it out of her hand, looked at the title and froze.

„No no no, I know this, why are you reading this? I remember this, why are you reading this? This was during the second trial, wasn‘t it, why are you reading this? No no no, please tell me this is a joke, this can‘t be happening, why are you reading this, WHY ARE YOU READING THIS??!“

Hermione twitched as his voice became louder and louder, more desperate and crazy-sounding with every sentence. Normally she‘d tell him to keep his voice down, they were in a library after all, but she couldn‘t, she was scared. This wasn‘t normal, Harry never acted like this, something was seriously wrong. She slowly started backing away from him, her hand lowering towards her side, ready to grab her wand, only to find it missing. Her eyes jumped over to the table, where her wand was still lying around, which she couldn‘t reach without somehow getting around Harry first.

Harry meanwhile had dropped the book and was grabbing his own hair and pulling it, while frantically looking around, as if searching for something, muttering things below his breath now, not with a raised voice anymore, which still didn‘t make it any less creepy.

„No no no, this can‘t be, why is she reading this, why am I here, why are we here, no, this can‘t be happening, how did this happen, this can‘t be happening, why am I here, why now, I can‘t be here, this can‘t be true, there must be an explanation, she must have a reason for reading this, calm down, there is a rational explanation for all of this, or maybe this is a dream, yes, this must be a dream, must be a dream, a dream, must be a dream, please wake up, wake up, I need to wake up, why am I not waking up...“

Hermione was scared senseless now, not necessarily because Harry was acting aggressive, but rather because something apparently had managed to scare him senseless, something that apparently was still around.

„Harry, please tell me what‘s wrong, I want to help you. Maybe the stress is getting a bit too much, how about we stop searching for today and you get a bit of rest?“

Harry suddenly stopped as if hit into the stomach by something. He turned towards her, and dropped his hands, leaving his hair even more unruly than it usually was, and Hermione gasped as she got a look at his face. He was crying, and his eyes looked broken, so incredibly broken, more hurt than she could even describe.

„...“

„Harry... you‘re crying. Why are you crying?“

„...They‘re gone.“

„What is gone?“

„...Who, not what.“

„I‘m... I‘m sorry, I don‘t understand? Who is gone?“

„My children.“

And with that he fell to his knees and started sobbing desperately, not a silent cry, but a loud and heartbreaking sobbing, the sort where you no longer care about looking dignified to those around you, where the snot starts running and the crying eventually gives you hiccups because you can‘t catch a breath anymore. Harry Potter cried like he never had cried before.
