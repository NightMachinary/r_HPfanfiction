Now that's a good portrayal of someone getting thrown back in time. I can't remember ever reading a fic where the person who gets thrown back in time/into an alternate dimension really freaks out. It's always "Welp, I'm a teenager again... time to fix canon and get laid! Not necessarily in that order."
