Wait , i rer-read it and i spotted a thing.

You both wrote that "she wanted to use snakes to help people" And "she didn't knew being a parselmouth herself" So she lied? Because it doesn't make sense , the whole AU is her being aware of being able to talk to snakes. Without that awareness she would have behaved almost identically to canon. I understand , it's crack anyway :D

-- Addon , nevermind i noticed my prompt was misswrote I'll post this answer anyway to highlight to myself my idiocy.
