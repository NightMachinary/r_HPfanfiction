"I've made your life hell? I think you made your life hell when you joined Slytherin house and tried to swim with the sharks. I think you made your life hell when you stole the stone. So what this miraculous discovery you've made that will get you out of your life debt?"

"You've actually done it? Found a spell to give me eternal youth? So how did you find it?"

"You found the missing key in one of Moody's lessons? You know what, I don't care just get on with it."

"Today is a dark day for Hogwarts. Today we mourn the loss of two of the finest student's to walk through Hogwart's halls. Draco Malfoy, a skilled seeker, a gifted potioneer, a loyal friend and a true Slytherin. To Draco Malfoy an exemplary wizard. And to Hermione Granger, the first muggleborn Slytherin in over three decades. Perhaps the most brilliant witch of her age, top of her class in almost all the subjects she took. She worked as hard as a Hufflepuff, was as bright as a Ravenclaw, was brave as a Gryffindor and as ambitious as a Slytherin. To two great students."

"Now if anyone has any information on the culprit of this dreadful crime please come forth to your either me or your head of house."
