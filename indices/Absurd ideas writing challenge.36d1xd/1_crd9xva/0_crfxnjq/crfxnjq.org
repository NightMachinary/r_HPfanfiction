"So you think you are the smartest witch to ever step foot in Hogwarts? Surely you'd want to be a Ravenclaw"

"Oh you want to be revolutionise the magical world and bring it into the 21st century? Quite an ambition for someone who has only been aware of the Wizarding world for less than a month."

"Are you sure you want to be in Slytherin? I'm warning you it wont be a smooth a ride for a muggleborn. You might not survive it"

"Yes, you're correct Salazar's house isn't just for purebloods but there hasn't been a muggleborn for at least three decades and for good reason."

"You think you can change their prejudices? You're certainly not a Ravenclaw then."

"If you're planning to try and use snakes to help people and not further yourself I'm going to have to put you in Hufflepuff."

"Yes I suppose you're right, you're not friendly enough to be a Badger. Well there's certainly a lot of bravery in you, wanting to be in Slytherin despite being a muggleborn, maybe I should put you in Gryffindor."

"Not going to settle for other house? Okay I suppose I should wish you the best of luck in SLYTHERIN"

"Who are you?"

"Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy. Granger, I've never heard that name before. Are you from abroad?"

"So you're from England yet I've not heard the name Granger. Who're your parents, muggles?"

"What? A mudblood polluting the noble house of Slytherin!"

"What do you mean bring the wizarding world into the 21st century, we're already in it! Don't answer that I don't care, a mudblood couldn't even change what we have for breakfast here let alone the world."

"What do you mean the world is moving on around us? Why would we want to change? Are you saying that our traditions are worthless?"

"How dare you? Our traditions have been going on for centuries and after being in our world a month you think we should abolish them? I don't care about the muggle filth's technology and if you know what's good for you you'd wouldn't either."

"Get out of my sight Granger, leave your betters alone."

"Don't presume to call me by my first name mudblood, It's Malfoy to you."

"You think THE Philosopher's stone is hidden on the third floor? What are you a moron? Why would Nicolas Flamel leave it at Hogwarts when he needs it to live?"

"You think that you, a first year mudblood, can get past the cerberus and whatever else that lunatic Dumbledore is keeping on that floor and steal the stone?"

"Oh you don't want to steal the stone, you just want to study it and not use it? You think that makes a difference?"

"I can't wait to hear at breakfast that you've been ripped to pieces and eaten."

"You actually have it? The Philosopher's stone?"

"That's quite... Slytherin of you. How did you get it"

"That's all that was protecting it? A dozy dog, a plant afraid of fire, a locked door, a game of chess, a snoozing troll, a fire and a mirror?"

"Do you mind if I have a look at it? For study of course."

"What do you mean no? I am a Malfoy and you're just a low-born bucktoothed mudblood!"

"You've lost the legendary Philosopher's stone? This is priceless, not the stone, this moment."

"No I have not seen it! How dare you accuse the scion of the Noble House of Malfoy of common thievery!"

"Just because I'm the only one you told about it doesn't mean it was me. You could have been followed or overheard, you aren't exactly the most subtle person in the world, you're shouting accusations that I stole a stolen philosopher's stone in the common room without a privacy charm!"

"I don't care if you say you were going to put it back, it's still stealing. Imagine what will happen when Dumbledore finds out that his mentor Nicolas Flamel is going to die because an ignorant mudblood stole it to study and try and make one of her own!"

"You weren't trying to make your own? What were you trying to study it for then?"

"Making a spell to stop ageing? I think you're a little inexperienced to try and create a spell let alone one for immortality. How noble you must feel Granger trying to defeat death only to become a murderer!"

"It doesn't matter if you didn't mean to lose Flamel's stone, he's still going to die because of you. When Dumbledore finds out your wand will be snapped and you'll be sent to Azkaban!"

"Fine, I wont tell anyone but you owe me. Big time. Unhand me Granger and stop crying or I will tell Dumbledore."

"No, Granger you can't come in. The train is not counted as being in school so I don't have to put up with your whining."

"For Salazar's sake! Do you ever stop talking?"

"Oh yes, that is a cunning plan talk until I give up. The hat must be broken."

"Fine! You win come in. Crabbe, Goyle give us a minute would you?"

"What is it that's so important that you had to interrupt my ride home?"

"You've still not found it then?"

"I'll tell you what's going to happen. Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel will die in the near future and you won't say anything. You'll keep your big mouth shut and when you read it in the paper you will act as surprised as everybody else. You owe me big for this. It may even be worth a life debt."

"A life debt? It means you owe me a favour that will either save my life, or cost you yours. You will also have to do things I say when I say."

"Order you around? Yes I can do that and more. You're lucky I'm a kind and generous master and I don't have you doing things for me right now."

"Eurgh, calm yourself Granger I didn't mean those things. We're 12 years old and I would never touch a mudblood!"

"Now that we've had this little conversation I think it's time you left.

"/Stop. Stop, leave Justin alone. Come back over here/"

"Harry Potter a parselmouth?"

"The snake is still advancing! Granger a parselmouth as well?"

"Slimy Slytherin probably told it to attack Justin! It was turning around before she started hissing at it! She must the Heir of Slytherin!"

"Granger, why didn't you tell me you were a parselmouth? When you owe someone a life debt you can't keep secrets like that!"

"What do you mean you didn't know? You're in Slytherin for Salazar's sake!"

"I'm not even going to ask if you're the Heir of Slytherin like the other imbeciles. You're a mudblood, and a mudblood couldn't be related to Him."

"No I won't stop calling you a mudblood, it's what you are."

"Why are you telling me this, I don't care if people are hexing you and calling you names."

"No I'm not your friend where on earth did you get that insane idea from?"

"I only tolerate you because you owe me and don't get any ridiculous plans in your head about me helping you find out who the Heir is, or finding the chamber to clear your name. Though if you do find it you have to tell me where it is, if it's impressive it may even clear your debt"

"So this is it? The mighty Chamber of Secrets, a dusty half flooded wreck of a room! The only thing impressive about it is size of the basilisk Potter killed. As much as I loathe to admit it he's becoming quite the Wizard. Defeating a troll, killing his first defence professor, destroying the memory of his second and slaying Slytherin's thousand year old basilisk by age 13! When he has as many friends as he does it's no wonder he won't give you the time of day to talk about your parselmouth problems! There are no hidden troves of knowledge, no treasure not even a portrait of Salazar here! This does not even come close to cancelling your debt Granger."

"It took you a whole month to tell me you had a time turner! And you only told me after I worked it and confronted you about it! I think for that I'll have to borrow it for a while. To study."

"I don't care if you'll miss class, I'm not your mum."

"I doubt the teachers would even notice a mudblood like you was missing from their class."

"You think you're their favourite? Being a teacher's pet doesn't make you their favourite, I know for a fact Snape despises you because of it. You definitely won't be any of their favourites if they find out you stole the Philosopher's stone."

"Yes, I thought you would see sense and hand it over."

"I don't care if you hate me. You're not important enough for me to hate you back."

"Granger, if you get me into the Triwizard Tournament and I win, you will have paid off some of your debt. If you don't the price goes up. If you do manage to find a spell that will stop you from ageing that will be my price. You will have to use in on me first and once you have cast it on yourself and destroy any notes of it and obliviate the knowledge from your head."

"You managed to get around the age line, confound the goblet /but/ Potter's name came out instead of mine. Tell me why."

"You thought I'd want you to? Are you mad? I couldn't give two snitches about the golden boy, we rile each other up but I don't want to kill him. I wanted you to enter me so I could win and show that the strong, pure Malfoy blood that runs through my veins is superior to all others and entered Potter? You think his blood is better than mine? You think he's more powerful than I? Yes he may have had some lucky breaks and achieved some impressive tasks, but I would have done just as well if I was in his shoes."

"You know what? I think I'll tell him you entered him. Everyone knows you can't lie, so everyone will see the truth. You don't want him to know? Is it because you have a crush on him, think he's your soulmate because you both speak parseltongue? Oh my, your face gas gone as red as a Weasley's hair. I was joking about telling him before, but now its too perfect for me not to."
