AU Hermione is a muggleborn parselmouth with no magical relations whatsoever. She gets sorted into slytherin by the hat because she's the "most slytherin individual in centuries" "Blood Purity" was a misinterpretation , it was to mean "untainted/able by dark magic" : moral highground power doesn't corrupt her. Bonus: she might meet someone while he makes a fool of himself hissing in a zoo. - might be nice but found it too clich√®

Plot twist: Slytherin is a "mad" scientist-ante litteram , he was a follower of hippocrates (snakes bro) , did several discoveries in healing most of which are public exept one : a charm to "cure" aging [hint : something you know is a RED not-so-herring you get the point]

PS: This has been brewing in my head for AGES , but given the fact i'm not a native english speaker and my time is better invested into studying i never got the opportunity to even plan to write it. Now if anyone will ever bring this plot to light 1) I love you 2) please pm me
