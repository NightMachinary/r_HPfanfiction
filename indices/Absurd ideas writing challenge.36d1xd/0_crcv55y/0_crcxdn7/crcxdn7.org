/Hogwarts Massacre!/

Saint Mungos' Healers are still compiling a casualties after Hogwarts' Potions Master and alleged former Death Eater, Severus Snape, went on a hexing rampage. Sources inside the castle report that a dinner time prank that left most of the student body transfigured to look like Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, proved to be too much for Professor Snape's sanity. Here at the Daily Prophet we wonder just what Albus Dumbledore, former Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, was thinking having a Death Eater on staff in a school with our children? Has senility claimed his mind?

For further information on:

The scandal that led to Dumbledore's removal as Chief Warlock, see page 8.

The "trial" where Severus Snape was found "innocent," see page 5

/Curse Scars and Polyjuice/

Healer Andromeda Tonks (nee Black), who replaced the now infamous Severus Snape as Hogwarts Potions Professor after last week's disastrous polyjuice incident, is seeking volunteers with dark curse scars for a study regarding polyjuice's inability to mimic Harry Potter's famed lightning bolt curse.

/Defense Professor Sacked!/

Our DMLE is investigating allegations of torture perpetrated by Defense Professor Delores Umbridge after it was discovered by newly hired Professor Tonks that a Blood Quill was being used as punishment in detentions. We at the Daily Prophet would like to know: JUST WHAT IS GOING ON AT THIS SCHOOL!? When questioned about the the hiring practices that led to two professors attacking students, Headmaster Dumbledore would only say that he never hired Delores as she had been appointed to the school under the Ministry's new education reforms. Minister Fudge however blamed the infamous curse upon the DADA professorship for twisting the mind of his previously reliable undersecretary.

/Ministry worker attacked by snake/

Arthur Weasley, author of the Muggle Protection Act was attacked by a large snake in the ministry building where he had been working late last night. Fortunately his attack was seen by the late Healer Dilis Derwent's Portrait and he was rushed to Saint Mungos where he is listed in critical condition. The DMLE is asking for anyone with any information regarding an escaped magical snake to come forward, but advises anyone who spots one to proceed with extreme caution as it's poison has been magically enhanced.

/Mass Breakout from Azkaban Prison/

Minister Fudge confirmed for us today that the still at large Sirius Black successfully orchestrated the escape of a number of his cohorts from Azkaban. Eleven high security prisoners, including his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange, arrested for the gruesome torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom, are now loose. The DMLE requests that any sightings of these fugitives be reported immediately, and reminds citizens not to engage them as they should all be assumed to be armed and extremely dangerous.

For a complete listing of the escaped prisoners and their history, see page 3

/Death of Philanthropist/

Lucius Malfoy was found murdered in his home today. A DMLE investigator who wished to remain anonymous, revealed that it appeared that he had been forced by his sister-in-law Bellatrix Lestrange (nee Black, sister of Lucius's wife Lady Narcissa Malfoy) to harbor the escapees from Azkaban. Rather than allow them to take refuge in his home, Lucius valiantly gave up his own life setting off a mysterious defensive artifact which filled the manor with a gaseous form of basilisk venom, leaving 13 dead. Narcissa, who was away from home at an emergency Parent/Teacher conference with her other sister, Professor Tonks, could not be reached for comment at this time. We offer our condolences for both her and her son Draco Malfoy, a fifth year student at Hogwarts.

/Sirius Black found innocent/

An investigation that the DMLE was keeping under wraps just concluded with the most shocking outcome imaginable. Sirius Black, long believed to be the traitor responsible for the death of the Potters, has been found innocent after the investigation at Malfoy Manor revealed that the 13th Death Eater found at the scene was none other than Peter Petigrew who was thought dead after his explosive duel with the same Sirius Black. Veritaserum testimony reveals that it was Petigrew, not Black, who was the Potter's secret keeper and whom led the Dark Lord to their door. Soon after the trial, Sirius Black could be found lambasting the current Ministry administration for what he describes as their outrageous slander of his Godson, Harry James Potter, of whom he is seeking custody. He refused to speak about his ordeal as an innocent man in Azkaban, saying only that he was looking to move on with his life, and to speak to his lawyer Theodore Tonks for any information regarding his case, and that he could neither confirm nor deny any rumors regarding a vote of no confidence being brought against Minister Fudge by the House of Black.

/Sirius Black hauled in for questioning regarding Basilisk Bombings/

The Ministry questioned recently exonerated Sirius Black in conjunction with the ongoing search for the identity of the Basilisk Bomber. In an interview shortly after his release from holding, Lord Black expressed concern that newly elected Minister Scrimgeour was falling into the same trap that got his predecessor ejected from office. Lord Black was disheartened to find that even after his exoneration he is still being persecuted by the ministry. The DMLE officials would only say that they had exhaustively cleared Lord Black of any wrongdoings regarding the string of deaths employing veritaserum with Lord Black's permission.

/Basilisk Bomber Strikes Again/

It is our sad duty to report the death of Patrocles Nott, the latest in a string of bombings targeting upstanding members of society who were forced to work with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named via the Imperius Curse. Is it not enough that they were forced to commit atrocities in their youth by the terrible curse? Must they now worry about the misguided actions of a deranged vigilante? The DMLE asks again for anyone with information regarding these bombings to come forward.

/The Dark Lord Lives!/

12 of our brave aurors are in Saint Mungos after The Dark Lord stormed the Ministry with his Death Eaters. He was forced to retreat by the heroic actions of the Aurors and Ministry workers, who were tipped off about the attack by Albus Dumbledore. Professor Dumbledore himself dueled He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in the ministry atrium. When questioned regarding how he knew of the attack the Headmaster offered no comment.
