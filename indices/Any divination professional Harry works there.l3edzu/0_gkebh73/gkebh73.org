linkao3(If Them's the Rules by MayMarlow)

Harry goes back in time to make sure Tom Riddle doesn't grow up to be a Dark Lord, he eventually works for a Seer as a “Witness” to basically account on historical events. This might not be what you are exactly looking for as it's more of a time travel fix it fic. It says that it's Harry/Tom but in the first 40ish chapters it's just a very nice family dynamic and I hope it stays that way.
