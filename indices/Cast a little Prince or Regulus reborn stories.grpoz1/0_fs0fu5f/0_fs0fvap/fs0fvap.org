#+begin_quote
  Regulus started laughing at the irony---was this his eternal punishment? To come back to life as a muggle? He was very sure he was dead, he remembered the moment his lungs gave out. He kept laughing until the laughs turned into a sob. As he sobbed, the bed started to rattle and a nameplate fell off the wall. Accidental magic.Regulus comes back to life in a new body only months before the Dark Lord does. He's not sure if it's a gift, or a punishment.

  His teachers all agree that Harry Potter is a strange boy, but they have no idea exactly how strange.(Harry is the reincarnation of Regulus Black and retains his memories.)
