I read one a while ago where Teddy is absolutely hated by Ginny (I mean, she's evil to him to the point of not being realistic) and whilst escaping from her trying to batter him, he finds a time turner in Harry's desk and ends up back in 1994.

I think it ends with him back in "his" time and Harry breaks up with Ginny when he realises what's happening, but the conflict over Teddy, and indeed Harry and Ginny's relationship, are minor plot points.
