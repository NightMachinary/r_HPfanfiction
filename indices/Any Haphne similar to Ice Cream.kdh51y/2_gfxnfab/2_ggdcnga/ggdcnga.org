I read one chapter of "Black coffee, with sugar" some time ago. Hated it. Her not telling him he has a daughter for 6 years? Depriving the child of a father? Absolutely nothing could ever change my view that she is a sociopathic bitch after that, no matter what imagined reason the author can come up with. I could also already see that when she finally tells him, Harry will just accept it with a smile... So, that story was an instant skip.
