Rowling has given us evidence that the British Wizarding community at least has ongoing spells operating in the background, such as the one that detects every child showing the first signs of magic within the 'jurisdiction' of Hogwarts and powers the quill of acceptance.

​

It's a small stretch to me, to then say that the Trace is applied in the same way, or similarly.

Suppose there is a quill in a room somewhere in the Ministry with similar magic to the quill of acceptance, and it notes down all instances of 'deliberate underage magic' (note that Dobby was able to replicate this using his own fundamentally different elf magic) that occurs in areas where it shouldn't (so, just about anywhere outside Hogwarts, its Express, and possibly other exemptions woven into the charm).

Possibly it is able to detect if there are any adult magic users nearby to supervise, in which case it would probably not mark down anything. (But the Trace goes away on majority - honest, guv'!).

​

Then, it might be the job of some Ministry bureaucrat(s) to read this quill's output and decide how to respond to any given situation, if at all. Presumably, families like the Malfoys would be able to bribe or threaten these people into turning a blind eye to their youths' misdeeds, and someone like young Tom Riddle might, upon finding out about it, be able to discreetly remove his own Trace ahead of time (although, since he left Uncle Morfin alive, it is possible that he simply had him along under Imperius when he murdered the Riddles, which would then count as magic use with an adult present).

​

Although this doesn't gel perfectly with the way Dumbledore tells it, I rather think there would have to be no notification when Riddle was performing unforgivable curses on people, due to Morfin's presence: if the authorities were notified that an underage student is pulling stunts like that, one imagines said authorities wouldn't much care that he supposedly has adult supervision.

​

Possibly this more basic version of the Trace was in place before Voldemort's first war, and elaborations were added because of that event, possibly at Dumbledore's own instigation; in fact he would probably have to perform the alterations himself.
