Then you would have a tracing charm which works for seven years, which is yet another Orwellian nightmare.

See [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Trace][HP Wiki]]: the Trace is hopeless convoluted mess, which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Heroic attempts of HP wiki editors notwithstanding, I still have no clue how it works. Using the book canon only (and specifically ignoring anything JKR or HB editors wrote on the Pottermore ex post), I have some thoughts.

One very radical thought is that the Trace is the charm, which has to be cast on some individual specifically and it can last just for some limited time. E.g., it was a parting gift of the Minister Scrimgeour (or some of his Aurors) during the Funeral of Albus Dumbledore, or perhaps it was installed on Harry (and Harry only) every year when leaving for Hogwarts. Why it doesn't work on The Burrow, I have no idea, aside from the fact that it was the well-established pureblood house, and Death Eaters were not ready yet to attack it before the fall of the Ministry (although they knew Harry was there).

It probably doesn't work completely, but I just want to emphasize how incredibly little we know about the Trace, and how much it is just a last-minute plot-crutch of JKR created as an explanation why Harry has to stay in the Burrow for the wedding (because, obviously she wanted to have their moment at the wedding), and perhaps why Ginny cannot go with them (because she didn't know what to do with her, because JKR sucks with the romance).
