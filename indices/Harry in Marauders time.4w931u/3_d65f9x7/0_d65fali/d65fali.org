  Werewolf!Hermione. Remione. In which there are strange magical happenings, time and dimension travel, and other wolfy things. "Hermione mused, in some detached part of her brain, over how fitting it was that she was going to die on Friday the 13th. She'd never been much of a superstitious person, so she supposed this was life's cruel way of punishing her with the irony."
