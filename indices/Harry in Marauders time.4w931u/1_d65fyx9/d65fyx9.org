I would like to read stories where a more adult Harry goes to '70s & became Hogwarts teacher/auror/unspeakable, especially Hogwarts teacher. Would love to read how an author writes his interactions as teacher with marauders, Lily, Regulus(Especially Regulus character never fully developed in any fanfic), Snape, Lucius, Black sisters etc. You can add Nevilles parents, Luna's parents too. Shame that there's very few in this category & the very few are there, rarely well written, most tends to cliches. Delenda Est had some potential in this category but it was completely wasted.

Harry as students, there's few good stories, most of already them are mentioned here. Here's another one: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun by Lord umbrex) - not essentially marauders but 70's. Most marauder era fanfic tends to cliches, slash etc.
