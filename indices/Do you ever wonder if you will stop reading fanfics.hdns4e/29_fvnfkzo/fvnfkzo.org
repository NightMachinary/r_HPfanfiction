Reading fanfics is my only hobby that I spend my whole day outside of work and three meals on since the beginning of this whole pandemic back in February.

I don't think I'll get sick of it. This is the longest sustained spike I've gone, and when I get a chance to grab book 6 from my fam when travel is a little less risky, I'll finally read the rest of HP.
