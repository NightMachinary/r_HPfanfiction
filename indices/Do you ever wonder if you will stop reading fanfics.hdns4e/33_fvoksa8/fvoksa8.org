They kind of saved my mind post high school when I couldn't read fiction books anymore for weird psychological reasons. I've tried reading my old favorites but I get nauseous. Sometimes, I can read nonfiction though. I read my way through 5 libraries when I was a kid. Can't even enter one now. I got back a lot of things after that breakdown, but that wasn't one of them.

I'm autistic and mentally ill and started aggressively reading everything in middle school to combat overstimulation and really bad anxiety. I used to bring at least three books to school all the time. I lived in used book stores. Books-A-Million, Barnes and Noble, Walden. Just desperate all the time. I was teachers aid in the school library at the end of middle school and all through high school (which wasn't allowed for freshman-junior) it was literally a requirement in my IEP.

There is a lot of grief stuck in there. I miss it though.
