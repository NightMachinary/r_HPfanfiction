I don't think I'll ever stop reading fanfic.

I go through reading slumps and spikes. Usually I'm in a reading slump when I have lots of school stuff going on. I have to put myself into this slump because I can sometimes get addicted to reading fanfic and literally read something for hours and forget about sleeping.

After the last DH movie came out I was kinda scared that most people would lose interest in the fandom and stop writing fanfics. I'm glad to be proven wrong.

I'll be reading (and re-reading) fanfic as long as it's being written. It's weird that I haven't read an actual book in so long because reading fanfic is so much easier and less effort, even if word counts are higher.
