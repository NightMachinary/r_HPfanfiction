What I do is if I get tired of one type of fanfic, I switch to reading fics from another fandom. Currently it's Harry Potter that's my main fandom, but I rotate between the ones that I like. It's mainly because I often find myself only interested in reading one fandom at a time, but it helps keep me interested and excited whenever I return to a fandom that I haven't visited in a while!
