One of the things I like most about the younger generation is that people seem far more accepting of these kinds of things.

When I was in school, even amongst a relatively geeky crowd, it would have been social suicide to admit to reading fanfiction!

Which means I can offer no point of comparison to how common it was 10+ years ago. I knew of only 2 other people who read fanfiction. One was my closest friend who I only found out read it by accident. The other was a girl who got publically ridiculed for it.
