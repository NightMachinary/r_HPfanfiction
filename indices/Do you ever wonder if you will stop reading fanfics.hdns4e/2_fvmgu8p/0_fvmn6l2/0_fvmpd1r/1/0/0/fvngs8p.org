I'm almost 24, and I remember fic being a big thing in my close knit social group, but we kept quiet about it around the rest of our school. It was a little more accepted, but I think that's because it started going mainstream with one direction self insert fanfics during my middle school years. By high school it just wasn't as big a deal as long as you kept kind of quiet about it.
