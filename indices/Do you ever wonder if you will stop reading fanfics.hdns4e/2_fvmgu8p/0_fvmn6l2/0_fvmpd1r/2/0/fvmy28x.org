Next time I see them I'll try to find out what kids obsess over now instead!

In fairness, Harry Potter was fairly unique in that regard - it's popularity was unprecedented even compared to some of the historic greats of children's literature like C. S. Lewis and Enid Blyton.

I imagine a lot of it was to do with timing. The emergence of social media and the shrinking of the world, etc. Would Harry Potter been quite as big if it was released 20 years earlier or 20 years later? We'll never know obviously, but it's interesting to think about.
