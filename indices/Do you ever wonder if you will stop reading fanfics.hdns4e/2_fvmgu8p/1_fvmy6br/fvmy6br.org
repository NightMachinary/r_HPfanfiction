the problem is after the main books ended

every other entry has kinda sucked.

whereas a good entry like for example dragon ball super rebirths the fandom and brings it back to life and to greater promience it also introduces a new generation to the franchise.

like how many youtubers make content exclusively about harry potter meanwhile due to fact dragon ball is getting new and interesting content there are a couple of dozen channels making content for dragon ball
