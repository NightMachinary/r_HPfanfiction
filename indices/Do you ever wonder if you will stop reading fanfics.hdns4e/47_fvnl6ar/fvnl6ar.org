Hahahaha hahaha. Nope. Fanfiction is better than published fiction at this point. Where else am I going to read some really hot gay smut in an alternate dimension from the original series with soulmate marks? Or oops-we-are-now-magically-stuck-together-in-close-proximity-aus.

No one wants some stupid, straight ass white romance with characters as stupid as Bella and Edward.
