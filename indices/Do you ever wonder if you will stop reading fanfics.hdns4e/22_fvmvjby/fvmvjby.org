I am trying to read less for the moment, because I'm neglecting my other hobbies. I can't stop reading when I start so now I try not to read stories above 20k. But I still have 45 tabs open with stories to read. Basically I don't have enough time in a day to do everything I want and it frustrates me. But I think I'll continue reading because I enjoy it so much. But on a lower intensity than the previous year.
