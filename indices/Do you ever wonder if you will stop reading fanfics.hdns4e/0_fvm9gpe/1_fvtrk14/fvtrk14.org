I get like this, but for fandoms. Like I will go all in and read nothing but Harry Potter fanfics for a month, then I'll suddenly find myself peeling away for a week with Stargate, and then a month or two of Naruto, before I suddenly turn on my head and instead of searching by fandom, I'm now on a romance kick for a month before suddenly wanting nothing but pure, crack fueled comedy.

When speaking of a singular fic, though, I've found that I can only binge around 23 chapters before running out of steam, but if I pace myself and have a couple one shots to read every now and then, I can power through 1-2 million words in around 4-5 days.
