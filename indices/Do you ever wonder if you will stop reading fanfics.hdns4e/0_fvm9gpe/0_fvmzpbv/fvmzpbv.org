Oh yes, I read waaaay to much between 8-17/18. I would write entire chapters the night before an exam because that exhilaration of potential failure gave me an adrenaline kick or whatever. Eventually, towards the end of high school, I disciplined myself a lot. It helped that I attended a Jesuit school. In any case, throughout uni, I forgot about fanfiction, and really never had the time. It wasn't until now, in quarantine, that I rediscovered it.
