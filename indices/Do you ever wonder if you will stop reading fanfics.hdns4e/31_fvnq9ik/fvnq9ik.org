Yes. I feel like I'm running out of fics to read. There's a few that I stupidly read, only for them to be incomplete and I'm waiting those those, but because of my ADHD I need to be constantly multitasking and it drives me insane, so I keep downloading fics to my TTS reader, and abandon 70% of them due to me not liking the fic. Sometimes I'll take breaks and just listen to YouTube instead, but these breaks never last long. I've actually been so fed up with most dark!Harry fics and I've begun writing my own which is at 4,000 words at the moment. I have a basic plot already written out, but it's slow and I refuse to post it until it's done. Anyone else start writing their own because they feel like they're out of fics? But no, I don't think I'll ever stop. I will take breaks, but never be done.
