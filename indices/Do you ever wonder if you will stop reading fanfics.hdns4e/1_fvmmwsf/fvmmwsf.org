I honestly think I have an addiction. I put off anything other than reading and it's caused me huge issues. With work deadlines and even general things like remembering to eat. I cut myself off cold turkey last week because I have deadlines I really need to meet. It's going to be amazing to pick up my phone and actually be able to read again.
