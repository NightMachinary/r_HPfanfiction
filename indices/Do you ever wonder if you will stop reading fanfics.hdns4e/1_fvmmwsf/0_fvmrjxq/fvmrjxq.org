I've been there! When I was in my undergrad I had to stop reading for a while because I was using reading to procrastinate, and I wasn't getting things done. I took a break for almost 2 years, and it was the right choice to make. After a while, I honestly didn't miss it---it just wasn't part of my routine anymore. Now that I have a job with a regular 9-to-5 schedule, I've picked it back up, and I've been able to limit reading time to my commute/evenings. I never stopped loving it!!
