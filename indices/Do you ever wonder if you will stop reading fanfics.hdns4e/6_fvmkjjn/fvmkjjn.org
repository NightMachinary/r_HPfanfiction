I'm legit worried nothing else will ever hold my attention again. It's been about two years and the only books I've read have been Harry Potter fanfiction. I used to read at work on my desktop because everyone thought it looked like I was reading something "professional" and they left me alone. But then I started reading at home, and then I spent a while Saturday reading a fic, then the whole weekend... Now I'm unemployed and I spend a good portion of every day reading Harry Potter fanfiction!

Don't get me wrong, I don't think reading fan fics has caused any problem I may have, but I'm pretty sure I'm never going g to /want/ to read anything but!
