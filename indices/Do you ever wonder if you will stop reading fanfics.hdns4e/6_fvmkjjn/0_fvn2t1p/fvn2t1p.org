This is so totally me!!! It's been years since I read an honest to god book, years I tell you!! It's just fan fiction is so bloody damn good I honestly have the same fear will like anything hold my attention again like fanfic does? Like my only hobby is just reading fanfic, nothing else. Some people will have different interests outside fanfic like knitting, coding or something like that but me lmao I've no life!!
