To be honest? Yes.

I went through the phase everyone went through, in that I read all the very tropey, very cheesy stories out there like flies on rice. And then, over the years, I became and still am sick of them.

Hell, I even had a small Harmonian phase.

These days, unless a story or prompt is unique or has a unique take on things, I tend not to bother reading a story unless it's a guilty-pleasure read/craving, since they're just the same shit over and over again.
