I doubt it'll ever happen to me, I enjoy fanfic across many fandoms and that gives me a lot of variety. Sometimes I go years without reading anything from a particular fandom and going back is this amazing hit of nostalgia and exploration.

Also I've always been an avid reader, I just swapped books (primarily crime fiction) for fan fic.
