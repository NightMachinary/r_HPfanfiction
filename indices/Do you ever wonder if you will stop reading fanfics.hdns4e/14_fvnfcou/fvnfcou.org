I kind of rotate through fandoms. While Harry Potter fanfiction might have stolen my heart about five years ago, I haven't been reading only Harry Potter fanfiction.

I've also been reading fanfiction on the BBC Merlin series, Sherlock, Twilight, Naruto, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, NCIS, etc etc, I just - no matter what - always come back to Harry Potter fanfiction, always pleasantly surprised at the vast amount of new content that has been created in the short time I was visiting another fandom.

I don't think I will get bored soon.
