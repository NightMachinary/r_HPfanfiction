Sometimes I switch from fanfics to Japanese novels and then I switch back. Or I stop reading when there's too much work to do. I don't think you have to be scared, I live by the motto â€˜whatever happens, happens' so I think that if you ever stop reading fanfics then that's okay and there's nothing to be scared of!
