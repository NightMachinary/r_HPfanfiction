I feel kinda the same... it's my escape, my me-time and a hobby all rolled into one. I don't se my self stopping any time soon.

I have at times feared that it will become an addiction, and tried to disable alerts for authors making new fics. It have helped a bit. Now I only get notifications if there is a new chapter. Yet I still find myself going a week without reading and then a week with my nose stick to the screen if I stumble over a new crossover, pairing, idea or just revisiting old fics. There are a few out there that I could read again and again.. I used to read many books, but these days I loose interest too fast and actually prefer FanFiction
