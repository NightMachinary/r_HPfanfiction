I decreased the intake of fanfiction over the years but I suspect it happened because I read quite a lot of them and there was hard to find any new ideas.

But whenever I have a bad day, or it's rainy outside fanfiction is my go to. After so many years some fanfics still manage to transport me into the wizarding world and it feels like going back home.
