The thought doesn't scare me, but it does make me a bit sad. HP was my first fandom, and when I stumbled into it back in 2005, I had the time of my life and met some fantastic people. Fandom has changed a lot since then, and I enjoy it less. There's nothing appealing about fandom on Twitter, for example.

Now I can go days or weeks without finding an HP fic or a promising new author that excites me or caters to my tastes. But I always have a side-fandom or two to help pick up the slack (Twelve-era Doctor Who, The Magicians, Person of Interest, and so on), and I keep an eye on the fic output there. None of them comes anywhere near the embarrassment of riches that HP produces, but they feed my appetite for stories about other beloved characters and worlds.

Also, I'm pretty sure HP will lure me back for as long as I'm writing in it. Working on stories of my own keeps me connected to the characters and the world and makes it harder to drift away.

So giving up fic would mean the loss of a certain kind of pleasure, but on the other hand I do love books, so it would free up more reading time for published works. I would miss the fanfic community, though.
