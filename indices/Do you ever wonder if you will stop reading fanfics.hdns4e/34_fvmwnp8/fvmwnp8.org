I do get tired honestly... so I rotate... Harry Potter slash ... Severus, Draco, Lucius, Sirius, Fenrir Greyback, and Voldemort/Tom. If I'm sick of Harry Potter fanfiction well... Dean Winchester and Castiel from “Supernatural” as well as Sam and Gabriel. If I'm sick of Supernatural then there's always Rick and Daryl from “The Walking Dead” to entertain me (ironic since I'm not even a fan of the show anymore!) “Percy Jackson” as a very slight few which is disappointing but interesting to pick through; same with “Gone” by Michael Grant - I swear that series is so underrated. It's fantastic.

And if, heaven forbid, I'm sick of fan fictions entirely... I go to Wattpad and I reread something old but purely amazing; RotxInxPieces has some truly amazing (if not soul crushing) books and there is about 30 of them in one series so that will keep you busy, and that's just /one/ series. She has other series up too. There's also a few others I've read that are just worth going back too.

And if I'm not feeling wattpad either for some truly crazy reason - then I'll just reread the books I read when I was growing up; the books that made me truly cherish reading in the first place.

I hope I never get sick of fan ficton; I love it way way way too much. I don't think I'll ever let it go. I'm far too obsessed with it.
