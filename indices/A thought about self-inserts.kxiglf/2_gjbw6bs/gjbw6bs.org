If I see a fic labeled self insert /without/ a pairing. I'll give it a shot.

If there is a pairing, I run.

If it's an OC in a pairing I see Mary Sue and run.

If I see reader, I run.

The only SI's I read are ones where the author shamelessly inserts themselves into the fic and keeps it in their pants.
