  Did they remember to increase the antagonists in a proportional manner? Because is you're gonna give Harry a lightsaber, you've gotta give Tom a Death Star.

I strongly disagree... I feel like Voldemort is best as a opponent that's easily defeated using the cheat of knowing about the/what horcruxes he has.

The challenge the SI can work against is the world itself... as in politics,incompetence, schoolwork/magic, relationships and so on....

no need to keep the old antagonists around/relevant. The act of Inserting an out of context element, then nullifying it by throwing a counter to it into the soup bothers me a lot.
