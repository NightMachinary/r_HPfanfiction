SI traditionally, as I understand it, stands for Self Insert. However, a large part of it is also Self Idealized. Most SI that I have read feel like a daydream that someone wrote down. Which is cool, I like them. But they are absolutely going to end up with more and better powers or resources than canon every time. The question is, did the author present it a manner which doesn't strain credulity or without jumping any sharks? Did they remember to increase the antagonists in a proportional manner? Because is you're gonna give Harry a lightsaber, you've gotta give Tom a Death Star.
