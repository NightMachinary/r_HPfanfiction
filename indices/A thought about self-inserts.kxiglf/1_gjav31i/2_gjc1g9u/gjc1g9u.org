It's fanfiction. You can write a power fantasy, and thats okay.

"bUt ItS nOt GoOd WrItInG!1!1!11"

So? Fanfiction can be completely about the reader and author having fun. I've enjoyed power wanks immensely, and I enjoy writing a strong OC.

If you don't like it: fair. No need to read it. I don't like stories with Dumbledore bashing.

But just because you don't like a type of story, it doesn't make it wrong or bad.
