I disagree about the antagonists for a simple reason, canonically Voldemort is ridiculously powerful against anyone /but/ Harry Potter. Harry beat Voldemort by a quirt of magic rather than any earned skill or power and i think you could write a really interesting SI fanfiction without empowering Voldemort by simply showing the terrifying gap between the average or even above average wizard against someone that powerful.

Just imagine someone as powerful and skilled as Remus... but in the place of Dumbledore during the Ministry battle.
