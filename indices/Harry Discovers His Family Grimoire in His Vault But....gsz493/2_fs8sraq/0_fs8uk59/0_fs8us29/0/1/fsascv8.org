I would argue that it is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as it remains consistent, or at least the caricature is entertaining.

Blood Purity in canon is a bad thing, because it is used to justify hate crimes, inbreeding and has no relation to facts. However, if one were to pursue the thread of thought starting with family talents, like Trelawney seers, Black Metamorphomagi, etc... It could be made to work, especially if those families only get special privilleges due to their long history of providing goods and services to the Wizarding Community as a whole.

Finally, I vehemently disagree with giving Muggleborn a leg up the competition for free. Giving them a small upgrade to mental parameters to express the critical thinking and common sense imparted on them in their youth - sure. That is something they can be expected to possess given their means and upbringing. Giving them magical advantages to match the estabilished wizardng clans - NO.

Like it or not, muggleborn are immigrants. Ones that are invited in, of course, but when looking at the start (new muggleborn just got a Hogwarts/Poppins letter) - they are unknown, they have no prior training, they contribute nothing.

In many works this is ignored, and we have great muggleborn revolution dragging the Wix World to 20th century... Except those usually fail to address both the problems with that endavour and the fact that as backwards as WW can sometimes seem, it's holding strong and has for centuries. Despite that, the would-be revolutionaries usually study neither the culture they wish to root out, nor the magic/technology progress - and why it is not so frantic as the muggle world's. Especially given the fact that muggle (our) growth is not sustainable.

TLDR: Blood clans are fine, but Noblesse Oblige. Super/Revolutionary Muggleborns are not, unless extreme amounts of worldbuilding are done to justify the phenomenon. I think Muggleborn should be able to gain recognition for merit - but since they (from a certain perspective) appear from nowhere, they would naturally lack resources that their more privilleged peers would possess. They would also be subject to less pressure.
