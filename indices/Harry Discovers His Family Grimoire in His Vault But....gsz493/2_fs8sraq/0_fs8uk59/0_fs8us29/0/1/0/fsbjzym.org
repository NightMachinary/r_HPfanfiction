Pretty good perspective.

It's like with clans in Naruto (another popular FF community) - they have some unique and strong hereditary abilities/ones that are taught only to them by clan, but anyone can get up there in terms of power if they're just good enough on their own merit.

The only problem here i think is the canon attitude and beliefs of pureblooded families - they don't feel superior and stay at it, they actively seek to genocide muggleborns - in that vein, that's why wizarding supremacy should be frowned upon. In order to make a fic where some sort of 'pureblood superiority' makes sense is to make an AU where they aren't a bunch of inbred genocidal maniacs, but simple magical aristocrats/intelligencia - a bit self centered and superior, but willing to accept some outsider if they show merit (and behave 'properly', because that's what such cliques of stuck up bastards usually care about anyway)
