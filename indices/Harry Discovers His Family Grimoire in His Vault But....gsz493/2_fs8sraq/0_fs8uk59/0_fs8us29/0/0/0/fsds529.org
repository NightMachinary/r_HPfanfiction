There is a simple way to give muggle borns an "edge", if you make it that purebloods have affinity to the types of magic that their family uses and need more effort to practice magic outside of that, then you give muggleborns a blank slate and then its left up to the muggleborn to create their own niche. You could even have some purebloods hating muggleborns because unlike their ancestors (who developed their family magic) all of the new muggleborns are being boring and general.
