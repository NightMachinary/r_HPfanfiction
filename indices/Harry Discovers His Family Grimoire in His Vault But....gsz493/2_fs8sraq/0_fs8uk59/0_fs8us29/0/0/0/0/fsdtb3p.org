That could work, though I was talking more about different kinds of magic, not general ones, but you could have quirks for each family.

-Potters, good at transfiguration and fire(making clay pots), hero complex

-Blacks, good with blood magic and curses, bad temper and vulnerability to insanity, low mental stability

-Longbottoms, Good with plants, defensive magic, shy, don't like changes.

-Malfoys, Good with illusions, arrogance.

Could even expand that a bit with people having combinations, for example, a Harry descended from Potter and Black, could be good with fire, curses, and have a short temper AND hero complex.

I was also thinking of the Family Magic some people use where the magic is semi-sentient and has to judge if people are worthy of being Family Head, maybe one where there's even a totem.

Muggleborns could just be neutral magic and blank slates and say things like "Hey, maybe it is harder for me to cast a firestorm but at least my family dinner doesn't end in spellfire and screams"
