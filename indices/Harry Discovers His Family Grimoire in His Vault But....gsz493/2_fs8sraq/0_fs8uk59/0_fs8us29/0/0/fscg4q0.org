I think it makes sense(family magic, NOT anime style) depending on how you see magic working, generations upon generations of wizards expanding and adapting their magic and increasing their families', kind of like an /egregore/(don't know if there's such a term in English) which is basically an idea and/or personage that becomes more real with belief and faith. Think low-key American gods.

Maybe after some time their family totems became real and semi-sentient through this method.

Maybe they used blood magic to create one and tied it to their bloodlines or at least tied some other entity.

Maybe family magic has nothing to do with blood and is just secret magic only taught to family.

I don't see the problem with muggle-borns not having an equal advantage, canon is already too lenient with it.

I mean shouldn't kids from magical families learn magic as kids? And I fully agree most families would just block the trace in their homes if they could.

I always thought it would be much more interesting seeing a muggleborn succeeding /despite/ all the disadvantages than just lowering the purebloods to be incompetent and weak.
