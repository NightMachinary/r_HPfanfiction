In a dark corner, far from the treasures of gold, gems and various magical items, stood an ornate lecturn and upon that lecturn, sat a dusty tome from an age long past, surrounding it were shelfs carved from stone with rows of tiny statues hewn from a myriad of materials.

As Harry approached, a heavy feeling of dread and desire washed over him, looking past the book, upon a pedestal stood a sickly green jar, carved into in was a face twisted in deranged grin, seemingly anticpating his approach.

Gathering himself after the initial wave of this *wrongness shooting through his body, he did the sensibl thing and advanced towards the book to open it.

Harry clicked his tongue, he didn't know this language, he would have to bring it to Hermione and was debating on whether he would share his heritage with her, wondering if it was even fully his to give away. Before he made the decision however, the script changed into a style of English probably older that his great granfather, hardly a convenient read but still manageable.

The introduction contained the a retelling of the myths of Prometheus and the fashioning of humans from clay, the breath of life given to them through the gift of fire. The story of Pandora and her pithos.

"A pithos," Harry asked himself, "not a box?"

A cliffnote appeared as he said the question aloud, it described a pithos as a large Greek jar and a page number. Curious, Harry flipped to the page noted and on it was the same smiling green jar behind the lecturn. Pandora's** Pot** of** Greed**, it read, the details of which redundantly described how it look and a sentence stating that the pithos would grant two great blessings upon the one who opened it.

Harry wondered what kind of blessings they could be, he had had enough of the terrible luck that always seemed to plague him and maybe, if he opened this jar that bad luck would be reversed.

"SNAP OUT OF IT, YOU FOOLISH BOY!"

Twisting around to find out where the voice had come from, Harry stood at the ready, his wand in hand in a split second.

"Who's there?" he asked glancing around.

Suddenly one of the small statues on a shelf came to life and started to berate him.

"Can't you understand that it was tempting you? What oaf has our family born? IT IS FAMILY LAW NOT TO TOUCH THE JAR! MUCH LESS OPEN IT!

Harry had no response it his confusion and shock that such a tiny statue would be verbally assaulting him.

"THE JAR WILL GIVE YOU A BLESSING BUT WILL UNLEASH A BLIGHT UPON THE WORLD AS WELL, DID YOU NOT READ THE MYTH OF PANDORA AT ALL?

(anyway i could go further with this, but its 4 am and i thought that was enough, this was a combination of yugioh, greek myth, and pjo hopefully it will be somewhat legible when i wake up from my mini coma of 11 hours, goodnight, morning whatever)(as a side note, the mini statues were supposed to be shabti, with knowledge imbued into them by every Potter using the breath of life mentioned in the Prometheus myth, working somewhat like the portraits)
