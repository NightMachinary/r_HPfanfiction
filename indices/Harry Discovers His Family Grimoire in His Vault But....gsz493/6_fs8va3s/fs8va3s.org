I mean depending on how fast it would take to set the room/kiln to the temperature needed for a specific magical pot composition, it might be decent for creating an insta-trap. I mean you could make it to where a whole room is a kiln and thus it kills everyone who isn't wearing temperature protection amulets because it instantly sets the temperature to the one desired and its dragon fire level or higher in terms of heat. Maybe some of the fires spells could be used offensively and because they were originally used to start/extend the kiln burn times are considered necessary to make the pots themselves, thus they need a specific counter spell that no one but Harry has to undo the damage caused by them as like goblin forged blades you wouldn't want people fucking with it. I mean it would technically be considered dark magic, or just be literally considered dark magic depending on your interpretation of what dark magic is.
