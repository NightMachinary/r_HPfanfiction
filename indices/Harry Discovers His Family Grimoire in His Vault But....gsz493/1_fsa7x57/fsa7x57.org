Wait until he gets to the section on Ritual Pottery.

No joke, ceramics and pottery have been parts of civilization for thousands of years. Wiccan, Shamanistic, Egyptian, African, Mayan, and a bunch of others used them ritualistically.

I saw a documentary once where this African tribe would decant specially made beer into this odd-looking pot, pass it around for drinks, and then someone would blow on one end to blow the dregs out and study the pattern. That's right, Divination.
