I'm writing a story from Tom's POV, so ofc Dumbledore will be the antagonist and Tom isn't happy with him. However, it is implied Tom is an unreliable narrator when it comes to him. Voldemort goes back in time and raises himself, if anyone is interested. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24476011/chapters/59074657][Ouroboros]]
