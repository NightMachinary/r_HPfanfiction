It depends on the definition of bashing. [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/on-bashing.html][I think]] that every bashing is a poor attempt how to cover for underdeveloped plot and poor storytelling, but it doesn't mean that it is impossible to have story with evil!Dumbledore, and even less that there is nothing to criticize on him. Some of his actions are really difficult to defend even if it was because of normal human problems of laziness, conflict avoidance, etc. (leaving one-year-old child outside in English November, not checking up on a child left in the foster care, to start with the earliest ones). And if the author goes for outright evil!Dumbledore without bashing then she must develop the plot so that it is real. So, I rather like “There Will Be No Foolish Wand Waving by kgfinkel” linkffn(13137899), where Dumbledore certainly doesn't smell of roses, but it has its own well-developed AU story very different from the canon, and it seems to work for me.
