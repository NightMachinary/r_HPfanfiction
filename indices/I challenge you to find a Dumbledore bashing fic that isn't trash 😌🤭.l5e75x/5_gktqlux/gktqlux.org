I like On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads. In order to join the premise to the canon Dumbledore gets shafted and hated more than he probably should have. But it doesn't set out to bash him.

I kind of agree that a story that sets out to bash from the outset is not likely to be well written, so it's good to distinguish what is happening.
