Does Voldemort Lift is hilarious. I love a crack fic that really leans into it. And Luscious Malfoy! The author took a common misspelling that pisses people off and turned it into a great running joke. As per OP's request, I dont know if I can classify this as Dumbledore bashing. Maybe that's because I'm too busy laughing in all his scenes.
