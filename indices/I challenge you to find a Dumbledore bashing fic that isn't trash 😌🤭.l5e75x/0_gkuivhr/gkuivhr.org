linkffn(Unfortunately Unbreakable by Luan Mao) is a crackfic, so it might be cheating a bit.

I'm not sure if linkffn(Does Voldemort Even Lift, Bro? by zugrian) really counts as bashing, but it feels close. Harry thinks Dumbledore is an evil mastermind, but he's really just a stoner. It's also pretty cracky.

linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe) could probably even count. Dumbledore is a pretty minor character in it, but he'll probably show up more in the sequel. I'm not sure if it's really bashing either, since I'm pretty sure that Dumbledore was well-intentioned and tried his best, he just happened to fail spectacularly, and the main character calls him out on it. He's also justifiably mistrustful of the main character, which sets him up as an antagonist of sorts, and makes him seem worse than he is.
