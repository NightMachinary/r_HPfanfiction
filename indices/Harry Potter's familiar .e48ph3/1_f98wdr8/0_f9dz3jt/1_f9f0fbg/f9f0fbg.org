I really like unusual pairing.\\
And i've read some with Hedwig (Ones where she's an animagus or just a very smar owl that can assume human form)\\
And even if it's weid, i like it.\\
But It's not what i'm looking for.\\
I'm searching for some fic that shows Harry having a bond with some animal, just like Eragon and Saphira from Inheritance.\\
The Harry/Hedwig pairing is more of a romance focused fic.
