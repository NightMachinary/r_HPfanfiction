Rumor Has It is abandoned but it was fun while it lasted. It's about a fem!Harry who talks to Voldemort through the connection between them and she gets gradually darker while they repair Tom's soul (intending to leave only one Horcrux)

Princess of Blacks is very popular at the moment. It's about a fem!Harry who is the sister of the Boy Who Lived (Not a Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived). She was left with the Dursleys because they thought she was a squib and she uses a lot of Dark magic. The story itself is quite dark.

Knock 'em Dead is about a a fem!Harry who can see ghosts and the spirits of the Peverells teach her to harness her necromancy. It (as far as I'm aware) is abandoned too. But you never do know with Tsume Yuki, it might just be on a really, really lost hiatus.

I'd like to hear some more Dark Fem!Harry's. Those are my favourites and there just aren't enough of them.
