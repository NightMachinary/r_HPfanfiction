But the soul is not an object it's a living thing and therefore would gravitate to another living thing (hence the ritual to place/force it into an object in order to create the horcrux). In terms of in the room if I remember Harry was the only living thing close by. If you then assume (yeah I know) that the soul only had a few seconds to survive before passing on there wasn't enough time for it to go looking.

Also remember the spells that were flying around and the explosion when the curse rebounded and unless the animals were trapped in the room it's doubtful there would be anywhere in the vicinity. Leaving Harry as the only possible "safe" place for that soul fragment.

In reality Harry isn't actually a true Horcrux as his body never underwent the preparation/spells. However, he was a living being that the soul could try to take over (via the wound that is his scar) it is his mother's protection that keeps the soul trapped in the scar. Of course the only way I can see his mother's protection not destroying that soul fragment is the scar tissue is not alive and her protection only works on Harry's living flesh.

And the biggest reason why the "soul fragment" works that way......the author wrote it that way.
