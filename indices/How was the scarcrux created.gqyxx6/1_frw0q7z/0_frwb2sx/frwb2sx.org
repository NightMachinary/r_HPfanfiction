If anything, that makes canon even less satisfying. Especially if you think about the probability involved in the soul's trajectory overlapping with Harry. I mean, there's a point where tragedy becomes comedy because it is just too much to be believable. And the odds for all the events leading up to that encounter, Lily being there and Snape's desire for her ass. Add a ~1% probability on top of that for becoming a Horcrux, and being a serial lottery winner is suddenly a common thing.
