If you're talking about canonically, under normal circumstances there is a spell involving a ritual that is performed after the murder has been committed. Every time murder is committed, the act is so inherently evil that your soul fractures, and the process of making a horcrux involves a magical process that deliberately transfers one fragment to a physical object. JKR has hinted that it is disgusting so I've always inferred from context that it likely involves dismembering the body or perhaps cannibalism.

For the scarcrux in particular, it was caused by the instability of Voldemort's soul. He had made so many horcruxes that the remaining fragments were unstable. My understanding is that when his own killing curse rebounded, one of the remaining pieces of his soul (perhaps the fragment that had just broken off in the act of killing James and Lily?) flew into Harry.

I'm not sure why it couldn't have gone into an inanimate object, since horcruxes are traditionally objects rather than people. I suppose because Voldemort was not deliberately creating a horcrux using the ritual, the soul wasn't looking for an object but the usual vessel for souls - humans.

To answer one of your specific points, I don't think Lily's love would have protected baby Harry from a flying soul fragment. I sort of imagine the love magic is protecting him from imminent mortal peril, not permanently protecting him from anything having to do with Voldemort. It was such a freak accident, and a random shard of soul flying at a baby isn't the same thing as a killing curse. Just my two cents.
