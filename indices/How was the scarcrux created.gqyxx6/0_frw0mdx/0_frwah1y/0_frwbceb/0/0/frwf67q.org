â€œTell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building..." -Deathly Hallows, The Prince's Tale

The soul cannot live without a vessel and I imagine it cannot go inside a non-living object without help. As such, it sought the closest living object: Harry.
