linkffn(1875189) was an interesting variation on portrait fics. YMMV on the rest of the story (and the unlikely friendships that form in it), but I found it pretty neat. Arsinoe's fics always had a way of drawing me in, no matter the main characters.

Just note that it was written /before/ the series was finished, which accounts for any discrepancies with canon.

Edit: Didn't see the deleted reply in this thread that has this fic as a recommend until after I posted.
