My feeling is that it is extremely difficult to do magic /around/ a Dementor. Combined with the fact that learning spells would presumably count as a happy memories and thus be taken by the Dementors after a while, meaning wizards freed from Azkaban wouldn't be as good at magic as they started out, it's easy to see how the misconception that they actually drain the magical ability from you could have arisen.
