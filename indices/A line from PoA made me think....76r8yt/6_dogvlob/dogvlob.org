I'm in agreement with what others have already said but I will say I find the idea of Dementors slowly draining a wizard of their magic over time to be a really interesting one.

It makes me wonder how long it would take...? Would the prisoners effectively become squibs afterwards...? Or would they be more akin to muggles...? Also, would it be possible for them to "heal" and regain their magic...? If they could, would they gain it back over time or would it be a flood of power...?

Makes me wonder what would've happened with the Death Eaters in Azkaban; would Voldemort have even bothered to break them out? Would he have considered them on the level of muggles without their magic?

Edit: for clarity and grammar.
