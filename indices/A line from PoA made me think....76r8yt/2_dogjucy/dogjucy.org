Some forms of magic are clearly connected to the casters emotional state (see Neville gaining self-assuredness and getting better at casting spells, Tonks inability to transform when depressed, Merope losing her meager abilities after being abandoned). Now connect that to Dementors' effects on the human mind. And bang, you have a power sucked out.
