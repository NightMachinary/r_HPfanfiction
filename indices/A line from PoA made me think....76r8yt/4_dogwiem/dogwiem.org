I suspect that prolonged Dementor exposure results in a mental state not dissimilar to depression. As such, people so Demented might have problems with willpower itself....

Consider even the will-sappingness of straight-out despair. It is likely that 'normal' people respond to Dementor exposure like that. It seems rather plausible that that data is from evil people locking up innocents, though.

I suspect that the type of people that the Death Eaters imprisoned in Azkaban are... they might respond rather differently. Especially the ones who seem to actually have issues to begin with.
