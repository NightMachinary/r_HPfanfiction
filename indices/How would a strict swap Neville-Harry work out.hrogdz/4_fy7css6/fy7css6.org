If the Potters are Crucioed to insanity, that would seal Severus' side in the war as surely as killing her would (in fact, I read a pre-DH Snape fic once where he had unrequited feelings for Alice and turned due to danger, and later torture, of her). And unless he is unaware of the Potter child completely, would probably have turned around the same time anyway -- even if Voldemort's primary target would be Neville, I can't see him leave Harry alone -- covering all bases, etc. He simply just happened to be interrupted in canon after all.
