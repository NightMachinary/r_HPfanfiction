This would be fine for a "looser" swap. A strict (I don't believe this is truly possible) one has Karkaroff outing at least the Lestranges, who are off to prison. Now young BCJ is a wild card I don't think most knew about. Still, it would take a lot to convince me he could overpower James /and/ Lily by himself or that he'd have the balls to do it.
