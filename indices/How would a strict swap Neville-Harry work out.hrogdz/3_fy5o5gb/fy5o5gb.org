Voldemort doesn't have to go to their house. Lily and James didn't stay inside all day, everyday. Someone close to them under the Imperius Curse could lure them out. Or they could make Neville sick enough to force a St. Mungos visit.

I don't see how the Potters would be tortured without Peter giving up the location. The Longbottoms had jobs whereas the Potters didn't.

As for the meat of the story: I don't think Neville survives. He floundered under criticism and expectation in canon and here there's no Harry to set an example/look up to.
