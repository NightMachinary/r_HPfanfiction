DO you want to like copy everything from Harry?

The premise works without a FIdeliius and traitor...

Now, I always wondered if how the odd circumstances that let to Harry surviving the killing curse could be replicated in Neville. I mean, sure ALice could be as willing to sacrifice herself for her son, but part of what made that work with Harry was because Lily had an option Voldemort was offering her to live because of Snape, and she choose not to.

Not sure, one of Alice's parents was a Slytherin and she was a pureblood? Maybe Voldemort offered to spare her? Though it seems unlikely that's a strong enough reason to let her live, after all, Voldemort is a heartless fucker, and Alice had already opposed Voldemort like 3 times already.
