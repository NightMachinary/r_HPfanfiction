I imagine this Peter who has had 15 years more to mature, would stick by his friends plus he has grown attached to harry

though I imagine he would never confess how low he sank during the first war to anyone nor would he let anyone see the guilt he still carries because of it

I imagine in this timeline, harry might have become friends with ron and neville at a younger age

due to sirius thinking it might be good for young harry to have people his own age to talk too

Peter would then suggest relatives of people who used to be in the order. Remus would bring up neville and sirius would bring up how that ministry workery who pestered him about his bike mentioned he had a son that would be similar age to harry Peter would go 'oh arthur, he married gideon and fabians sister'

so harry, ron and neville become friends at a younger age

I imagine peter would turn spy, when voldemort returns Peter would march himself to dumbledores office to confess his actions during the last war, and then say he wants to become a spy for the order
