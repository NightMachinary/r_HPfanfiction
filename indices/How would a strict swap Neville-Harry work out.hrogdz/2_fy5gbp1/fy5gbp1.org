You also need to put attention to the motivation for Bellatrix to attack the Potters in the first place. In canon, she attacked the LOngbottoms because she thought Voldemort had it wrong or something, that it was Neville being a pureblood who was the true danger. Harry is a halfblood and Bellatrix thought him inferior than Neville... now she is out for revenge, so she ought to get caught doing something. Just thought I needed to remind you that.
