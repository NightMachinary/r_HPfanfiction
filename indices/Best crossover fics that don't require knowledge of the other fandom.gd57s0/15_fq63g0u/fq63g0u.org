Only a Boy by Riddell Lee linkffn(8016336) Hp and Merlin (TV series) crossover. Doesn't require knowledge of Merlin tv show.

Plot Summary: In an AU world where Harry Potter doesn't exist Merlin is sent to the future after fulfilling his role in helping King Arthur restore magic. There he attends Hogwarts as Merlin Evans, and is given a lot of crap for his name, and basically Merlin fulfils the role as the Boy-Who-Lived without the Dumbledore meddling. Featuring awesome Twins, good (fatherly) Snape and has amazing writing!
