Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20)

Dnd 3.5e wizard is transported to Harry potter universe, 10/10. If you didn't understand any of that, don't worry, practicly everything gets explained that you need to know, unfortunately unfisnishrd, but there's an unnoffocal ending of acceptable quality, albeit falls into the trope of making MC completely OP, and getting rid of flaws that defined the charact, still better than nothing.

Linkffn(Harry potter, squatter) Harry potter/Percy Jackson crossover, mainly focused on Harry relation with greek gods, learning magic and survival skills, and food porn, lots and lots of food porn.
