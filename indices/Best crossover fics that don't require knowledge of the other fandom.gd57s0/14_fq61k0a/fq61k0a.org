Snakeskins by Sunruner Linkffn(9659426) Harry Potter x Hetalia crossover. No Hetalia knowledge required but does require the reader to wrap their head around personified nations, luckily you'll only get to know 2 in depth and the rest are Hp cast (albeit next-gen).

Plot Summary: Two Italian sibling students are killed in Hogwarts, suspected as a suicide. An investigation occurs in Hogwarts to investigate the deaths of these children's. Shockingly, the school doesn't seem to care. Why? They're Slytherin students. Post-war, Slytherin has a broken rep with diminishing numbers due to bullying from the other 3 houses. (Role reverse) Our duo protagonist, Italy and England, are tasked to go under cover as children to figure out the mystery to their deaths or forever close down Hogwarts school for good. (Best part - they keep the charade going the whole fic)

It's set in Next-Gen Hogwarts but incorporates so much Hp book lore with the complexity of personified Nations. Like Hp books this fic gets darker over time with dead paintings, accidental splinches and hauntings. But it also explores world building of Wizarding Italy, lives of OG hp characters as adults, and a teacher you'll hate more than Umbridge. It is absolutely addicting.

I challenge you to read up to ch 7: “The Sorting Hat” to decide if you would like to continue or not. I liked writing this post :D
