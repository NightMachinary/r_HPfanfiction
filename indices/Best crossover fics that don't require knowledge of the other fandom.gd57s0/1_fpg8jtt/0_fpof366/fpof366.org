I enjoy Black Sky a lot, also, although I stopped a lot of chapters ago. However, I disagree that you don't need to know about Katekyo Hitman Reborn!

The first part of the story is all HP, but later it becomes mostly KHR, and there are a lot of things that aren't from HP you come across. I kept hoping that I'd start understanding a lot of the background and references, but it never came together for me.
