Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider; Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis)

Only borrows the vague theme of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones. Raiding ancient tombs, evading traps and discovering treasure. There's an OC called Lara Kraft but her name is more of an easter egg. The first one is focused on Petunia's adventures in Egypt while the Trio is at Hogwarts, the sequel is focused on Harry, Ron, Hermione traveling around the world hunting for traces of ancient Atlantis. Set in the same worldbuilding as the rest of the Starfox5-verse, so Jamaican zombies and the magical Ottoman empire make a comeback.
