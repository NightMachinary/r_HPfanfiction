Crossover is with Anita Blake. The original novels have a reputation of being poorly written vampire porn (and they are) but they also introduce some neat worldbuilding ideas. This fic is better written than those novels and does a good job actually explaining all of the worldbuilding. Personally, I'm only in that fandom because I've read a few fics that lean heavily on the worldbuilding of the series. When I tried to read the actual books I hated them. This fic works better as an entrance to the fandom than any of the books do.
