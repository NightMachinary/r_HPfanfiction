In Hogwarts Battle School, Harry isn't immune to her veela powers, even in spite of some training in occlumency, and the main focus isn't about ships. It takes awhile for the fic to introduce her since it starts in his third year. It's a pretty good read if you're into action and mystery in your fics.
