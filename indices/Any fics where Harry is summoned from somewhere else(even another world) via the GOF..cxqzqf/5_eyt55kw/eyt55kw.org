One of my favourite fics. This one has Harry attending a school in Ireland for creatures where he gains a brother and sister who are the same type of creature he is. IT has Ron bashing and Dumbledore bashing, but I find it good fun. He and his siblings are summoned to hogwarts because of the Goblet of fire. Linkffn(11498456)

This is the story that the previous one is inspired by, and has a similar entry point to the story where Harry and his adoptive brother are summoned to Hogwarts gy the Goblet of Fire Linkffn(9729235)
