  Ruby Rose lived to be a Huntress, wanting to be just like her Mom, Summer Rose, however her last name wasn't always that of the one she saw as her mother, she was once known as Ruby Potter. The Wizarding World has no clue where their savior is, but a Death Eater decides the Goblet of Fire is the best way to bring her out of hiding. Ruby Rose is Fem! Harry.
