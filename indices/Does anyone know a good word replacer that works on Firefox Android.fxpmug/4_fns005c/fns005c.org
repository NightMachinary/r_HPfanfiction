A flower name makes the most sense given the Evans naming tradition. So any flower you like - I personally like unusual ones like Alyssa, Jasmine, Marguerite (good nickname for this one: Meg, Cassia, Aster. Holly, Violet and Rose seem too obvious, for some reason. And Poppy Potter sounds ridiculous aloud.
