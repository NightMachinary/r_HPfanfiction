That's just a fan-theory, and as I said in the OP I don't really like it --- I find it more satisfying to think that Nagini has served Voldemort for practically as long as he's been a Dark Lord, than to have her be a relatively new minion in the 1990's. Gives more time for Voldemort to come to trust her more than any other creature in the world and entrust her the secret of his Horcruxes, y'know?
