Watched it, and, huh.........

- They overanalyze "maledictus". "Maledictus" is based on the same root as the French word for "curse", "malediction", and has nothing to do with Taboos or Parseltongue.

- The word 'Nagini' /can/ mean half-snake-half-woman, but it simply means "female snake" in Sanskrit (Nagin means female snake in /Hindi/). Not at all convinced Rowling was looking any farther than that.

- Yes, Nagini is a magical snake. So what? There are lots of magical snakes who /didn't/ use to be people.

- "In essence divided" /obviously/ refers to the Horcrux inside her.

- Nagini is long-lived, but she's a /magical/ species of snake. Remember that Basilisk live even longer.

Overall not a fan of the theory. I /can/ believe that this character may be Maledicted to turn into a snake someday, but why would that snake have to be Nagini?
