I daresay the average age of the fandom is a lot to do with it -- teenagers probably want to read about teenagers. And the age the older part of the fandom was when they read the original canon matters too. The nostalgia element probably makes a difference.

BUT I think there are plenty of post-Hogwarts stories out there if you look, (apparently 13.9k in English on ffn) but apart from a select few, they don't get much attention. I notice you only mention stories that are already very popular on here, so I wonder where you are looking.
