I mean I like stories where they're still at school because my reason for reading the books bled out in the Shrieking Shack in Book 7, so I tend to prefer stories that make that not happen - and for that, people usually go back to Book 6. Unless they choose to feed him a whopping dose of handwavium and continue from there, and I've read a number of excellent fics that do just that, so...

Plus, you know, I think people tend to write stories set during the Hogwarts years because that's what we're most familiar with, if that makes sense. Like, we know the setting, we know the characters, why not stick with what we know?
