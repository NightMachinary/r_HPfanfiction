Outside of straight-up romances, post-Hogwarts stories lack a defined structure. What drives the conflict in the story? Is it an AU, or is it possible to slot into canon? Even romances can be very tricky, as the books take place mostly in Hogwarts, but a post-Hogwarts story needs to develop the setting, characters, and basically everything without the Hogwarts setting to prop it up.
