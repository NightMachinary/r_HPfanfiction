3 main reasons in my opinion:

1: Writing them as adults would take way more effort when it comes to developing the world. You cannot fall back on the book content but must invent your own, and you have to develop an interesting world and a plot within it that keeps peoples attention. A lot more world building required if you will (and we all know how limited the pool of good world building fics are).

2: Lack of interesting content. With canon ages you have a war going on, you have action, adventure, excitement all set to be utilized both within and beyond Hogwarts. In canon, all that stuff to some degree comes to an end right when Harry and co enter adulthood. So suddenly you have to create something new. Reusing the same plot devices seems boring. Having another war... really? Everything seems too normal so you would have to spice it up somehow and that's hard.

3: Ages of readers. We may actually start to see at least a few more adult-oriented fics appear now that much of the original HP generation has aged into adulthood. But there is probably still a skewed amount of younger readers. So fics lean towards school age material.

--------------

Now, I will say that one fix to numbers 1 and 2, is to use content from the past. In other words, an adult Harry (and maybe "& co"), end up back in time for some reason during the 70's or around the era of the "1st Voldemort war" or maybe even further back. This allows modern canon figures, to live as adults within a historical canon past (of which we know more about than the future when it comes to the world of HP). We see a few of them, but honestly, I was always shocked there were not more fics similar to this.
