  Harry Potter is about Magic, Unicorns, Trolls and evil Wizards. Not young adults figuring out their place in life... that's a whole different genre.

I think this is way too oversimplified. Yes, the unique aspect of Harry Potter compared to more generic fiction is the magical world. But so much of the books is about adolescent characters finding their way, developing their friendships (and enemies), learning to navigate the strange world around them. And - a bit to the detriment of the books in my opinion - they're also a bit about petty teenage relationship squabbles, though I understand why JKR included a lot of that stuff... because that too is a significant part of adolescents figuring out who they are and how they fit into the world.

So why can't fanfic delve into such issues after Hogwarts? A survey of fanfic genres also clearly shows that most writers aren't interested in merely exploring magic. The majority of stories revolve around romance or relationships of some variety, even if they aren't central to the plot (though they're much more central in many fics than they ever were to the original books).

People write fanfic for all sorts of reasons, but a lot of it is a kind of escapism coupled with a desire to see characters do things they didn't get to do in canon. Hence why you get so many Draco/Hermione or even Harry/Draco fics. Those aren't about "magic, unicorns, trolls and evil wizards," though those may show in the plot too: they're about writers who want to see characters play out fantasies about the characters' personal development. Heck, even JKR herself admitted there was a degree of "wish fulfillment" in wanting to have the DH epilogue there, something that again had nothing to do with magic -- it was about the characters' lives, how they played out, what they meant to each other.

Of course, that doesn't mean there's going to be a huge audience for a "Harry Potter and the Fertility Treatments" fic, even if there's an author interested in writing it. But maybe to an author who had struggled with such things, there could be a plot that they'd find satisfying to write. Why should the fact that other fiction explored such issues better stop anyone from writing fanfic about it? There's a lot of literature that does "bad boy meets staid girl who explores her wild side" a hell of a lot better than 99% of Draco/Hermione fics, but people still write them (and a hell of a lot of them).

I agree with you that the bare plot outlines suggested in OP don't sound engaging on their surface, but it depends on what you do with them. And there can be significant magical issues involved too; I've seen examples of plots like that where you don't just have an occasional "Accio" grafted on.
