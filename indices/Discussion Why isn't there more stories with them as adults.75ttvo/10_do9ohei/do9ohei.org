Extremely boring.

Why would I want to read a Harry Potter story about the most mundane shit of life? Not to mention that there's already hundreds of years of world-class literature that has addressed all of these subjects much more seriously than a fanfic ever could.

Harry Potter is about Magic, Unicorns, Trolls and evil Wizards. Not young adults figuring out their place in life... that's a whole different genre. What's the point of setting such a story in the HP universe ("oh and by the way, they are wizards, so of course Harry uses Accio when playing catch with his kid")?
