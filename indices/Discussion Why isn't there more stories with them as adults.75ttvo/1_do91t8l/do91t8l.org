because it is easy to make changes to who a character is when they are teenagers compared to when they are adults.

I find most of the adult harry stories that hold my interest have to do with him ending up in another universe.

I read harry potter as an escapist fantasy fiction and after Hogwarts harry was very determined to be "normal" and Normal is boring .
