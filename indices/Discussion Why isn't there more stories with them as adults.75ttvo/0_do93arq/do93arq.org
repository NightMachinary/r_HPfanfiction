As another post already said, a lot of this probably has to do with the age of fandom (skews younger) combined with the "normalcy" of familiar settings. I'd also add that even for older authors/readers, the Potter world does provide a bit of escapism back to teenage years, so it can be comforting to place a story in that setting.

But I think it's more than that too: there are much greater challenges to writing fics post-Hogwarts. If you write about a story that takes place within canon (or within some variant of it), you have a ready-made set of locations, schedules, minor characters, etc., and all of their interactions to draw on. You read the books, and you get your details from there, and it's relatively straightforward to riff off of that.

As someone who is roughly the age of the Trio according to their canon birthdates, I attempted a fic a few months ago. It was basically all post-Hogwarts, spanning time up through the epilogue. And I wanted to try to stay as close to JKR's post-Hogwarts information as reasonable. There's a lot of research, imagination, and creativity that then has to go into sorting everything out, even to create a basic setting. Precisely when do H/G and R/Hr get married? When exactly are the children's birthdates? (That's not so much of an issue if a kid is 8 vs. 9, but it is an issue if the kid is 6 months old vs. 18 months old, or if someone might be pregnant at that point.)

And that's only the tip of the iceberg, because then you have to fill in all the details for locations the characters frequent as adults, where they are in their careers exactly at that point and what their work dynamics would be like, how their schedules work, how family/work interactions happen, what it's like to have kids who are 2 and 4 vs. 7 and 9 or whatever, what sort of changes/issues are likely to pop up in relationships after 5 years together, after 5 years with kids, etc. And that's before you deal with the challenges of portraying the characters as realistic adults, extrapolating from their teenage personalities while incorporating any backstory that may have accrued and affected them in the meantime.

There's just a lot of variables if you want to do it seriously, perhaps even more so than writing AU Hogwarts (or pseudo-Hogwarts) fics, which often merely change a few specific variables.

I have experience with a lot of this real-life stuff, but I can imagine it's harder to try to piece together all of this and make it realistic, unless you've sort of lived it. I've seen quite a few post-Hogwarts fics clearly written by people who have no clue what mature adult relationship dynamics are like, particularly in affair fics. And others who seem to want to write post-Hogwarts fics and basically ignore the fact that kids exist or the real-life challenges of planning around them.

I first encountered fanfic around 2005 or so, and frankly I was creeped out a bit by all the 14-year-olds having sex in stories. So I immediately started looking for fics with older characters, and even back then there were quite a few. I'll admit I became a H/Hr fan early on (at least in terms of fanfic), partly due to early encounters with some fics that placed them in a more mature setting. Once HBP and DH came out, many new H/Hr stories also progressively migrated toward post-Hogwarts settings to create scenarios that played out future relationship dynamics after subverting canon pairings.

(To be clear, I'm NOT trying to convert anyone here. I know a lot of folks dislike H/Hr, and I'll be the first to admit there's a TON of crap with that pairing out there. I'm just saying the very nature of the canon with the pairing seemed to draw people out to make them picture post-Hogwarts settings as more of a norm to somewhat attempt canon compliance, though often ignoring DH epilogue.)

Anyhow, I absolutely agree with the post here: nowadays I tend to read mostly post-Hogwarts stuff, and for romance plots I really only want to read post-Hogwarts. The only Hogwarts-era romances I can stomach anymore typically are humor fics. I was never a fan of the idea that all the main characters were more-or-less locked into "happily ever after" romantic pairings at 17ish, and I'm always interested in fics that try to show how they develop as young adults, and then how they navigate the world of families. But it's rare to see it done well.

Oh, one last obvious thing: so much fanfic revolves around romance/pairings, and stories that involve characters "getting together" are often significantly more popular and common than stories about characters in established normal life relationships. But if you like canon pairings, then you're mostly stuck with romances worked out already by the end of Hogwarts, unless you do something like break the characters up and put them back together again... or go more significantly AU.
