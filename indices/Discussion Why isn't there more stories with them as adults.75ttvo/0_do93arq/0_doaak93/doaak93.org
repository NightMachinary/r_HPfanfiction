I also think authors find it difficult to find the right balance in a post war fic. Either the fic is some crazy new evil villain-type story, which almost always falls flat compared to the original, or its an over-the-top soap opera where the characters all wind up OOC, or its an incredibly-boring, nothing bad happens, canon compliant fic.

Which is a bit silly since there are plenty of legitimate storylines one could tell about post-war Harry and friends that are as compelling as the original series. I think a lot of authors simply can't help themselves.
