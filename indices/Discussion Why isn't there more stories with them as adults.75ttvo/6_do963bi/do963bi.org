As a reader and a writer, I'm much more interested in the characters as adults than teenagers. I find trying to write them as teenagers, especially in the confines of Hogwarts, to be much too constricting. I much prefer being an adult and being able to eat ice cream for dinner if I want to, rather than being stuck as a teenager trying to avoid Filch in the halls.
