I loved reading fanfics when the characters were at Hogwarts when I went to school, just because I could relate (you know ignoring the whole magical world aspect). So yeah that does make sense.

But now that I'm an adult I'd just love to read stories where the characters are adults like I am. So it just irritates me that there are so few well written adult Harry Potter fanfics out there that are worth the read.

I'd just like more stories with the characters as adults dealing with real world problems, and I've seen on here that I'm not the only one, so it's good to see that I'm not alone.
