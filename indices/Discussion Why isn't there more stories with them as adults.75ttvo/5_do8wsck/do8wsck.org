I think that a large part of newer writers to the fandom are young(er) people, namely teenagers. Since it's easier to write of your age category, authoring Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny as teens is by and large "easier" for that age subset. As adults, real life takes over (e.g., university, work, family) which makes it more difficult for adults to pen works of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny as actual adults.

Quite honestly, I'm more interested in reading the characters past their Hogwarts years and into adulthood (as I'm now one myself). Reading about Hogwarts and them going to classes just doesn't interest me anymore in FanFiction. Also, few people actually can "write" teens, as many of them are moody and distant and dramatic, which can sometimes spoil the reader into rotten territory.

As a last thought, there's probably a sense of normalcy in which authors of these stories think that many readers want to read these characters within the confines of Hogwarts castle, Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley, the Burrow, and everyplace in between as fans of the series can recognize these sites as the foundation of the books. Parting these characters from what is known of them can create unfamiliarity and an unwelcome change due to the setting being so different from what authors and readers are used to.

I certainly don't shy away from new works that have them as teens, but I show a higher interest in stories that display originality and with the characters well past their school years.
