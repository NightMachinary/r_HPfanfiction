Sounds interesting, except I don't see the story yet here. See [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/dudley-has-a-witch-as-a-daughter.html][my comments on exposition v. story]] and it applies here as well. What you have is a premise of the story, not the plot line (unless you have it and you are just trying not to spoil it, which is understandable).
