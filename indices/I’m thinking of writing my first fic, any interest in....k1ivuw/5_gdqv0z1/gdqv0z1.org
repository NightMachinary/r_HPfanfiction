I would be interested in that premise for a story.

A good place for canon divergence in my opinion would be GoF. They see really dark curses the first time in that book; Harry actually fantasises to put Snape under the cruciatus at one point of the book. For the third task Hermione and Ron are helping Harry to study new spells. I think it is the only time in canon where the three of them "train" secretly. Hermione also would find a way in the Restricted Section - she has already done that once before. If Hermione doesn't find a way you could also use fake!Moody to stir them in the right direction.
