It's linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land).

I really love that story! :)

(There is a sequel too, though it's abandoned and the final few finished chapters haven't been uploaded to FanFiction.net but they are available from here: [[https://strangerinland.weebly.com/index.html]] But be prepared for the pain of a great story left unfinished... :( This unfinished stranger trilogy is kinda like I'm Still Here, similar settings and characterizations, both sadly left half-baked.)
