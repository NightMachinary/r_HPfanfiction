Why?

Castles aren't that uncommon in europe, you can find one on every other outcropping or cliffside if you're looking for them. A lot are inhabited too.

Not to mention, it's a kid. Kid sees castle and thinks "hey, cool, castle!", the end.

Why would they "go insane" or "try to find out what it is"?
