(„Why is it, that only I can see this beautiful castle?“, mumurs the 7 year old, „why can't my parents go near it?“) or something like that. I think the point is that the muggleborn, as he doesn't now magic is real, thinks he's going crazy because his parents don't believe him, that there is a magnificent castle. So what is it about this build that makes it unapproachable for his/her parents. It makes some sense if you look deeper into the stuff of the HP-Universe
