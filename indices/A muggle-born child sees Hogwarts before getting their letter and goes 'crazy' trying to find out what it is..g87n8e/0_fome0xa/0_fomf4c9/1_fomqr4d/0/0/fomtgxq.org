Yeah, but how? No roads to Hogsmeade. Wizards don't drive. The train is only accessible through a magic only platform. No maps exist of the area as it's unplottable. The surrounding woods are a death trap.

Now finding the leaky cauldron or St Mungo's or the ministry, sure. Those are high traffic areas for both sides.
