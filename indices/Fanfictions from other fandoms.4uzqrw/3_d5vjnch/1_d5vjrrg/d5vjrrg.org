  The ruler of Salamandastron is still fighting his own ghosts, some of which are real while others are perceived, figments of a tortured mind. A young fox reaches out towards his destiny, but his past may be his own undoing. Redwall is searching for a new hero, but they are shocked at what Martin the Warrior sends to their aid. War is coming, and Redwall is not ready.
