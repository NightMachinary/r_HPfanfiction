My first Pokemon fic that I just finished reading. I was blown away... by both the fact it's only really on it's second arc and that it's at 930k words and it doesn't feel extraneous. If you are a 90's kid and grew up with Pokemon like me, read it.

This is a Harry Potter fic, but it crosses over with ASOIAF in a manner that is fascinating and well worth the read.

This is a Silmarillion fic that is written by a good friend of mine. Extremely well written and worth the look for any fan of Tolkien's mythos.

Last and by no means least is a Redwall fic that I wrote. Warning though, those expecting a bright and colorful Redwall fic may be put off by this, as it's violent, grim, and somewhat depressing. Feel free to leave me feedback.
