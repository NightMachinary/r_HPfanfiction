Honestly you should check out some [[https://www.fanfiction.net/Familiar-of-Zero-Crossovers/2762/0/?&srt=4&lan=1&r=10][Familiar of Zero crossovers]]. It has literally more crossovers that actual fanfiction. This is because the anime series premise is really good, with a colourful supporting cast and epic quests. The only negative is the main character, who due to the plots introduction of him, is easily replaced by anyone/thing. You don't even have to know the series before you can hop into any one fanfic.

These two are my favourite: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6359442/1/The-Familiars-of-Zero][This one]] is a high quality compilation of one-shot of all sorts of new main characters. And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7736264/1/Emperor-of-Zero][this is one]] where Napoleon Bonaparte is the new main character. And he decide to conquer this world.
