[[/r/fanfiction]] recently started doing fic rec posts every Friday and self-promotion posts every Wednesday. They're both great places to pick up recs for other fandoms, and there are some people who read/write bleach, Naruto, and pokemon there.

If you like Marvel or Supernatural, [[/r/marvelfans]] and [[/r/fandomnatural]] also do weekly fic rec posts, though they're both a bit more slash heavy than here.
