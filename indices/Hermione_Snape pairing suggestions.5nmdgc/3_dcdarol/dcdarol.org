Ping me about this tomorrow? This is one of my favourite pairings, and I've got a handful that I really love, but I'm literally in bed on my phone and trying to link them would be more effort than my half asleep brain can handle.

Sin & Vice, Come Back to Me, Pride of Time (though I liked the ending in Divide of Time better I think), The Contact, The Gilded Cage, Occluded Soul... I'm sure there's more but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.
