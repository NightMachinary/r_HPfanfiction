Thank you so much! I have been looking at some other discussions and saw When a Lioness Fights there so I am super excited to read that, and I actually just re-read a Pet Project--so good. I can't wait to read these. I had an Ashwinder account back in the day, but have long since abandoned it and lost my saves, this is so helpful thanks!
