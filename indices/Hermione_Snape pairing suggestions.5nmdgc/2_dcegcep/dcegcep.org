Ok, here you go. Actual links to the ones mentioned in my earlier post, and a few I'd forgotten about, lol. All of them should be complete, and i think over 20K words. I don't really read short fics lol.

linkffn(5089614) - Camerado - Haven't read this one in a while, but I remember enjoying it.

linkffn(9234875) - Come Back To Me - Time travel, but not how you would expect... It starts out slow, and has a few weird chapter in the middle, but all in all I love this fic.

linkffn(7453087) - Pride of Time, and the alternate ending Divide of Time. I liked the alternate ending better, but really both endings are good.

linkffn(10822825) - Of Myth and Magic - Completely AU, sorta, not sure how to describe it without spoilers... Really good, but not exactly a "feel good" fic. Still worth the read.

linkffn(2290003) - Pet Project - This one gets recommended a lot, so you may have already read it. But figured I'd toss it up just in case.

linkffn(11053807) - Sin & Vice - Excessive use of a Time Turner. I don't think I've read another fic quite like it. I really love this fic, and...

linkffn(11702523) - The Master, the Warden, the Headmaster and the Deputy - by the same author. Two of my favorites, I think, lol. It's really hard to pick. (The author has some other fics that are really good too)

linkffn(4661762) - The Gilded Cage - Another great fic.

linkffn(6408692) - The Occluded Soul - I loved this one so much that I actually started re-reading it when I woke up this morning lol.

linkffn(2162474) - When a Lioness Fights - A very dark story, but I enjoyed it. The author is not a native English speaker, so there are occasionally things that don't come across well, but it wasn't a big issue if I remember correctly.

linkffn(11477797) - World Enough and Time - Think "The Lakehouse", and you've got the premise of the story. Another one I haven't read in a bit, but I remember enjoying it.

Ok, that's a list, lol. I actually have more than that in my Favorites/Followed list, but I absolutely don't remember reading them, so I don't know if they're actually any good, lol.
