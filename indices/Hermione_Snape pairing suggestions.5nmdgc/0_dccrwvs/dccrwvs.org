A good place to start, especially the pics by Loten (on ffnet).

I'm trying to search for one I loved, I'll edit.

EDIT : Found it ! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5928118/1/A-Chance-in-Time]] I really liked the way the time travel is done (regarding paradoxes, for example). Probably one of my favorites time travel SSHG stories.

(also, you're not alone, I love this ship and I ship many more "weird" HG pairings, you need just ask)
