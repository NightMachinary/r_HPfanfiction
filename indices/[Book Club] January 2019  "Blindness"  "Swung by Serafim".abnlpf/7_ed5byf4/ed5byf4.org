I read Blindness a while back, and it's definitely a worthwhile read. I thought the pacing was off a bit at times, or maybe I just felt there was too much focus on 'patterns' and making patterns, changing patterns, etc. I get that it's central to the story, but there was just a bit much of it at times.

The original characters were good, if a little one dimensional, and the Canon characters divergences all made sense and were true to character.

Harry was definitely !SuperHarry, but it didn't trash the story, and there were worthwhile conflicts and resolutions. Some unique or interesting takes on how to handle the usual fanfic clich√©s that have to be handled as well.

Overall, would recommend as a good fic to read.
