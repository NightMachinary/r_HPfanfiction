Although Blindness is no longer on the list I very much urge people to read it. I find that the first half is incredibly moving. The unique story, the way Harry and Hermione connect with each other is fantastic. The way they handle their disabilities and build a relationship is outstanding. Also a lovely Dursley depiction in this story, especially when contrasted to the almost callous reaction of the wizarding world at first.

The latter half is still good, but sadly strips away some of the great buildup we see in the first half. Although still very interesting concepts (especially around the Hallows) are explored we do enter god mode Harry territory and that kinda nullifies any handicaps that make the beginning of the story incredibly intriguing. The god mode also means that a lot of the sad things that happen in the story aren't that impactful. It felt to me that the author was looking for a happy ending and shied away from truly dramatic things happening. Bringing Hermione back from the dead was good for the happy ending, but I found myself wanting to see where the author could take the story if she stayed dead. The feutus wasn't brought back and that did create tension for sure, but it felt like punches were being pulled. Which is in line with my biggest gripes with this story that dramatic and sad plot lines are setup in the first half, but broken down to a more happy ending in the second.

For me this was the best completed fic of 2018.
