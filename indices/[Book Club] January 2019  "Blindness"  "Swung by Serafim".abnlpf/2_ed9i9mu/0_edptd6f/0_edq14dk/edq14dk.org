Not happy maybe, but a lot of tragedy was very much mitigated. Their handicaps don't matter at all anymore, Death no longer matters (mostly), anyone opposing him no longer matter. The end has a degree of sadness in it for sure. It is after all not supposed to be a happy story.

Maybe it's more the disconnect between the two halves of the story that I feel. One about two youngsters growing up with disabilities, having to find their own way in a magical world with unlimited potential that rejects them. And then the second half a story about Super Harry trying to find answers about fundamental questions about both magic and life and death. I loved the questions explored in the second half of the story, but I would be very interested in a complete story in the tone of the first half.
