OP violates the very rule they quoted in their post. /Blindness/ depicts sexual acts between minors:

I removed the scene because it's so obscene, but it happens in chapter 16.

This is but one of numerous instances. It might not be graphic, but it goes beyond suggestive, as is the wording of rule 4.

I'll thank you to keep such filth off our Christian, family-friendly subreddit :^)
