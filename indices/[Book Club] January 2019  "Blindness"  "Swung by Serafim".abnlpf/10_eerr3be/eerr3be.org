Swung hooked me in the beginning. An intriguing plot I hadn't seen before with reasonably likeable characters and interesting developments. Couple things that bugged me though and led to me not finishing. 1) Angsty interactions that feel forced and don't suit the characters 2) Not using contractions in dialogue. This unreasonably bothers me. 3) Characters agreeing too much and out of context for apparently no reason. Groupthink? Everyone always starts using the same phrases in dialogue. 4) Too much fluff. 5) Childish innuendos by supposed adults

Blindness on the other hand is incredible. Magic system is fascinating. Story pacing worked for me. Characters, while flawed, felt realistic. Writing is beautiful. Overall 10/10. I've read it twice now.
