I really enjoyed Swung by Serafim but I feel like it just unravelled a bit in the last chapters. It felt like originally the author was going to add more and then they decided not to, so it has a meandering ending. It's an interesting view into the characters lives, but I almost would have liked it better if it had ended with Harry going "I don't want it back!" And fade to black.
