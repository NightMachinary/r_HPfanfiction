Ok this thread finally got me to actually read through Swung by Serafim. I tried it a while back and bounced off the beginning of it; the stuff with CDs and music lyrics and Harry being a honey badger animagus just made me think it was going to be terrible. I'm pleased that I was wrong and I actually did enjoy it for the most part.

As someone else mentioned, the prose is very smooth and makes for an easy read. The premise is unique, the deviations from canon are great fun, the character interactions and slow growth of the friendship (and, we presume, eventual relationship) between Harry and Snape are very well done. Some of the plot stuff didn't make sense to me in the moment, like the whole thing with Sirius meeting Voldemort, or why the potion they used to kill Voldemort didn't just kill him right away, but I could excuse that since the pacing was solid and there was plenty of tension.

Then Voldemort dies and the story just keeps plodding on. I get it. The author isn't telling the Harry Potter and Voldemort story, they're telling the story of Harry and Snape, and they hadn't yet reached the end of that. The problem is, there's just not much left after Voldemort's death. There's no real driver to the plot, they're just kind of going around doing their thing without any real tension or conflict. It doesn't help that there's a sudden OC who appears out of nowhere to take over large parts of the story for no real reason. She's... I don't want to use the term Mary Sue, it's super overused and I'm not sure it's quite right here anyway. But she has a lot of the earmarks--everyone loves her when they meet her, she has a super cool and unique way of dressing (and everyone loves her hat), she has a tragic backstory, she has her own special accent, she has special powers (despite never studying magic, she can do tons of stuff trivially just from knowing Latin), she gets adopted and eventually marries a fan-favorite canon character. I dunno, I liked her in her introductory scene, and the bit where she dresses Snape was fine if a bit too long, but then she just took more and more space in the story and it was like, really?

I don't want to end on a down note, because the first portion of this story really was a blast. Flamethrower's writing was solid enough to pull me through a few minor missteps along the way, and I certainly don't regret reading the story. Good pick, glad I pushed through and finished it.
