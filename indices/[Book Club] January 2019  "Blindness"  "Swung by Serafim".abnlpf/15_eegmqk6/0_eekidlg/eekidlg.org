Pretty much my feelings exactly on the fic. The inclusion of song lyrics were... well... I'm sure it seemed like a good idea to the author at the time. I mean we all have songs where we're like /yeah this gets my mood exactly/ but that doesn't mean I want to read through whole stanzas of 90s emo music. I tried reading the first one and skipped the rest.
