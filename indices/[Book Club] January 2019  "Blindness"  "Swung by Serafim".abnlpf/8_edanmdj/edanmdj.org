Swung by Serafim is one of the best fics I read last year. For everyone that does not read slash, I urge you to make an exception, it is very mild and some of it is subtext only (at least that's how I perceived it) and the story is very well-written. I often dislike Snape (in Canon and in most fics), but I love his portrayal here. The character development that Harry goes through whilst relearning everything and getting to know all his friends again is extremely well done.
