Okay, I read both.

Blindness--it was good, nice original concepts with the magic and giving Harry challenges to keep up with his extreme power. I didn't love the development of his relationship with Hermione in the last few chapters because he basically gave her 0 emotional support and made tons of huge decisions without her. Yes, he has sex with her when they are both 17, but I didn't mind the suggestion that two 17 year olds might be doing it offscreen. I mean, I did attend high school...

Swung--this author has a great turn of phrase that makes the story pleasant to read. The arc towards defeating Voldemort was well-written (of course Snape and Harry's collaboration would lead to Voldemort being defeated with a potion!) and I highly enjoyed the potion-brewing and ingredient-gathering scenes, along with the extremely tense "Snape spy" scenes. Nitpick: how did Voldemort not immediately die of White Fire? You *can't* tell me the dude isn't cursed. First of all, he has a Dark Mark at the very least, and having your soul fractured by dark magic is surely a curse.

Other thoughts:

- At the beginning of "Swung" everyone, and I mean everyone, spoke their dialog with the identical snarky Snape/Harry voice. It was a little tedious. Over time, the author improved at developing different voices in dialog, even giving Snape and Harry different voices. Of course, even at the end they'd have the most stodgy character say something snarky/profane/OOC just for the lulz.
- After Voldemort is defeated, there is no real narrative arc. I found myself skimming through wedding after wedding. I can't fault the author for wanting to write happy fluff about their favorite world/characters, but that didn't mean that it worked tonally with the first half of the story or that I really enjoyed the ride.
- I love a lot of the side character pairings in this, especially the slash ones.
- The moments of tension that occur after Voldemort's defeat were sprinkled at random. Yes, I know that in real life, you're going about your life when random tragedies happen and resolve. But fiction has to make more narrative sense than real life! *wedding* *wedding* *Snape is poisoned* *okay back to the weddings*
- The characters often seem to share some kind of telepathy with the narrator/author/Snape. For example, Snape thinks of Jade as being similar to a hummingbird and never mentions it and everyone starts calling her Hummingbird Girl. Then in the last chapter everyone and their dog shows up because they all somehow know that Snape and Harry should get together. Even if you had this opinion of your friends, would you really show up at their house to stage an intervention? LOL
- Jade's motivations never made a ton of sense. She had a lot of potential as a character, so I don't want to bash on her too much, but yeah.
- Snape's obsession with the endlessly recurring "wrong bloody House"/"senile sorting hat!" lines... may... have strongly contributed to my "houses aren't important" rant here the other day... that's all i'm sayin...
- The author kept trying to shoehorn in the idea of impropriety between teacher/student as an awkward joke in the beginning of the story. It was cringey. I feel like talking about wand grip etc. would be so commonplace you would have to be seriously pervy to think of it as an innuendo.
- I loved the magic house! I wish the author had done more with the isolated house elves and the ancient portraits as being unique/plot driving. Lots of opportunities there.
- If I ever read the word "politic" again it will be too soon.
