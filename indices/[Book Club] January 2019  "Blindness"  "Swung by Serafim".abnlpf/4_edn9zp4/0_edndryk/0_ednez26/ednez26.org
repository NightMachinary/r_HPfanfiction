Haha, I did! I really liked the first half. I am not really in the pro-Snape camp as far as canon goes, but I thought the author did a good job at making him a compelling/likable character.

Also I think reading the "fantastic elves" works kind of ruined me for other fanfic for awhile, I have yet to read anything that comes close and I think it's making me snotty.
