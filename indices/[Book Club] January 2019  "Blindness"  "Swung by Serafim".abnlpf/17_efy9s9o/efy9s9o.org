I know I'm late but I needed to comment on Swung. I was very invested in the story at the beginning, but it really devolved into my favorite tropes. Triads, song lyrics, Snarry, Wizengamot manipulation, overpowered Harry (no explanation of his sudden eidetic memory?), forever young potion? The plot development was compelling enough to make me want to see it through Voldemort's death, but after that I skimmed a lot.
