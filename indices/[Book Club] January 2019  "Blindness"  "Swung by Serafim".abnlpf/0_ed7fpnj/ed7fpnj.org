“Blindness” by AngelaStarCat is one of the most fascinating hp fics I've read. I adore it, and I was grateful that the author completed it, due to her RL challenges. It's an exceptional fic. If there's underage sex in it, I either didn't notice or Harry and Hermione were close enough to 18 that I didn't care. It's not as if they were shagging like rabbits throughout the story. Whoever made the comment regarding the one sex scene in the story, and how horribly vulgar yada yada. . . . our oh so Christian subreddit . . . Blah blah . . . . Give me a fucking break. Really? Have you never noticed 1) the copious amount of profanity on this subreddit, or 2) the number of requests for smut on it? I can't stand it when people who read fanfic and who lurk on social media platforms like this one, play the self-righteously indignant card, particularly when it's clear that the individual didn't read the fic. Except to skim it and tell everyone who bothered to read their comment, exactly where in the fic this abomination can be found. Please. The author wrote an excellent and original story, which would be fascinating to discuss. Maybe the Book Club rules need to be tweaked, if “Blindness” is being labeled as smut.
