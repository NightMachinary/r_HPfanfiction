It is a [[https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive][site-wide]] rule, so your ire should be aimed at the admins - not concerned users like myself, or the mods who are just doing their thankless job.

The rule does not forbid smut in general; only sexual or suggestive content involving minors. There's no room for interpretation here - “Blindness” literally has a scene depicting sex between two underage teenagers. Whether it is an "excellent and original story" or not has zero relevance.
