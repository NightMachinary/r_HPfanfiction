Yes, I hate people that feel the need to report stories for their content in general. I also dislike those that report every story that has explicit sexual content because it's against ff.net rules. It's not hurting you or anyone else, just leave them alone.

In this particular case, I also disagree that there's anything morally wrong with it in the first place. It's not hurting anyone, it's no different from portraying any other crime in fiction.
