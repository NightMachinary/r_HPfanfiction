Neither violence nor character death in storytelling are mentioned in reddit rules, so that's neither here nor there. On the other hand, the [[https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-sexual-or-suggestive][site-wide rule]] against suggestive content involving minors specifically mentions /stories/ as one of the mediums to which it applies.

Does flowery prose, or indeed good writing, mean a story should be exempt from the rules?
