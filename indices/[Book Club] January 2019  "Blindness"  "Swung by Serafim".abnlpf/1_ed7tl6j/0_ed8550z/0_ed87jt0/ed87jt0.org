Reddit is rather more sensible than you're suggesting. There are hundreds of discussions all over the site that break a strict interpretation of that rule but remain active and uncensored precisely because they discuss legal activity.

Blindless hints at legal sexual activity between two people.The irony of censoring one story while promoting one with "Graphic Depictions Of Violence", "Major Character Death" and "Discussion of Past Child Abuse" tags is quite incredible.

The policy is meant to cover things like that odious story Overlord Vulcan, not Blindness. Ultimately it's your sub so you get to interpret the rules but from the reactions here it's clear most people think you're going too far.
