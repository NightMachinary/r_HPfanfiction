Reddit isn't as strict with this rule as you seem to think. As long as it's not real children, the rule doesn't apply. [[/r/gonewildaudio]] has audios with women playing characters in their early teens getting raped and the admins don't ban them because they're very clear about it not being actual children and being made by adults for adults.
