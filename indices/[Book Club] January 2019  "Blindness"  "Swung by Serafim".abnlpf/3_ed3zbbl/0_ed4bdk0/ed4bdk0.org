If you couldn't get into Blindness, then honestly, no, probably not worth continuing. I finished it myself and called it worthwhile, but I can well imagine it's not for everyone. It has a very particular style.

Swung by Serafim seems to have an OK start, but I'm a bit dubious about it holding up for over 300k words?

Edit: If you like to see Harry working with Snape more closely, there's a very good arc of that in linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions).
