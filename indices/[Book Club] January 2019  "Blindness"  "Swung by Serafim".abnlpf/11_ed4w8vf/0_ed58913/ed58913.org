There are two relationships (that I can remember off the top of my head) that count as slash. I am placing them in spoilers so others can remain unaware, should they choose.

1. Luna/Original Female Character

2. Harry/Severus, though this one is hinted and nothing actually happens between the characters until the final chapter
