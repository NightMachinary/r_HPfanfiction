I hadn't wanted to post my thoughts until after I'd finished Swung by Serafim but I'm still only on chapter 25 with no belief that I'll be finishing it any time soon so here goes.

First Blindness. I read this story as it was coming out and thought it was brilliant to start with. The way the story handled Harry and Hermione's individual development was believably done, and when they got together it was really quite sweet. The first stages of Harry's experimentation were interesting and engaging. But that's where things began to go wrong. Once you've reached the point where Harry can bring people back from the dead you've already lost most of the tension. Then the story spent ages building up the Lady Luxe as a mega baddie only for her to be swatted aside with no bother at all. And then it ends. I don't think I've had such an anticlimax reading a HP fanfic. Sure there have been stories that annoyed me because I thought the author made the wrong calls at the end but this one left me with a sense of "meh". It's rare that I remove a completed story from my alerts list without adding it to my favourites, but this one made me do it.

And as an aside, I'm a huge fan of progressive rock. Yes, King Crimson, you name it. But even compared to a genre that gave us "Tales from Topographic Oceans" and "The Revealing Science of God", the chapter titles are pretentious to an outrageous degree: "The Carbon Black Flesh of Living Shadows" and "Yellow Petals in Golden Firelight" would have had Jon Anderson rolling his eyes and calling AngelaStarCat pretentious.

It seems like there's a decent story in Swung By Serafim but I haven't got to it yet. Others have mentioned the tedious song lyrics but there's other things that seem included just to pad the story out too. And then it's page after page of people bantering and not advancing the story. [[/u/evolutionista]] has made the point that everybody starts out sounding exactly the same. Having got to chapter 25, that's still the case. In a group dialogue scene I can't tell who's speaking until you reach the "said X" part of the sentence, which is simply poor: each character should have their own voice.

It's quite a funny story in places. The banter is largely tedious but each character manages the odd genuine witticism at some point.

But seeing that I've reached chapter 25 and I'm only just over half way through, I simply can't be bothered any more. I'll probably finish it at some point but I'd rather read other stuff at the moment
