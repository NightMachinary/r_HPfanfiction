LOL, I was definitely rolling my eyes at some of those chapter titles, even as a fellow Jon Anderson fan...

In addition to Harry quickly getting to the superpowers stage of his experimentation in Blindness, I was disappointed that the authors took such an interesting road with Hermione (traumatic brain injury/lingering intellectual and speech disability) and then basically cast it aside after one or two chapters. Then she's back to being regular Hermione with the occasional stutter for flavor. I really wanted to see how Hermione would deal with those challenges in the long-term and it was disappointing that the premise of her disability was discarded so soon.
