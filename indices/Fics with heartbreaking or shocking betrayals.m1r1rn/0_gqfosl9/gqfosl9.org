Harry Potter and the Perils of the Unknown is a pre-HBP book 6 which was very popular at its time. Now going over it, it seems pretty poorly written but it works for angsty teenagers I suppose. However it does have a pretty awesome plot twist where Luna is revealed to have been faking her quirky persona and had been recruited by the Death Eaters. That was pretty heartbreaking.
