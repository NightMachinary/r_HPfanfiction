It might help to clarify a little. Do you want a self-absorbed Harry who doesn't care about anyone but himself, do you want an apathetic Harry with no drive to do anything, do you want an indy!Harry rebelling against the plan who doesn't give a shit about Dumbledore or Magical British society, a Harry who is a Sherlockian-sociopath that doesn't care for societal mores, etc?

A character who doesn't care about anything at all isn't really all that interesting from a literature standpoint - characters don't do what they aren't motivated somehow to do - so I don't think you'll find any fics starring a Harry of such... broad apathy. Specifying might be the only way you'll get anything, if that's what you're looking for. Apologies.
