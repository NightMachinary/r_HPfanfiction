I can't think of the fic but I swear I read one that used two secret keepers for a secret. As an example (meaning I don'trememberwho was actually used), Something along the lines that the fidelius on Harry's property had neville as the secret keeper. However, then a second fidelius was put in place stating that Neville was the secret keeper for that property with Harry as the secret keeper.

So even though neville was the secret keeper for the property he couldn't give that secret away even if he wanted to unless you knew the secret that he was the secret keeper. So in order to get access to the property you first had to get Harry to give you the secret that neville was the secret keeper than you had to get neville to actually give you the secret.

If you just tried to get the secret from neville without having harry telling you first it would not work, no matter how you tried to access it.
