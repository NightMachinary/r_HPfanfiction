Going purely based on canon? Any person that had been told the secret would become secret keepers themselves, with the fidelius still intact, but having more points of failure. In this case James, Lily, Sirius, and Dumbledore at the very least, would be able to share the secrets with others. We don't know if anyone else had been told the secret of where they were hiding before Wormtail sold them out, but we do know that all of those had been let in on the secret.

They'd probably actually be more secure if those were the only people they had told about their hiding place since those people were all trustworthy, but there is still room for errors as with Hermione letting Yaxely in on the secret by apparating to Grimmauld with him tagging along.
