Up for debate. There are a lot of different fanon interpretations of the Fidelius designed to either capitalize on it's amazing power or give it limitations. Most of these fanon interpretations are actually reactions to other fanon interpretations though.

In canon we basically get a few main facts.

"An immensely complex spell involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is hidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth impossible to find --- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window!"

One, as stated. The Fidelius hides a secret within someone's soul.

Two, the information of the secret can't be found out except through being told by the secret keeper.

Three, Voldemort could have physically placed his nose against the Potters window and not have found what he was looking for.

The two most common divergences away from canon then are that the fidelius can only hide places, and that the fidelius can hide anything. In canon we only see the fidelius hide secret places. The secret location of the Potters hideout, the secret location of the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, and the secret location of Shell Cottage. That is what is being hidden. The secret of the location. Not the location itself. That is hidden through further layers of security such as the unplottable charm on Grimmauld place and the charms cast on the trio's tent.

Therefore in canon, it should be perfectly reasonable to hide secret ideas and concepts. /As long as they are secret/. This goes against the other fanon divergence about the spell hiding anything. It can't hide the incantion to the killing curse because people already know that. It's not a secret.

In the case provided by OP then, I would say that the concept of the existence of the Fidelius charm can't be hidden as it is known to more than a few witches and wizards. However, I see no reason that a fidelius charm couldn't be used to hide a secret, and then another fidelius used to hide the fact that a fidelius had been cast.

Those are from canon, the question of the failure point of the charm is not. If a person attempted to cast the charm on a not-so-secret secret there are a few ways I could see it going. The charm just fails to take completely. The charm takes but all people already aware of the "secret" remain so. The charm takes but all people already aware of the secret become secret keepers. Some combination of these (eg, as long as its fewer than 20 people the charm succeeds but with limitations)
