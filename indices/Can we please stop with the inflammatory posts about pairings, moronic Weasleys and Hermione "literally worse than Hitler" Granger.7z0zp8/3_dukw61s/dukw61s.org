People are out of shit to talk about. I have been coming here for about three years now? Honestly not much has really changed, people recommend the same 10ish stories for everything, almost everything has been talked about. Every couple of months something pops up that inspires a brief discussion of something new.

What you are complaining about has frustratingly been common too. When people are bored they want to be negative.
