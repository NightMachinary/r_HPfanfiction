It wouldn't be done correctly because most people believe Hitler to be a madman that was a psychopath that killed his followers or soldiers on a whim. Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus is the perfect example of that. Hitler was considered to be very charismatic, charming, and polite when in company. He was an astonishing politician. He was just a terrible general.

Anyway, before people calling me a Nazi supporter, I would have taken this idea into heed if I could write or speak German.
