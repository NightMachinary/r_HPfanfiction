I think that the difficult part would be writing the entire thing in English without losing the charisma. Give me some time and I can write a speech with the same speech patterns and rhetorics in German, but turning the entire thing into good sounding English is next to impossible since the German language favours more complex sentences and you can combine words together, giving them a different "sound".
