The best one I remember is either Hogwarts being attacked by some weird Grindelwald/Dumbledore hybrid with an enchanted WWII German battleship and another where Voldemort made a pebble into a Horcrux and accidentally dropped that on the wreck of the Bismarck, reviving ot with magic. Neither was particularly good and I don't even remember the names of them.
