Has any fanfic ever featured literally Hitler at hogwarts?

Example: somehow Grindelwald transferred Hitler into Eva Braun as an unborn child. She gave birth in prison and he turned out to be born as a wizard. His birth is covered up because the authorities don't want a kid to grow up being known as the child of Hitler.
