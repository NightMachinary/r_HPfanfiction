  why the hell do authors try so hard to maintain the timeline?
#+end_quote

The farther you stray from canon, the more you actually have to write/plot.

But to address your actual question, no, I doubt it would be possible to avoid changing the timeline for anyone who went back in the past. A character from the future who ends up in a "do-over" fic would be so far removed from who they /were/ that they couldn't hope to replicate it as they /are/. Mistakes would be inevitable.

... and considering that the whole point of going back is likely to change something, why bother preserving anything at all in the first place? The past has already been mucked with by the mere act of time travel.
