I mean I suppose to answer your question in a very black and white way; Yes it is POSSIBLE, but as you highlighted it would be insanely difficult, I mean horrendously difficult, to try and do everything almost exactly the same as you did originally.

Now from a more literal stand point, maybe. Just maybe. It would take either multiple people going back in time together, and being fully aware of the others that went back aswell, or the one(s) that went back being able to successfully convince the core group that they had indeed come from the future.

If they were able to pull either of those things off I think it is POSSIBLE for someone smart enough to keep things relatively similar to the original timeline, but it would take a huge group effort and coorporation to do so. You'd need to keep everything as close to original until the point you needed/wanted to change.

Finally, if the time travel you're referencing is same as timeturner time travel from cannon then I suppose you could just hide somewhere extremely secluded until you needed to edit the timeline. That said starting any kind of talk about the timeturner canon time travel opens up all kinds of paradox's and plot holes so I don't even want to get too deep into that idea. Basically because in that world, the problem would have never happened, but at the same time it would have happened so that you could fix it and have it never happen? Idk timeturners are actually the dumbest thing ever.

Just my thoughts, I'm probably stupid and wrong but thought I'd share nonetheless.

Hope this helps.
