Would not call you stupid or wrong, as you had good arguments, as i agree with you that it could be possible to remain somewhat close to the timeline, and just hope that the main big events come about the same way. But if Harry is smarter and doesnt dumb himself way down to his 11 year old self, then wormtain might know he is smarter and warn voldy, making him more careful, aggressive, or kidnap him differently, might make wormtain flee sooner, anything can happen when secondary characters react differently to different circumstances.

And wasnt really going to mention the deux ex of timeturners, seems really broken! But more in the line of real timetravel. (Harry potter and the quantum leap for example, or deaths pride -or any of the death sends harry back fics)
