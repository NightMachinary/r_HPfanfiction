Well when I said "if someone is smart enough" I was more insinuating that they would be smart enough to look dumb enough? If you know what I mean. I do understand what you're saying about secondary characters changing the timeline significantly, that's why I was trying to stress how difficult it would be to keep it the same. A change so minor as just taking a different route to the same place you went in the original timeline could, via the butterfly effect, change everything.

We could discuss this all day to be honest, and I'd love to. That said I don't think we'd ever come to a conclusion that satisfied even just the two of us, let alone the population at large. I'm not sure we'd really come to any real conclusion at all to be honest. Not that it would put me off the discussion in any way.

When it comes down to it, despite everything I said originally, in theory I suppose it is POSSIBLE. In practice probably not, heck something as trival as tying your shoelace differently could cause you to trip, someone may see it, laugh at you, cause others to come and look etc. etc. everything would change from then on.

Personally when I read timetravel based FF that tries to stick to the original timeline I just turn off any logical part of my brain and just enjoy the story for what it is, just a story. Digging any deeper just seems to frustrate me.
