If the author chose a time turner as a method for time travel, then it makes sense to avoid changing what the person already knew about. But then the time traveler could change aspects that they didn't already know about.

If the author choses another method (veil, potions, rituals, spells), then I feel like its fair game to change the events.

The easiest option would be writing something similar to the timeline.
