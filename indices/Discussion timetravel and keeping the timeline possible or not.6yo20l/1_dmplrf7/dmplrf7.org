Well in most writings there are two schools of thought about time travel.

The first is that you cannot alter the past and that everything will generally unfurl the same way regardless of your interaction with the past.

For example - Man loves woman. Woman is killed by a mugger. Man invents the time machine to save her, goes back in time and walks down a different street to avoid the mugger, but now she is killed by a runaway car. He tries again and just stays with her in their home but she slips in the shower and breaks her neck - despite his actions the outcome will always be the same because if she did not die he would never have invented the time machine. The timeline is FIXED - we see this illustrated in the original 12 Monkeys movie.

The other is that the timeline is in FLUX and that by changing the past you create a new future (well, new futures as each change then creates spin-off choices which again create new alternate realities). Similar to what happened in the film "Sliding Doors" where we see two of these diverging timelines where the point of divergence was whether the protagonist caught or missed a train. The one who caught the train discovered her partner was cheating on her which started one chain of events. The one who missed the train did not get confronted immediately with her partner's infidelity and the arc of her story is therefore different. Another obvious example of this would be The Butterfly Effect.

I don't think either choice is better for plot/story purposes. Either can be done in a meaningful and impactful way. The key is to be consistent in your choice - if the timeline is fixed it's FIXED the key beats that are revisited must happen - but preferably seen from a new perspective or in a way that its context puts a different spin on how the time traveler viewed "history".

If the timeline is in flux then history will be totally remade and the traveler can only rely on what they know of the /character/ of the historical figures they interact with in order to be able to predict the outcome.

So I guess the TL:DR here is, yes it would be possible if the time travel is within a story universe where the timeline is fixed but not if the travel takes place in a story universe where the timeline is in flux.
