Even if you were trying hardcore to do everything the same, there would be countless things you didn't even remember doing that you would do different. How much do you remember about the year you were 11? Granted, most of our lives haven't been as eventful but I wouldn't even remember my class schedule and half the names of the kids in my grade let alone day to day things.
