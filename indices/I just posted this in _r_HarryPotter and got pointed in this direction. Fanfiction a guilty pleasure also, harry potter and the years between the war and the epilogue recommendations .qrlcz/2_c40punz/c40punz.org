I'll offer you a recommendation and a plug.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=232569][This]] is probably my all-time favorite fic that begins right after the final battle. It's brilliantly done, and it has the advantage of having an amazing [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=264951][mini-sequel]]. Full disclosure: I did not write either story, I'm just a huge fan of both.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=305303][This]] is my current writing project. The story begins about 50 years after the final battle, and includes canon and next-gen characters, as well as a third generation of the family.

Good luck and happy reading!
