My theory, canon-compatible: the wand is enchanted with a primary casting language, usually something out-of-use to differentiate from non-casting conversation. As the wand and owner grow and learn, they expand the repertoire based on hearing about and trying other spells.

Therefore, a Japanese-made wand might have incantations in classical (pre-Heian) Japanese, or they may derive from the more influential Sino-Tibetan traditions, since elements of Tibetan and Chinese cultures were adopted and adapted over centuries along with the migrating religions.
