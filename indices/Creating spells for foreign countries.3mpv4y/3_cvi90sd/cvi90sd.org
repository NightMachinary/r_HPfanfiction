I think using the same incantations could work if you provide adequate explanation for why they're the same.

In the Japanese translation of canon, they didn't change it at all, just copied the spells into Katakana. Search for "ハリー・ポッターシリーズの魔法一覧" on Japanese wikipedia if you want to see.

As others have said, there is classical Japanese, which is mostly dead. Since we only know how they wrote, it would be a lot of trouble to think about the pronunciation. If you want to do different incantations with solid background, I'd suggest checking myths, fairy tales we have.
