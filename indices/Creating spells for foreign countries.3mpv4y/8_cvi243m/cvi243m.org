There's old Japanese, though I have no idea where you could find out enough about it to actually use it.

Another option could be to just make up a japanese sounding language, and have that as an ancient wizarding language. You could have it use the same script as normal Japanese, in the way that Mandarin and Cantonese have the same written part, but are different when spoken.

You could also just use latin spells. Maybe the Roman empire was the first to standardize magic, and they spread it to the rest of the world.

Do they have to use spells/incantations/wands? Maybe they should use something else, like martial arts, songs, acting, or even just have them focus more on visualization.

You could also use a mix of oriental languages. Some spells used in Britain use a mixture of other European languages, in addition to Latin and English. It would be likely that Japanese spells would also use a mix of languages.
