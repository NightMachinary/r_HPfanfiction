I'd say unless you plan on going in depth and AU on how the magic system works, just go with stringing concepts together, even if it doesn't quite make sense in the Japanese language. Remember that HP spells are psuedo-Latin that are heavy on concept at lite on proper grammar: slug vomiting hex is /slugulus eructo/ or slug burp, even though /slug/ has Nordic etymology, /-ulus/ is Latin origin and the actual Latin term for slug is /limax/. Not all of the spells are based on dead languages either, and Latin was not always dead.

 

If you stress to much over it, you end up having to talk about /why/ magic responds to certain words, and that can get messy.
