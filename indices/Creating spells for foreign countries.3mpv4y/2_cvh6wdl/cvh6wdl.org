In which language will you be writing your story? If it is indeed in English, then I would recommend using the same spells. But if you will be writing in language other than English (Japanese perhaps) or if you have adequate knowledge of Japanense itself which is to say something more than -san, -kun, -kawai and etc (don't mean to sound rude) then you can experiment with Japanese words.

As others have pointed out, don't fret too much on the words themselves. JKR's world is supposed to be vague and finding explanations / details for everything within will rob it of the charm.
