did you check how the Japanese translated the spells? I know that in French some spells were changed to sound better to a French ear (stupefy is stup√©fix, crucio is endoloris, Imperio is Impero, and so in my headcanon that's how the French say it in the Potterverse)... it could give you ideas. (I don't mean read it in Japanese, but there has to be a refference to the Japanese translation somewhere on the web).
