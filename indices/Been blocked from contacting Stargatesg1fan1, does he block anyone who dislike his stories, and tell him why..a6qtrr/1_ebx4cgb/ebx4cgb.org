Fanfiction is full of stuff like this; that's probably why it has such a bad reputation. For reasons which mystify me it is very popular. But this is rated M so no one under 16 should be reading it, and if they are, well, that's their look out and not your problem.

It may well break site rules, I haven't read it so I don't know, but if it does you can report it. It's highly unlikely that the site admin will take any action however.

But it's the writer's prerogative to block you if they wish. Your review will stay there.

Just move on. Life is too short to waste it on worthless rubbish.
