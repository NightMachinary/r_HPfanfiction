You definitely overreacted. Authors can write whatever they want and it's not up to you to police them. That story is marked as mature. That alone is enough. It doesn't matter if kids ignore that. That's on them and the parents.

You can't seriously expect everybody to write a certain way just in case children happen across their works. Your line of thinking is absurd, and while the story itself is absurd as well, your review was out of line and the author had every right to block you.

This is the internet. It's full of fucked up things and it's up to the parent to make sure their kid doesn't come across any of it. It's certainly not up to the creator of whatever it is.
