Have you actually read it. The story says a lot about what type of person he is. If he was writing his own story using his own characters i'd agree, but he's using famous characters that kids like more than adults. When you write about such characters, it is his business that my niece searching for a Harry Potter found this pile of excrement. She didn't find it on Fanfiction, but on hpfanficarchive.com. They don't censor, and last I checked he said the smut version was on that site. I linked the Fanfiction one, because I don't want to link that one for obvious reasons.

You believe what you want, but he is at least somewhat responsible for this situation. Again if he wasn't using such well known characters that focus on kids then I wouldn't care too much, but he is, and therefore should be held accountable.

Thanks,\\
