I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you're not a troll.

It's not any of your business what this author chooses to write, and it's not his responsibility that your niece stumbled across adult content. If she needs her internet usage monitored that's her parents/guardians job.

It doesn't sound like a story I would ever read or enjoy, but rape fantasies another adult content is common in fanfiction and people are entitled to write what they want as long as it's not breaking site rules. The author does not have to take it down because you don't like it, and nor do they have to engage in polite conversation with you.
