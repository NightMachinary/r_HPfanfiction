This story really frustrates me. I was following it and enjoying it for a long while. It's well developed, slow-burn. But somewhere around 750k words in, I got so annoyed with the increasing, low-key misogyny (Hermione is so dainty and only eats the smallest of meals, and this somehow becomes a defining character trait ...) that I had to nope-out.
