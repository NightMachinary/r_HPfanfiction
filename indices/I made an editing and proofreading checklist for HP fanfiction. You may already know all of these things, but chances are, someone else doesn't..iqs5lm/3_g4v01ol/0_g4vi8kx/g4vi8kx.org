I think that's perfectly fair. For me personally, one reason I stick so hard to these rules is to make sure my own writing is at least /consistent/, because far worse (for me on my pedestal) than mis-capitalising (or mis-hyphenating) something is capitalising (or hyphenating) it inconsistently across a fic!

In the early stages of my writing, I went back and forth on Muggleborn, pureblood, halfblood hyphenation, until I finally looked up one that I think was straight from the book, and then wrote it down in my notes so that I could just reference that instead of, each time I wanted to write it, having to spend 5 minutes trying to remember how I wrote it in the past!
