There's only one thing i dissagree with. To me, it's the killing curse, Avada Kedavra.

Spell names lower-cased, but incantations upper-cased. I haven't decided on the capitalization item names, to be honest. To me, calming draught is just an item, just like potion is.

Kinda like how I'd capitalize Firebolt, because it's a brand, but wouldn't do the same for broomstick. But I do think that's just preference, and as long as you're consistent, it's fine.

I see that the rule is HP-specific items. But I just find it weird, like it's placing emphasis while it shouldn't.

And I know that JK capitalized Muggle and Muggleborn, and I could squint and see why, but why aren't pureblood and halfblood? It's kinda like albino, white, black, tall. Just designations, descriptions. Why should muggle and muggleborn be capitalized but not the other two?

I'm also undecided on the hyphen in muggleborn, pureblood and halfblood. I know JK does it, and I don't know enough about the rules for hyphenating words, so I can't really say if it's correct or not. It feels like the oxford comma to me. Neither correct nor incorrect, as long as you use it consistently.

For the rest, I agree wholeheartedly. I'm not following them all, I see I'm using some crutches here and there, and I do try to improve.
