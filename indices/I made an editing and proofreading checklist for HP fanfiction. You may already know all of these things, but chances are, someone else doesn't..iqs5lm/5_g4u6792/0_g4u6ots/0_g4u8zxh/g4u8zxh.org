That's completely true for formal writing (eg. professional documents), but for casual use it's completely fine to put together a list using sentence fragments. Just make sure your sentence fragments aren't capitalized---as a rule of thumb, capital letter = sentence, which means you need to end it with a period.

A list that's introduced (as in your examples above) generally ends up being more formal.

The real no-no is mixing list styles---don't capitalize bullet points separated by commas (or sentence fragments) and always punctuate points that are full sentences.
