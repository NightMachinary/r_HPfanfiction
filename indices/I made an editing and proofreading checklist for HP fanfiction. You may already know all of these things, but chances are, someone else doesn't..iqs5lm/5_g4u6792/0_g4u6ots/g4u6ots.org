Expansion: lists obey the same rules of punctuation as everything else.

You can write a list using complete sentences.

- In lists with complete sentences, each bullet begins with a capital letter and ends with a full stop.

- It's basically a series of completely independent sentences.

Alternatively, you can write a list using commas, exactly the same as if you were writing the list out without the bullet points:

- in lists like this you do not capitalise each bullet,

- but each item must end with a comma or a semi-colon, and

- the final item on the list is preceded with an "and" or an "or" and finishes with a full stop, completing the sentence.

The ultimate rule of lists is this: if you remove the bullets, the resulting prose should still make sense. Bullets are just a formatting tool.
