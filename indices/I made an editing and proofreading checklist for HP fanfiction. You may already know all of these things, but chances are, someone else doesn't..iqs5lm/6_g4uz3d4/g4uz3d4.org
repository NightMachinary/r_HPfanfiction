Here's my two knuts on the subject: do all the things people say you should. Or do none of it. Don't do anything readers and critics say are awful. Or do all of them. Try everything at least once, and see what works for you. My second fanfic (as of yet unfinished sadly) is in first-person present tense with POV switches and a number of alternates for 'said'. And I think I can count it a success (for my standards). And I wouldn't have the pleasure of writing in first-person and just how fun it is, if I had taken the random advice of internet strangers.
