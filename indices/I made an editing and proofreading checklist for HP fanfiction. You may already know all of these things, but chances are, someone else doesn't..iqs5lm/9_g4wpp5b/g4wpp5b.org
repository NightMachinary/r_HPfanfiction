This is so great, thank you!! The one problem I have with this is just that it isn't really clear. Some of the dot points are things you want people to do and some you don't want people to do. You should really break it up into ‘dos' and ‘don'ts' because it doesn't really read easily. I can't quite figure out what I should and shouldn't be doing based on this list. It's just gonna be a little hard to understand for people who either don't know the universe inside and out OR for those who speak english as a second language and aren't strong. Or just people like me who are STRUGGLING to understand this list haha. I appreciate it so much, but would LOVE a little clarity.
