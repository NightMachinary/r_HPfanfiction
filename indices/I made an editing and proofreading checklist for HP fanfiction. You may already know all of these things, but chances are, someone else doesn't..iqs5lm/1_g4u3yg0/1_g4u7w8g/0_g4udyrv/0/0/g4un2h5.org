It'll also help if you can create distinct sounding 'voices' for them. Emphasise different things, change your sentence cadence, how events are processed and reacted to, that sort of thing. Really make it clear that you're in the heads of different people.

If you're writing in first person (I'm struggling to parse your comment and can't really tell if you're currently writing first or third) then there's probably a lot of useful information and guides for you in D&D guides on DM roleplaying. When you're one person playing pretty much everybody on an entire planet, you have to work to keep people sounding distinct in ways other than just accents. :)
