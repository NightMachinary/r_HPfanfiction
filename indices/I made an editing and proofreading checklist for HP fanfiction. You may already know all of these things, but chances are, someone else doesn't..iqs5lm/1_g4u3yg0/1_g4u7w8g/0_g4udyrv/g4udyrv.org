You can switch in a chapter, just don't switch in the same scene. There are published and successful novels that do this because the chapter has more than one scene and this can also be done with fanfiction.

That being said, if you can stay in one POV in an entire chapter, that is probably the way to go, but if not, switch in the next scene, just try to avoid doing this if you can, especially try to avoid doing it multiple times in the same chapter. It does all depends on the genre of the story and what exactly you are doing, but there is still a general rule. I find that reading either published books, very well-written fanfiction, or google helps whenever I have doubts about how I am writing something.
