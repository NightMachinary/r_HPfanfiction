This! There's lots of people saying never switch in a single chapter, but I'm of the opinion that switching mid chapter can be done, and done well. Just don't switch in the middle of a scene and make it clear the switch is happening.

Hint: if you have to indicate the pov switch by explicitly stating "harry's point of view" or something, you're doing it wrong
