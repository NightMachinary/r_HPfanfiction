Absolutely. A change of subject should be illustrated, never explicitly stated. If the introduction of the new subject can be executed naturally using elements relevant to the preceding scene, all the better. That way, the reader can comprehend the relation between the two scenes, and the author can avoid jarring or confusing their audience.

Moreover, I don't understand the desire to make scenes and chapters functionally equivalent. Those are two distinct concepts that exist simultaneously for very good reasons: To me, a scene is the narrative of a specific event unfolding from one perspective (change of perspective requires change of scene, even if the same event is retold from a different angle), whereas a chapter is a set of one /or more/ scenes, that together form the narrative of a series of events with distinct, delineated meaning to the story. Sentence < Paragraph < Scene < Chapter < Arc < Story.

If so, then equating a scene with a chapter implies either A) Very boring - and short - chapters, or B) The conflation of several separate events into a single scene. I don't see why either would be desirable.
