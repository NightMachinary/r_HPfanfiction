I have seen far too many fics that could really use this list.

I'd add:

- Check your tenses. Writing in present tense is +objectively wrong+ fine, if you really want to, but you have to at least be consistent.
- Delete all flashbacks. They are a crutch for bad writing, and you're probably using them wrong anyway.
