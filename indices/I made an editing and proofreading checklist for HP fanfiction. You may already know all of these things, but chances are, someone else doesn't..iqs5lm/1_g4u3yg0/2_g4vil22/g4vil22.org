On a very personal level I definitely agree with your comment on present tense. I simply can't read present tense stuff anymore. (I'm sure I used to read some present tense novels in school, probably.) I think it can be done incredibly well, but I just find it so hard to parse through.

However, I simply don't have the experience or expertise in present-tense writing to unilaterally make a claim against it :P
