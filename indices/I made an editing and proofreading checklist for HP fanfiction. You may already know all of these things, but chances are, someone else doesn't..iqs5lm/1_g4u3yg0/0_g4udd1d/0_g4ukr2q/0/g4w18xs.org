Not just combat scenes. I rather like it for oneshots that are meant to be tense - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8809533/1/][And the Wolves All Cry]] is a great example of a short story sized fic that's done well in present tense.

That being said... I was always under the impression that it's never appropriate to switch between the two. Are you aware of any examples where it's done correctly?

I find sticking to past tense extremely difficult, and will often shift mid-sentence: "dialogue here," he said, <describe some actions in present>. Needless to say, I reread everything and I'm constantly fixing it. With my current WIP, I just said fuck it and switched everything to present tense, third person limited, because I can keep it consistent and it thankfully suits the style of the story.
