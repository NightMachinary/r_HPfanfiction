I mean, if you're American or particularly American-influenced, it's probably just cultural priming. You use the quotes like that, the people around you use the quotes like that, the media you consume use the quotes like that, so you're basically starting from a point of "This is the correct way to do it" in the same way that we in the UK would start from 'autumn' being correct instead of 'fall'.

Both types of quotes are technically correct, after all, they're just correct in different places. Equally, a French person would find it correct to use Guillemets instead of either thing and be equally correct for their part of the world.
