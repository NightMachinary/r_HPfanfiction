I assume here you're referring to single vs double quotes:

Haha, that's a great question. I'm not exactly an authority on this, but in my own experience, it has been a long time since I've read a book with British-style quotes, and a semi-long time since I've read a fanfic with British-style quotes.

I certainly wouldn't stand on my high horse and say "only use American-style quotes," but I know for me it's a lot easier to read double quotes than single quotes in stories. Maybe it's simply because I'm used to it? I think there's also the fact that I might confuse single quotes with apostrophes...

At any rate, I'd pick whatever is more comfortable for you, or what you deem most appropriate for your fic, as long as you are consistent across your fic.

(There's also the whole argument you can get into about "punctuation inside the quotes, American-style" or "punctuation outside the quotes, British-style" but I will withdraw my stick from that particular fire. I've seen people mix double quotes [American] with punctuation outside quotes [British], for example.)
