Oh, I'm currently reading a disaster of a fic and was reminded of one more:

If you use a descriptive noun or whatever to refer to somebody, make sure it actually makes sense.

AKA don't call Harry "the raven" unless he's literally a bird. If you're referring to his hair, SAY SO. This is not the first time I've seen this nonsense :x
