I'm glad to see this story get discussed. I remember that I enjoyed reading this & Solstice Muse's other story inspired by The Time Traveler's Wife years ago. However, I re-read Scourgified last year and found myself not enjoying it as much as I did before because of the stuff you mentioned in your review. It still has a special place in my heart though.
