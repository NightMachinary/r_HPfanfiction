I mean, I'd be curious to know how old that kind of law is, especially in a broadly common law system like we have here. If it's post 1600-whatever, then it's possible the Wizards wouldn't really care.

In terms of competition laws - Bagman cheats the Twins and they never get their money back or mention a Ministry way to mediate/get compensation for the issue, so we know they don't probably really have security laws aside from 'death by Goblin'. Mayhaps they don't have 'effort' terms like that either?
