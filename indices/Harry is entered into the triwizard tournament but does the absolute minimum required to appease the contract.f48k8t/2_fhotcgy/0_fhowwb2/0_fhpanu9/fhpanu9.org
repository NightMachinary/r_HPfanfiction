Even if it breaks off at the statue of secrecy, I'd still expect common contract law to include general principles like "willingly entering the contract" - which mean that in any common law court Harry wouldn't be required to do anything at all, since neither he nor a legal substitute (guardian, someone with power of attorney) is a willing party to the contract.

Which does leave the loophole of someone tricking Vernon into entering Harry on Harry's behalf, which might sort-of hold up (the age restriction should still kill the contract).
