The word you're looking for is "criminal". To call something illegal is to say it is contrary to law, but this is a much larger class of things than those with a criminal offence attached.

Many actions are unlawful without being criminal - the entire class of actions known in English law as torts, such as trespass, false imprisonment, conversion, etc., which are civil rather than criminal wrongs.

Slavery within Britain has always been illegal - which is to say, a civil wrong which courts would correct if asked to do so - but it has not always been a criminal offence.

The distinction between "illegal" and "not legally recognised" doesn't really exist when it comes to slavery. Rather, detaining a person against their will is prima facie illegal (unlawful imprisonment), and can only be justified by a lawful excuse (i.e. if slavery had been legally recognised, it would have created an exception to the illegality).

As for "positive law": the default assumption of English law is that of liberty, i.e. all things are permitted until they are prohibited by law. In English law, you don't need positive law to give you rights: rather, positive law is required to /take away/ rights. In the case of slavery, a positive law would have been required to displace the common law right of all people to habeas corpus.
