Wouldn't Habeas Corpus (at that general time) only be applicable if they were regarded as English Citizens? ie. If you kidnapped someone from another country, then brought them here, would they still be protected by Habeas Corpus?

I am most definitely neither solicitor or lawyer, so this is all just my layman understanding of stuff I've picked up here and there over the years and I can't really repudiate or question or confirm anything you've said with what I currently know. I'd take your word for it, but like me you're a random voice on the internet and I have no idea if you're right or not. Though I'm getting the feeling I may have misunderstood something somewhere, so I'm gonna try and find where I've likely mis-stepped. I think I might've misunderstood the 2010 thing as filling a gap where slavery was never criminalised or tort-illegal rather than taking the common law into statutes/codified law.

I can't tell if that last paragraph comes off in an offensive manner or not, but I am definitely not intending to be insulting or anything. I just think it's very silly to take anything someone on the internet says as gospel without doing some work to verify/substantiate it. This is something that'll take me a while to look into and I feel it'd be rude for me to leave a response any longer, hence me making this conclusion-less response now. Thank you for taking the time to educate me, either way. :)
