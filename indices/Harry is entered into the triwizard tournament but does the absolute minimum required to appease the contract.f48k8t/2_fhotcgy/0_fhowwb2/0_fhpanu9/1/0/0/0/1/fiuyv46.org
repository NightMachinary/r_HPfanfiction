Very true. I've been reading up and apparently I made a wrong turn somewhere and started metaphorically reading some stuff backwards somehow and I was wrong. Thank you for explaining enough to give me things to google and poke through legal texts and analyses to find. Made a lot of really boring reading into slightly less really boring reading. :D
