It's really more of a quibble than anything else. Mostly depends on your philosophical and practical definitions of illegal and legal. I'll explain that as I go, it's easier to demonstrate with examples.

From what I understand of the situation, the previous cases of slavers being penalised or punished had criminals charged with the things that lead to slavery, but never slavery itself. False imprisonment, assault, trafficking, even owning a person, etc, but never was anyone charged using the term 'slavery'. It's true that slavery was technically illegal, in that most of the things you'd have to do to get a slave and keep one were illegal, but the actual charge of 'enslaving a person' didn't exist. It was 'technically' legal, just not practically. In a case around 2010, we realised that having all the separate laws might've worked, but it was ridiculously impractical and thus combined the lot. We ignored the problem until it became one, then we fixed it. That was the point I was originally trying to make. Our legal system is almost entirely made up of things enshrined into law through that pattern. Ignore an issue, see it become a problem, then make a law to forbid it.

And technically those cases of freeing slaves were never done on the grounds that slavery was illegal, only that it wasn't legally recognised. Again, only a technical distinction, but an important one in English law at the time. We have a thing called 'Positive Laws' that give people rights or specify actions you can/must do - think the 'you have the right to bear arms' in the second amendment(?), as a good example of the format. If you are/do A, then you can be/do B, basically. That's how the US established slavery as a thing, and we never had any of those positive laws on slavery. Essentially, you couldn't enforce the right of one person to own another (or rather, to apply chattel property law to a person). That's what it means when there's 'no legal basis to support' something in English Law. It doesn't mean the practice is illegal, only that it isn't legal.

(Oh, and the ruling of the Mansfield case you're (and they're) quoting essentially was that people cannot be removed from England against their will, but the judge was quoted as saying he believed that property rights could not be attributed to people except by positive law, but he never put that into his ruling.)

The lacking distinction of slavery as a separate thing arose from Norman times (1100 ish) when they took advantage of the Irish-Icelandic fights over Slavery to abolish the trade of slaves and the networks there just sort of fell apart and the slaves melted into the serfs of the feudal system and the clarification was never really made from there as it was never needed. Again, ignore the issue until it becomes a problem, then make laws on it. We're big on that pattern here.

Apologies for the long message, but if I'm wrong please do correct me. I'm always happy to learn!
