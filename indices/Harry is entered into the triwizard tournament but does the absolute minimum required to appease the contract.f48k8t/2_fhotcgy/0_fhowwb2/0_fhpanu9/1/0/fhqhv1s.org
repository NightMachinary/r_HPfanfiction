  I mean, owning a slave was technically legal in England until 2010

Definitely not the case. Even during the height of the slave trade, owning a slave was illegal /inside/ Britain. There are various cases from the 16th to 18th centuries where courts freed slaves on the basis that there was no legal basis for slavery in English law. The cases use various phrases of a similar type: to set foot on English soil makes you free; to breathe English air makes you free.

The problem, of course, was not the law itself but access to the justice system. Which is the same problem as today with modern slavery.
