Ooooh. That's a really good point. Magical Mythology would be a really interesting legal foundation for them to operate on, while mixing in some typical common law stuff as well. After all, like someone said in this ([[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/f4unur/headcanon_entering_someone_into_a_contract/]]) thread, it is possible to bind someone to a contract without their consent or knowledge, so maybe their legal system reflects that magically-induced reality. They'd probably be more likely to hold with what magic allows than what 'Muggle morality/legality' dictates, no? Why legislate against something magic would enforce anyway?
