As another layman with some knowledge of (Common) Contract Law - all I can say is that CCL doesn't seem to apply.

I did, however, recall some Irish myth about geases: those most certainly did /not/ require anything like informed consent, and were quite binding, as well as being explicitly magical. They are probably a better basis for how magical contracts work.

Unfortunately, that memory is someone telling me about them, so I have no reference to share.
