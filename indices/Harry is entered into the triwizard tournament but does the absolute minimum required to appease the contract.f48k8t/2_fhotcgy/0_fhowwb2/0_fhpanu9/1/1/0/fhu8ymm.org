True. I make a lot of semi-extrapolated assumptions to fill in gaps of stuff I don't know/can't remember until I can find/be corrected with the right answer. Like, I would assume that most of our changing governments would've instituted new laws each time we were conquered or our national structure changed (eg. the integration of Scotland and Wales and beginning of the UK rather than simply England). The Normans did institute their laws over the older English laws in the 11th century, so it's possible. I'm not sure how those transitions occurred though, nor how they might differ in magical society.

Also, it's possible that 'consent' differs in some magical sense - perhaps Harry resigning himself to taking part counted at consent? And if being told that being told that your name being in the goblet counted as 'informing', then it's possible he also wouldn't be able to claim he was tricked into 'signing' either.

And if memory serves, UK Common Law and English Common Law aren't necessarily the same thing, so perhaps one covers it and not the other, and that one was never adopted by magical people?

If nothing else, we know their legal system isn't necessarily like ours, given their apparent government-influence in the Prophet and general libel/slander behaviours.

I am most definitely neither solicitor or lawyer, so this is all just my layman understanding of stuff I've picked up here and there over the years. I'll be poking around over the next week or so to try and see what I can find on this and the slavery pre-2010-illegality note, so hopefully I'll be able to find something.
