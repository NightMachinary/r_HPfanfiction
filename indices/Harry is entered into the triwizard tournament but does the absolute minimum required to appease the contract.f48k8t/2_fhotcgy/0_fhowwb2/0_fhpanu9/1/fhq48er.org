Well, possibly. But Common Law relies on things having 'come up' in the past and laws being made then. Someone has to make a law and forbid a thing, right? If everyone in Ye Olde Magical Britain had gone all in on the Tournament, then there might never have been a law made and thus it'd be perfectly legal. I mean, owning a slave was technically legal in England until 2010, while trading them was made illegal in the 1800s. If stuff doesn't come up, we really don't get to it quickly.

EDIT - For anyone rereading this in the future, I checked - did a lot of reading of some really dry historical legal texts and more mercifully modern analyses - and Taure is correct here. Ignore everything I say about Slavery being legal or not criminalised, I was operating on some odd misunderstandings of centuries-old legal structures. :D
