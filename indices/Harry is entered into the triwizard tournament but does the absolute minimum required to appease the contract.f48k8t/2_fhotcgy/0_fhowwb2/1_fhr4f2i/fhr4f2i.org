But you aren't dealing with the Statute of Secrecy as a point of divergence, you're dealing with the Goblet, which is presumably much older. For instance, it does not care that Harry hasn't yet reached majority -- the Age Line had to be added on top, and isn't actually part of the binding contract. So it isn't post-1600 -- it's more like maybe post-1200 or something, whenever the Triwizard Tournament was first introduced.
