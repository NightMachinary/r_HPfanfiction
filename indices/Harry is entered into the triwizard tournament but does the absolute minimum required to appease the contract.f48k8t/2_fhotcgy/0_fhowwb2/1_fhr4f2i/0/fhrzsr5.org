Fair point. But it's possible they added a second set of laws in addition to the magical ones on the Cup. Like the cup gives the basics "Put names in the cup, I pick the competitors" and then there's some legal thing somewhere that says "If you are a competitor in the triwizard tournament, then you must do A, B, and C". Probably not, and they probably just left it at the Cup's rules and called it a day, but Harry was so oblivious he could've signed a dozen documents without really making note of it to us.
