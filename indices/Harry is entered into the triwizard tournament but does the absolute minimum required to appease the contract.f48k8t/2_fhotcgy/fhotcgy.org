Sorry, don't know the fic. But as an aside, chances are that the Triwizard rules would include a clause (express or implied) that participants try to win. Such terms are common in contracts and routinely enforced. Similarly, the rules of sporting competitions generally do not permit teams to "throw" games.

There are even different recognised levels of trying (subject always to the particular terms of the contract, read as a whole). In simple terms:

#+begin_quote
  Endeavour = token effort is enough.

  Reasonable endeavours = you have to genuinely try.

  All reasonable endeavours = you have to genuinely try and keep trying until you have exhausted all reasonable avenues.

  Best endeavours = you have to try so hard that you are expected to sacrifice your own benefit to achieve the goal.
