I'm arguing that actually seeing a death in person and processing it has magical weight that representations of it don't.

Like, I've watched a lot of hunting shows growing up, but seeing my dad shoot a deer the first time he took me out to the deerstand (when I was... 5-ish?) had a weight to it none of the shows did. And that was nothing compared to my first deer.
