It depends on who was officially disowned from the family versus simply burned off the tapestry, and also if women can inherit the title. Sirius would be first in line (if he wasn't disowned), then Andromeda (if she wasn't officially disowned), then Bellatrix, then Narcissa, then Draco.

Delphi Riddle was born out of wedlock, so if we're going with the typical lord/ladies inheritance system, she probably wouldn't be able to inherit.
