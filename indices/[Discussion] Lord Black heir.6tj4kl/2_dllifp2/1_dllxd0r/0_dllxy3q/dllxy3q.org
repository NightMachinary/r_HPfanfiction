In Britain at least, any change in the line of succession for the monarchy must be by Act of Parliament, as since 1688 (when Parliament crowned the King of their choosing rather than the next in line by succession), Parliament has had supremacy over the Crown. (De facto supremacy goes back further).

A current holder can disinherit someone of any property that is theirs to pass on. So in canon, where there is no indication that the Blacks have any title, Sirius is free to will Grimmauld place and Kreacher to Harry.

But titles are generally not property in the sense of property that you can dispose of as you wish. Rather they are honours granted by the monarch. You cannot pass on or sell your title because the giving of titles belongs to the monarch alone, and it will be inherited according to the method the monarch dictated at the time the title was created.

There are /some/ titles that are attached to land, which are a different kind of title known as manorial title. These will transfer with the land if the land is sold. But these titles are not noble titles but rather the titles of the gentry: they entitle you to the title "Lord", but you are not part of the hierarchy of the nobility. Further, most of those titles could not historically be sold as they were a form of property ownership known as entail, where the current "owner" had a life interest only, not full legal title. It was only in the 20th century that entails were able to be broken up and sold (and the creation of new entails is unlawful).
