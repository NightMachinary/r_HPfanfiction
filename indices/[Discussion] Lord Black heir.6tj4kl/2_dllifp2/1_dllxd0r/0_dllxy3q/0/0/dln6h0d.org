Adoption usually confers the same rights as if you were born to your parents.

I also have to mention that at least in Germany, high nobles often had their own house laws, which settled who inherited, who got money from the family fortune, and so on: [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausgesetz]]

It would not be unreasonable if noble wizard families had such laws as well.
