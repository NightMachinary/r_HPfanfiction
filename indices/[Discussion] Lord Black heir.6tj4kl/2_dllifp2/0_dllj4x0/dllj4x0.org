But the wizards could have a system of their own for titles, and how the rules are set up for them would be up to the author, since canon doesn't have/mention such titles. It could very well allow adoption to work, and I'd say that most likely, genders would be treated as equals. Or it could be entirely up to the current holder of the title - like how the rules of the Admiral's Cup are made by the current holder.
