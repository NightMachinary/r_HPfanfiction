This is a very complete analysis of the Black family situation in the late 20th century.

Thank you very much for taking your time to write this.

It's very interesting that RON might have a stronger claim than Harry and even Draco to 'Lord Black title' if this title follows traditional European rules.

Perhaps Lucius and Draco aren't that interesred in the Lord Black title because themselves might actually have their own title (the Malfoy one), and as I said earlier, the headship might or not be inherited along with the material possessions (that probably can be given freely in a Will to whoever the owner considers it).

How ever this 'Heir without a possessions' it's very unlikely because the tradition usually have the Heir keep most of the main state and gave to the other offspring token gifts at best.
