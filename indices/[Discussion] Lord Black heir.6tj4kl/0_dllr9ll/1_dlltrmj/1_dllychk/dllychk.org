The more I think about it, the more interesting the idea of Phineas Black gets. A second son, he's watched /four generations/ inherit from his father (assuming Sirius actually inherited) before he gets his chance when he's in his 110s. He probably attended Hogwarts within a couple years of Dumbledore and watched him become the most powerful wizard in Britain. What does he do when he finally gets his chance?
