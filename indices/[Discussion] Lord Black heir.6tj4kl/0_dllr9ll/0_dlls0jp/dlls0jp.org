Great breakdown!!

I think you flipped Draco and Arthur at one point though. Draco is descended from PNB's third son, Cygnus (great-great grandson) while Arthur is descended from PNB's fourth son, Arcturus (great-grandson).

The other interesting question (and this would come down to OCs, so it might not be preferable) is where the Burkes and Longbottoms come in, as they could have a better claim than Arthur Weasley. Neville's great-uncle Algernon could be the child of Callidora Black and Harfang Longbottom.
