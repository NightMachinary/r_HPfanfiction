  I think you flipped Draco and Arthur
#+end_quote

I don't think so. "According to the wiki" (quotes for reasonable scepticism but having no better alternative), Arcturus Black II (Arthur's grandfather) was born in 1884, and Cygnus Black II (Draco's great-great-grandfather) was born in 1889.

  Neville's great-uncle Algernon could be the child of Callidora Black and Harfang Longbottom.

If Neville's great-uncle was the child of Callidora, then Neville would necessarily be the ... great-grandson of Callidora? Unless Harfang remarried at some point. Or "great-uncle" was simply a courtesy title.
