  who was Lord Black in the Maraunder's era

Arcturus Black III (b. 1901) would likely be Head/Lord from 1952 to 1991.

Arcturus Black III (Sirius' grandfather) was the oldest son of Sirius Black II (died 1952) who was the oldest son of Phineas Nigellus Black (died 1925). Arcturus didn't die until 1991 (outliving his only son, Orion Black, Sirius' father, who died in '79, and Walburga Black, Sirius' mother, who died in '85).

We don't know enough. It depends on whether Sirius was actually disinherited, whether Heads/Lords can "name" their heir or whether title inheritance is determined simply by law, does inheritance pass to the oldest living or to oldest male of oldest line, etc.

When Arcturus Black III died in 1991 he was survived by a number of Blacks and their /known descendents/:

- Iola Hitchens née Black (death unknown, b. 1850s but maybe alive), sister of Phineas Nigellus Black
- Lucretia Prewitt née Black (d. 1992), granddaughter of Sirius Black II, first son of PNB
- Sirius Black III (d. 1996), i.e., Harry's Sirius, great-grandson of Sirius Black II, first son of PNB
- Phineas Black (death unknown, b. 1878-1883 but maybe alive), second son of Phineas Nigellus Black
- Callidora Longbottom née Black (death unknown, b. 1915 but maybe alive), daughter of Arcturus Black II, third son of PNB
- Cedrella Weasley née Black (death unknown, b. 1915-19 but maybe alive), daughter of Arcturus Black II, third son of PNB

  - /Arthur Weasley/, son of Cedrella Weasley née Black

    - /Bill Weasley/
    - /Charles Weasley/
    - /Fred Weasley (d. 1998)/
    - /George Weasley/
    - /Percy Weasley/
    - /Ron Weasley/
    - /Ginny Weasley/

- Cassiopeia Black (d. 1992), daughter of Cygnus Black II, fourth son of PNB
- Cygnus Black III (d. 1992), grandson of Cygnus Black II, fourth son of PNB

  - Bellatrix Lestrange née Black (d. 1998)
  - Andromeda Tonks née Black

    - /Nymphadora Tonks (d. 1998)/

  - Narcissa Malfoy née Black

    - /Draco Malfoy/

- Marius Black (death unknown, b. 1915-1920 but maybe alive), squib and son of Cygnus Black II, fourth son of PNB

In addition, there are at least two other Blacks who have passed on but may have non-Black descendents with inheritance claims:

- Charis Crouch née Black (d. 1973), daughter of Arcturus Black II, third son of PNB
- Belvina Burke née Black (d. 1962), only daughter of PNB

Canon, Harry Potter has no known relationship to the Black family until he marries Ginny (granddaughter of Cedrella Weasley née Black). If we ignore that Fleamont nonsense and say Dorea Potter née Black was Harry's grandmother (thus making Harry and Ginny third cousins via PNB ... which is /fine/, no sarcasm), then (absent Sirius being able to name an heir) Draco's claim is probably better than Harry's --- Draco is the grandson of a male Black heir (Cygnus Black III) who would have been next to inherit after Arcturus if Sirius wasn't eligible, while Harry is only the great-grandson of a male Black heir (Cygnus Black II). Draco also descends from CBII, but through the oldest son (Pollux Black) rather than through a younger daughter (Dorea).

If Sirius was ineligible, then that would basically strike out the entire line from Sirius Black II (son of Phineas Nigellus Black). The next oldest son of PNB was Phineas Black who was not known to have any descendents but could still be alive. The next oldest son was Arcturus Black II which could actually give Arthur Weasley a claim. After Belvina, we finally have PNB's fourth son Cygnus Black II (great-grandfather of Sirius via Walburga, as well as B/A/N).

Arthur Weasley's claim might be better than Draco's. Like Draco, he is also the grandson of a male Black heir, but he descends from PNB's third son while Draco descends from PNB's fourth. However, if CBIII does inherit because he is in a direct male line, that could strengthen Draco's claim over Arthur's later despite Arthur having primacy from PNB. EDIT: Callidora may have been disinherited, removing Arthur's claim.

So, when Arcturus Black III dies in 1991, the possible heirs are:

- Sirius Black III (b. 1959, d. 1996), great-grandson of SBII, first son of PNB (if not disinherited)
- Phineas Black (b. 1878-83), second son of PNB (if still alive, we don't know, but he'd be about the same age as Dumbledore, b. 1881)
- Arthur Weasley (b. 1950), grandson of Arcturus Black II, third son of PNB, but with a break in the male line and possible disinheritance
- Cygnus Black III (b. 1938, d. 1992), grandson of CBII, fourth son of PNB

Who actually inherits depends on whether Arcturus named an heir, whether breaks in the male line count against you, etc. My money is on Sirius --- he /did/ inherit 12 Grimmauld Place, so he /wasn't/ disinherited (or at least reinstated after being sent to Azkaban as a Death Eater and thus proving his worth). After Sirius dies in 1996, I'd say it goes to Phineas --- if the Tapestry doesn't say he's dead, then he's not, and he has precedence.

Huh, it just occured to me that Marius Black is the first cousin once-removed of Arthur Weasley, and could be related to Molly through Lucretia ("I think Mom's got a second cousin..."). In 1991 he would be in his '70s and related to the Weasleys through the Black family --- two reasonable reasons to "never talk about him" (just because his name never comes up, not because it's verboten).

Also, there were a number of important Black deaths in the early '90s: Pollux Black (great-grandfather of Draco) in 1990 (age 78), Arcturus Black III (grandfather of Sirius) in 1991 (age 90), and Cygnus Black III (grandfather of Draco) in 1992 (age 54), as well as Cassiopeia Black (age 77) and Lucretia Prewitt née Black (age 67) in 1992. Most of them were reasonably old, but ... maybe Lucius clearing the way for Draco to inherit?
