I'd like to believe that there is true nobility, it just require subjugation. Tom /could've/ been a respected lord and a true political player, had he and his posse not gallivanted about committing various atrocities. Buuuut he broke off somewhere between a good chunk and most of his soul, so we ended up with a wraith in a homunculus.
