Indeed. It's just something that some fans have toyed with.

IMO Even if it was as a true nobility title (which of course it isn't) Sirius could give Harry EVERYTHING in his possession (12 Grimmauld place, the money, the freaking furniture, the books, etc)EXCEPT the title because it'd be granted by very different rules. Draco could get the 'Lordship' but absolutely nothing else. Perhaps the only way to pass it to Harry would be that He was adopted into the family (like the old Roman families)

Basically all this 'Lord Black, potter, Slytherin, etc" are as must of us know, illogical bad fics, that have little idea of how nobility or inheritance works.
