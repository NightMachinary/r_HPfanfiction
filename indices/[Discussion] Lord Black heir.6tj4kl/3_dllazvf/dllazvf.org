The whole inheritance thing is too flimsy in canon to really be worth following. Sirius, who was "disinherited" by his mother, willed the headship to harry, who is at least 3 generations removed from any black blood.

 

At worst, sirius was soft disinherited for any of three reasons.

A Lord is a sovereign, and sovereigns require subjects, unlike a familial head. The wizarding world definitely has an aristocracy, but tom was the only actual Lord knocking about.
