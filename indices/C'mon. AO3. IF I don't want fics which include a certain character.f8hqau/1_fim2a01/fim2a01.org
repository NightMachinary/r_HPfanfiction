That's why i use the filters to remove all the unwanted relationships. I go as far as removing 30 relationship tags so as to not have a problem later. Honestly just remove the pairings and not the characters. Even if you really really don't like a character you might just stumble upon a story you might dig (which you might have missed because it happened to have that character listed).

You can also use additional tags or the category to remove M/M if you want. Some fic might still get through, but you have to deal with it.

Honestly it doesn't take more than two minutes to do all of that.
