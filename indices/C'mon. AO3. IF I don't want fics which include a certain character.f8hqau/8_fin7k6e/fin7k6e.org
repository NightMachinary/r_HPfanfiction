I only venture into AO3 through here and google only. AO3 was full of slash and full mess with tags. I like ffn tags much better only four characters. That's enough for any story, imo. No one is gonna need a tag like Katie/Lee only to be mentioned in one sentence in some 40th chapter. I wish ffn had two more character selection boxes in exclude search list. At present I only excluding Draco and Snape. If I had two more I could add Vildemort and Tom Riddle Jr.
