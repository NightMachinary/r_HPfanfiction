Ah, okay. So it really is a sheer volume of inaccuracy issue (ie. You're getting lots of stuff that isn't what you want). That is a big thing on Ao3. I was noting to someone else in this thread that two of the highest pairings when looking for F/M fics are M/M pairings (Sirius/Remus and Draco/Harry).

Oh, and before I forget, the 'suggestion box' for Ao3 is [[https://archiveofourown.org/support]] and their twitter handles. There's also more advanced search options with a tutorial here ([[https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/10851]]) that may help.

EDIT: I found the 'support' link in the contacting the staff FAQ here ([[https://archiveofourown.org/faq/contacting-the-staff?language_id=en#sendfeedback]]) and it said feedback was acceptable there, even if the page itself doesn't seem to.

I don't know if the suggestion box will be useful though. It seems like it's the nature of the system they use - it seems to be meant for searching really specific things with wide exclusions and not just searching widely with specific exclusions. Like it's supposed to get you as many options as possible, directly related or indirect. Worth a try though, maybe they'll know a way around that we don't (and if they do, please post it!).
