No but since I don't want to read Draco or indeed Snape relationship stories, I sometimes have to scroll past pages of stuff to find anything to read at all.

And if I find something, finish it and go back to look for more, I have to set all my preferences again. It's a waste of time and makes using AO3 a lot less enjoyable.

Maybe if it was a less prevalent tag, it wouldn't matter but the little shit is unaccountably popular and stories that feature him make up a ridiculous proportion of everything on the site, and are correspondingly difficult to avoid.
