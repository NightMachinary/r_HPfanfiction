Personally speaking, it's not a matter of individual fics so much as it is a matter of volume.

If you exclude Draco Malfoy because you want to read absolutely nothing with Draco Malfoy in and then a third of the fics on your first page still contain Draco Malfoy/Someone ship tags it's more /frustrating/ than anything else.

Sure you can just ignore them but if you're ignoring a huge chunk of the fics then it's not exactly a mystery as to why you might want to filter the lot of them out with as few tags as possible.

For example, I would /love/ the ability to filter out entire categories when looking through a tag because I am never going to want to read RPF so if I could get rid of that entire category rather than the specific fandoms therein then I would be a very happy bunny. Sure I /can/ get rid of them with the fandom tags, but it's annoying to have to do so.
