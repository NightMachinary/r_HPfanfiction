Ah, okay. That makes sense. Thank you for your answer. It sounds like it's not so much about Malfoy specifically as it is about the site not really doing what you're asking it to do. Like the fact that two of the highest pairings when looking for F/M fics are M/M pairings (Sirius/Remus and Draco/Harry). Malfoy is just a particularly annoying/prevalent example. Right?

I think it seems like we search differently too. I tend to go looking for a specific thing, so I tend to end up with far fewer unrelated things - eg. "I want to read a Harry-Hermione fic today" so I filter to get only that, which means my not-that-pairing fics number tends to be quite low. Like, if I click F/M, then Hermione/Harry, I only get 130-ish of the 2800-ish fics having that pairing.
