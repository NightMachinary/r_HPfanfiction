I apologise in advance if this comes off as any way insulting or demeaning, but I'm horribly confused and too tired to edit for amenability.

Is this really something that bothers you all overmuch? Just seeing a fic summary of a fic with one of those relationships you don't like? Like, isn't just scrolling past them simpler and less time consuming? You don't have to read a fic just because you see a summary of it, no?
