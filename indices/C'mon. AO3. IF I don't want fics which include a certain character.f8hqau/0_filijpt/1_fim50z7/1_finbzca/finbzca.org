There is a downside with 'too many' tags - and that's in not exactly making it clear which is important. That is to say, if I'm looking at the descriptions and the tags, it'd be nice to know which are major ones in the story - and which might have basically no presence there.

Eg, tagging something with a relationship that pops up a single time in chapter 4 and never gets mentioned again - while technically true - is also mostly irrelevant.
