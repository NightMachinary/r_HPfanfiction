The one case where it can be an issue is where someone plans to write some huge, sweeping epic and tags all the characters/relationships right away, and the fic is abandoned after 4 chapters with 90% of those characters/relationships never appear in the story. If you're looking for a specific character or rare pairing, it can be frustrating to go through all 15 chapters of a story only to find the author got ahead of themselves when tagging.
