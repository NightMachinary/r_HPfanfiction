I mean, yeah. It's not the only or even worst place in terms of AO3 usability.

Just a random example: if you click on Search -> Works, at least on mobile it's easier to search /for/ rape or underage than to exclude it. Which is not how content warnings work.

[[https://imgur.com/rqHccVt.jpg][Clicking "Rape" in the Warnings section searches for fics containing it, uit doesn't avoid it]]

I'm not saying that this shouldn't be a feature, because there are probably users of that features. But making it easier to search for it than to exclude it a yikes from me -- makes the place more hostile to people affected by this.

I have so many more examples of why AO3s most important upgrade to the site should be an usability rework.

Just for fun, here is a more minor nitpick. Search for "Excluding Crossovers" but two fandoms in the search. I have no clue how how the results are generated, [[https://imgur.com/qpA7UhB.jpg][but it's rather confusing]]

Instead AO3 just should limit the input to one fandom in that case, or search for "either fandom A or fandom B" if "exclude crossovers" is on.

Anyway, I could go on all day with major and minor nitpicks. It's still a great site, don't get me wrong - but there's loads of room from improvement.
