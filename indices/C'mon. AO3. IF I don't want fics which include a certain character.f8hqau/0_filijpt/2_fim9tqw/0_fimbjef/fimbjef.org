Not necessarily. I can write a fic where character A is in a relationship with B, but B never actually appears in person. I don't think that's even particularly uncommon in shorter fics.

Regardless, that kind of a setup would probably take some serious restructuring of the way relationship tags work on AO3, and I don't see them being able to implement it anytime soon, even if they wanted to. And tagging your fic based on how you /wish/ tags work, rather than how they /actually/ work is a losing proposition.
