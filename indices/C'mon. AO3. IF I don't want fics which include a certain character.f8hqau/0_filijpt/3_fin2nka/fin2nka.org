I'd much rather have overtag, because it's more likely it'll show up when I search random tags for fics. But I have to say, I do hate when it's so much I've got to scroll and scroll to get past them all. For series fics, or fics that they have several fandoms in one, and each chapter is different, I can understand it. But one fic, one fandom, shouldn't be so annoyingly overwhelming of tags. It makes me want to skip the fic if it's SOOOOO much.
