[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=characters&charid=269][Potions & Snitches]] might prove interesting to you. It has all sorts of Severus-Harry interaction -- equals, parental (adoptive or otherwise, and the occasional reversion), mentorfics and what have you. It also explicitly forbids Snarry, which makes it far more helpful than FFN filtering (where sorting away the Snarry fics from the others is basically impossible).
