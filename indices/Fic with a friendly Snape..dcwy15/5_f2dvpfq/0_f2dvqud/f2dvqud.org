  This is the story of a girl, who cried a river and drowned the whole world...or something like that. Annabelle Andrews never felt like she was enough. She knew her parents loved her. She knew that her twin Archie would be there for her, but still, she felt like there was something missing in her life. Can she find it before darkness finds her?
