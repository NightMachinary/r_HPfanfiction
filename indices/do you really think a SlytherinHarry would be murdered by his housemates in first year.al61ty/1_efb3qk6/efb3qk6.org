The others' reaction to Harry being in Slytherin would certainly be quite interesting.

I've been bouncing about my own ideas for such a story, but the basics are, most think he's probably the next Dark Lord and/or the reincarnation of Voldemort and try to suck up to him; others profess that it's their solemn duty to avenge He Who Must Not Be Named and murder him, but spend more time squabbling on how to do it than actually doing it, and when they do, it fails miserably; and there's a bare few /sane/ ones who long ago gave up on telling the rest of them that he's an 11-year-old kid who can't even cast /Wingardium Leviosa/ and is beginning to think they're all a little funny in the head.

(You get more of a plot out of this when you factor in those Slytherins who are themselves trying to become Dark Lord, with varying degrees of success and dedication. Plus the other Houses. Plus Professor Snape.)
