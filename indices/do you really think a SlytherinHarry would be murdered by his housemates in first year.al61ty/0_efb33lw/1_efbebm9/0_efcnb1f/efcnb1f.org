Slytherins are /supposed/ to be opportunistic schemers. My takeaway from the books is that Malfoy embodies Slytherin ideals to the core, but makes a lot of personal and character mistakes, especially because he's the in the same year as Harry.

Harry surviving Slytherin would come down to a lot of old families agreeing to an alliance of sorts to "bring him over to the light" so to speak, and I'd see Harry being swarmed by people who not necessarily respect him, but honor him in some sense. A begrudging respect for Voldemort's defeat. They'd defend him, but not outright help him like Gryffindor does. Muggle-borns make it into Slytherin occasionally, too, and they likely need to be brought up to speed and/or have a good reason to be there.

You are right though, it does just take one lucky / pissed off 6th or 7th year to Avada the kid and be done with it.
