But bigotry often outweighs other traits. Look at Neville---only heir to what seems like a fairly powerful, wealthy family. And yet the Slytherins look down on him.

So yeah, I can buy some Slytherins "backing" Harry up---but I think he'd also have trouble. And I think it would just take that one 7th year, one old enough to remember their parents who are jailed, etc., losing it and killing Harry.
