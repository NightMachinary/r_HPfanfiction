To be fair, the Malfoys aren't as bad as some like the Lestranges, who even hate half-bloods. Lucius is even described as hoping Harry would grow up to be the next Voldemort when the curse deflected off him. Still, I think it's more likely that it starts off with him being bullied, but as Voldemort comes to prominence it's more likely to escalate.
