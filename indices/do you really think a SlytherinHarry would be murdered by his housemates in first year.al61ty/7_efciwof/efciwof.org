The thing is: Why didn't it happen with a Gryffindor Harry? Sure there are less opportunities, but no self-respecting Slytherin would commit a /cold-blooded/ murder of opportunity. True, not all of them are that smart, but the ones not smart enough also have less opportunity.

I honestly think that a Harry who has established himself in the House by befriending some of them is about as save as he was in Gryffindor. Basically, if Harry shakes Draco's hand in the train, it lays the seed of doubt needed for a Slytherin to reconsider the plan. Malfoy means power. The Potter name means power. Such power also means an equivalent amount of retribution. No, the young Slytherins are too scared and the old ones too smart to risk it, in general.

If there are one or two fanatic outliers who want to avenge their parents, it only makes for a good little plotline, I'd say.
