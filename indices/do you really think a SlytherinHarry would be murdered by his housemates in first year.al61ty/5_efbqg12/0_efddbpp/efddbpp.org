  I'd like to believe he'd find some true friends in the Slytherin House. The majority would probably be superficial after a point, but I think he would have a few people he could genuinely depend on

I think so too, and this is part of what I wanted to tackle in a as-yet-unwritten SlytherHarry fic idea I've had periodically nibbling at my brain for a few years.

Basically, out of the Slytherins - and especially the ones in his year - you'd have Malfoy and those like him, who would basically try to get on his good side, and then bully him almost constantly when that doesn't work out. You'd have a few more opportunistic ones who try to leverage his unusual fame for their own ends, and then you'd have one or two who, for whatever reasons, genuinely do want to get to know him and end up his friends...though they'd still think him weird for trying to be friends with non-Slytherins(because that's who Harry /is/), but they'd go along with it anyway.
