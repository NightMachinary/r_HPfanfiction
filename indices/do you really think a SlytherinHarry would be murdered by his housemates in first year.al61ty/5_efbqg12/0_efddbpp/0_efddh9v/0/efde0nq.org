Thanks.

Problem I have is, I want to set up a situation where the inter-House relationship is more complex than "Harry's House = Good/Other House = Evil and/or Stupid/Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff = Irrelevant". To that end, I separated the Trio by making [[https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4829/46832221072_0912b5c994_n.jpg][Harry and Hermione a Slytherin and Ravenclaw, respectively]]. *BUT* I can't seem to come up with a good story to tell past, roughly, the first Potions class that doesn't end up with a canon-rehash, which I don't want.
