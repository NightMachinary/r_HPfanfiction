I don't think so. Slytherins are supposed to be cunning, right? So they'd either befriend him for the benefits of having a famous friend or close to him so they would eventually backstab him for Death Eaters. That is, if they are that cunning. Most eleven years olds aren't.

I'd like to believe he'd find some true friends in the Slytherin House. The majority would probably be superficial after a point, but I think he would have a few people he could genuinely depend on
