No. A slytherin is too cunning to be that blunt. Maybe ruining his repuation...but I only expect the diehard Vodemort supporters to think of that.

Truth is Slytherins seek items of value than can be used to thier ends at one point in time. Harry may have killed Voldemort but he is also powerful, has social status among both the purebloods and muggleborns/half bloods. He has immense political value- either as a minister, an influencer or just as marriage material. He is the "saviour of the wizarding world". Not even death eaters would risk the backlash from that sort of brazen kill. Maybe in the darkness in disguise but thats another story!
