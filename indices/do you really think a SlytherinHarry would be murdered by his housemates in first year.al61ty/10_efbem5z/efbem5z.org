I do think he'd be killed, but I don't think the entire house would be after him or anything. Most of the younger years are just too young to contemplate it, and there are always opportunists like Malfoys or the occasional half-blood who probably isn't out to get Harry on blood status. But all it takes is one 7th year, and the 7th years when Harry first enters Hogwarts are old enough to remember their parents, the end of the first war with Voldemort, etc. If Bellatrix had a kid for example, or if Pansy was a 7th year when Harry was a 1st year, I could completely see them killing Harry and making it look like an accident.

I also think there's a possibility that the older years would "bully" Harry but he could get accidentally killed.
