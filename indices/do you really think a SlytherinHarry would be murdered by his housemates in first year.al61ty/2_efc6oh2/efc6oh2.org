Why would these, let's say sixth or senenth years who'd be children from imprisoned fanatical Voldemort followers only try to murder Harry if he was sorted into Slytherin? There was never an attempt to murder Griffyndor!Harry from Slytherins in the books.

How would Harry being in Slytherin make him a bigger target than he already is?

Sure there /may/ be more opurtunity for a Slytherin to kill a kid from their own house than from another house due to more shared spaces... But i don't think it would be likely.
