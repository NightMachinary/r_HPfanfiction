As someone who advocates that possibility, I do not think that Malfoy would be the one doing it. But there is definitely the possibility that someone like Flint would off him, or some other older student who has family in Azkaban.

The other avenue would be to abuse Crabbe's and Goyle's dim wit to have them carry out a murder without realising what they are doing (eg poison the bedsheets or hide some cursed item there similar to the necklace which was used on Katie).
