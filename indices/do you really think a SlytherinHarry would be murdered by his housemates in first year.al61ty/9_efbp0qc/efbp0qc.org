Slytherin students would be wary of him, maybe even go so far as stay away from him, but I don't think that they'd risk murder.

I could see one of the older Slytherin students going after Harry; would attack Harry I could see Slytherin Harry being a loner because of this; or even befriend Muggleborns who don't get the big deal of why Harry is in Slytherin, matters.

Perhaps Harry would try and show that him being in Slytherin isn't a bad thing, or will snap at people if they try and do anything to him.

There has to be a reason why the sorting hat told Harry that he could see him there (More than because Harry had a Horcrux inside him or other means); maybe he could change how people view Slytherins? Who really knows.
