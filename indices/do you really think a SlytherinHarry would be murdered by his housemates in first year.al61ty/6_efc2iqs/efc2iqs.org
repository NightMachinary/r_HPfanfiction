Nah, I don't think the Slytherin kids are murderers. People have this tendency to underestimate just how hard it is do deliberately murder someone. Look at Draco in canon. For years he goes around thinking he's big and bad, gleefully talking about how he'd like all Mudbloods to die... then in book six, when he's actually called upon to DO something and kill Dumbledore, he completely goes to pieces.

I think Harry's Slytherin housemates might THREATEN to kill Harry in his sleep, but wouldn't actually DO it. A few painful and/or humiliating pranks, though... that I can believe.
