In my current ongoing, I have a fem!Harry named Rose who gets sorted into Slytherin - and survives mainly by being more Slytherin than everyone else. First night, everyone is reserved and polite, but obviously wary of her and others. Except our lad Draco, of course, who tells Rose that he will have her kicked out of the house because she doesn't belong.

Rose knocks him on his ass - winning the respect of her year mates, who were already tired of his shit, and of the older years, most of whom were appalled at how Draco had acted more like a Gryffindor by calling her out on the first night. Later, she verbally crushes Lucius Malfoy by quoting one of his own speeches, shaming him publicly while remaining completely polite and proper. She learns very quickly how to play the game, and she plays it well.

It works because not only does she lean in to what being Slytherin means, but that that particular version of Slytherin places more emphasis on subtlety, which she has to spare. The house goes along with it because, when they really listen to what she is saying, they can't find a single fault in what she has been saying all along.

So, would Harry get his ass killed in Slytherin? Maybe. It very much depends on both the version of Harry we're looking at and the version of Slytherin. Beyond Draco and his bookends, and maybe Pansy, we know little of his year in the snake pit, so most fics use Daphne and Theo and others to tailor the house to the story - which works, but doesn't really tell us how a canon Harry would do.
