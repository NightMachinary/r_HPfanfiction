No. The idea that being in Slytherin will get you murdered by sole virtue of being in that house is ridiculous.

Switching spells are a thing, and it's something that second years learn. If you really wanted to kill a student, all you'd have to do is brew a poison (or smuggle it in somehow) and switch it with whatever the victim was going to drink.

Disillusionment charms, and silencing charms are both taught in the school to upper years. Using those, and waiting at the entrance to the common rooms of other Houses to sneak in, and do whatever it is that will kill the intended victim isn't something that would be difficult for a fifth or sixth year student. Or even a talented third or fourth year student.

Same goes with invisibility cloaks - they're rare, but not unheard of. Getting one and using that as an alternative to disillusionment is certainly a possibility.

Or, just use polyjuice potion, you know, like a 13 yo Hermione, and implicate someone else with the crime.

Stunning spells are sort of fourth year material - it doesn't take a lot to stun the victim as they go to the bathroom, and fling them off a tower. Or even just use a beater's bat, if you're worried about magical signatures (or whatever else is used in magical forensics).

Being in Gryffindor, Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw does not suddenly give you magic protection against these things just because you're in those Houses as opposed to Slytherin. If someone is that determined to kill, they are going to find a way to make attempts on the victim's life, no matter what.

  tl;dr: do those â€˜if Harry was in Slytherin an older student would murder him within the month' ideas/stories have any merit?

TLDR; this whole "being in Slytherin will have you dead by the end of the week" trope is put forward by overenthusiastic authors (usually ones who are convinced that Slytherins can be nothing less than good little Dark wizards) who don't think twice before jumping the gun.
