No. We don't have any reason to think the Slytherins would immediately be hostile towards him, Draco even tries to become friends with him, and even if they were, they're children. Even when things were getting serious in the sixth book, no one tried to kill Harry or anyone else inside the school.

To be honest, I think he would have ended up fitting in okay if he was in Slytherin. The Gryffindors are as bigotted as the Slytherins and people like Ron would have taken the same dislike to him as Draco did when he was sorted into Gryffindor. I think that would have pushed him into being friends with the Slytherins. There might be a few ridiculously fanatic people in Slytherin and he couldn't be friends with them, but most of them are probably just mildly racist at worst when they don't have Voldemort stoking the fire. The ones that were close-ish to him would probably tone it down when Harry was around.
