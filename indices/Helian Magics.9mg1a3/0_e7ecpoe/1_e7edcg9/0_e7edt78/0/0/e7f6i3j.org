It was going to end as Harry/Tonks. H/F was just a teenage relationship to add character growth and plot twists.

Story follows Tonks and the order through dealing with Harry's death and Voldemort's rise. Highlights how Harry's death changes things through the relationships he had made.

Fluer meets Bill, Remus and Tonks never get together.

Voldemort rises faster as he has no fear of the BWL. He storms the ministry quickly. When he does, Harry comes out of the veil, aged physically from the time spent in the other realm.

Harry learned a lot, he's angry, vengeance on Voldemort. Tonks is the only one to really get through to the changed Harry.

Dumbledore and Harry defeat Voldemort in an epic battle. Dumbledore dies, and Harry becomes a recluse until Tonks finds him.

It ends with Tonks and Harry together, and with main characters having major roles in the wizarding world.
