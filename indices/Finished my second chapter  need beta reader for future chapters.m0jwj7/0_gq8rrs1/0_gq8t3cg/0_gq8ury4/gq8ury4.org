If romance isn't going to be the main focus of the story, you may want to be more short and concise in your description about the relationship, and actually add to the description what the story is about.

I don't know your story plot, but For example:

"Harry potter has an interesting destiny. Fated to foil the dark lord, he will have to grow and learn how the prophesy affects him and how can he stop the greatest dark lord of all time? With enemies around him, even at school, such as a malfoy boy, how will the malfoy sister play a part in Harry's role? She hates harry..at first. Harry hates her..at first. What happens when the youngest daughter of the dark lords favorite family begins to become enamored with his greatest enemy? How will the love/ hate relationship between margerate malfoy and harry potter effect the fight against voldemort and his followers?"

Something like that, where your giving insight into the relationship subplot, but still letting readers know what the main plot will be. Right now, reading your story description, it only includes relationship information
