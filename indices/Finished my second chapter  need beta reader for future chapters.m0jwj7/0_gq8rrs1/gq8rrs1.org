I could beta for you. I do have a question though. Reading the stories description, I get the idea that this is a romance focused fic. While not a bad thing, I'm just curious if this is what you intended. Will the romance be the main focus, or is there more to this story besides maggy malfoy and Harry's love hate relationship?
