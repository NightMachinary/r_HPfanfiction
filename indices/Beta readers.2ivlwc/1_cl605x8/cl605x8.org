I did it for a while, but I had to stop when I could no longer give my authors the time to do a good job. In that experience though, I learned one beta isn't enough to do everything.

My specialty was in grammar, description editing, and aiding in plot development in specific shows. Grammar by far is the hardest for me. Having to tell someone a specific grammatical fix 900 times is irritating; but getting tot help someone's vision come to light is amazing. Helping someone make their creation solid and helping them make it better...there's nothing as cool as that. Being that cheerleader is rewarding.

I always suggest people become betas; everyone has something they can do. Continuity, grammar, keeping characters /in/ character, important details of cannon that need to be kept; everyone can do something. In the process of beta-ing, you learn a lot about how you can write, ways to improve yourself as a writer, and things that you should never do.
