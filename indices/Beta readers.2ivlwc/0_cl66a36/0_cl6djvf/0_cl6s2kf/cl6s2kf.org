I like the feeling that I'm refining ore into metal; that by my own hand I am helping something transition from raw ideas into a clear, well-expressed product. To be honest, as a writer it is very very easy for me to fall into the trap of continually re-editing my own works rather than actually writing new materials or chapters.
