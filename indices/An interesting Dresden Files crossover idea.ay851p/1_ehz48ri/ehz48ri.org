I think the average Potterverse wizard would mop the floor with the average Dresdenverse wizard. Most Dresden wizards we see are either Council members or Wardens. Wardens seem to significantly above average powerwise and Council members are nearly god-tier. The average wizard though... Think of the small coven Harry runs into in White Knight. That seems to be average in the Desdenverse. Meanwhile the average Potterverse wizard is a Hogwarts graduate than can throw reductos and stupefies with ease. Don't get me wrong, Dresden wizards can be very powerful, but they're like Batman. They need prep time to do what Potter wizards can do with a wave of a wand.

That's the average wizards. Wardens and council members are another story. Ebeneezer kills a hundred people with a wave of his staff. He brings down a satellite with enough accuracy to target a mansion. The Merlin kills hundreds of vampires with A ward. I think MOST Wardens and Aurors would be somewhat evenly matched with an edge going to Aurors for wand ease of use. Council members are probably fairly even with Dumbledore/Voldemort.
