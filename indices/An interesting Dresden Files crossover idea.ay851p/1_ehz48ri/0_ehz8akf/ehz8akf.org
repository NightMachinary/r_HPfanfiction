The ones you are talking about are members of the Paranet though, described by Harry as minor talents, you should look at the members of the White Council to get an idea of the average Dresden Wizards, people like Molly for example. Or even Warlocks, think about Kravos or Hannah Hascher, the average Potter Wizards woudn't stand a chance.
