I think that it is a disservice to wank one side in a crossover and isn't too interesting. Both Dresden Files and Harry Potter wizards have their respective strengths and weaknesses or rather aren't as able as the other in some areas. No need to make it a dick waving contest when you can treat both groups with the respect they deserve.
