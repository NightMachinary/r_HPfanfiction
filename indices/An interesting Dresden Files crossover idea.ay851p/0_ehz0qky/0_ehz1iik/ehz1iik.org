I didn't mean to actually "wank one side" as you put it. Just wanted to portray HP wizards as the boogymen of the world who are perfectly content on remaining isolated, unless someone goes and breaks the statue of secrecy. It however doesn't mean that the Dresden wizards are powerless. Just that they are extremely limited. Of course in raw fire power a normal Dresden wizard could probably hold themselves against a normal HP wizard for a while, however when you throw apparition in to the mix the odds get way to stacked for the HP wizards. It's just than when a trained group of Aurors show up the combined fire power is just too much for a team of wardens to deal with. It however just a plot bunny I had .
