Have I read read them? Of course my friend! What kind of a question is that? They were one of my very first reads.. even before I actually read cannon Dresden files books. I believe I was abandoned after Harry's coin was destroyed and his fallen angel took up residence in him? Great fic it was, pity is was abandoned though..
