The problem is that while both sides have their strengths and unique skills, for example Potter wizards have apparition, trasfiguration and dark magic which are all things Dresden wizards can't or won't use and would put them at a serious disadvantage in a fight, and Potter magic is more versatile, more useful in everyday situations, it is true that in terms of raw power Dresden wizards have the better end of the deal. Ebenezar could have killed Voldemort from his home with little effort by simply colony dropping Malfoy Manor, The Merlin can ward a structure so that it takes a minor god to break through the wards (Dead Beat), Harry himself by the time Turn Coat comes around could have defeated Voldemort (just look at his fight with the Nagloshii, I doubt Voldemort would have survived being garroted with soulfire), so it's normal that they are considered more powerful I mean the biggest show of power we see in HP is the duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end of OotP, Harry Dresden does things like that at the end of every book.
