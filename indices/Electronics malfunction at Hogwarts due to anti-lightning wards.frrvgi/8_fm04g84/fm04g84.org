"Harry is dragon and that's ok" makes a nice explanation of this - basically Hogwarts got awarded against lighting many years before, and then when some old, lamp based electronics made their way there they didn't work, so everyone thinks electronics don't work there at all - but it turns out only free-range lightning/electrical discharge is prohibited, so more modern stuff can work perfectly as all the electricity is contained - same as with human nervous system
