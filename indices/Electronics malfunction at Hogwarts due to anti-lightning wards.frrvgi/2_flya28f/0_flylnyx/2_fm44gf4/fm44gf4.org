If I were to give a plausible explanation why electronics don't work, I'd put it down to the unpredictability and non-physics observing part of magic. Circuit boards are precise bits of kit which might not fit well with magic. I could easily imagine the sort of weirdness magic would work on it if it's a mysterious energy which does its own thing based on the thoughts of those around it.

Consider something simple like a battery powered torch/flashlight just suddenly bursting because the filament got a bit too excited, or the batteries just suddenly running out of charge for no apparent reason. That would be enough to discourage using technology. It just wouldn't be very consistent.
