She did a ton of extra reading to know about the wizarding world, and early on she had that issue of believing anything if she saw it in a book. I don't doubt that she read enough references to "he-who-must-not-be-named" and his various terrifying (especially to an eleven-year-old) crimes that I could absolutely see her believe that he indeed must not be named. And a lot of her "everybody knows that stuff" really was stuff that you would learn within days of coming in contact with the wizarding world, IIRC.
