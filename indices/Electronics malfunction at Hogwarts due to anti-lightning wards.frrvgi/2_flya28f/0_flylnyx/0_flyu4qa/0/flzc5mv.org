I mean, I don't know why you'd say that. Hermione is rarely used like that as a character, she doesn't really know wizarding urban legends and actually holds them to a very low opinion. Heck, why would Hermione know about this and not Ron, if it we're an urban legend? Ron wanted Harry to Summon a rebreather for the 2nd Triwizard Task, but Hermione states it as a fact that too much magic will stop electronics. Not that it overloads circuits because it's too much energy. Electronics just won't work there unless wizards tamper with it to "run on magic"

The whole "electronics don't work near Hogwarts" is just a play on the prior "Wizards are bad at logic" or common sense, that even Muggle tech is foiled by the wizarding substitute. That's really all their is to it. You could say it's like an EMP in effect, but it's not literally a perpetual EMP.
