I agree. If I could go to Hogwarts today; purchase 2 Ankers and an owl, and alternate sending them home every week to be charged at home. Cell service may not work but music saved to phones, old iPods, whatever to still have music is good enough for me. I'd even be satisfied with the old janky walkmans/disc mans and an obscene amount of double As. Lol, walk into charms with an old '80s boombox!
