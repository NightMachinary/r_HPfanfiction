The sad thing is that there are a number of things that can be used in place of those delicious spuds. Since they use compressed gas there are all kinds of make shift weapons that they can make.

Just replace the spuds with rocks or ball bearings, can't help but think of the metro game series rn..., and you've got dead wizards. Until they cast a shield or transfigure one..
