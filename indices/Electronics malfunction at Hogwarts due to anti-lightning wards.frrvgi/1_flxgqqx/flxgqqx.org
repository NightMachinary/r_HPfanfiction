This makes perfect sense. This is kinda similar to my headcannon why most forms of guns don't work in significantly magical spaces, due to wards against Muggle explosives, from grindwalrds war. Bombing was an real threat, and anyone who was anyone got awarded against most muggle explosives, to the point where it's in the wizarding of the industry standard for warding. No explosions, nothing to propel the bullet out of the chamber. A pneumatic gun (ie. Potato cannon) might still work, but you would need to compress the air beforehand.
