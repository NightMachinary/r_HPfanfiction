Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief)

Harry/Hermione eventually happens when they're both adults after a bunch of other relationships fail, Harry dates Ginny and Romilda for a while in Hogwarts while Hermione dates a muggle (she's expelled from Hogwarts and learns magic from Mundungus Fletcher).

They relationship is really difficult, especially after Hermione makes a mistake and Harry finds out that she was the thief he's hunting all along.

Harry, Ron, Hermione and Dumbledore are all competent and a bit more powerful than in canon, especially once they're adults and work as aurors or thieves and don't get bashed.

Voldemort is a little less powerful and gets defeated around the middle of the story since the war against him isn't the main plot.

Lucius Malfoy is really sneaky and despicable but quite competent, Draco a lot less competent but just as loathsome.
