I listen to a lot of fanfiction on my phone with “speak screen” but it would be fantastic for it to be read by a person with actual emotion and such.I have no idea where you would even start though.

As an author, I've always sort of wanted to try doing something with my works that way, but I don't have the talent.

I hope you do it. There are plenty of stories out there to choose from.
