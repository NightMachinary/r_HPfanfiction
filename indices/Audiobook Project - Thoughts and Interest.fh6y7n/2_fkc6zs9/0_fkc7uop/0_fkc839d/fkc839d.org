My favourite story on the site is The Sinister Man's “Harry Potter and The Prince of Slytherin” so I think that would be fantastic, but it's 900k words, so it would be a project and a half on your part. Extremely popular though, so may be a good one to use as a kickstart.

Aside from that... a few others, but I write more fanfiction than I read these days, so I'm probably not the right person to answer that.
