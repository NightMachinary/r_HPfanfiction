This may seem a bit mundane as a solution, but it fits my headcanon:

The problem isn't with Hogwarts being just highly magical. As noted elsewhere, the Ministry building, Diagon Alley and St. Mungo's all operate within London having no particular effect on the nearby muggle businesses. The problem is that, being a school, Hogwarts has a high concentration of /accidental/ magic; the sort of unguided, unrestrained invocations of intent that will screw with anything if it has half a reason to.

To me, this is the reason Peeves exists- he's a conglomeration of angst that feeds on accidental magic that has been absorbed into the walls of the castle as a kind of safety valve. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons probably experience similar expressions of wild magic.

The other not-very-inspiring aspect that has a bearing is that Hermione, when she brought it up, was talking about spy gear and radios. Since Hogwarts (and other important landmarks) is Unplottable- as in, 'magically can't be found on a map' - it makes sense that radio signals don't function as intended. If the protective enchantments are bending light around the place, you can imagine that tv and radio signals have similar difficulties getting through.
