Sometimes, I wonder if the issue is not that electronics wouldn't work, but that it would, depending on its complexity, eventually gain a sort of sapience. I've always wondered why the Ford Anglia became wild/alive when before it showed no signs of doing so. Did Arthur Weasley mess up the enchantments that badly, or was it a natural consequence of exposing electronics to so much magic?

Anyway, to prevent Hogwarts from being run over by sentient electronics, they spread the myth that electronics don't work in Hogwarts, and maybe even backed it up by charming the grounds too.
