Assuming it really is an issue and not just the wizard's misunderstanding of electronics that created the accepted fact that electronic stuff doesn't work amongst magic, I could think of a few things. I think its also important to note that single wizards and witches obviously don't "produce" enough magic on their own to shorten out electronics. Muggleborns would have a bit of a problem then.

I once read a fic in which mages used Null-Fields linked to a small plate of copper to shield electronics from high magic areas. It would make the magic "flow around it" without touching it. The explanation behind it, if I remember correctly, was some tattoo that Pharaos would brand warlocks with to quell their magic.

One fic established the notion that magic was some sort of conscious entity. While it was content to let the other forces of nature have a majority of Earth, it got quite jealous about its very own places. The solution therefore was to produce electricity with magic. Mages built powerplants run entirely by Animation Charms = usable "magical" electricity. It was a bit stupid, but thats why I liked it.

Another theory I once read was that the nature of magic was some sort of "meta-energy"-thingy. Long exposition, short - the electronics would break as if you connected every contact with every other contact. A perfect short-circuit. The solution was to find ways to let magic flow through a device instead of electricity. I think the final solution was to remove all conduits between elements and then "command" the device to work. Magic would replace the conduits so that the device would work "according to its creators wishes" - which may lead a alarm clock made by a vindictive chinese factory worker to always wake you /juuuust/ a minute too late for you to be punctual, and computers assembled by a slighted retail-employee to crash when you got that very important document finished but not saved. Wizards and witches would then go ahead and buy up a lot of these production pipelines, make sure that the employees have the right mindset and good working conditions, all in order to make well-meaning and helpful devices.

The last I can think of is the simple "its impossible, deal with it". Electronics and electricity is not working in high-magic areas. Period. Therefore the solutions have to be redone with magic. The Wireless is an example. So are the communication mirrors. The way to make devices work in Hogwarts and other places such as the castle, is to re-do them in a magical form of their function.
