Yep. I mean they were ahead of muggles in terms of communication and travel for ages. The floo network for example is older than the telephone (Bell got the patent for the telephone in 1876, and we know of an accident with Floo in 1855). We also know that James and Sirius had used the mirrors while in school, so they had wireless video-telephony by 1978 latest, which only is common since earliest ~2005 in 'our' world.

So magicals aren't as technically behind as we'd like to make them out to be in this sub. Sure, they underestimate Muggles, but all the things that in many fanfictions impress the purebloods aren't that impressive.

- Telephone? We got the floo. You can actually pass objects through it.
- Cars? Who wants a car when you can apparate and have a travel-time of zero?
- Planes? Floo and Portkeys are superior. Don't know how about it's internationally as it isn't said in canon, but within < 12 hours after the death in the FB movie the ICW had sent a delegation (~ 50 people) which included the British Minister and Swiss delegate to the US. So they have something that can transport wizards fast, and that probably can also transport masses (See: Quidditch World Cup)

Seriously, all our big 'technological advantages' save the internet (well, and TV) have actually explained counterparts in the magical world, and we have a lot of things we don't know about.

In my headcanon that is what prompted the wizarding wars and the hatred of muggleborn wizards - they brought in muggle ideas, and marketed them very successfully, magically adapted. This weakened the pureblood elite, and hurt some of the less skilled purebloods even more. While new stuff is harder to actually produce for muggles they have a lot of people that have great ideas, that is why the ideas are adapted, the implementations aren't.

The success of 'mudbloods' is what Voldemort used to convince the purebloods to fight a war. People don't just start randomly killing their inferior servants, they need to be in a shitty situation. Muggleborns were successful and a great target for hate.
