They couldn't.\\
What we see of magic is a capacity to bend (and, basically, forget) reality to will. There are no "highly magical area", there are area where beings with the capacity to bend reality to their will, do; not much in a muggleborn house, every day in a pureblood house, and nearly permanently in Diagon or Hogwarts.\\
On the other side, the use of electricity (and, even further on this scale, electronic components) are an affirmation of reality. A power cord would still transmit electricity in an arrea with magicl beings are active (basically, electricity is just electrons galivanting); an incandescent lamp may still be basic enough to work for a time. A microchip? Hell, it's very existence is anchored in the notion that the world follow very strict rules at any moment.\\
To give an example : no smartphone could survive entry into the leaky cauldron because it works based on the principle that it can say where it is at any moment, but the leaky cauldron is charmed in order for non magical not to be able to find it.

You will tell me, yes, but isn't it a problem for the shop next door from the leaky cauldron? Then my answer would be, why would it?\\
OK, let's go a little further : most of what we read in fanfiction is based on the fact that magic can be explained in a (pseudo) scientific way, that arithmancy is a science, that magic manifests itself as a field. While Bacon (be it Roger or Francis) or Occam published before the status of secrecy, what we non-magical call science did not have the same definition at the end of the 17th century. Even Newton did not publish it's magnus opus before 1687 (5 years before the Statute), and he still was an alchemist. Most of what we consider "science" today is at most 2 centuries old.\\
Let's get our hammer on this nail : science is a method, which allow to create predictive rules based on observation; magic is a way to put past observations to the bin, crush predictions and, damned be Darwin, turn a toirtoise into a rabbit. Arithmancy is where you learn that if your rabbit has a litter of seven in the morning, you'll be unlucky till lunch, while you'll be lucky till dinner if it's in the afternoon. Charms would have Newton seizure, and Transfiguration Einstein. Ancient runes is multi-layered poetry, a discipline where the meaning of words and individual "letters" are as important as the general rules of versification in order to reach the needed effect (and basically, are the current standard of /classical studies/ in the magical world, the equivalent of Latin for non-magical: interesting, but not of real use outside of litterary criticism (well, it would be curse-breaking in the magical world: ancient egyptian poetry-bound curses are hell to decipher).

Sometimes, it's like everyone in the fanfiction community is with Milton, and I'm the only one /of the devil's party/ with Pullman. Clarke's third law does not mean that magic is an advanced science: I want my magical world to be magical, not a science I would be unable to understand; magic shall not be quantified and ruled, it must be an (ill defined) object of wonder and fables. I want my witches and wizards to forget logic on their way to greatness and change the world by willing it to be something else; I want my Trelawney able to see because she's unable to interpret, my Babbling thought process working alliterativelly, my Hagrid laughing to tears reading Darwin, my Dumbledore so powerfull because he never understood the meaning o the world "logic". I don't want want midichlorians, I want the old religion; I don't want magical computers, I want a pet cerberus.

Ps : sorry for the rant.
