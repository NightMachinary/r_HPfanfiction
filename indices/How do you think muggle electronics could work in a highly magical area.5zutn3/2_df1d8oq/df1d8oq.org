I'm always of the opinion that if you get adult Hermione, Arthur Weasley, Professor Flitwick, and a group of Unspeakables together, they will solve the problem of using electronics at Hogwarts.

Just because a 12 year old Hermione said there was problem, did it mean it would stay a problem forever.
