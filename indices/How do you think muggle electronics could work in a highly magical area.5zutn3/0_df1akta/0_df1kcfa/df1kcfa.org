Yes, I believe this is it exactly. To expand further, it would be very easy for magicals to come to the conclusion that electronics don't work at Hogwarts (or with any magic). Imagine the following: some muggleborn a long time ago tries to bring his electric desk lamp/clock/radio/whatever to Hogwarts. There are no outlets to plug anything in and any batteries will run out soon enough. The magicals who have absolutely no understanding of electricity see that it either doesn't work or stops working and the muggleborn with primary school education can't properly explain it. The magicals then come up with the (to them) logical conclusion that the muggle thing didn't work in the magical place so it must be the magic stopping it from working (which subconsciously reinforces the idea that magic trumps muggle). Word spreads and soon enough it's been codified in Hogwarts: A History and professors are telling it to all the new muggleborn.
