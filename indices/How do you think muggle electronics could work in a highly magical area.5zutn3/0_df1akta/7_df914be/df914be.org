Even if you take it at face value that electronics don't work at Hogwarts, there is also the possibility that the Hermione's book's explanation of why could be wrong. Maybe instead of there just being too much magic, there could be some specific magic at Hogwarts screwing with electronics, either intentionally or unintentionally, that would be present at other magical places. Like there could be some defensive enchantment that shoots lightning at enemies, and as an unknown at the time it was deployed side effect it increases the current in any circuit present in its field of effect, which would fry electronics.
