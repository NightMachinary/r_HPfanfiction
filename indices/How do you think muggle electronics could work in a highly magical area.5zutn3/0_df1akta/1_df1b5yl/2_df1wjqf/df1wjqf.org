If we look at what traditionally interferes with magic, cold iron, running water, circles of salt all fit the profile. My personal opinion is that iron can absorb magic like a sponge, but it's properties can be altered by runework on it. A sort of antimagic if you will. Then, you could create a lattice of iron runestones to absorb magic escaping diagon alley, and sucking it up.
