It could be that the amount of magic needs to be massive to interfere with electricity, like it would be within Hogwarts castle and Diagon Alley. Right outside those areas would be OK, since the magic pollution tapers off sharply. So Hogwarts grounds would be OK, as would anything outside magically "enclosed" areas like Diagon Alley and the Ministry. King's Cross would mess up radio signals very near the platform entrance, which wouldn't be remarkable in any way. Cell phone coverage will always be somewhat spotty.
