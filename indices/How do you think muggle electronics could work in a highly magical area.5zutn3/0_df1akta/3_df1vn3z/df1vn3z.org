  The whole magic destroys electrical thing is nonsense. Diagon ally, the MoM and Kings Cross all exist in the middle of London

We have evidence that Magic and Electricity don't mix well, for example from the FB movie (Spoiler, duh): [[https://streamable.com/5mig4]] - When the magical thing (you know what I mean) travels through New York lights go out around it, in a way that normally wouldn't happen (not every streetlight after each other)

I think I have an explanation for this: Like Newt's case, Diagon Alley and King's cross aren't really there, they are their own pocket dimension. We know magic doesn't really believe in space and time :)

That is why stuff doesn't work at Hogwarts, it wouldn't work /inside/ Diagon Alley either, however it would work right next to it - and the bit of magic around Diagon that 'leaks' or is used to concealed Diagon isn't too much. I'd imagine they have to swap out light-bulbs a bit more often, hard-drives die a bit faster, stuff like that. Noticeable, but not enough to warrant investigation, and it sounds like something Rowling would say.
