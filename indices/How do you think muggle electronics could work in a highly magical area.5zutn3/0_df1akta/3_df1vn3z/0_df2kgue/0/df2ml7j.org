I think it's about magic being wielded, not the magical potential of creatures. For example a niffle mostly uses magic passively and internally, and most muggleborn children don't use magic mots of the time. We know that Harry

- apparated once
- let his hair grow
- turned his teacher's wig blue
- shrunk a sweater
- let a snake lose

These are all instances that we know of. Five times in the history of nine years, which isn't much magic. And three of them were not at home. If other magical children are similar... not that much. Compare that to Hogwarts where hundreds of children use magic daily, Diagon Alley or even to the Burrow.

We also have no canonical information about how how muggleborns deal with... well, everything. Imagine your child can let things fly around, banish food they doesn't like... I think your electric stuff breaking relatively frequent would hardly be worth a mention and is low on your list of worries.

Also Newt calls an Obscurus a "magical force", it isn't a 'creature', it's raw (dark) magical power (in my understanding).

The biggest hole in my theory is Grimmauld Place, and again I think there never was a huge amount of magic used on a daily basis, and probably affects the neighbors only a bit - although more than at Diagon Alley, but since the neighboorhood isn't that great people maybe don't notice stuff breaking? Not sure.
