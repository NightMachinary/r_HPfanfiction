Could it be that magic has wierd influences on physics? We have already seen that no matter how much you try to nerf conjuration and vanishing, magic still spits on physics. What if magical fields had their own fluctuations? Anything living, containing a spark of magic themselves,(yes I'm including muggles here) could not be affected, but any nonliving object would be subject to random effects like heat and cold, spontaneous combustion, and in the case of electrons flowing, increases frequency and distance of quantum tunneling. If electrons start teleporting between wires and semiconductors, then only simple circuits would work, such as a lightbulb or alarm clock. But if anything uses a complex motherboard for instance, then they will short out, and possibly catch fire.
