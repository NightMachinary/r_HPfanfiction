Oh, I've done this one! Hope you like walls of text.

Before we even go into how electronics could work around magic, we first have to figure out /why/ they don't work around magic. My theory is that they don't work around magic because there's some kind of jinx preventing it. Think global, or at least Europe-wide magic, which specifically prevents /electronics/ from /functioning as intended/.

Let me go over the possibilities for why magic and electricity seem to not play nice together, so we can see why this is probably the case. One of three things has to be happening:

1. Magic creates electromagnetic fields powerful enough to interfere with electronics. I don't think this is the case, because I'm fairly certain such a powerful EM field would have all sorts of obvious secondary effects that never get mentioned. Magic should be arcing like nobody's business when cast, but it doesn't. Nobody's hair ever stands on end. Besides that, it would have been impossible to hide magic by the 50s-70s. Either the widespread use of electricity, or the constant measuring for EMPs from nuclear detonations would have tipped somebody off. It'd be like trying to hide magic today, in the age of information.

2. Magic screws with the fundamental force of electromagnetism. This would prevent electricity from working, since the very foundation for electricity doesn't work any longer, and doesn't require there being constant EMPs. However, if this was the case, chemistry would stop working. Clearly, it doesn't stop working, because nobody instantly dies due to a sudden lack of human-friendly physics, like hydrogen no longer bonding to oxygen. It could be that this is what's happening /and/ magic also somehow counteracts this effect, but that's getting pretty obtuse.

3. An application of magic is preventing electronics from working. Now, let me make /another/ list of supporting evidence, incidental or not:

- Magic is overwhelmingly presented as a tool, with specific applications, and not an omnipresent force. Whether or not it is a force on some level is irrelevant, because on the macro level, it just doesn't appear to be the case. When magic is doing something, it's because somebody or something has willed it to be so, not because magic itself is doing it by nature of existing. It always comes from somewhere.

- We already know magic on this scale and on this level of abstraction exists. The Taboo is a spell effect which can detect a name being spoken. That's extraordinarily far out there, if you think about that on a mechanical level. It can only feasibly work because you can cast magic on concepts or ideas. "Electricity", from a human perspective, is just as much a concept or idea as a name.

- It's unbelievably convenient. Honestly, magic just happens to cause arguably the single greatest muggle tool to malfunction? The same society that absolutely refuses to have anything to do with muggle society? It's far too convenient, for an entire race of people who do not want to be discovered, to be outright incompatible with the world that their ruling classes don't want anything to do with. Especially considering they could do it.

So, I think it's intentional, and potentially even a conspiracy. If you wanted to use magic on an electronic, I think you'd need to develop a counter-jinx, or find a way to create a magically isolated environment, so that you can control exactly what sort of magic works on whatever is in that environment. Neither of which sounds easy to me. Even putting aside whether or not it's a conspiracy, you probably don't have access to the jinx, and I imagine you need that to develop a counter-jinx in any reasonable amount of time. I don't know about controlling the magic environment, if that's even a term which makes sense, or if you can do that against this sort of jinx.
