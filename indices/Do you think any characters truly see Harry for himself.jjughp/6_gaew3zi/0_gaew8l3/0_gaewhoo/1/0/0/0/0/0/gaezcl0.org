Fair enough. I have never really talked to any slash lovers so it's interesting to find out about your preferences. I always prefer het pairings but I dont mind femslash. I generally dont care about house when it comes to pairings, but I dislike primary pairings without Harry. Fics that dont revolve around him feel odd.
