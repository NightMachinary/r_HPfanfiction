In cannon Ron and Hermione are the only ones That interact with Harry enough to know the real him. Sirius and Remus see him as an extension of James(especially Sirius), Pretty Much everyone else sees him as a celebrity, Weasleys know him as Rons good friend, Grangers presumably know him as Hermiones good friend but nobody else sees him as the neglected confused youth he is. Fred and George come close and so does Luna and maybe Ginny( cannon does not talk of Ginny much until the sixth book) but only Ron and Hermione really know him.
