I think I agree with everything here. Fleur I hadn't really considered but now I think about it, her whole attitude in cannon and fanfiction suits a "Just Harry" relationship. I think the whole understanding thing is fair enough but shouldn't be overused if you get where I'm coming from. Almost every character gets Harry at some point. It's the characters who almost always get him which I'm looking for. Maybe they are the same thing? Your Tonks point is a good one, but I still think they arent very compatible. I'm just being picky now though so I will shut up. Thanks for your input!
