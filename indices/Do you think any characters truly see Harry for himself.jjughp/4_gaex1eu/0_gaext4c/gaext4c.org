I dont know about Ron and Hermione. Yes they are very close to Harry and have a very good understanding of him, but I still think they might have preconceived notions or expectations of him like Ginny. Ron because his nature is to be jealous and short-tempered. Hermione I am struggling to argue against but it still feels wrong.
