This is way blown out of proportion in fics. He might have wanted that when he was still a young kid. But after that total cluster fuck in DH, that bridge to normality was burnt forever; they would NOT leave their fate to those soulless bureaucratic Ministry minions again; they would take matters into their own hands and forge their own destiny.

Harry becoming the youngest Head Auror ever at age 27 means that he has accepted his exceptional role. Harry might not care about title or prestige, but he cares very deeply about his family, his friends, and his sense of justice and duty! He will not let those sadistic genocidal Wizard Nazis regroup, he will not leave the Ministry at the tender mercy of blood purists again, and he will do whatever it takes to *protect his family, his friends, and his agenda*.
