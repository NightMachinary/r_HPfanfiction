Maybe that is the epilogue version of events. If I am honest, I strongly believe that they could never really achieve much beyond winning the war. Harry isnt the type of character to use his fame to do anything and is more likely to sink into depression, as sad as that may be. They are just kids. That is something we have to remember. Kids, no matter their experiences and abilities, are not suitable for government reform and positions. Push a revolution too quickly and you end up creating an unstable government, but dont push it fast enough and it crumbles back to where it started. I dont think that a group of kids, no matter their skill and conviction, will ever be able to make much of a true political change. Sadly, the wizarding world is likely to stay as bigoted as it was. That is just my belief though, and everyone is entitled to believe something different.

My opinion of Harry wishing for anonymity and peace comes from his description in almost all of the series. As far as I am aware, he never tries to use his fame, and he almost always shies away from public attention. Harry just never seems to want to do heroic things, he is just forced between a rock and a hard place, and can only do the thing he knows: being heroic. He is defined by bravery and courage, yes, but equally for his desire for normality and averageness. Maybe that isnt what JK intended. It is simply how I see the character.

All said and done, thanks for your input, it has really opened my eyes to a lot of things. Your way of presenting and explaining points is exceptional, despite your more invested approach. No offence, but you can come off as a little aggressive.
