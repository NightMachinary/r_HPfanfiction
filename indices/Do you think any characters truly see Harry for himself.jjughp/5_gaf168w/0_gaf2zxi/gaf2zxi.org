First of all: Damn. I wasnt expecting a crusade though absolute respect for formulating a valid argument with cannon proof etc.

I wish to say one thing as a general response: this is all MY opinion.

That being said, you raise a valid argument that Ginny is particularly close to Harry in terms of experience with Voldemort and general life outlooks etc. You are also correct that age and experience factors heavily on opinion and outlook; first year Ginny is extraordinarily different from Post War Ginny. Without my personal context, you are correct. MY context is that I wrote this post after coming across a short discussion about Ginny in book one, and her general attitude towards Harry. I am sorry that I didnt make this clear.

Thank you immensely for your participation in my little discussion, though I never expected something quite so... vitriolic? Extreme? Whatever your background, personal experience, or views are, I have a great respect for someone who defends their view with such passion, backed up with evidence and an explanation.

Just an additional note: my use of Just Harry is less of a reference to the scene in book one and more of a generic belief that Harry, as a character, simply wishes for peace and anonymity in the wizarding world. Yes he fought a war and overcame insurmountable odds, but in the end he doesnt care for the title or the prestige. He simply wishes to be a normal boy with a normal life. I think that is one of the key messages within the whole series.
