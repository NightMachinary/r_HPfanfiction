  Ginny is too obsessed with Hero Harry to be in a functioning relationship with him

This is so wrong that I don't know how to begin with, as the best person who can understand Harry's trauma is none other than Ginny:

- They are the only two persons who had been intimately violated by Voldemort and lived to tell the tale. Even Hermione couldn't claim this feat.
- Ginny was a founding member of his student resistance group Dumbledore's Army, and it was her who came up with the name.
- She, Hermione, and Luna were the only girls who had been with him on that ill fated DoM battle from beginning to the end. No other women could possibly imagine the horrors and stress of facing 12 of Voldemort most vicious sadistic genocidal magical Nazi scums.
- Next year, Ginny again fought directly in the Astronomy Tower Battle, in fact facing Amycus Carrow directly. Hermione and Luna were duped by Snape and missed most of the fighting.
- She fully understood that Harry had to go on that suicide mission, and she did her own part by organizing the resistance at Hogwarts.

  see Harry as "just Harry", a.k.a. not the Man-Who-Won, Boy-Who-Lived

By overcoming incredible odds against the ultimate evil, by becoming a child soldier at incredibly young age, what's the difference? What's the infatuation with "Just Harry" anyway? In canon, Harry muttered this line once in his first year. Do you honestly believe Year 7 Harry was still the same?

People can change, and will change as they grow up even without traumatic experiences. How many of you (especially those above 30) can claim you are still the same as when you were 18, or even 11?

Furthermore, Harry Potter is not just a high school teenager drama. These characters are child soldiers who forged their bonds through immense suffering and struggles. They have little to do with your average teens. Do you even understand what "Band of Brothers/Sisters" mean?
