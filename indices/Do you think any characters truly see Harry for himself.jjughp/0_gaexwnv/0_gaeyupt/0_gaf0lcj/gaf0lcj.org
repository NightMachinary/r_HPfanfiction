Eh, both Hermione and Ron start off with a bit of that, but it is really gone halfway through the first book. It depends if you are looking to see a start of a relationship where it doesn't come into play or if you are ok with characters growing out of it.

And as I said, Ron knowing that Harry's shit don't shine and he doesn't piss gold makes jealously worse. He knows Harry is just another bloke like him who actively doesn't want what he wants, but it actively gets given to him anyway. That is why it is so hurtful to Harry when Ron treats him like the Boy Who Lives instead of a friend or even just a dormmate: Ron is doing it to spite Harry because he knows it will hurt him.

Tonks fics usually go for the "I was old enough to remember seeing you as a baby before the event". It can work pretty well. Its only really when the authors pair "I remember babysitting you when I was six" with "And you are my childhood crush" that it gets super creepy.

Hermiones limited "You are a Hero Harry" comes from her reading, most of that is dispelled in the first book, the rest of it is put dead to rights in the second book with Lockheart. It is certainly dead and burried by the time of the Hippogryph ride.
