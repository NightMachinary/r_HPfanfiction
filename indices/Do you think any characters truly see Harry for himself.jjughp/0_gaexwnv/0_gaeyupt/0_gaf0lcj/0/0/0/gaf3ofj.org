I dont really care about the age thing. As I noted in a previous conversation about boundaries in fanfiction I think age boundaries can be stretched within reason. Harry and Ginny works if you assume Harry's ultimate wish is for "normality". A normal wife and a normal life seems pretty "normal" to me. However, I do agree that their relationship is a little... eh. Unsatisfactory for many.
