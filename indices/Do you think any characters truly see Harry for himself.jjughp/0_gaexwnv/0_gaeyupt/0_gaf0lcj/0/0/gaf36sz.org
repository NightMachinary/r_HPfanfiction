Erm, the canon description of Harry is an audience insert who is passive, a bit impulsive and stubborn.

Thus he really fits most pairings depending on the audience. Personally, I never saw Harry/Ginny. But there was quite a bit of where he ended up that made little sense to me. Harry/Ginny, him being an auror (like why), or the fact he doesn't... get the hell out of dodge once he isn't needed in Britain anymore. Eh.

The age gap with Harry/Tonks is enough to put off most fics for me during Hogwarts timeframe (which is most of them) if they don't involve time travel or other shenanigan's. There are a few set after Hogwarts (which is usually a 20y/o with a 27y/o, which is much less offputitng) that I find ok, but otherwise the age thing is usually just ignored (to the detriment of the fic).
