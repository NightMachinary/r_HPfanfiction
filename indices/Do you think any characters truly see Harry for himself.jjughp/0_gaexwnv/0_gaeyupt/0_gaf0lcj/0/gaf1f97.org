As much as I love Honks, if you take the cannon descriptions of both characters it is quite obvious that they wouldn't really work as a couple. I agree that the childhood crush thing is very creepy but I thankfully havent come across too many fics like that.

When I posted this discussion I was firmly set on Hermione suffering from Hero Worship but I think I have switched sides. I think it is inevitable that anyone close to Harry will suffer from being in his shadow and being awed by his feats but I think Hermione is a prime example of a true friend. Kind of sad that they dont end up together because they suit each other far better than Romione or Hinny.
