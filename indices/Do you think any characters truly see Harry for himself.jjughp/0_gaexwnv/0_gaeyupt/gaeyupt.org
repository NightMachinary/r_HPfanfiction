I like your reasoning. Ron never seems to see Harry for Harry in my opinion. He is often too blinded by jealousy to properly see Harry for himself. Hermione I am beginning to agree with but I still have reservations. Maybe post GoF Hermione but not before. Luna (Huna I think?) I absolutely agree with. I really struggle to enjoy fics where Luna is portrayed as just weird. Tonks (ignoring the age gap) seems ok but I get the feeling that Harry would always be the "Young Legend" sort of character. A prodigy if you will. Side note: I read an odd fic where Tonks wanted people to ask her to change but everyone tried to impress her by asking to see her natural form. I enjoyed the cliche flip but I remember the fic being a bit odd.
