Ron sees Harry as Harry, he's just still very much aware that 'just Harry' has more gold than the whole Weasley family combined just sitting in a vault, and is one of the most famous and popular wizards alive (complete strangers bow or shake his hand, stories are written about him etc.) and can get a bit jealous of that, because Ron would love all the attention that Harry hates.
