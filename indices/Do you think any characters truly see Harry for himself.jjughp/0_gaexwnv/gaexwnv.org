This is common in Harmony fics, as it fits the canon characterization. Arguably it applies to all members of the Golden Trio, although Ron is played inconsistently in fanfic. I'd argue he certainly sees Harry as Harry, he can just be a bit jealous of Harry. Sometimes that jealously gets played as him not seeing Harry for himself, but I think that is a mistake.

If anything, Ron knowing Harry for Harry is something that makes jealously worse, or at least more poinent.

Outside of the trio the place I think this is with Luna (Larry?). Although it really depends on which flavor of Luna the author goes with.

I'm not a huge Fluer/Harry fan, but I imagine this is implicit with any Harry/Foreign, particularly if it is framed as "Voldemort is really just a British thing".

Mixed results on Honks fics. For some reason authors like to give 6 year old Tonks a creeper crush on baby Harry. (I groan whenever I see this, just like I groan at the "All mah boyfriends want me to change into someone for dem you da best for wanting my true self" lines ._.). When that is avoided Honks usually doesn't have the hero worship.
