I don't know about polyjuice, but my headcanon has always been that Voldemort looked like a snake because he was cursed by the unicorns blood from the first book. I like to believe that unicorns blood curses your body to reflect the state of your soul, so Quirrel, an otherwise normal guy with a parasite wraith attached to his soul began to sprout Voldemort's face when he began drinking unicorns blood. Similarly, Voldemort was fed with unicorns blood before the climax of the fourth book, and the baby creature that he was possessing looked like a scaley, raw evil abomination, almost identical to the appearance of the Scar Horcrux, and bearing eerie similarity to Voldemort's ressurected body.
