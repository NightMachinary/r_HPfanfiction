Voldemort most likely already looked like that before his first defeat. There are two hints in canon that point this way:

GoF Graveyard scene: The Death Eaters recognise him immediately, and Voldemort tells them:

#+begin_quote
  "There was no hope of stealing the Philosopher's Stone any more, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortal. I set my sights lower ... I would *settle for my old body back* again, and my old strength.â€œ
#+end_quote

And in OotP Fudge, who did everything to deny Voldemort's existence, takes one look at him at the Ministry and knows he is back. He doesn't think it might be someone else, or some weird creature, he recognises Voldemort.
