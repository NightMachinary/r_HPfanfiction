We have canon evidence that Riddle was physically twisted and deformed from dark magic use, but it was more waxy pale skin which looked off, rather than scales. That said, the way he phrased it is that his intention was to go back to his old body. We don't actually get told that he looked like that.

Next, both instances of recognition may simply be educated guesses. I would imagine that the Inner Circle would have some inkling and rumor of Voldemort's ambitions for immortality. Combine that with them being summoned by the Dark Mark, which burned black, and ending up in a graveyard with a pale dark wizard with red eyes, I think that even the dullest amoung them could fit the puzzle pieces together.

As for Fudge, he saw a pale, red-eyed monster who was dueling Dumbledore to a standstill, and this is after a full year of being told by Dumbledore that Voldemort was back. This, combined with Lestrange, should be enough for anyone with any critical thinking skills.

I am not saying that you're wrong, just that there isn't enough evidence that I am.
