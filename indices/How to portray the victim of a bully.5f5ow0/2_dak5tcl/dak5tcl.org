Speaking to my own experience and that of my sister's, I would think that someone of that age would probably be prone to a lot of emotional stress. Maybe not leading to outright depression (yet) but a severe case of anxiety that controls her life. Maybe she could put on a strong facade during the school year and then completely break down outside of school. The anxiety would be the main catalyst for a lot of problems in life, but it's helped by the presence of true friends (as cheesy as that sounds, it's actually helpful). I suppose it all really depends on the character's personality.
