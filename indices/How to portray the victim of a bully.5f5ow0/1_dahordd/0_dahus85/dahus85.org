I was sure I had replied, but apparently not.

Half-breed in the sense of half-creatures, people who had either of their parents not human (veela, giant, goblin, elf, pixie, etc.).\\
A sort of Umbridge-like mindset, but on a larger scale and slightly less extreme. Half-breeds are less than human and objectified, with many thinking they should not have access to a wand and have blatant discrimination made against them. I want to emulate the racism and fight people of different ethnicities had to live through during that time, but in the wizarding world.
