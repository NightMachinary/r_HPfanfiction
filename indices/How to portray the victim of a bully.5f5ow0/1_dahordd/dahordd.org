I think [[https://parahumans.wordpress.com/][Worm]] did a pretty good job. Read the first arc for tips. The protagonist there just tries to get through the day, but has something else to focus on as an escape. She is depressed, and somewhat resigned in a way, but planning a way out. She is a few years older though, keep that in mind.
