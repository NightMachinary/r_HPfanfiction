I don't think you're coming at this from quite the right angle. Remember that you're writing a story, not an academic report on bullying. Your focus should not be "What is the most accurate representation of bullying?" but rather "what representation of bullying will lead readers to root most for my character?".

For that reason I would be wary of depicting too much in the way of angst or having the character wallow in self-pity. No matter how justified such feelings can be, they are not appealing characteristics nor do they contribute to a "hero's path" character arc. Their likely effect is to put readers off and make them dislike the protagonist rather than get on their side. There exists an "angst tipping point" after which the main character feels so passive, so weak, so self-indulgently woe-is-me that you actually start wishing more pain on the character, not less.

To that end, I would highly recommend taking inspiration from two elements of canon. The first is the Umbridge plotline in OotP. The feeling of frustration in the face of injustice, the sense of powerlessness leading to anger... these are powerful emotions to harness in the reader. The second is Harry's response to the Dursleys. By making him a resilient character, by having him keep his sense of humour, his snark, and his essentially good nature, the reader immediately gets on his side.
