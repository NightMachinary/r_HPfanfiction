Ron would be very conflicted.

I dont think he would hate Harry suddenly, and he 'd like to be with /his/ first friend (because it looks like Ron never had a friend outside of his family before Hogwarts either), but he also would want to be in Gryffindor and not disappoint his family.

I now imagine his conflict of loyalties leading to the hat to decide that somebody who wants to make everybody happy and stay with their friend deserves "Hufllepuff". - And poor Ron being not very happy about that decision.
