Ron is one of my favourite characters. But I never liked characters that were not at least somewhat flawed, apart of in the rare instances where l feel like reading power fantasies.

I also think having the main characters of the story in several different houses would create interesting dynamics. And it would create opportunities for each of them to grow in new ways, too. (Which kind of fits OP's prompt of a different sorting leading to unforeseen consequences.)
