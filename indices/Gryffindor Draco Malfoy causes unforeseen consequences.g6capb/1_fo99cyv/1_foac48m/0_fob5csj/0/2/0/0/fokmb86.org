Had to google that. That sounds incredibly painful, so sorry you are going through that.

Getting antsy, have been feeling like crap this week with an incessant dry cough the last couple of days. Everything triggers the cough. We just heard that we could return to work from May, so i reaaally dont want to get sick now. We are on a no work no pay thing, so lockdown isn't that fun here. Will see how it goes and get tested if this doesn't go away.

Hope you make a full and quick recovery from hereon out.
