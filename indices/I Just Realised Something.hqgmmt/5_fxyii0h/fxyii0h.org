The story Three Little Words by Rouven_Auge_des_Sturms_Singer has Fred and George placing a bet and then telling the fourth years (Harry and Hermione that Dumbledore was just telling the Head Elves to start the feast.

George smirked at his brother before turning and agreeing. "All right. My brother, will you bestow wisdom on these mere fourth years?" He asked waving dramatically over the three of them. Fred bowed slightly, making a smirk too. "Oh yes, my dear brother I will. You see, my lovely Mrs Granger, you are asking the wrong question. The question is not what, but who." He said grinning at them. Hermione rolled her eyes.

"What is that supposed to mean?" She said in an annoyed tone, before eating another sweet potato. Fred smirked leaning closer. "You see these words, that are no words its names. More so the names of the four head house-elves designated to each house. Nitwit for Ravenclaw. Blubber for Gryffindor. Tweak for our friends in the dungeons and Oddment for our badgers. It is the signal for the four of them that the feast is starting." He said with a wink, while Harry stopped eating, looking surprised.
