I always thought there are four words and four houses, so each word means something to the houses.

I think they are what people in each house don't want to be seen as. Let me explain:

Nitwit - basically the opposite of Ravenclaws values. So Ravenclaw students work to try not to seem like a Nitwit in their house

Blubber - it's what people in other houses think of Hufflepuff, so Hufflepuff students work hard to not be viewed as such within their house.

Oddment - in Slytherin where pure blood beliefs and old traditions are followed, no student would want to seem the odd one out in that house

Tweak - When you tweak, you fine tune something cautiously. Gryffindor is full of brash and brave people. Students in that house would not want to stand out by being more calculated in their risks.

Overall I think Dumbledore wanted them to know that it was okay and understandable to feel like that during the school year, and that being different is okay. Just my two cents.
