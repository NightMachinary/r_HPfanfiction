This one makes sense in the mouth of a man old enough to remember Music Hall. It's a standard comp√®re's joke from that era: I dare say it absolutely /slew/ back in 1910. It was a standard for tedious old think-they're-funny bores when I was a kid in the 70s, and I seem to recall Vic Reeves recycling it on /Big Night Out/ as part of his schtick as a music-hall/variety revivalist.
