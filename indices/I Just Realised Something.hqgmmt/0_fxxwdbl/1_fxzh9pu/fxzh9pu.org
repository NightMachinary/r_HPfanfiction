When you say houselves and I look back at the words and found another insult though its pretty much the same.

Nitwit/Ravenclaw - smartest house but not the people

Blubber/Griffindor - bravest house but also not the people

Tweak/Slytherin - House that needs to be guided to the right path

Oddment/Hufflepuff - Well I don't know how to describe it but they are the rest

Wow JK Rowling, just wow...
