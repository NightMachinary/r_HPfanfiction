I headcanon the knight bus as an insult to people who can't get an apparition license (or had theirs taken away), can't afford the floo network, or get too drunk to apparate. They have to ride in a "muggle contraption" to get around, and according to pure bloods: muggles are filth.

Now on to the others: portkeys, apparition and floo travel.

Floo power is a proprietary item. Only one company sells it in Britain. At the same price for a hundred years. Why would they change anything? They have a good thing going.

Aparition? Again, it works, why should they change anything? In fact, it would probably confuse people if a new technique or change appeared.

The magical world from what we were shown is a very backwards place. Not a lot of new things happen. And then you throw in the pure bloods, where new things might step on their toes.

Portkeys? It really sounds like it requires all sorts of tracking. What happens if two portkey travellers collide while in transit? If two people arrive at the same time? It sounds like a lot of work, and simply not regulated to keep it out of everybody's hands. Fudge really got peeved when Dumbledore forced one on Harry in OoTP. Change here might be a chore because then EVERYONE has to accept it.
