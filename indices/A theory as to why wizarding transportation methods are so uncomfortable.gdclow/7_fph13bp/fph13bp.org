Really clever ideas, I doubt I'll adopt them as a full headcanon as I also like a number of the other expkanations, but I'd love to see them in a fic. I think that your theory on portkeys and Goblins is especially fitting.

While the idea that there are costs and tradeoffs to magic and that comfort is the price paid for convenience works well in some fics, I think it only works in fics that apply that concept to the entirety of magic, and not every fic should do that. I feel like this would read really well for fics that address creature interactions. Is it possible for an elf working with a wizard to create a version of Apparation suited to the stature of the wizard? Perhaps it's only because the ability and knowledge is stolen that the downside exists and cooperation would see it removed.
