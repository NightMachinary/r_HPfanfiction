I don't remember where I read it, but someone posited the theory that apparition forms a momentary microwormhole that sucks you through to the place you want to go, and that magic is used to condense you into a noodle thin enough to fit the compressed space. Wizards definitely have the ability to fuck around with space and a wormhole would be the most energy efficient method.

Knowing HP canon, actually breaching the fabric of reality would be a very bad thing.

However, I also like The Arithmancer's theory that you don't actually twist on one of the perceptible axes, but that you twist your body into a fourth spatial dimension, where distance doesn't matter and you essentially do a 360 degree turn through 4D space along the w axis and land back in 3D space where you visualized.
