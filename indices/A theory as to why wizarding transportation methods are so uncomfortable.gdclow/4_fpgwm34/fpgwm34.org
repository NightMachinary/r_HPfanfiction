My theory is that apparition is uncomfortable because you're traveling from one place to another without disturbing the spaces between. I'm not very sciency, but from what I know, I would think that there would be pressure differences as you travel. I'm not sure where you are as you travel between spaces, but it's mentioned that you cannot breathe. That could be the pressure, or lack of oxygen. Or even moving so fast, your lungs can't expand.

Is it ever mentioned how long it takes? Perspective being in real time, or wherever they travel through?
