Done. And yeah, you see new theories in this sub all the time. I didn't think this one would get so much attention, but I like it nonetheless. Maybe it'll inspire some more speculation.

However, there are people in this community who like to force their own opinion on how magic functions onto others (Taure does this for example, but I don't think it's meant to be malicious), which might put people off of putting their theories here.
