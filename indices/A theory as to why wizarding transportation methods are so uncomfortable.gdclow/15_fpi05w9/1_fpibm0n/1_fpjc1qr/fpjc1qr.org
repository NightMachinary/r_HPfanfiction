And the few who do end up dead from accidents. It's a self-stabilizing society, anyone too curious will one day cast a dangerous spell in a closed space and, poof they went. Harry's first use of Sectumsempra, where he managed to use the spell correctly despite never knowing what it even actually do is alarming. Sure the Latin root is ominous enough, but there's gotta be enough homophone in Latin that one of your experimental benevolent spell kill you instead. With the non-European descent Patil twins and Cho Chang doing well at Latin-spell-based school, it stands to reason a European wizard trying a new spell based on Latin might instead create a new spell based on other cultures' magical language, and end up floating in space.
