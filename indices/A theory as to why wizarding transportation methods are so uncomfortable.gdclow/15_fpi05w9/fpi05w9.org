I like this, it also goes along with the fact that in the books, the kids are taught how to perform magic, but not how magic works. Like, they're taught to swish and flick, but never why that's necessary.

Honestly I think that if the kids had been taught HOW magic works at their magic school, then they'd have been much more powerful. If they had, say, Magician's style education about how magic works, then they might not even need a wand by the time they're 15.

But that would change the whole second half of the series.
