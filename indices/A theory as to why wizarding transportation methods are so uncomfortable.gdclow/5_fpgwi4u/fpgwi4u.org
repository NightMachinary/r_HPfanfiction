I see it a lot like astronauts training their bodies to withstand G-forces for take-off and re-entry. You or I may be fine, but most likely not if we were to attempt what an astronaut does. So a young wizard/witch that has never taken a portkey or used the floo or side-along apparating doesn't know what to expect and it may not occur to grown wizards to explain it. I think mostly the unknown could be best explained by J.K. Rowling's writing style and a desire to move the story along more than anything else, they just throw Harry into side-along and portkeying because it's convenient travel. I feel like not every wizard or witch can apparate, or a person can but prefers not to acclimate to the feeling and chooses the floo. Just as I can attempt to train my body like an astronaut, there is no need since I work in an office and doing so would be more work for me than I would prefer in a hobby.

Apparition would almost certainly be required for magical law enforcement but not for a book seller or a ministry clerk. Perhaps there are skilled wizards that know how to use the spell comfortably and with almost no sound.
