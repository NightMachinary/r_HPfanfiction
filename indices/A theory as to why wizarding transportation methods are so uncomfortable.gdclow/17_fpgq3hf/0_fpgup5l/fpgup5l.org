There is logic to magic. Because if there weren't, then wands wouldn't be worthwile. Incantations wouldn't matter and neither would anything else.

I hate the perception that "only intent matters" or "belief is key", because if only belief would matter, then an autistic or bipolar or neurotic wizard would be a living reshaper lens that tears up the landscape around themselves. Or a person with OCD would forcefully reorder everything around themselves according to their perception of ideal order.

Have you ever seen a screenshot of a [[https://i.redd.it/7iyh3gm8wcw41.png][genuine OCD person's Terraria world, for example]]? They'd do this, but in reality. (zoom in to see the true extent.)
