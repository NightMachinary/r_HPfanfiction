But then why is Phoenix Travel not uncomfortable to the Phoenix? If magic always takes a price, then all spells would have some equal drawback. The Patronus for example is arguably a much, much larger "cheat" than apparition, but it doesn't seem to have any sort of drawback beyond the memory requirement. It doesn't have a price.

Additionally, people can adjust to the discomfort, and Harry describes the Apparition Instructor at Hogwarts as being wispy and light and almost see-through. If you can just overcome the price magic takes for cheating, then it's not really a price, is it?
