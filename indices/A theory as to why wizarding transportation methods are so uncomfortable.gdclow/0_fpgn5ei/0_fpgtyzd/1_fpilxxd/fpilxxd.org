Perhaps you are both correct in the sense that it was stolen from another species and it is uncomfortable because it was stolen and not natural. A wizard is supposed to be able to cast spells but shouldn't teleport so when he does it is uncomfortable. A house elf is supposed to teleport but not use a wand, that would mean that for an elf to use a wand would be awkward and unnatural.
