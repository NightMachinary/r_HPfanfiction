I'm not sure we know Phoenix travel isn't uncomfortable. Harry never uses it to my knowledge. I'm not sure how a patronus is a cheat either. It allows defenses against horrific beasts and that's just about all.

Of course you can adjust to discomfort. Just because you're used to it doesn't mean it goes away.
