I think that the reason travel is supremely unpleasant is metaphorical. Magic allows you to cheat, but with a catch. Travel is unpleasant, and not even magic can remove that. You have to have the same amount of unpleasantness it would take to get to a place physically and compress it in the smaller amount of time you have when traveling magically.

So phenomenally unpleasant experience all at once.
