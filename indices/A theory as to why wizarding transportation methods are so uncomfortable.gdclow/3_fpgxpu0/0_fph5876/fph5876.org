Eeeeeh, it's definitely described as uncomfortable by every other wizard too. Even adult ones say it occasional, if only to say "dreadful, isn't it" or "the first time is always the worst" or "you get used to it". Note that they don't say it gets better, just that they acclimate. The thousandth time is just as horrible as the first time, but as a routine apparator you can ignore it.
