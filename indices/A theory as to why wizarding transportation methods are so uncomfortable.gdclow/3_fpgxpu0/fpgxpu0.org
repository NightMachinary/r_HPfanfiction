I think we see the transportation as uncomfortable because Harry finds them uncomfortable, and the experience is described usually when he does it the first time and isn't used to it. If you weren't used to sitting in a car you might be uncomfortable too, riding some metal thing on wheels that run 80 km/h and more when you have no idea how it works.
