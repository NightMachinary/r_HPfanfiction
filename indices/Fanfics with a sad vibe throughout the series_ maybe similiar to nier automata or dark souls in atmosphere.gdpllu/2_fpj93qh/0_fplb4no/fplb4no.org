I thought he finally founds her hidden(her parents had obliviated her to protect her but then she remembers everything) somwhere while grieving and they get together and marry, that fic got me pretty down until I read the ending.

It's one of my favs too, but it's not sad, their relationship is actually very happy, it's just sometimes the world goes to hell around them. And the ending is good.
