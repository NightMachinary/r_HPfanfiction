What sucks for me is there are some really good fics out there that get abandoned and your like "damn..."

There's a WIP I've been reading that I'm hoping doesn't get abandoned because it is very good.

At least I can't see myself abandoning the fic I'm currantly writing! Been milking this idea for too long and I think I'm onto something good with it
