True enough, but he kind of screwed him up. I mean, nowhere near what happens in most manipulative!Dumbledore and when we see it from his perspective plus how the whole thing ended up it actually does make sense, but it doesn't change the fact that he shoved Harry with the Dursley's and for a moment we believed he actually planned Harry's death (before he explained the whole resurrection thing). I honestly think he did what from his perspective seemed to be the best for all, including Harry himself, but he was the root of a considerable part of Harry's problems.
