True enough.

I think Dumbledore's problem is two-fold: first, he refuses to act sometimes even when he should, because of his baggage and fear of becoming like Grindlewald. And second, he has to juggle the needs of being a spymaster and politician leading the fight against Voldemort with the needs of being a headmaster and professor, and it sometimes results in conflicts of interest (for example, staffing Hogwarts positions for strategic reasons rather than hiring the best teacher).
