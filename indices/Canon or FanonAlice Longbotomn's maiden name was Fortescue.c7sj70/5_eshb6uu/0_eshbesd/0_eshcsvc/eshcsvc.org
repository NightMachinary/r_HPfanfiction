They're Jake and Miranda in my head, from Vox Corporis, but I still think it's bizarre that we have to have Fanon names. (Miranda is a main character in The Tempest, and it makes more sense for only of her parents' families to have a tradition of Shakespeare names)

I like Dan and Emma just fine. I don't think I've ever seen Ian and Michelle, but those seem like a smart idea, since those are the names of the actors who portray them in Deathly Hallows.

It's especially galling we still don't have names for her parents considering all the post-canon pottermore stuff.
