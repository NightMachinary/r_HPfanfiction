Nah, fanon. We know extremely little of the Longbottom parents, never mind what fanfiction would have you believe. It is equally fanonical to propose that Alice and Lily were friends at Hogwarts; we don't even have hard evidence that Alice even /attended/ Hogwarts. And the Longbottoms were probably somewhat older than the Marauders.

(In such case, the Wiki's a useful resource, by the way.)
