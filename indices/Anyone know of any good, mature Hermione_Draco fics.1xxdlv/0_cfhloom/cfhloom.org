I don't normally look for this pairing, but I recently enjoyed a long and emotionally sophisticated story called [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/1/Amends-or-Truth-and-Reconciliation][Amends or Truth and Reconciliation]] by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1994264/Vera-Rozalsky][Vera Rozalsky]].

Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

Harry Potter - Rated: M - English - Drama/Romance - Chapters: 66 - Words: 329,854 - Reviews: 1021 - Updated: 1-6-13 - Published: 11-26-09 - Hermione G. & Neville L.

It is in Hermione's POV and involves more than a few ethically surprising choices, but if you'd like to see a proper post-war fallout kind of story involving Hermione and Draco (and Neville and Ginny and memories of Tonks), it's worth the read.
