[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8982722/1/Cruel-and-Beautiful-World][Cruel and Beautiful World]] by[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3692526/Lena-Phoria][Lena Phoria]] was quite good in my opinion, though rather dark.

"After years of captivity, Hermione Granger fights her way onto the streets of Voldemort's London with only the knife in her pocket and the blood on her hands. There's a checkpoint on every corner, a curfew enforced by Voldemort's most trusted followers, and the only way back to the Boy Who Lived is through the Death Eater who let her be captured in the first place."

She has others completed Dramiones but I haven't started on those yet.
