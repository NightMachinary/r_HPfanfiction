im reading a fanfic right now called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9486886/][Moratorium]] , it has a f!harry who refers to herself as ”Moratorium”, but “acts” like Harry. it's a bit confusing, but it is a double personality. although, im only chapter 3, and the author has yet to call it a personality disorder.
