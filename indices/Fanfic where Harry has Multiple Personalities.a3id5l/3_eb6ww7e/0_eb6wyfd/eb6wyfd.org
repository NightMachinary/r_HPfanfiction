  Disclaimer: I don't own anything from Harry Potter.A/U. Voldy won't really be a problem, although he's still alive, just greatly weakened. (And only a few Horcruxes).Harry has Dissociative Identity Disorder. When he was a child, he was aware of his alters, but as the trauma continued, his dissociation grew until he blocked them out. Essentially.MIght have still worked out just fine until he was Sorted into Slytherin...where a certain Potions Professor ends up eventually taking him under his wing and discovering his little...secret. :3
