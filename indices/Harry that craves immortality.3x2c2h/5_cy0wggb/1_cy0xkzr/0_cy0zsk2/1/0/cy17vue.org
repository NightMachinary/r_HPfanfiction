I'll skip the extensive argument of whether the main character can be considered a mouthpiece of the author and simply say 'oops- meant the character'.

You have a right to be angry if I'm withholding a useful life-saving technology, and you can even lay judgements about it, but that doesn't make me a murderer, just someone who decided how he wanted to use his discovery. By informing others that the Philosopher's Stone existed, Flamel left it open to others to discover it on their own. He didn't patent it nor is he trying to market it. Whether or not he made those decisions based on higher principles or self-interest is irrelevant. It still doesn't equate to blood on his hands.

If your absence would not change the flow of things, i don't see how you can be held responsible for being there but not interfering, especially if you made no promises about intending to interfere.
