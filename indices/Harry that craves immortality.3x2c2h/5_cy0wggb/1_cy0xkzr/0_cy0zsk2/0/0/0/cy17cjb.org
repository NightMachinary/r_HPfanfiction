Peter Singer, a professional philosopher, does the same thing: he reduces a moral concept (whether we are morally responsible for others) into a simplistic mathematical algorithm.

And yet he is still an extremely respected philosopher and people debate about whether his ideas have merit. To me, that is not the same thing as 'categorically wrong'.
