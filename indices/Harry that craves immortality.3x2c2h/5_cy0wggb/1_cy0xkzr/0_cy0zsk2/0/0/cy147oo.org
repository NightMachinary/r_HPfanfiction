It's categorically wrong because the character is trying to reduce this particular moral concept into a simplistic mathematical algorithm. The character very specifically does NOT say 'if you want to die later, you still want to die'; he's suggesting that his lack of desire to die today can be applied by inductive proof to apply for all days to come, and suggests that because it's based on mathematics that the argument is unassailable.

Of course morality isn't settled- it's a cultural model and therefore subject to revision and reinterpretation for the standards of the time. What I can say about it is that it defies application of absolutes, which pretty much invalidates using abstract mathematical concepts to define it.
