"Being Categorically wrong"

Are you being hyperbolic here? Because I would be suprised if you actually thought that morality isn't exactly a settled science: there's still lots of debates going on.

I'm quite sure you could find a lot of philosophers who would say that immortality would be an extremely good thing (and that depriving others of it would be an extremely bad thing).

And some philosophers, such as Peter Singer, do in fact blame people for indirectly causing deaths they could have prevented, and advocate donating as much money as possible to charity (99% of income).

Regarding the specifics of the character's argument: "either you want to live or you want to die". The character is saying that if you want to die later, you still want to die.
