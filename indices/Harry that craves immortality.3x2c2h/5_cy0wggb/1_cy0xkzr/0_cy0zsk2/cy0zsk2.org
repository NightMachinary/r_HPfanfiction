It's flagrant abuses of 'logic' like this which demonstrate why Methods of Rationality is frustrating. The author acts like he's being clever while being categorically wrong /and/ being condescending about it.

Only an adolescent would believe that behavior can be explained by such simplistic mathematics. 'If this, then that, else the other'. The disproof of this assumption can be accomplished by presenting even a single exception.

"Either you want to live or you want to die.' No, sparky. Every human being is distinguished by the capacity to change its mind even if the conditions around them don't appear to have changed. Just realizing that infinite life can also mean infinite pain, infinite sadness, infinite ennui would prompt the unaging to pick up a gun and aim for a life-ending target. I don't want to live forever- I want to live for a fair span and enjoy myself during it, and if it looks like the potential enjoyment isn't going to balance out the difficulty of struggling to live, I will consider looking for an exit strategy.

I want to keep living /at the moment/. Things look good. I can expect some bad with the good but overall, my flawed expectations for the near future appear quite positive. If I knew I was going to get into a car accident where I would either live the rest of my days limbless and in constant pain or die suddenly, I'd be hard pressed to select the first option.

What's more, the idea that Flamel is any more liable for his choices for living nearly a millennia than we are for living almost a century is utter crap... 700 hundred years during which millions died who could have lived if you took action is the same as blaming everyone else for the hundreds of thousands of deaths that happened during their typical 80-year span. Immortality doesn't change the rules of cause and effect- if you don't know what's going to happen next, you can't be expected to change it. Yes, a whole lot of people can be saved if I decide right now to dedicate my life to being a doctor or a firefighter, but I don't wanna. Am I therefore a murderer? An arsonist? Crappy wordplay isn't the same as logic, and the elitist tone that's used to convey it is a kind of insincere salesmanship that makes me rage.
