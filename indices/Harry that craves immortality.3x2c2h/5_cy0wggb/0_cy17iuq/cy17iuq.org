You could make the same argument of 'That's not Harry at all' against a Harry who usually works hard rather than usually just going with the flow (as far as I recall, literally the only time Harry works hard in the books is in learning the Patronus charm).

Regarding HPMOR, the Harry character is in several parts quite literally an aggressive preacher for his particular philosophy, which is annoying to many readers.

However, if you are either extremely open (not hostile to even the most bizarre ideas or to the most annoyingly confident characters), or already believe in the utilitarian philosophy, HPMOR can be very enjoyable.
