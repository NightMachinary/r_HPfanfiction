Thanks for finding this. I hadn't read it in awhile and couldn't remember the other line of the prophecy about "either must die at the hand of the other" I always like reading this. And jus because it's not confirmed in canon doesn't mean it's not. We don't have a death date for Harry, he could have sacrificed his death and not even known it.
