Haven't you ever read the fan theory that "neither can live while the other survives" and the prophecy could mean that after voldemorts defeat Harry /can't/ die? Harry sacrifices his death to stop voldemort, this isn't a good thing to him because he will never see all the people he lost. Sirius, Remus, His parents, he won't go on to "the next great adventure" like everyone else.
