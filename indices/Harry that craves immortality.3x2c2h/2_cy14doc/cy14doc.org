This is certainly an intriguing idea but it isn't a theme of fanfiction that immortality is bad. This is a canon concept that is first brought up in book 1 when dealing with the philosophers stone and carries on through the entire series. This is a philosophical debate that is given life in HP and in many other fictional worlds. Almost universally immortality is considered burden as much or more than it is a benefit.

linkffn(The Last Enemy) Is a oneshot based on Harry conquering death, its very good.
