Linkffn(Yule Ball Panic) and it's sequels.

Linkffn(The Pureblood Princess)

Linkffn(Victoria Potter) surprised this one hasn't been mentioned yet.

Linkffn(Iris Potter and the Goblet's Surprise)

Linkffn(the never ending road) This is future fem!Harry/Snape, but this first book which is like 500k words has none of it. It hasn't happened yet. I recommend giving it a read. The writing is real nice, even the pairing is trash.

Linkffn(Gryffindors Girl)

And if you're real desperate, linkffn(Princess of the Blacks)
