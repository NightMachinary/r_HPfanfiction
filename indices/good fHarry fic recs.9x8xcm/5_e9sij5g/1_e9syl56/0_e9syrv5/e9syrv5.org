Like I said, the first dozen chapters aren't the best. I began writing the story when I began reading fanfiction, and the only reference I had to draw on at the time was the most popular stories I had read. Those mainly being Robst's work and Methods of Rationality. If I wasn't so busy with school, I'd go back and rewrite it all.

It grows into its own by chapter 14.
