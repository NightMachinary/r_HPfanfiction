I agree with most of your stuff, and even like some of the fics you rec'd, but Knowledge is Power is trash. It is easily Robst's worst fic (he even agrees, which is why he's rewriting it, though the rewrite is just as bad IMHO). The fact that Harry and Hermione create a new school, which they want taken seriously, that is named PISS is just so totally unbelievable so as to ruin the whole story for me. That and then the story gets distracted from the new school idea with the orphanage. Not only that, but what kind of mansion are they living in in Italy that can house, school and feed hundreds of people? I like robst's stories for the most part (I'm a big HHR fan), but Knowledge is power is god awful.
