[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045677/1/Foreshadowing-Demise][Foreshadowing Demise]] by Shadowmistress13 is my personal favorite. linkffn(4045677) Status: Incomplete

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10947735/1/To-Travel-to-a-Parent][To Travel to a Parent]] by Fandomobsessed77 is a particularly unique one. linkffn(10947735) Status: Incomplete

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]] by LullabyKnell is slightly slash, but the story itself is well written enough that it isn't overbearing. This is a time travel fic where Harry saved Regulus before he was drowned. linkao3(5986366) Status: Incomplete

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11314398][(honey) there is no right way]] by Sincere_Lies is more about Harry getting into a time loop. It hints into slight slash territory, but it is actually kind of cute. linkao3(11314398) Status: Complete
