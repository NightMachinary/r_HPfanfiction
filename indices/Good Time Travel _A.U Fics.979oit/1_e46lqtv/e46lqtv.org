  1) I am against ANY time travel fic that sees a character CHOOSING not to meddle with time, especially in the Marauders Era.

I hate those dumb time travels as well. I mean if you were given the ultimate deus ex machina of time travel, you might as well use it! What's the fucking point to rehash canon plot rails again and again? I would rather read JKR's original.

That being said, I have several time travels (not only Marauder Era) to recommend in which the time travelers decide to fuck the time line right from the start:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795): Hermione time traveled to her two years old self in 1981. Hilarity ensued, but also heart breaking moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): Harry was thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. He started out a little slow, but got things going eventually. Not everything went the protagonists's way though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns][Ginny Returns]], linkffn(4740107): Ginny accomplished her primary mission objective in a very efficient and painless way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4692717/1/Many-Thanks][Many Thanks]], linkffn(4692717): It's a very unique Hermione to Marauder Era time travel narrated from James Potter's POV. She didn't get paired with anyone.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10687059/1/Returning-to-the-Start][Returning to the Start]], linkffn(10687059): As the summary says, Harry would kill ALL of them, but without involving the kids.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4655545/1/Reunion][Reunion]], linkffn(4655545): Harry and his girls finished them off even before they were supposed to go back to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455): Basically an one-shot, but it's the only time travel fic in which Hermione KILLED Tom Riddle in his orphanage instead of raising or shagging him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We are the Golden Trio!]], linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 day (!) old Rose were thrown back in Aug 31 1991, and they got down to business immediately. This fic has a very good plot and great Trio friendship, but is somewhat in lacking in grammar and spelling.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]], linkffn(12511998): Powerful Harry somehow ended up in 1970, and began fucking over Death Eaters immediately. Bellatrix was very impressed.
