Delenda Est was an interesting one. It reached my favorites list due to the first half, but the second half let it down. And yet, the second half had a lot of unfulfilled potential. It lacked tension and credible opposition, and yet there were plenty of hooks that could have been turned into that.

It's still on my favorites list, because the first half was worth it.
