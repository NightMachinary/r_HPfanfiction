I think I'd read A Little Child Shall Lead Them before and then forgotten about it. It's not especially revolutionary, but the wipe and gradual restore of Hermione's alternate memories is touching, and the whole thing wraps up quickly enough to not overstay its welcome. Worth a read, since it doesn't take long.
