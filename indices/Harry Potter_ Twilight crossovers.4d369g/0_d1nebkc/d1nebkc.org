I am normally not into crossovers, but i had never considered this concept, which to a surprising degree actually works due to the simple fact that there are vampires in the world of HP, and Twilight leaves a lot of open wiggle room for myth and magic being real.

Ive never seen any crossovers of these two before, but I would also be interested if anyone has come across any.
