There actually are a few good HP/Twilight crossovers.\\
This genre is infested with lots of bad slash and Mary Sue wish fulfillment, but there is some good stuff there.

Actually one of the better fics I've read is called Harry Potter and the Forks Massacre. Warning it's abandoned but the story does a good job of characterization and dialogue.

There's also a few others that are pretty decent, but they're slash.

Good luck finding what you're looking for, good HP crossovers are few and far between.
