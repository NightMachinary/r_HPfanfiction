[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2690061/1/A-Right-Hufflepuff][A Right Hufflepuff]] - From Ron's POV, short and always gives me a smile.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backwards with Purpose]]- already pretty well-known, but just in case :)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2221913/1/Chess][Chess]] - Another Ron POV, pretty great

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2516931/1/Evanescence][Evanescence]] - Written before Pre-DH, about finding Horcruxes, it's good from what I remember, but it has been awhile since I read it (just to warn you)

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1399984/1/Recnac-Transfaerso][Recnac Transfaero]] - Kind of dramatic, but I still love the Trio scenes in this and it's sequels!

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter?]] A fun fic about Harry traveling and his friends trying to find him

Some might not be JUST about the trio, but they are some of my favorites!
