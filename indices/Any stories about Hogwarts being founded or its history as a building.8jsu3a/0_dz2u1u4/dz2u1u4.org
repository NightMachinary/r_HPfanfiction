One important thing to remember is that Hogwarts - the building, not the school - is a /castle/, which imposes some things on the architecture.

The main one is that all those 'abandoned classrooms'? They're there for a reason. A fully-working castle has at least a modest contingent of dedicated fighters, keeping in training and patrolling the surrounding country to maintain control. (Within practical limits, which are defined by the foot speed of men and horses and the size of the garrison. There's a possibly-apocryphal tale of an archaeologist who was an infantry NCO in former life predicting the site of a fort on Hadrian's wall as being a spot neither of the known forts either side covered.) Those fighters - whether they're mages or hired muscle - need places to sleep, maintain their gear, train and so forth.

They need room over and above that, however. A major function of a mediaeval castle was as an intake: when enemies came, the local people under the castle's protection could carry their foodstores, their livestock, the lord's herd and the contents of the tithebarns inside the walls. The peasants got handed whatever blade-on-a-stick arms the local blacksmith could throw together and were available to man the walls.

Still on top of that, there are whatever other things are being done at the castle: housing a Royal Mint, housing a royal armoury, housing the local Big Man (anywhere from the small-l lord of the man or up to the King his own self) and so on and so forth. If it was an important job that needed a secure place to operate, it could and would be moved inside a castle's fortifications.

Normally, a lot of those functions - garrison, refugee camp, palace, safe deposit, prison, mint, armoury, arms factory - would be fulfilled by wooden huts and sheds built inside the outworks of the fortification, which is why so very few castles still have them. Castles that stayed in use after gunpowder made them obsolete often have those internal buildings replaced with permanent structures - the Tower of London is the easiest example to find pictures of. The Yeoman Warders have an entire street of houses in there to live in.

I would expect that a /lot/ of the buildings at Hogwarts started out as wooden structures inside the palisades of a mediaeval hillfort, getting replaced as the mages living there found time to levitate stone to the site and magically shape it - possibly with a master mason looking over his shoulder and advising on design. Of course, all that magic used to shape and lay the stone? The resulting building gets a bit ... animated. That plus a thousand years of student cock-ups, we should be thankful it's only the staircases that move.
