Incidentally, this leads to my personal headcanon about Why Slytherin Left. *The* big change in Britain in the decades after Hogwarts was founded was the Norman Invasion. Salazar, a basque, would likely have had no good opinion of the Frankish peoples - they'd invaded his home country several times and outright annexed vasconia - and now he's /expected to educate Frankish whelps/? Cue massive argument, the wands come out, things get said, and he flounces.

The name of one of those damnable Frankish invaders, per JKR? One Armand Malfoy...
