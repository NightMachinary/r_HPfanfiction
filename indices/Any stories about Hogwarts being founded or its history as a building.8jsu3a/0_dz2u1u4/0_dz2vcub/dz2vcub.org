The /other/ thing to remember is that Hogwarts wasn't in Scotland when it was built. Scotland wouldn't exist for a couple of centuries (not bothering to look it up, left as an exercise etc.) and Hogwarts was built in either Strathclyde, Alba, or some tiny Pictish kingdom unremembered by history. England had only been a thing for a few decades, Wales was still independent, what is now northern England and the Borders were culturally very much aligned with Wales and Cornwall and the northern border of England wasn't so much a hard-and-fast line as a hundred miles or so of banditry that wasn't entirely settled until the late 1600s...
