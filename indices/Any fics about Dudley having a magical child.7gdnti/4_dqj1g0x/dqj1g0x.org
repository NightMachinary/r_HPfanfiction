Holly at Hogwarts is pretty decent. Dudley's changed his name to "Dillon Wycliff" and has two children, one of whom is the titular Holly. Dudley does not like his daughter being a witch at all, and he's really uncomfortable with all the magic stuff, but he tries to be supportive, even if he doesn't really want to know anything about what she does at Hogwarts.

(Story is based on the books ONLY, so it contradicts a lot of things from interviews and Pottermore and all that stuff. One of the more interesting ideas is Luna Lovegood as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.)
