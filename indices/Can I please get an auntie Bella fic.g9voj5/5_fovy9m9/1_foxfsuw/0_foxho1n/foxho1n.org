Yes Hermione is the love interest. Well that's always a problem with any time travel story if only one character of the pairing goes back. Sometimes it's handled by the older version being subsumed by the younger version. Eg it's the younger mind and personality that is in control they just have some information on the future.

Which I will admit will change them (usually speeding up their mental/emotional development). The ones that are tougher are the stories where the older version completely replaces the younger which makes things "iffy" all the way to "creepy". Eg an 80 year old mind in the body of a 14 year old boy who is chasing after a truly 14 year old girl.
