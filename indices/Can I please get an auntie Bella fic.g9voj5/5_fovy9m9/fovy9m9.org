Try World Changer by Ariel_Riddle. It's a WIP (though it may be moving into abandoned territory. Last update November 2018), and about 144K words. One scene from it.

Sirius was thrusting something into his hands. "A box of treacle tarts from your Aunt Bella. She told me to tell you she retrieved them from that French bakery you're so fond of and put a stasis charm on them. Nothing but the best for her Harry." "Aunt Bella," he tried, the words foreign and bizarre on his tongue.
