This isn't really on point but you might like Rorschach's Blot's Let's Do The Time Warp Again. Here Bella is still crazy but she has been refocused on Neville as her "little Dark Lord". She then sets out getting all of the Slytherin girls for his Harem. Neville's grandmother Augusta comes in all ticked off that Bellatrix is anywhere near Neville until Bella uses the "secret phrase". Grandbabies, lots and lots of grandbabies. At that point Augusta is all in favor.

All in all it's a good crack!fic read.
