I don't know if it's exactly what you're looking for but The Train to Nowhere by MayMarlow on ao3.

She doesn't play the largest role but she is present in a fair amount of chapters especially farther into the story. Harry spends a winter break at her house in one chapter and in some instances thinks of her as motherly. It's not dark!harry (I don't think) but is very AU.
