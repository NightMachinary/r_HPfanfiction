War fics? Hmm:

- Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): A minor spoiler but Harry gets kidnapped during the Triwizard Tournament so Voldemort starts a war against several countries in Europe. As a result, Britain becomes an island under seige and includes at least three major battle scenes that I can think of, not to mention the stuff in Ireland (which is trippy to say the least).
- Patron and Divided and Entwined linkffn(Patron; Divided and Entwined): Starfox5 does a good job depicting a sense of war coming to a country, with multiple factions vying for position as top dog and the sorts of atrocities one would expect in such a conflict.
- Skitterleap linkffn(Skitterleap): if you haven't read this, the Austro-Hungarian Empire is at war with a number of other states, particularly in Eastern Europe. Not at Hogwarts, since its a massive AU, but most of the characters are pretty familiar (although its the most unique Fred and George I have ever read).
- The Firebird Trilogy (particularly the last book) linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy): Voldemort, the heads of the covens and Harry's faction are in a bout to take control of magical Britain and decide the future of the witch-born. Good ideas regarding war, though it is pretty dark. Warning: a dark ending indeed.
- Magicks of the Arcane linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane): I have some issues with this fic, but if you think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/25/Magicks-of-the-Arcane][this]] interests you, give it a full read. A somewhat disappointing ending, but at least it has an ending.
- Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of the Hero): Part of the Hero Trilogy, these fics depict war in truly brutal ways, and have what may be the saddest noble hero arc I can remember.

There are more, but these are the ones that come to mind.
