I second the firebird trilogy.

So often war is depicted without meaningful losses. Darth Marrs does a great job with this, while some may call it dark, I call it war. War does not leave a winner, merely survivors. Too often the defeat of Voldemort is a great victory followed by rejuvenation and celebration. War inflicts wounds that don't heal, and whether you like the ending, it does an exceptional job of it.
