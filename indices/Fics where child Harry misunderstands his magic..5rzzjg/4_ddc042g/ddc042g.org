linkffn(5846162) has Harry thinking his magic's chakra (/a la/ Naruto). He ends up, via accidental magic, giving himself a real chakra network and devotes his life to being a ninja - and a good one, not a Naruto-esque flamboyant ninja.

It's a good fic, though it gets weird (in the Lovecraftian sense) midway through. It is very much dead, but still worth a read.
