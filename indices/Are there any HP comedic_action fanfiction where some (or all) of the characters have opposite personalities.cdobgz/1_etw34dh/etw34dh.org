Stages of Hope by Kayly Silverstorm comes to mind, it's a dimension travel AU where already AU characters (grim dark universe) trip into another, even more AU universe (opposite ish universe). There are some crack ish comedy bits but it's mostly action and family bonding, because the grim dark characters (Harry, Hermione, Neville, Luna) all need hugs. Essentially, they go horcrux hunting and both freak out and impress the opposite universe guys. All of them are super badass. Complete too!

Reverse by Lady Moonglow also fits this, and is also a dimension travel one. Hermione finds herself in another universe where everything is...reversed. /bad dum tsss/ Slytherins are still hated and Gryffindors are still praised, but Gryffindors are TERRIBLE PEOPLE. Dumbledore's proliferated the use dark magic, pure bloods are literally treated like house elves, and it's in general this super trippy dystopia. Evil Lily Evans, badass/chaotic neutral/sane Bellatrix, and also Lucius Malfoy needs a hug and probably some therapy---all of which are cool to read. Dramione romance, and Hermione spends her time trying to fix the horrendous human rights violations going on. And even though I'm pretty sure it's abandoned, there's still a ton of content that it's worth reading.

Both of these are really good and novel-length.
