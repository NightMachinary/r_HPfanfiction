I really fucking hate the “preserve the timeline” thing. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

Anyone who wants a repeat of that total cluster fuck is one big fucking coldblooded negligent shit head.

There's no need to let Moody suffer even a single moment.

There's no need to let Voldemort gain a body.

They know where Voldemort is hiding during the TWT. They know Voldemort is still very weak in that homunculus body. A raid led by Dumbledore will see both Voldemort and Wormtail captured, and Nagini destroyed.

Then they would be able to:

- Force Voldemort to spill all his secrets, his Horcruxes, his minions, his resources, his plans, and just about anything.
- Obliviate Voldemort back to his infancy. Even if he should escape in wraith form, he would wander the mortal plane as a confused and harmless spirit until the eternity!
- Dose Voldemort with Draught of Living Death and lock him behind wards stronger than Nurmengard.
- Exonerate Sirius by putting Wormtail on trial.
- Arrest every Voldemort minion that are still free, beginning with Lucius Malfoy.
- Begin Horcrux Hunt and find a solution to Harry's scar.
- If the above is successful, execute Voldemort.
