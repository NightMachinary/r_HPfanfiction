I'm actually fine with the universe conspiring to restore the original timeline. That shows creativity and has potential to thicken the plot.

But in the case I referred to, Harry /deliberately/ freed Wormtail from prison because he thought that the original sequence of events needed to happen, nevermind that everything was totally different by then.
