My headcanon for age reversal like in Peggy Sue is that the person truly does regress in maturity, but keeps his memories. Basically, similar to one getting a vision of the rest of their life.

I have nothing against fics portraying it this way as a result, nor with any age "discrepancy" in dating/etc.
