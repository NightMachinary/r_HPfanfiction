Here's a quick way to get a early elementary child character:

Make that child a savant about everything related to one thing a kid might be interested in, be it model rockets, star wars, ponies, giraffes, or dinosaurs, and let them know everything you can find in your research.

Then make them complete dunces at most every other topic, and have them do their best to work their favorite topic back into the conversation.

Bam. Instant child.
