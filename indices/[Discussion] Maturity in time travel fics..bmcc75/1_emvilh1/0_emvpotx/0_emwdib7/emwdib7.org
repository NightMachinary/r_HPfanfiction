Now I want to read a fic where Harry eventually noticed the degradation caused by the "time travel" where his neurons slowly burns out bit by bit due to huge amount of increased activity... Eventually slowly going crazy so he tries to circumvent it but its just his brain finally adapting.

The problem is the damage have been done and we now have someone who was one a bright you man becoming crazy around sixth year looking for a way to save his life, thus immortality while a dark lord is on the loose creating havoc in the background. Slowly but surely his attempts to keep himself alive works but his mind in tatters. A new Dark Lord hell bent on punishing everything that is deemed Dark and Evil like a Purifying flame that sweeps through the wizarding world.

History Repeats itself as well as bad things happen to wizard who messed with time. Time punishes Heroes who think they can circumvent time to change what was once was. He was not the only one. December is the seventh and last of seven months to have a length of 31 days, Tom Riddle is born as the seventh month dies. In the original timeline, He was once a chosen one meant to kill a dark lord. The one meant to bring forth acknowledgement that muggles are a danger since Dark Lord Grindelwald triggered a nuclear winter. But Time is not to be trifled with and will make do, those who wished to create paradoxes will be dealt with. When Grindelwald was dealt with Tom never forgot what muggles did. Just like how Harry will never forget what Purebloods and the Dark did.

History repeats itself and bad things happen to wizards who mess with time.
