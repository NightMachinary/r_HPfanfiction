I think that more than what is right or not, tha author needs to decide a course and acknowledge it. Let them be mature but thus unable to connect to those physically their own age, whose differences might be played up for contrasts sake. Have them regress and be afraid when they notice it. Have them be naturally be regressed but not have all the skills and knowledge at 100% available, exactly because they mentally regressed and can't handle that.
