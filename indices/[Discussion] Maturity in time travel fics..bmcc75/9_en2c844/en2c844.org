This isn't HP, but for a really interesting exploration of mixed-up age and maturity levels, you might enjoy linkffn(Shinobi: The RPG).

It's a gamer fic, with an adult being reincarnated into the Naruto world, with his memories intact and a Fallout 3 interface - except that the world doesn't work like a game for anyone else. There's no "guy at the mission desk just repeats the same words every time you talk to him until you accept the quest"; no, he's dealing with real (well, story-real) people, who care about him and work with him and get angry with him and are sometimes frankly terrified of him. Teammates who get upset if he time-skips an hour while sitting next to them, supervisors who worry about his mental health if he runs off to kill monsters and farm EXP, teenage girls who can't understand why an apparent 13-year-old (and one with the matching hormones) is reluctant to date them. And he dumped Charisma to give himself more Intelligence and Luck. Oops.
