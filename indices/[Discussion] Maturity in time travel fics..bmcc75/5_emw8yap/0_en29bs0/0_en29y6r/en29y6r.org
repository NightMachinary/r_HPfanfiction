I like that one, but it's also the ancestor of a lot of modern fanfics. I can give it a pass on things everyone does because it did some of them first. And Harry does become less of a mess over time, which is nice.

A main character that can't progress the plot because they're too broken to cope with their environment is a slog. If Harry keeps tearing up every time he spots Cedric, people are going to get some strange ideas about him. And if the author keeps stopping to write flashbacks of some brutal death every time Harry runs into them or sees a tapestry or something, the story isn't going to actually progress very much.
