It's also a bit tiresome when every little thing triggers flashbacks for him, particular negative ones that put him into a panic attack or cause him to lash out and draw attention. I get it, things had to be bad in the future for him to end up in the past. But when he starts crying every time he sees Hedwig, has long and drawn-out nightmares every night of each named character in the series dying gruesomely to betrayal, instinctively tries to curse Ron the moment he sees him for becoming a future Death Eater, or enters the Great Hall and relives the Battle of Hogwarts and nearly kills the first person to tap his shoulder...

I'm not here to read about a Harry who's so broken from his experiences he has trouble staying anchored in current times. Or if he was, he should start getting better now since he's in a safer time and making positive changes. I want to read about him making use of a second chance and trying to fix things.
