I think there's actually a story about Wife Husbandry or something and it's weird but done so well. Like they finally caught on the grooming but seriously cannot escape like most abusive relationship. It's like an imminent car crash but you can't look away.

It's a fuck up time travelling Harry grooms teenage Tom to be a companion slash Dark Lord weapon of sort. It was deleted I think but the psychological horror it devolved into is unforgettable.
