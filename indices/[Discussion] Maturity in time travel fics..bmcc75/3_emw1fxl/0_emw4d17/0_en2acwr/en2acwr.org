  We have a word to describe somebody with the mental age of an adult (especially a 20+ year old) establishing a relationship with somebody who's mentally an adolescent.

Yes, but what we /don't/ have is any kind of established set of rules for what constitutes acceptable non-creepy behavior for someone who has literally sent their mind back decades. If they attempted, while still physically a teenager, to date someone of their own mental age, then the law as it stands would prosecute their /partner/. What would you consider to actually be ethical dating in this scenario?

Of course, there's always the fallback of "wait until you're physically 18 and mentally 40", but even then, how many people would be OK with them dating a 40-year-old? How many people who knew their mental age would be OK with them dating an 18-year-old? It would be legal, yet it would still cop a lot of flak, no matter which route they took. And is it really fair to make them wait that long, when you have already made it clear that for dating purposes, you think they should be treated as an adult?

And what about cases where the time traveller doesn't simply replace their younger self, but merges with them in some fashion, so their memories of childhood are doubled up and fresh? What is their true age then? What can or should they do about it?

What about scenarios like Nightmares of Futures Past where the time traveller is undercover, and thus has interacted with his peers - including his prior girlfriend - and built up friendships with them in hopes of preparing them better for the coming war and thus /saving their lives/ from what he knows will otherwise kill them? Is that, then, "grooming"? What would be ethical?
