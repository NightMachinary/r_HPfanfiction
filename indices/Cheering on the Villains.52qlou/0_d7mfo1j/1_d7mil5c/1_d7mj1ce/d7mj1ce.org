I'm assuming Hermione's dark side would be referring to her blackmailing Rita Skeeter and the contract that mutilated Marietta Edgecombe's face. I'm pretty sure that was permanent, too, as I recall a reference of Marietta attempting to hide her face with makeup later on, so not something easily reversible, at least.

Personally, I like Hermione more because she's a brilliant witch, though, as well as how she stood up to Bellatrix Lestrange's torture. Of course, her dark side is pretty awesome, too.
