I think plenty of people love ruthless, smart, villainous protagonists, which explains the popularity of 'Breaking Bad' and 'House of Cards'.

Hermione is highly popular partly because of her dark side, and Harry was no saint either. The fandom further harbors great love for villains such as Draco and Snape, even Voldemort and Bellatrix have a significant following.

My top favorite fanfic is *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), which basically features a villain, who is a mixture of Harry Potter and Voldemort, as the main character. Many on this subreddit love that fic, too.
