I don't know if you have read this but [[https://my.w.tt/jy1LbJZqk4][Draconian by hepburnettes]] from wattpad is in Draco's POV most of the time. It's a dark fic and is what gave me the start to read fanfictions. It was already complete but the author decided to take it down and now has put it up again chapter by chapter. I don't exactly remember the plot but I remember loving it. It's been a few years since I've reread it.

I have other dark dramione-centric fanfics that are well-written and well-plotted but it doesn't fit your criteria. Hermione being the primary narrator of the story, but has elements of Draco's perspective. It really is daunting to find an excellent Dramione fic seeing it's the most common ship and most fics are not really well executed.

Now I also saw your Severus Snape fic reqs, this is also an SS/HG rec but it's worth the read. Has a time-travel element in the story but it's probably not what you expect. I think it's complete last time I check and is very lengthy. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11053807/1/Sin-Vice][Sin & Vice]] ffnbot!directlinks

When I stumble upon something that fits your request exactly, I'll be sure to send it your way. :)
