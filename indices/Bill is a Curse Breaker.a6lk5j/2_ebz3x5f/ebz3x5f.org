Nothing about the dagger, but if you're just generally looking for stories that expand on Bill's job, then there's linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider), which sounds like it should be ridiculous but is actually decent. Starfox is a great writer.

It's a minor plot point, though more than just a throwaway line, in one of my favorites, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past).
