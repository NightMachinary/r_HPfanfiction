Lots of stuff with transfiguration, like carbon nanotubes and basically alchemy (rearranging atoms). She gets to the philosopher's stone via some pretty advanced decryption, invents lots of spells, etc. I like how she, at one point, has a bit of a spell-inventing feud with Rookwood, where they each keep reverse-engineering each other's spells and using them against each other. Rational!Hermione but not as smug as HPMoR.
