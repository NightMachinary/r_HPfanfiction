The Arithmancer is pretty long but there is a section where Hermione and Bill (and Harry) go hunting Horcruxes: linkffn(The Arithmancer) -- the part in question is in the sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes). AU from Hermione as a math-genius. Years 1-3 are pretty close to canon, but Hermione does some cool magic with maths and terrifies everyone around her. The story really comes into its own in Lady Archimedes. Sorry, not sure if that's what you're looking for, but it covers the part you described.
