There was a story I read recently where Voldemort gets his wish of immortality because Harry doesn't kill him. Instead he puts him in a magical stasis that unlocks after millions of years when the earth has become barren and the entire human race is extinct. So Voldemort is now the uncontested ruler of earth and is immortal because of his horcruxes. But now his immortality is a prison and he is doomed to this barren planet in search for food and sustenance (he's immortal but still feels hunger/thirst).

I think if Voldemort ever got immortality, he would realize what a foolish target he had been chasing for his entire life.
