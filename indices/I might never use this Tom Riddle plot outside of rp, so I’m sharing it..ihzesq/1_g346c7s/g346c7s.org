I am assuming that at some point in his life Voldemort experienced what he would perceive as the three greatest human weaknesses: lack of control over a situation, pain and death (not himself but others, say, his mom). That's why he is so set on using them against other people, while he tries to protect himself from them. In my headcanon, it's not Harry that is able to resist the Imperius, but actually Voldemort's piece of soul in him. He doesn't make any friends because he knows that the pain of being betrayed by someone you care for is worse than any physical pain. And, obviously, he makes Horcruxes to prevent death.
