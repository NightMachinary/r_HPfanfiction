How about just making Lily Potter, Vanquisher of the Dark Lord Voldemort in an alternate dimension, coming out of the Veil?

This Lily lost both her husband and son on that Halloween night, but she managed to destroy the body of the Dark Lord. In the following week, she saved the Longbottoms and killed two Lestranges in the process. Over the next decade, she, Sirius, Remus, and Severus led the effort in hunting down Voldemort's Horcruxes. Finally on Halloween 1991, she managed to track down and destroy the Diadem of Ravenclaw. Voldemort, still lingering as a wraith in Albanian forest, was permanently vanquished.

However, this victory came at a steep cost. Sirius, Remus, and Severus all died at various stages of this dangerous quest. Lily locked herself deep in the Department of the Mysteries, trying desperately to bring her family and friends back. Eventually, she settled on the concept of dimensional travel. For almost 5 solitary years, she worked to modify the Veil into a gateway to a world where Harry and her friends are still alive.

She came out some time before Harry entered this room. This Lily was much more powerful than Bellatrix and slightly mad, the Death Eaters never had a chance...
