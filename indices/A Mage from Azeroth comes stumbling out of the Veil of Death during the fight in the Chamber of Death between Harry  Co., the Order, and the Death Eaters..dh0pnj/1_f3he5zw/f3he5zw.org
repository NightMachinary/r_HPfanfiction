I would love to see a well written HP / Warcraft crossover honestly. I've been toying with the idea of writing my own for quite a while. But english isn't my mothertongue and I lack experience. Maybe I should still try.

A mage would be fun, but something with an even weirder magic, and who looks like evil incarnate, such as a Shadow Priest, a Warlock or a Death Knight would be even better I think.

(And actually mages from Azeroth do know mundane spells. Enchanted brooms that sweep on their own, and a lot more. Rommath did rebuild half of Silvermoon in a night with magic after all. But yeah, they do know a ton of destructive shit. I'd really like to see a wizard face in front of a meteor-shower summoning maniac who cast without a wand.)
