The following fics put me in a good mood:

A Study in Magic by Vixit :: linkffn(6947125); Ravenclaw!Harry raised by Sherlock and Watson. Friendship theme. One of the best fics in my opinion.

Musings and Muses by Vanwilder :: linkffn(13068827); Calm!Harry. Chapter 1 and 2.

Pureblood Traditions by The Ferryman :: linkffn(12286176); Resourceful Hermione.
