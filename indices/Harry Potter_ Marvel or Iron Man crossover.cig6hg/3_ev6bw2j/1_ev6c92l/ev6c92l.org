#+begin_quote
  Tony Stark died at the age of seventeen with his father in an accident. Harry Potter, witness to both deaths, was tired of living in the Wizarding world. One dying man's wish grants him the reprieve he desperately needs as he takes on the role of billionaire playboy. NOTE: This is an old story and while I don't particularly like it, I know people who still do. So it stayed up.
