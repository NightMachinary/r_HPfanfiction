Um...that's the first point of discussion in the essay, /and they are explicitly ordered from least important to most important/. The rest of it talks about her manner of talking, her sense of humor, how they spend time together. The last, and thus officially "most important", problem is "Hermione is too rational and not tactful or intuitive enough to deal sensitively with Harry's dark moods."

So I'm not sure how you got the idea that the essay is fixated on physical attraction.
