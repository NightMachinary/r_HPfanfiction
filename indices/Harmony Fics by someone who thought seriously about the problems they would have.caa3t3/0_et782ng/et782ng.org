That essay seems strangely focused on the physical aspects of attraction, as if peoples physical attraction doesn't evolve with the relationship.

I think a large part of the issue with the lack of issues to work through in a h/hr relationship is that the 'easy' way to do this is to use misunderstanding/trust issues/"do you believe in me" plots.

However, the driving characterization of the H/Hr relationship is one of loyalty. Hermione is characterized as steadfast behind Harry, and Harry is displayed as extremely loyal to his friends

Thus, common romantic conflicts are hard to have. Such as:

- Harry/Hermione are concerned the others are hiding their true feeling (neither is ever set up to keep secrets from each other)
- Harry/Hermione is worried the other is staying with them due to duty instead of love
- Harry/Hermione can't advance the relationship because they feel like the other is hiding things.
- Harry/Hermione have romantic misunderstanding that they don't clear causing drama

They can be done, but it is harder.

The ones that do work tend to be used in fics that alienate Hermione from Harry, rather than a romantic challenge:

- Hermione decides she has to do something for Harry against his wishes for his own.
- Harry decides to 'protect' his friends by shutting them out.
