  Newly emancipated 15 year old Harry Potter decides to get out of Britain for the summer and head to Vegas for his vacation, bringing along Tonks and Remus to keep him out of trouble and things he shouldn't be doing. Two days later Harry wakes up in a hotel room in bed with Tonks and a mystery woman, another mystery woman in the bathroom, Remus is missing, and next to no memory about what happened during the last two days. Want to know the whole story? Join Harry on this crazy ride to learn just what happened to Harry during those two days and what happens as a result of it all.
