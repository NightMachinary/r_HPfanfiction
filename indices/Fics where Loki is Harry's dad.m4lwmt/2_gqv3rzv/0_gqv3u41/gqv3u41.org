  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

  "I was there every step of the way, I held her hand as she suffered through labor, he has my name, he is my son now...not yours." James said harshly trying as hard as he could to keep his voice low. "We both know that he isn't yours," Loki hissed back at him as he took a step forward. Warning possible Slash

  Years ago a mistake was made. Now years later the consequences of that mistake are being brought into to light. A mistake that has the potential to destroy Harry's life as he knows it. His parents aren't who they thought they were, and he's left facing a truth about himself that leaves him uncertain about his future.
