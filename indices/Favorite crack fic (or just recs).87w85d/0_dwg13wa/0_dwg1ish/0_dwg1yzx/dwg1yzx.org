Dunno why the bot's not working, but you should definitely read Seventh Horcrux at the very least. I'm not kidding, I've read it about 7 or 8 times now, and it's still amazing.

Also, let's see what else I can remember. linkffn(The Horror! The Horror!; Dear Order; The Inner Eye of Harry Potter; The Wendell that Wasn't; Inspected by Number 13; Escapologist Harry; We, Harry Potter; On a Train, Switching Tracks; In the mind of a scientist; Parseltongue lets me talk to WHAT; The Ultimate Escape Artist; Dimension Hopping for Beginners; Just a Random Tuesday; Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbable Plot; Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion) are all varying levels of crack and humor.
