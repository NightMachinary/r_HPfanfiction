A few more : linkffn(When in doubt, Obliviate; Whatever Happened to Bromance; Timely Errors; Two Weeks in the Alley; Sphere of Influence; Reunion; The Parselmouth of Gryffindor; On a Pale Horse; The Original Naked Quidditch Match)

Oh, and just one thing, most of what I recommended is more on the side of humour than crack, as at least Make a Wish and the first chapter of the other fic you said you liked (which seems nice, thanks!) aren't really all that cracky. Crack fics, to me, become crack due to sheer absurdity or a level of ridiculousness you wouldn't expect in even a humorous fic. Something like linkffn(Oswald the Ottoman) is a great example. Or maybe something like linkffn(Oops by michaelsuave), while something like linkffn(If I were a Superhero, I would be) is more borderline.

All this is, in the end, just my interpretation of the genre.
