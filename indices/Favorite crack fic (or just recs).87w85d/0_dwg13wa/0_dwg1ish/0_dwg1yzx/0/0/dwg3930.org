Ooo, I'll definitely read some of these soon.

And no worries, that makes sense to me. I think you're right, though, that what I'm looking for is maybe more humor (or borederline crack, but still humor). I think that's definitely the first one I listed, although Make a Wish I think does have aspects of absurdity (especially once the scientist and apprentice come in) that would make me call it crack.

But you do make a good point. I'll edit my first post a bit to see if I can be more clear (and maybe get some more recs). :)
