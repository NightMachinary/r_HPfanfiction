Oh yeah, I have seen Seventh Horcrux recommended a few times. For some reason, I always forget that it's supposed to be crack/humor/parody/whatever. I have that, A Black Comedy, and Where in the World is Harry Potter bookmarked. I've read Harry the Hufflepuff and Oh God Not Again and liked them both. :)

More recs are always appreciated, but whatever you have time/patience for! ^{^} Even if I don't end up bookmarking or reading, I always like discovering new stories.
