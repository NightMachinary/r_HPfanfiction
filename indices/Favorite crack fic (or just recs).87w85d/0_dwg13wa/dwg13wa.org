There's a reason linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) is the most rec'd and on top of so many people's(including mine) favourite list. It's very cleverly written, damn funny and an overall masterpiece.

Also, a few other amazing ones: linkffn(A black comedy; Where in the world is Harry Potter; Harry the Hufflepuff; Oh God not again). There are a lot more, so if you like these, ask me again.
