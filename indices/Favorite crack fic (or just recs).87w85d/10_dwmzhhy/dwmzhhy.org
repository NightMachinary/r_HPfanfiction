I've only ever read two gen fics that genuinely made me laugh out loud. One is the ever-controversial HPMOR; the other is Scorpius Malfoy and the Improbably Plot (and the other various crack fics by the author).

That being said, if anyone can recommend a fic or writer whose humor is more like opalish's (the other of the Improbable Plot) than Seventh Horcrux or A Black Comedy, I'd love to hear some reccs too.
