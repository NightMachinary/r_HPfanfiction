I think if each fanfiction in a series is distinct enough that it has its own themes, character arcs and resolution, then it's probably best to separate them. Clumping together a bunch of clearly discrete stories and implying they're a single coherent story is misleading in its own way. I have seen it done before, and if that's how you prefer to write your series then I don't necessarily have a problem with it, but I also see the appeal in writing a series as multiple separate entries.

If an author writes a completed fanfic, for example, then sometime later decides to write a sequel, the first fic doesn't suddenly become incomplete. And if the first book was written as stand alone, it would be really weird to append the sequel to it.

Just to give an example from a non fanfiction:

The webnovel Worm is already insanely long. By itself it's already longer than the entire Harry Potter series. There's no practical or technological reason then, that when the author decided to write a sequel, he couldn't just attach it to the end of Worm. As you said, "it doesn't exactly matter how big the book gets if it doesn't need binding". But Worm was written as a single story. Sure there are sequel hooks, but at the end of Worm the protagonist's character arc is complete, her journey is over. The sequel, Ward, is separate enough that it would be incredibly jarring to go straight from one to the other without some kind of delineation. Hence the author decided to upload it as a separate story, with its own website. I don't think the fact that Ward is currently incomplete makes Worm any less complete, nor do I think they should have been published together as a single story

On the other hand if an author arbitrarily divides up a story that is clearly being written as a single unit, then I think that is rather misleading, and should be avoided if possible. Obviously though, this isn't black and white, and some stories in a series are more stand-alone than others.
