The first ever story I've read (back when I was unaware that a "complete" tag existed, was abandoned 200k words in because apparently, the author had died. Lesson learned, I began with bonds of time (which was marked as complete). ~400k words later, I find out that there's a sequel, so I read another 400k words. And oh look, there's part 3. I soon realised that it was abandoned ~50k words in and the author moved on to different projects. I felt more than a little disappointed back than, after reading nearly a million words for nothing. The author had blasted himself in a gigantic hole and didn't know a way out (and I don't see one either without massively rewriting what is already published).
