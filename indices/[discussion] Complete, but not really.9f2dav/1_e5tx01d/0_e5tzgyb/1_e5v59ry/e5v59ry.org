I've gone the J.K. Rowling route for my story. I /already have/ my ending written out. The best part is at worst if I completely lose interest I can just add a few paragraphs summing up the in-between, add it as an Epilogue, and bam, instant closure. Not that I plan to do anything like that, but it's a nice contingency solution to have.
