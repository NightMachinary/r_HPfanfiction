Finishing a work - actually completing a story - is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated qualities of a fanfiction author. I know we're doing this for fun, not for money, and no one should expect us to work as if we were professional authors - meaning, force ourselves to write even if we don't want to - but I don't consider any author great if they don't go that extra mile and finish their stories, nor do I consider any story great if it's not finished.
