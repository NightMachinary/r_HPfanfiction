Series are not the same as long stories. They have distinct books, with distinct arcs and plotlines. Marking book one as complete is perfectly reasonable even if book four is still in progress.

Much more so with HP, we have a preset yearly template with the series itself, it's only natural that fanfiction writers would follow the same 'one book one year' formula.

That said, I've seen people post a story in short 'books' that clearly don't follow any sort of structure, as though to just top the 'recently posted stories' list as frequently as possible, and /that/ irks me.
