  I have a thing for betrayed Harry, through the Goblet of Fire, Azkaban, etc. It's suprisingly difficult to find fics where Harry is COMPLETELY alone. Authors tend to feel the need to shoehorn Neville or the Twins in.

  Romance because of this isolation is welcome, but not mandatory.

In these threads this is discussed as well, you can look there for some inspiration :)
