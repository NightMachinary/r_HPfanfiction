It's not exactly a match to your description, as Longbottom is the BHL, but /Knowledge is Power/ by SerpentSannin might be what you're after.

It may be against site rules (#6) to post a link (though the "author's" note by Defenestratable suggests otherwise, that this is an authorized copy), but if you Google "Knowledge is Power SerpentSannin Fettucini", you should be able to locate a repost within the top couple of links.
