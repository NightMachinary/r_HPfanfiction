Gideon Prewett. linkao3(The Second String)

This story is an adventure story more than a romance so you wont find any smut or anything remotely fluffy.

That being said, Harry is goddam adorable in this. He's all brave and strong and stubborn and then Gid walks in and he just grins like a big goofy moron and can't think straight and it's absolutely adorable.
