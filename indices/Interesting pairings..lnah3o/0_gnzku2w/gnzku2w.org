Might as well add Tonks, Susan Bones and Snape to that list.

Midnight Blues (Harry/Hannah Abbott) - linkffn(9121877), pretty good post-war fic, goes beyond just Hogwarts/Magical Britain, although the H/Hr and "Muggles good, Wizarding World bad" vibes got a bit too strong later.

Hallowed (Harry/Lisa Turpin) - linkffn(7469856), one of the best smart!Harry fics and has a fresh take on the Triwizard Tournament without going through the stations of canon. No bashing.
