  Harry becoming a merchant in a feudalistic setting. This can work for Naruto, the Avatar series and, funnily enough, Game of Thrones. Just Harry selling stuff to different villages, cities and states whilst having his canon-typical luck come into play. It's challenging because being a merchant in such a situation is a very tetchy career choice. Sure, Harry is basically free to roam, but nobody's going to be particularly surprised if he dies going from point a to point b one day... and their surprise at seeing him alive reflects that.
