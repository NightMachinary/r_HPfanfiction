You know, what I really want to read is a story where Harry gets thrust into another fandom and just really, really doesn't interact with said fandom's main cast outside of blink-and-you-miss-it cameos.

I've been working on them and, fair enough, they're actually really challenging to write effectively, as you're trying to write about Harry actually being in the Universe of the day rather than in a Hogwarts with ray guns and space ships.

Ideas so far include (along with fandom):

Harry becoming a merchant in a feudalistic setting. This can work for Naruto, the Avatar series and, funnily enough, Game of Thrones. Just Harry selling stuff to different villages, cities and states whilst having his canon-typical luck come into play. It's challenging because being a merchant in such a situation is a very tetchy career choice. Sure, Harry is basically free to roam, but nobody's going to be particularly surprised if he dies going from point a to point b one day... and their surprise at seeing him alive reflects that.

Harry gets thrown into an Isekai without your normal Isekai's plot armour. The girls think he looks weird, the ROB hates him, his command of the language is basic, his gear is shit and his physical condition isn't anything to write home about. Basically, he's got the survival prospects of a jellyfish sucked into a jet turbine. Yeah, he survives, but it's always by the skin of his teeth. Could feature Harry's epic and injury/trauma-filled climb to the middle ranks of your average low-level guild in a dungeon setting, for example.

Basically, pick any Isekai and apply that premise to it. It'll immediately blow the competition out of the water, I can guarantee it.

Harry getting thrust into star wars/halo/etc... and being forced to take the equivalent of a space bus for a long time instead of jumping into the story with a spaceship ready to go. Even Star Wars doesn't hand ships out like candy to random humanoids from barbarian planets that haven't even gotten FTL down yet. A space ship, especially one that can travel faster than light, isn't something you can just learn at the drop of a hat-which virtually every fic ever set in space just handwaves away. Training for piloting one of those takes months, maybe even years, before someone can truly say they can pilot a ship (let alone captain one, which is a whole other plate of chips). There's a bewildering array of things to learn Harry's never heard of before and he just jumps into one and manages to get it off the ground on his first try? And then plays GTA with spaceships? Seriously, reading a fic where Harry actually has to learn shit before flying off into the great unknown would be a wonderful change. Star Wars, Honor Harrington, The Culture, basically any setting where FTL-capable small vessels exist.

Harry the magic detective that knows magic, not forensic techniques. Again, he has to learn them. Again, it takes a long-ass time to do so. Again, it would actually make things so much better, especially if he gets into an argument with the lab techs and is sometimes proven wrong. NCIS, Dresden Files, Castle, Lucifer, you get the idea-cop shows with a sense of humour because Law & Order was basically as dry as mummified salted cod from the word go.

Harry the criminal. Not a rogue. Not a scoundrel. Not a cad. Harry steals stuff to survive and assuages his guilt by going out and becoming a vigilante/good samaritan when he's not playing cat burglar. Best places for this-the Dredd Universe, because why not? Ghost in the Shell, where he has to deal with the cops' techno-magic fuckery. Dishonored, where he repents his wicked ways because Corvo spends his downtime trolling the criminal populace with how much better he is at their job than they are, which leads to sticky situations for one Potter.

Harry just doesn't give a shit. Harry gets plonked into the main plot line, sees the young up-and-coming heroes getting into their epic quest and... sits down in front of a crystal ball, grabs some popcorn and watches the show from a safe distance. I really don't care where it goes from there, but the thought of 5-6 chapters of Harry pulling an MSTK 3000 on the protagonists as he watches from his heavily warded bunker in the middle of Siberia strikes me as hilarious. Apply to: Every YA novel ever.

And finally, the one fandom I would love to actually see-an HP/STALKER series crossover. Not Harry goes to X, but The Zone comes to the HP 'verse and is centered around an important magical location rather than Pripyat (though not Hogwarts). Features Harry stuck in The Zone with some crazy, gun-toting muggles who completely ignore his ability to do magic because that Artyom kid was running around with a psychic baby alien, so cast away mini-Gandalf!

Can be used as a crossover for STALKER, METRO, Gravity Falls weirdly enough, Welcome to Night Vale, Stranger Things, It and the grand-daddy of them all, 'Roadside Picnic', the book by the Strugatsky brothers.

And that's it folks.
