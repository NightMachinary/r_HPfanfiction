One that AFAIK, nonexisting, which is HP/Red Rising Trilogy. I want to see the Red Rising-verse and Darrow being confronted with the possibility of magic, and how that changes the course of the books, lets say, Darrow found Harry out during the Institute, Harry might be in one of the houses, though the most sensical one for him to be would be Pluto, but that's Jackal's house. Or even Mars itself, play some part because of Harry's past.

Also, would have to give Harry the same Gold makeover that Darrow got. Perhaps the Sons found a "person" that was kept in a cryogenic stasis (exactly like in "Brown Coat, Green Eyes, which is the inspiration for this rabbit.) for future emergencies within the magical world, but something went wrong because the Golds somehow killed all the wizards in secret, so Harry would have a motive against them.

Just please, for the love of god, NO slash. Even if it seems lke the logical choice considering there's Roque, Cassius and Sevro as possible partners that could fit quite easily. Darrow would be more a strech considering we already know he's doing everything cuz of Eo.

Anyways, that's my ideia for a HP/RS.

What I want is more HP/Inheritance Cycle fics.

AFAIK the only 4 good ones or even remotely interesting (though both BCaL and BWaC are fantastic, imo) which are By Courage and Love, By Wisdom and Courage (2 different but with the same start and premise, authorized by the original writer) To Train a Dragon Rider and the one where Harry merges with Shruikan.

Sure, there's more fics, but none are remotely good and as interesting. I want a fic where the different branches of magic are exploited and explained, similar to how it works on BWaC and a bit less in BCaL. With romance because I'm a sucker for romance... Even would work with a femHarry dragon animagus that when teleported to Alagaesia gets captured mid book 3 by Galbatorix and then he learns her ability to shapeshift and forces her through his different and unknown magic (to her, at the time) to copulate with both Thorn and Murtaugh as a way to guarantee not only his obedience but his loyalty, but ofc firing backwards as Murtaugh and Thorn both change their true names due to their love or their hate against Galbatorix, granting them leeway to escape with her in tow. IDK, just seemed like a interesting point. A book fought with a witch that isn't a rider, but "has" a dragon, Eragon and Murtaugh side by side way before the final battle.

Thats it. Oh, and please, could someone write a good fucking femHarry/Percy Jackson, please.
