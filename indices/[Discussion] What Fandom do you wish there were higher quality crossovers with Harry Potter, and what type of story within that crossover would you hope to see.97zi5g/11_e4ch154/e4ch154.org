The Magicians, by Lev Grossman. I haven't gotten around to reading all of the books, but I love the syfy series, and the potential for high quality crossovers is insane. Just the possible interactions between the two magic systems is incredible.

My personal head-canon has always been that the magic portrayed in the Magicians, is actually magic as practiced by muggles, which is why it's so hard, why they have to memorize Circumstances, and why it can get "cut off" (like how houses can get their power cut); they're manipulating an external force instead of using an in-born power. This would help explain the Statue of Secrecy, why wizards don't rule over muggles, and how muggles ever could have been a threat; muggles have numbers, and their top 10 or 5 percent is smart enough to be magicians (in the books you have to be a genius to be a true magician), and magicians, while practicing magic that is often slower and less showy than wizards, can pull of some pretty intense stuff (like literally summoning gods, explaining how witch hunts and church inquisitions could have gone very badly for wizards).

The story I'd most like to read is some strange tale where Dudley, by some miracle, is born smart enough to be enrolled at Brakebills, and calls up Harry like "Hi, I kind of got to kill a Beast to help save a magical world; you've done this before, any tips?". But honestly any story about a magician wandering into the magical world, or a wizard wandering into the Magicians world, would do.

The two series have power levels that interact so strangely with another. On one hand, teleporting is a standard power in HP, and a unique power in the Magicians, possessed only by Travellers. So on that front wizards look stronger. But in the Magicians travellers can literally port to different planets and planes of existence. Fairly high level wizard objects are things like the Cloak, and the Elder wand, with the most useful daily life powerful object being a Time-Turner. The Magicians version of a Time Turner can create possibly endless time loop, in which it is possible to actually change time.

It's like, in the Magicians, everything is far more difficult than in HP, making HP wizards far more versatile. But on the other hand, the sheer level of power a Magician can exert with enough prep time is nothing to sneeze at. But I've yet to find a fic like that, so I guess I"ll have to write it xD
