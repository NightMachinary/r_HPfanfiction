Can always use more Dresden crossovers. I always considered the Dresden files to be the adult version of Harry Potter anyway.

Also there is nowhere near enough hot Warhammer 40K action. Which is terribly sad because Harry Potter fan fiction can lend itself exceptionally well to grimdark. Just imagine Dumbledore looking all sad and telling young Harry "In the grim darkness of the future there is only war"
