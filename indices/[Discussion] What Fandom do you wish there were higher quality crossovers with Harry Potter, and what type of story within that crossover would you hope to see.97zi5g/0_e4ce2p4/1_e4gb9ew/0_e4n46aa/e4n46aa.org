This reminds me of the Old Kingdom/Abhorsen series; Charter magic is much weaker when you get into Ancelstierre, a non-magical country separated from the Old Kingdom by a vast wall. Having magic reduce in efficacy would be a nice mechanic, especially if he has to go to King's Landing, Dorne or across the sea to meet with influential people.
