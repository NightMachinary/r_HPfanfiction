I had two ideas.

1) Young Harry (and others if you want) are dropped off in GOT hundreds of miles north of the wall. The closer they get to the wall, the more their magic fades.

2) same premise as above but the entirety of hogwarts is transported north of the wall when Harry is 11. This starts about 5 years before GOT events. Once again, they can't go south of the wall with magic.
