Game of Thrones.

Ideally I would love to see a young Harry (maybe 4th year after or during the Triwizard), being thrust into the GoT universe. His limited pool of magic would make some problem solving more interesting than him being a fully grown, fully capable Auror (or similar). He'd still be an incredibly powerful being, as even WIngardium Leviosa alone would allow him to cheat his way through Westeros.

There are two stories I would love to see him being engaged in. Either Jon Snow's or Daenerys Targaryen's.

Some points I'd think would be interesting for him would be:

- Saving Ygritte
- Becoming a dragon rider
- Saving Sansa much sooner
- confront the warlocks
- and so on andso forth...
