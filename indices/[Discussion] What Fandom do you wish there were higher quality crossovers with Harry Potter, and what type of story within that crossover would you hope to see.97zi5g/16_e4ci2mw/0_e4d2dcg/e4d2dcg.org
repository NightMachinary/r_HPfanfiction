Might not be exactly what you're looking for, but it is one of the best crossovers I've found linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by SteelBadger). IIRC it doesn't feature a superpowered harry, the worldbuilding is fantastic. There's little to no romance that I can recall, and it isn't set during the time of the fellowship.
