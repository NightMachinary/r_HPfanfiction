Try Not Quite a Maia by KarasAunty - it doesn't have Harry falling into middle earth, but it DOES have Neville, Molly, and a wonderful third character galavanting through in ab absolutely magical and well-written masterpiece. If you know LotR lore, you'll love it!

Rating: PG-13 Middle Earth has a problem: Gandalf the Grey is AWOL in Time and Space after destroying the Balrog of Khazad-dum. But who will take his place in the Quest to defeat the Dark Lord Sauron? Not who you think... HP/LOTR Crossover. Wildly AU! UK English.
