I don't know much about LotR, but that type of story sounds incredibly interesting. I can already see some potential characters from the HP verse, like a Pureblood Hufflepuff that doesn't even like being in their own house ("...and Hufflepuff took the rest...") or something.

I know nothing about LotR, but I'll take a look at what you just linked because it sounds interesting.
