I'd like to see a realistic Harry Potter falling into Middle Earth cross over. I just want something like Home with the fairies linkffn(6024634) where everything is gross, no one speaks English (And there's no convenient "translation charms") and they don't just fall directly into the lap of the nine walkers and immediately have romantic chemistry with Legolas or whatever. But instead of a normal human it's a Wizard/Witch at OWL level proficiency who is suddenly whisked away to Middle Earth. It doesn't even have to be a known character. In fact I would prefer an average Hufflepuff protagonist (Pureblood with little understanding of muggles to play up that initial confusion about where/when he is).

But most of the ones I've looked at feature Harry as a hardened post war veteran and powerful duelist use to fighting and being the chosen one destined to defeat great evil and already use to roughing it due to his horcrux hunt. There's little room for character growth
