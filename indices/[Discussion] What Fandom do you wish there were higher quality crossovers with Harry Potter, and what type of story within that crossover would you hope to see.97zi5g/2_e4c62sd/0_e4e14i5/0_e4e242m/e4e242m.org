I was thinking something along the lines of finding out that wizard magic comes from the sun somehow and once you get far enough away from the Sol system's sun magic stops working.

This presents unique opportunities however. If you can capture someone and drag them to the Sol system you can magic them up. I also like the idea that portkeys work even at galactic distances but they're a one way trip because they stop working as soon as you get there. This makes Sol a new type of smuggling because you go there and then portkey your cargo to where you actually want it.

Cerberus could be a magical organization. Statute of secrecy could be a thing of the past and everyone knows about magic. What would the rules be for organizations when magic exists? If a Wizard uses the imperious on someone and stays in the Sol system, that spell keeps working and the wizard just tells them to follow the orders of their handler. To the STG something like that would mean visiting the Sol system is "this is your last job because you're not with the organziation anymore once you return" type of thing.
