Harry Potter/Star Wars, where magic isn't clearly superior to the Force, at least in a fight. linkffn(8501689) is reasonably good about keeping magic and the Force roughly balanced - Harry is formidable moreso because his abilities are exotic and unknown - but he's still arguably the deadliest single being in the galaxy and certainly in the top five. Something where it's more even, where an experienced Harry is roughly on-par with an ordinary Jedi (rather than the very top-end) would be sweet.

This might require a younger Harry, one less trained in magic before joining the Star Wars world, but I'd still love to see it.
