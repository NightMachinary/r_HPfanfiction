/Doctor Who/. Whenever you ask for crossovers, it's either linkffn(That Which Holds The Image) (which /is/ good, but it's only one story), or convoluted plots to explain how the Tenth Doctor is secretly Barty Crouch Jr. Yet this is even a crossover that has some justification in the /DW/ canon!... How is there so little of it? Why aren't there any "Doctor raises Harry" or "7th Doctor as Defence Professor" or "Voldemort at war with the Daleks" or... any number of the endless possibilities?
