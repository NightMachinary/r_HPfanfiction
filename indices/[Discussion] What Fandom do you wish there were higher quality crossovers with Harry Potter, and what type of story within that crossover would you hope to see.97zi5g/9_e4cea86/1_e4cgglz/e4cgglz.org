I do remember reading a pretty fun story, where an amnesiac 11th Doctor ended up in control of eleven year old Harry's body. He didn't have his memory, and yet his mannerisms and way of behavior are just incredibly in character that the fic is honestly one of my favorite stories. The MC really does behave like the 11th Doctor would upon landing in an unfamiliar, but fascinating new culture; so much so that it ends up reading like a particularly good, particularly long Doctor Who arc.

I don't know how to post links properly, but I'll give it a try:
