[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127805][Shut and Be a Bud Again]] keeps canon pairings and runs from the aftermath of the battle through the next year. Sadly looks like it was abandoned in-progress but the first major story arc (chapters 1-19 or so) pretty much could stand alone. I think it has some really good character development and plausibly shows how Harry in particular could be feeling, though the writing and plotting gets a bit weaker in the later chapters IMHO.
