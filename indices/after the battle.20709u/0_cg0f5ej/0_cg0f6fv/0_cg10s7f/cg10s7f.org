I started Learning to Live Again, but I'm having some problems with it. The first one came in the second or third chapter when Arthur told Harry he couldn't stay at the Burrow. It just wasn't at all the Weasley way. It didn't fit. Then a few chapters later Harry and Ron are practicing to try out for the Cannons? I'm going to keep going, but I'm approaching these with reservations for right now.
