Thanks for this post. I'm looking for some new fics as well, and like you, I've already read both Little0Bird and Northumbrian's stories. Great, but I'm looking for other ones. Actually, most of the stories people recommend, I've already read... It's just been a while since DH was released and so most of the older fics have been floating around for a while.

Good suggestions by posters, though. There's also a story called /Starting Over/ by serendipity_50 over at Livejournal. She's got a sequal to it called /Inner Demons/. I thought both stories were pretty good. Ginny's a little bit... dramatic, but it's a decent story, I think. Give it a shot.

Here's the link to her stories:
