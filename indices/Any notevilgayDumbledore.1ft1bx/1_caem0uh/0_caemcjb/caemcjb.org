It was some Harry/Hermione thing with copious Dumblebashing. I think it also had James and Lily surviving by meeting /Emma/ and /Daniel/ Granger. (I hate that convention too, by the way.)

It wasn't explicit about it, but it had a very amoral out of touch Dumbledore sad over the fact that he had to murder his lover to cover up his crime of setting up Harry's parents for death.
