There's one I'm reading now by Kathryn518 called I'm Still Here that I am enjoying. It's a WIP but regrettably it's abandoned (or on a really really long Hiatus) as it hasn't been updated since Jan 2017. Voldemort and Harry have both lost as they have managed to each kill anyone that meant anything to either of them. And tgere is no magical world left as magicals took sides only to be killed by Harry or Voldemort.

Voldemort performs a ritual using the last bit of blood from the small handful of deatheaters Harry hadn't killed yet. To go to a universe/dimension that doesn't have the Boy-Who-Lived. Harry though seriously injured manages to force himself through the portal that Voldemort passed through.
