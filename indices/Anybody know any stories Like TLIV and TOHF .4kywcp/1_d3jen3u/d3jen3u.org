linkffn(In Light of Silver Memories) is similar to TOHF in that it features Harry, who receives Dumbledore's memories by the beginning of DH. IIRC, Taure was inspired by this fic to write TOHF. And like TOHF, it's abandoned.

I'm not sure about any other story where James and Harry's identities combine, but if you're looking for a story where Harry inherits another person's memories, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge) might be a good read as well. This time, it's from Voldemort, and it's the best written out of stories where Harry inherits Voldemort's memories.

Additionally, you might like linkffn(What Lies Beneath) which is an excellent fast paced psychological thriller.
