I think there's likely a lot of fics out there, especially if you branch out on ao3. If you ask for recs on this subreddit, that can also help you find some of the less-known fics of the fandom. I don't know what you've read already, but here's some of my Harry-centric favorites:

linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm; The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville; The Augurey by La-Matrona; The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; Victoria Potter by Taure; Family by Necessity by ArithmancerProof) linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower; The King's Indian Attack by Nectere)

Hopefully some of these are new to you!
