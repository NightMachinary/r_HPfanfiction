I used to think that too until I expanded my horizon and started to explore different areas. Here's a list of rec:

linkffn(the Nightmare Man) and its prequel, linkffn(Birth of a Nightmare Man) (Dark, Master of Death Harry)

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux) (sequel: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Chrysalis))

Someone else recommended it but the "Like None Other" serie is an amazing Severitus fanfiction.

linkffn(In Blood Only)

linkffn(Circular Reasoning)

linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good)

linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning)

linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh)

linkffn(Itachi, Is that a baby?)

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) and every one of its spin-offs

linkffn(Keep Your Enemies Closer)

linkffn(Equilibrium)

linkffn(The Havoc Side of The Force)

linkffn(Blood Crest)

Non-Harry centric: linkffn(Memorium)
