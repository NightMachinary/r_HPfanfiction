As others have stated do some posts with specific things you're looking for and someone will probably have at least one thing. I enjoyed the linkffn(princess of the blacks) series and the linkao3(Sarcasm and Slytherin) series. The sarcasm and Slytherin series is in the fifth book and ongoing. One other thing I'd recommend is be willing to look at crossovers as some are pretty good. One ongoing that I've enjoyed is linkffn(heroes assemble)
