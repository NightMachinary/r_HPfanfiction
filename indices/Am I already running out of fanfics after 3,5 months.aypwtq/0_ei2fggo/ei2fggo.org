There are probably a significant number of good fics still out there. They just get harder and harder to find.

Have you considered that your standards may be higher than when you started reading Naruto fics, so less and less stories are appealing?

10 hours per day is a /lot/. There's no way you kept that pace up reading high quality Naruto fanfics for 2-3 years.
