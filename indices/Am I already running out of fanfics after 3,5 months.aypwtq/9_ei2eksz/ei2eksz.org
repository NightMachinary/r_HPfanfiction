It's hard to say considering I don't know what you've already read. Aspen's Like None Other series is by far my favourite, though it was written before HBP. It has great characterization and near 1.5 million words and still ongoing. I read it at least twice a year. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061]]
