I'm using a hack of RISUS, this simple d6 system that lets the players be in control of their character progression. It's usually pretty loose but I have a set of rules for it to be more concrete. For instance you will have a stat for your Hogwarts House and you'll get to choose a Hogwarts class for another stat.
