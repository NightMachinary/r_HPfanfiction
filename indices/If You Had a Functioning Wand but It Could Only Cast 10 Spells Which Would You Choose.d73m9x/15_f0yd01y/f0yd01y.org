I'll assume you can cast those spells as many times as you want

1;accio

2;episkey

3;geminio

4;obliviate

5;legilimens

6;stupefy

7;reducto

8;silencio

9;the disillusionment charm

10;Imperio

Ok like imagine a school full of children ubder your command or the teachers

You could give yourself all A's and then just like make your boss give you his salary too or something

I will assume you can do the legilimens by just looking at someones eyes (if you have the wand with you) So that's reading minds

Accio is just useful

Reducto so i can break into places while disillusioned so that's two spells gone

We don't need rennervate because the stupefy will wear off at some point and we probably didn't stupefy them for no reason

Episkey just heals stuff pretty well

Geminio like omg just get an expensive diamond and then just copy it a few times and BOOM you're rich

Silencio so I can silence my steps and scare people

Just obliviate everyone after you've used magic on them

And that's it
