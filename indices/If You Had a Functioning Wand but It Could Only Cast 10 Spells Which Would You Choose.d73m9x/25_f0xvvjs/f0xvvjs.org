1.  Portus, the Portkey creation spell
2.  The Fidelius Charm
3.  Protego
4.  Protego Diabolica, the Spell Grindelwald uses at the end in Crimes of Grindelwald
5.  Imperio
6.  The memory modification Spell
7.  Confundus
8.  Legilimens
9.  Locomotor
10. Geminio

*Portus* lets me and anyone I choose to give a portkey instantly travel across the globe, the *Fidelius* and the *Protego* will protect me from pretty much any human threat, *Protego Diabolica* is by far the strongest offensive spell in the franchise and it even seems to be able to distinguish between friend and foe, its very useful for worst case scenarios, *the mind magic* will allow me to basically reshape Human society as I see fit , and force politicians globally to do things I want, like end all wars, start fighting climate change seriously, distribute resources better to guarantee as many people as possible decent standards of living, and probably a lot more, *Locomotor* and *Geminio* will both strongly help those goals long term since they allow the creation of lots of resources and lots of energy.

Edit: Why am I being downvoted? I am not complaining, but I am genuinely interested. Is it for my plan to save the world, or is because I used a spell from the Fantastic Beast movies?
