Assuming that I'm living in a muggle world you'd only need a few to be crazy powerful and have everything you'd need:

1.  Imperio
2.  Obliviate
3.  Pourtus (turns things into portkeys)
4.  Episkey
5.  Scourgify
6.  Stupfy
7.  Disillusionment charm
8.  Impervius (blocks objects like bullets for instance)
9.  Legilimens
10. Duplication spell

However, if you were in the wizarding world you'd need a lot of basics to just get by. More of your choices go into countering other wizards and Imperio is illegal. The same ten spells would barley get you anywhere.

1.  Finite
2.  Protego maxima
3.  Stupfy
4.  Expliamimus
5.  Legilimens
6.  Obliviate
7.  Duplication spell
8.  Episkey
9.  Disillusionment charm
10. Scourgify
