Assuming broad categories like 'transfiguration' don't count. And apparition doesn't use a wand.

Utility spells:

- Reductor Curse (destroy objects, obstructions, evidence and enemies)

- Summoning Charm (convenient, but can also work like 'point me' to find things you've lost or don't know)

Self-defense spells:

- Disillusionment (sadly, options for disguise and evasion are very limited)

- Stupefy (non-lethal alternative to Reducto)

'Break the laws of the universe' spells:

- Duplication Charm (this is MVP. Makes you rich, makes backups and copies of priceless objects)

- Flying Enchantment (Like the one on broomsticks or the Ford Anglia. Options for mobility are limited, but at least this one lets you fly.)

Mind magic:

- Legilimency (Mind-reading is always the best superpower. Legilimency does memories as well.)

- Imperius Curse (Immoral, but too useful not to include. Supersedes Alohomora and even doubles as an offensive spell.)

- Memory Charm (Ditto)

- False Memory Charm (Technically separate from the Memory charm, unfortunately, but its synergy with the other three spells means you have to include it. Can double as a clunky Confundus.)

...and now I'm on a list.
