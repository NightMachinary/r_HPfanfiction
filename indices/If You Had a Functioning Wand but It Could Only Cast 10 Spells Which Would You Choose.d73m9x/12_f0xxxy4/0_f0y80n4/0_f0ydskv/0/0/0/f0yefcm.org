Have you only watched the movies?

Harry used the curse three times in the books,

this is the first time

#+begin_quote
  Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before; he flung himself out

  from behind the fountain and bellowed, `Crucio!ʹ

  Bellatrix screamed: the spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe

  and shriek with pain as Neville had ‐ she was already back on her feet,

  breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again.

  Her counter‐spell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and

  landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor.

this is the second time.

  "Cruc -" yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the figure ahead

  illuminated in the dancing firelight, but Snape blocked the spell again. Harry

  could see him sneering.

and this is the third and most successful time.

  Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, “You shouldn't have done that.” As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!” The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. “I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, “you need to really mean it.”
