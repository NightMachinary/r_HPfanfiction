1.  Apparition (or Portus)
2.  Disillusionment
3.  Bombarda (or Reducto, not sure which would be better)
4.  +Episky (or better healing spell)+ The best healing spell available
5.  Stupefy
6.  Obliviate
7.  Legillimens
8.  Reparo
9.  Accio
10. Protego (depending on how well it could actually stop physical attacks) or Alohamora

Edit: I would go for Imperio but these all have a particular use for both combat and everyday life. I figure if you need to coerce someone you can just use destructive magic to get them to do what you want then Obliviate them afterward. I mean, if you *really* need to.
