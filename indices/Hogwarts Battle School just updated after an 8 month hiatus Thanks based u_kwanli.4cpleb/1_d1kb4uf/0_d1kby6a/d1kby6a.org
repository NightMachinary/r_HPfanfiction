If it helps, the reading can be broken into the natural arcs of the story. Book 1 can be broken up into three sections, Chapters 1-8, Chapters 9-17, Chapters 18-24. Book 2 can also be broken up into three arcs - Chapters 27-36, Chapters 37-45, Chapters 46-end of Book 2.

Book 2, especially, sprawls a bit more than Book 1 so breaking them up into chunks helps if you want stop reading for a while without forgetting the major plot points.
