The funny part is that I had this chapter ready about 6 months ago, but I wanted to wait to release it with the rest of the chapters ending Book 2.

Unfortunately, life got in the way and I haven't had the chance to finish the rest of Book 2 until now. So as I got closer to finishing Book 2 and sending it to my beta, I posted this update to apologize for the hiatus. Hopefully everything is back on schedule.
