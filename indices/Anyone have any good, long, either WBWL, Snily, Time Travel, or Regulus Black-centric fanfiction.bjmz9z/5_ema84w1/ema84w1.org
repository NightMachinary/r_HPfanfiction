Snily, linkffn(If Someone Cared Enough by Shain-of-Ireland). Just got up to the end of what's written for that one.

Also Snily, but it's been a while since I read it. Has good OCs. Linkao3(The Road Not Taken by kellydofc)

If Someone Cared Enough can be pretty preachy at times, but comes from a good place. It's definitely got a modern feminist strain to it. I find the OCs likeable, even though they are the primary preachers. There's some you're/your problems I've noticed, but the storyline more than makes up for it, imo.

Both are WIPs.
