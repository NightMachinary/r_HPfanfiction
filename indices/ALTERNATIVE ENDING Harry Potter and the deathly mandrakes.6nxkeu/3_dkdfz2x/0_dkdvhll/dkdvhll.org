If it came alive (or possessed) somebody like the diary did, then maybe! The container itself would probably not be affected (a horcrux can't hear unless it's possessing somebody or trying to gain a body IMHO, so as long as the horcrux doesn't do either of those things? Nope, I' don't think a mandrake would have any sort of effect!)
