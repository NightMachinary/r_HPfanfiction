Well, they could have given tons of them to SNAPE (disillusioned and silenced he could have planted them in the dark lord's headquarters...with a timed spell (or some kind of remote-release-spell) they could have been activated without him being in any danger!), to take the DEs out (might not have worked on Voldemort...or at best he would be disembodied again, but even that would help if he has no more servants left (set them off during a DE-Meeting and give Snape some protection and tell him to RUN, just in case Voldemort isn't incapacitated))

Yeah, I like such solutions because it's thinking outside the box! Most wizards only think of duelling when they think about fighting the dark lord (ok: scratch that, most think about surrendering probably!) directly, instead of trying to outsmart him or using remote methods of fighting (hell: Give Snape a freaking locator beacon to plant (I don't think Voldemort wards against muggle-radio-signals!) and then fire some cruise missiles at that location! Problem solved...for a while, now you can deal with the horcruxes at your leisure without DEs chasing you around and taking over the ministry etc.!)
