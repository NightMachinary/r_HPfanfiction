Ooooh yea. I suggest a dive into the Wikipedia section on Irreligion [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion]]

At a high level, you have Atheism ("God does not exist"), Agnosticism ("We do not know if God exists"), and Apatheism ("It doesn't matter if God exists"). All three have variants, and some variants are certainly mutually exclusive.

For example, Agnosticism has "Strong vs Weak" Agnosticism ("We cannot know if God exists" vs "We do not know now if God exists"), and "Atheistic vs Theistic vs Agnostic" Agnosticism ("We do not know for certain if God exists, but [he probably does] / [he probably doesn't] / [it doesn't matter]")

Edit: Actually, "I might believe" wouldn't be Agnosticism at all: It would be either a weak form of theism or possibly implicit/weak atheism.
