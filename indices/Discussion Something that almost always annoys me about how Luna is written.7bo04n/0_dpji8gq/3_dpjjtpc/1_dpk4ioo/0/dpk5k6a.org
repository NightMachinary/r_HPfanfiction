JKR remains adamant that the Crumple-Horned Snorkack doesn't exist, but has allowed for the possibility that maybe Luna discovered /some/ of the creatures that (nearly) everyone else thought were just fake when she was older. Evanna Lynch disagrees with JKR on this point and believes that the Snorkack is real (within the Potterverse, that is).

This raises an interesting point: how many people out there (besides the Lovegoods) actually believe what's in /The Quibbler/, and how many just read it for entertainment value? It must have a fairly high (pun intended) readership for Xeno to be able to live off of it.
