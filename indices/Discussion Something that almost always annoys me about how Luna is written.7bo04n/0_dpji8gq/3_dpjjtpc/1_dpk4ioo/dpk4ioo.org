E pretty much is what it is. Her dad is A, the nutter everyone has unfriended on Facebook, or at least unfollowed. Luna believed in it all because he's her dad, all she has, and if she accepts he's bonkers, then what does she have? She prefers to believe in the fairytales, because otherwise she has to face the truth. And she's too damaged to do that.

I believe word of god has it that she finally admitted perhaps her dad made some of them up, once she was an adult.
