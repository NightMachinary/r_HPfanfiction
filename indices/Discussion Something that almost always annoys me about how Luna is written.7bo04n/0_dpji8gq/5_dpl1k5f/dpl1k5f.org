Can't some of them be true and some of them not be true? The truth seems to be somewhere between Luna (too accepting) and Hermione's (if its not in a book its not true) views.

I think Luna does know that she's odd. Which is something I can definitely relate to. You can't easily turn off who you are. She just seems to have come to a resigned acceptance of it. There's a bit of using the fantastical creatures as a coping mechanism though and some of it I think is just her trusting her dad too much.
