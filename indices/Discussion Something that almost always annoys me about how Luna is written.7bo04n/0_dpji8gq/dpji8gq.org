Luna is a character designed to be no more than a side character. Any kind of close examination ruins her because it forces you to abandon ambiguity to actually commit to either:

A. The stories are false but Luna really believes in them, in which case she's that person you deleted off Facebook because they kept talking about energy healing and chemtrails.

OR

B. The stories are false but Luna doesn't really believe in them anyway, in which case she's some kind of sociopath.

OR

C. The stories are true, Luna believes in them, but they are some kind of code and Luna has mystical powers.

OR

D. The stories are true, Luna believes in them, they are literally true and the HP universe is high on meth.

And here's the thing: none of these options are satisfying.
