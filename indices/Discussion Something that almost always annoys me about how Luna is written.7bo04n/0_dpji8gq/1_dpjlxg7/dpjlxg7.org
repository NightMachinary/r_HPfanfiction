Canon mostly support A: she do believe in her story, probably because her father is the hardcore conspiracy theorist and she had only him after she saw her mother die (and probably never had any counseling); you don't delete her from facebook because in the end, she doesn't really care whether you believe or not, she just want you to have the 'good' info and respects your liberty of thought. More like the good friend you just have to keep separate from her conspiracy theories when talking with.\\
But, well.... who says that the HP universe is not high on meth? (see : valentine Dwarves, Canon fans, brains in a jar,...)
