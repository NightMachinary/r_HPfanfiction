Some people are more sensitive to drugs, aren't they? Or maybe, the different types of magic they surround themselves with affect them - Xeno eats and drinks some very strange things, and Sybil a)is a Seer, so already has naturally different magic(or different way of channeling it, depending on whether magic comes from within, or from external sources), and b)surrounds herself with heavy incense, and drinks a lot of tea and cheap sherry.
