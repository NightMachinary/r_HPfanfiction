You are correct, I was referring to Hermione's fanon catchphrase. You know, the 'Harry removes glasses, no one recognizes him' trope.

Really, when you think about it, Snape's logic puzzle was redundant. Surely a wizard would know how to identify nettle wine! And identifying the other potions surely wouldn't be harder than a game of chess, or key catching, or a troll.
