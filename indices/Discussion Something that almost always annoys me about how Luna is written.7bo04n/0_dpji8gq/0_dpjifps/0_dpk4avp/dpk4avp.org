What if....magic literally makes you high? That's why wizards don't have logic, they're basically high from birth. Obliviate doesn't literally remove memories, it just gets you blackout high for a short period, resulting in memory loss. That's why muggles seem...less smart and overwhelmed when exposed to the wizarding world - they're affected a lot more strongly because they're unused to it. That's why Harry barely noticed his best friend's parents that time in Diagon - they were basically high the entire time.

It's also why they eat so much.
