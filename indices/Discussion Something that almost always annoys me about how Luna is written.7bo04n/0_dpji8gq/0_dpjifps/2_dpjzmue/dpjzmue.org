The only story I know of that has an interesting case of Luna's creatures being real is Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin. Linkffn(11191235).

Spoiler: [[/spoiler][It's heavily implied that Luna actually has some ultra rare and useful magical perception ability, and it's a big problem because the Unspeakables are very interested in people with this ability. Interested, as in, let's disappear them and figure out how they work. It's also connected directly to Luna's mother's death.]]
