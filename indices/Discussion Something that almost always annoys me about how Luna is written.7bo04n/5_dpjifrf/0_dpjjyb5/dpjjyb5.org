It's actually quite easy when you think about it. Hermione's the type of person to require proof before believing it exists. She isn't the person who'll just accept the existence of a creature like a snorkack without multiple points of reference in books, through eyewitness accounts, etc. Luna's the exact opposite. She doesn't need that, just the simple belief in her mind that it actually does exist. That's why the two of them often clash.
