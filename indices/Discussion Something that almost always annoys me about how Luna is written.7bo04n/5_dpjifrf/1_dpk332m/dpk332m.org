Luna doesn't just believe in those creatures in a vacuum. When trying to decide if something is true taking the source into account is important and someone who gets most of their knowledge from a tabloid that talks about government officials cooking goblins in pies is a big red flag. There's such a thing as being so open minded your brains fall out. I like Luna but do not blame Hermione at all for treating what she says as rubbish.
