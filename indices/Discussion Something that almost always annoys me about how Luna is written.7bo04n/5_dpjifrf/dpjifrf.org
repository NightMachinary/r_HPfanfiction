I still don't understand why is she treated like a crazy person because of those creatures. Especially Hermione's reaction against her. How can she be so stupid? A few years ago, she wouldn't have been aware about magic, now she can consider that those creature exist. I'm not saying that those creatures exist but people shouldn't be convinced that they don't exist either, especially not in the effing magical world.
