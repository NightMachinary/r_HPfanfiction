How is it Luna's fault if her house is gaining up on her and bullying her? Have you ever been bullied? Going to a teacher doesn't stop it. It often makes it worse. Being bullied in a boarding school would be even more terrible. You don't even get to go home at night and feel safe.

I don't really care how she's been portrayed in fanfics... I'm not going to let that change my opinion of her from canon.
