A Luna who is actually socially inept and delusional is not fun to write or read about. She'd be a charity case to feel sorry for. The only reason to ship her with Harry in the books was because she had room for growth.

If Luna's character growth stopped at the end of book 5 she'd be incredibly boring. If she was made normal she'd be incredibly boring. Giving her eccentricity a good reason, or explaining her tortured childhood, or giving her "the sight" are all ways to expand her character and make her interesting to the reader AND the author.
