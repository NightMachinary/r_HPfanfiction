I think [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1075603/chapters/5542160][this particular chapter of Tomorrowland]] might appeal to both you and OP, as Harry /does/ talk with Luna about her beliefs here. I'm sure you've seen this fic recommended before, and don't worry: it's a collection of linked one-shots, so this chapter can be read on its own. But the whole collection is great.

Key line: "Looking up at Luna now, Harry felt like he suddenly understood her in a way he never had before. He wasn't sure how much she really believed in the existence of heliopaths, nargles, wrackspurts or any of the other creatures she talked about. What she believed in was the possibility of them."

I think Luna definitely has some childhood trauma, but I don't think she's mentally ill. /Xeno/ might be, but I think Luna has a bit more to her character than that. One of my thoughts has always been that Luna represents the ability to have faith in something and to look at the world through a more spiritual lens, whereas Hermione is 100% calculated scientific reasoning.

Luna isn't some mystic seer, but she also isn't crazy. Tbh, I'm a bit sorry for OP that their image of Luna has changed over the years, as that indicates they have lost some of their own sense of childlike wonder...
