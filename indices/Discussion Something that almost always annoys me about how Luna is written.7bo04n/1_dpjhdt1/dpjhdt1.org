Ive seen this post before I think. While characterization of Luna as if she is some kind of a sage is completely OOC, She is wiser beyond her years. Luna is that kid at school that everyone thinks is weird because of the things she does and says. But Luna is a kind person who loves her friends and because she doesn't obsess over being accepted by the kids at school, she often offers insight beyond her years. That's how JK Rowling built that character and that's something FF writers have never been able to do properly. She's a much more subtle character than most FF writers are capable of writing.
