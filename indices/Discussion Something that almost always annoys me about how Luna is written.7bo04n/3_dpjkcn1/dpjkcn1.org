I love Luna Lovegood, she's one of my favorite characters in the series but I will admit that it is very difficult to write her, I have done it and I have hopefully kept her in character, or as in character as possible. But upon saying that it is difficult.

So I can see why people have trouble writing her, even though it does irk me when she's crazier then she is in canon or all about mythical creatures or is seen as a seer or other similar such nonsense.

Luna is socially awkward, making others around her uncomfortable with the things she says. But she is quite perspective. She talked to Harry after Sirius' death, she was able to realize that it was Harry under the Polyjuice Potion.

She does have her theories, but she is very smart. She's kind of like the opposite of Hermione though, Hermione only believes in facts and the like while Luna is willing to believe in her theories and her magical creatures. It's a nice contrast.

TLDR: Overall Luna is perspective, smart in a different way then Hermione, and isn't afraid to say what's on her mind even if others don't believe in what she does.
