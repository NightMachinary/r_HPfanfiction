Yup definitely agree with you there. As much as I love Hermione, Luna as a character has always fascinated me because she seems like a rule breaker, but not in the sense that she would be doing it to make anyone mad or anything, just because she liked how she was doing it.

So yeah I could definitely see her doing things in class that would get most people in trouble, but her being Luna, didn't mean any malice behind anything.
