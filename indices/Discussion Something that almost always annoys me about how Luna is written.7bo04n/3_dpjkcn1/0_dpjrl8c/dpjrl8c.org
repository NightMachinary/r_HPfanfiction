  She does have her theories, but she is very smart. She's kind of like the opposite of Hermione though, Hermione only believes in facts and the like while Luna is willing to believe in her theories and her magical creatures. It's a nice contrast.

I cannot agree with your characterisation of Hermione.

Hermione believes in authority. That's why she is so focussed on finding her answers in books and teachers over her own experiences. Throughout the series she has to learn the hard way that "fit to print" does not equal factual correctness and that even in people in positions of trust and authority truth takes a back seat to agenda.

And this also colours her relation to Luna. We have seen again and again that Hermione has a hard time accepting things that contradict the established narrative and Luna pushes a narrative that diverges from any other one available to Hermione.
