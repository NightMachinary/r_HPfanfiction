I'm currently reading Pet Project; I tend to stay away from Severus/Hermione stories and Hermione in romantic pairings in general just because writers tend to write Hermione as perfect and she is anything but perfect, one of the reasons why I love the Harry Potter Series, no one is perfect.

Well anyway I'm reading it and I'm really liking how the author is writing Hermione, it's very believable and is even dealing with some of her issues that she has; for instance raising her hand at every question, writing way more in an essay that is needed ect extra. I'm really liking what the author is doing with not only Hermione but Severus as well. Nothing romantic has happened yet; which is nice, I like a slow burn when it comes to romance stories, feels more realistic.

Again I normally stay away from Severus/Hermione because it's not my cup of tea (no offense to anyone who likes the pairing of course). But I'm really liking it so far and the author seems to have Hermione's and even Snape's personality down pretty well which is a relief. I don't know how the romance part of it will come about, but it has me interested I suggest trying it out if you haven't yet, but up to you of course.
