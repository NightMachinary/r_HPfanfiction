Imagine if every single thing's existence depended on people's belief in it? The world would be a far smaller place.

In all seriousness, Luna is a brilliant character. She's one of a small group that likes Harry for being Harry, not saving the world, or for being famous. She's dependable, always there when Harry needs her, and is quite empathetic (in a human, not supernatural way).

I don't think she needs to change and neither does Harry. Not even a little bit. I think the writers who change her by giving her super powers ruin the awesomeness that it is Luna Lovegood. JK writing her was letting the world know that it's okay to be weird, and believe in whatever you want, and yes there are people out there who will appreciate you regardless. And you shouldn't waste your time on those who don't.
