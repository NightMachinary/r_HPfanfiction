I never actually liked Luna that much in canon, and can tolerate a fic only if she's a really minor character precisely for this reason. I think the problem is that she's "untouchable", she is perceived as being a good person and infallible under any circumstances. The other problem (in my opinion) is our society actually - we came to the point that criticizing any faults in other person is wrong, and these faults are being called life choices. People are not encouraged to change; in fact, today social interactions are about acceptance and safe spaces and 'always be yourself', 'no -something- shaming' and all that stuff. So there is a sort of taboo on pointing out flaws in other people. I think authors just feel good about themselves when they seem to accept Luna despite her weirdness.

The other thing is that she is almost always written as not having emotions - just staring mysteriously or saying something about nargles or whatever. She is not relatable and she never has any character development so I say (once again) she is just providing a way for the authors to point out how their main characters are good and accepting.
