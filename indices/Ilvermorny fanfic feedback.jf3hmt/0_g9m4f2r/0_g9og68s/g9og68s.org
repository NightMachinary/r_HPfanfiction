Thanks for the feedback. I have no idea why it wouldn't let me respond yesterday. I will try my best to work of the issues and make the story overall more enjoyable.

I also understand the grammatical issues. They haven't often been a problem but I know if I were to ever want to turn writing into a career it's best to fix them now. But in the meantime if you know of any programs or people who would go over them with me (preferably free) I'd appreciate it.

I'm glad that the story is coming across vividly and not over descriptive. I have trouble with that as well. I thank you again for your time.
