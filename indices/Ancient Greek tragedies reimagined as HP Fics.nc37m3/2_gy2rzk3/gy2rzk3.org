Well... the battle of Hogwarts is quite similar to the Illiad where several beloved characters die during the siege of Hogwarts. It doesn't really have the same outcome as the Illiad though, but - and I know the author is very hated these days - in the "Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness", the siege of Hogwarts is far more tragic than what we see in DH.

Edit: and all still because a man couldn't keep it in his pants and a woman responded well to his advances... namely James and Lily.
