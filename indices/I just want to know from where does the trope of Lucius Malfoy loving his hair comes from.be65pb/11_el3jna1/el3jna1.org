I'd imagine from COS movie onwards.

Iirc JK didn't initially envisage Lucius with /long/ blonde hair, it was a decision of the actor. Then naturally if you're an author, your character with waist length hair that no-one else in the universe has, must have that hair for a reason and that reason is likely to be a personal preference.

Altho now I want to read an AU where Lucius has long hair for some other legal or magical reason and it isn't a personal choice at all. Draco turns 17 and is magically bound to keep growing his hair out and enlists Hermione to find a way to break the magical contract bc he just doesn't think it goes with his image :')
