I'll have to reread the chapter when I'm off work later to be sure. Again, I'm working on a decade or so old memory.

I also just realized I didnt even answer your question. I feel that since a patronus is based on your personality and behavior, simply switching bodies would change what the patronus would be. So after the switch, Person A, in the body of Person B, would still produce whatever Person A's patronus was before the switch.
