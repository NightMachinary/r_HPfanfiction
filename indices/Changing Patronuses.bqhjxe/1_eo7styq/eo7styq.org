In my headcanon, the Patronus (and Fidelius, AK) charms are unique in interacting directly with the soul. A bodyswapped person keeps his original animal guardian (and Secret Keeper position).

If your Patronus is inherited from a loved one, their soul has imprinted on you to the point where even their death doesn't fully remove them from the living realm. This is why the Resurrection Stone "ghosts" was aware of what was going on with Harry; James could watch over him from the other side whenever he wished.
