I am pretty sure that, in canon, Patronus are linked to the soul. Patronus take a form that has a meaning for the caster, something strong (and probably safe).

Dumbledore's patronus is a phoenix (and probably even Fawkes), Harry's is a representation of his father, Snapes is a doe (because it was Lily's, or because he knew that James is a deer and she was his wife, no idea), and Tonks in a wolf (or a werewold, for Lupin).\\
We also know that Patronus can change (as with Tonk, we don't know what was her first form, but it was not a wolf).

So, in case a person A swap body with a person B, I believe the patronus would either be form A, or a form C because swapping body influenced him enough to change his form. But I see no reason why his patronus should take form B.
