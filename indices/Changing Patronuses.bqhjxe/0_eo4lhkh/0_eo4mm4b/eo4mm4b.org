I believe Tonks' original Patronus was a jackrabbit. Lily apparently always had a doe, because they were "made for each other". Bleh.

And yes, that's pretty much my thinking as well. - Though I'm not sure any description specifically says soul, hence the question. Patronuses also defend against other things that don't consume souls. Still, they may have to have something else influence the form.
