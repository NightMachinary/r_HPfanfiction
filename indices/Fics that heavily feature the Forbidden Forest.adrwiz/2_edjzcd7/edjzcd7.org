There's one of my favorites from ye olden days, linkffn(Hidden by eQuasarus). Now that guy could write a mean AU, his fics were wonderfully unique, with a tone I haven't really seen replicated. A sort of rough, plain, in your face prose, that was paradoxically, also pretty lyrical and evocative. Or I may be remembering with rose-tinted glasses. Also full of wonderful extrapolations for magical effects.

Anyway, from what I recall, this story features Harry running away from the Dursleys before Hogwarts and ending up in the Forbidden Forest. Harry decides that, given how negative his experiences with humans have been thus far, he must stop being human and become a wolf. Now even in the wizarding world this sort of thing would result in confinement in a mental ward, but because of Harry's absolute belief that he is a wolf, his magic slowly begins to adapt to this belief. He begins to "commune" with the other creatures in the forest and his magic gradually works to sharpen his senses, movement and strength. Eventually the wizards figure it out and try to lure him to their world, so there's some fuckery there.

Ofc it's abandoned, but I think it's worth a read-through regardless.
