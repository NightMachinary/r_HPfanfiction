apparently. this sub was my first real introduction to harry potter fanfiction and that's probably a good thing. Had I tried just from Ao3 or something I'd probably be dissillusioned from the whole thing. I get the appeal of pairing enemies together but if I have to read another Harry/Draco or Harry/Tom Riddle, I'll tear my eyes out.
