I'm afraid not. I corresponded with her in 2009, when she let me know that the site was not advertised anywhere; she just put it up for herself and a few friends.

Because of that, she was curious how I ran across the site.

I found it serendipitously, by searching on uncommon (in the general population) or secondary character name pairs that would indicate a specific cross, such as using Hermione and Nabiki in hopes of finding a Ranma 1/2 - Harry Potter cross, or Ranma and Hotaru for a Ranma 1/2 - Sailor Moon cross.
