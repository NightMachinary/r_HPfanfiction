In the first year he does not get made a seeker and Hermione has to turn her back so that Ron doesn't feel intimidated by people seeing him attempting to catch the flying key.

In his second year, he is, as you said, immune to the eyes of the basilisk, however he'd have to rely on his other senses in order to defeat it. Also he would only learn about the diary towards the end because earlier on he wouldn't pay attention to something that he cannot see or read.

In his third year, he cannot see the boggart so might have a harder time to learn the Patronus (actually that would make it quite an interesting story since the Patronus relies so heavily on visualizing your happiest memory). He would also not see his future self and confuse himself with his father, so he might act faster during the Dementor attack.

In his fourth year, Crouch-Moody might indeed allow Harry to use his eye-piece to give him an unfair advantage in the Triwizard Tournament. Harry would also use it look through Cho's robes.

In his fifth year, I wonder whether he could see through Voldemort's eyes. If he couldn't, he would be unable to save Mr. Weasley, but on the brighter side, he would not see the fake vision of Sirius getting tortured in the Hall of Prophecies so probably Voldemort would have to go by himself and risk exposure or find another way to lure Harry in. Also no Occlumency lessons with Snape. Also the Ministry would make fun of him because he could not technically say he saw Voldemort return.

In his sixth year he would have quite some trouble reading the Prince's instructions to worm his way into Slughorn's heart and win the Felix Felicis. So it would be more difficult convincing him to share his Horcrux memory.

In the seventh book, it would give Snape a harder time guiding Harry to the Sword of Gryffindor and, assuming that Dumbledore chose earlier to familiarize Harry with his and Voldemort's past verbally instead of taking him into the Pensieve, Snape would need to find another way to communicate to Harry that he's the final Horcrux. Also it would be rather sad that he never gets to see his parents.
