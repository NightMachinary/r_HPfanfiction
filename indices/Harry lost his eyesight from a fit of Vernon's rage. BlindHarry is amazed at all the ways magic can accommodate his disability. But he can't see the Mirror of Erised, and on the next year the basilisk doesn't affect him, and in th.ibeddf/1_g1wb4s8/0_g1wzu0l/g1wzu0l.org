That's a movie thing, the gang find “Scabbers” at Hagrid's and Sirius ambushes them; Lupin was the one to see everything on the map, and then (the idiot) /left the map open on his desk/ - and there's no way of knowing that Sirius would be exonerated for killing Pettigrew. Malfoy and company would never let Sirius have a fair trial.
