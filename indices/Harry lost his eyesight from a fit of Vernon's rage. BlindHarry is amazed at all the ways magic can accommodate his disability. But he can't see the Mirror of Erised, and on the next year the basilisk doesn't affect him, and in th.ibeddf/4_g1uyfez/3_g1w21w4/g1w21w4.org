Ah yes, the dementor arc. Doesn't advance the voldemort storyline and instead spends the whole book playing around with Harry's dad's school mates, adding more faces to fit into the confusing prequel scene in book 1.

Not to mention, the three new characters are kind of a mixed bag as well. Remus Lupin is kind of bland and so retires easily into a background character. Sirius is off the map until his own little arc comes around in book 5 which ends with his death (what?)

Peter Pettigrew's reveal as a villain, a set up that actually paid off, seems like the only /really/ plot-revelant stuff going on.

I think anyone who has POA as their favourite book probably watched the anime first
