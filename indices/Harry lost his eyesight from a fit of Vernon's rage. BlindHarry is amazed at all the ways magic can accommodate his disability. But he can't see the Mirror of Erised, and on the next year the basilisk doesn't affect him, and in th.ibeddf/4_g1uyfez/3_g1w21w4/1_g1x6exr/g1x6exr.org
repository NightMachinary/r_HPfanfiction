While Book 3 is not my favorite in the series, I do think it plays a significant role because it kind of sets up the events for the rest of the series. I always thought Books 1 and 2 can be read as standalones (and if I recall correctly JK said that that was the intent in case the books were unsuccessful), but from Book 3 on, the whole series ties together.

I agree that there are some irrelevant plots to the overall story such as the Buckbeak arc or Lupin or even Trelawney (yeah she made the prophecies but otherwise she's as relevant to the plot as Bob Ogden, Mrs. Cole or Hepzibah Smith). However it gives some background to Harry's family, it introduces Sirius who plays a major part later on in showing Harry's acceptance of death and the first glimpse of why Harry's love overpowered Voldemort and the fact that Harry's greatest fear are Dementors is a good indirect characterization of his personality.

Edit: on the same note, you can argue that the lessons with Dumbledore were nothing but a plot device to give some background to Voldemort's past because the only relevant memories to the plot were Hockey's and Slughorn's in order to find out what the Horcruxes looked like and their number.
