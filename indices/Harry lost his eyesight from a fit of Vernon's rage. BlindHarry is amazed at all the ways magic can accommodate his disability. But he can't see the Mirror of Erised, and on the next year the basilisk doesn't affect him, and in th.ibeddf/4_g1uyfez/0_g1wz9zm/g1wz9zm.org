There's a little cycle in books 1-6.

1 and 4: Voldemort is trying to regain a body in a convoluted way involving a minion at Hogwarts. Harry survives due to rare magic that Dumbledore explains at the end. There's dragons in both, and Harry sees an illusion of his parents.

2 and 5: Harry is ostracized by the wizarding world, a Horcrux is causing all sorts of problems for Harry, there's a real big snake, and Harry comes face to face with Voldemort - only surviving due to Dumbledore's intervention.

3 and 6: we learn a lot about past events that will shape the current war, Voldemort never makes an actual appearance in the book, there's a werewolf involved in the climax confrontation, and there's a big twist at the end that changes how we view a character.

Just something I noticed that I think is neat.
