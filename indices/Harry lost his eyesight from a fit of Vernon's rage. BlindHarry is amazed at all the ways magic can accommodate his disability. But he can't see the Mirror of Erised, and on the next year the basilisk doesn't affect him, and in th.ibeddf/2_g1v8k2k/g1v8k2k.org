Similar to Blindness, I believe once he is blind his days at Dursleys would be relatively better, and he can totally develop a sonar of sorts.

Also, it'd be rather that Dumbledore or someone else would think of a magical eye/s as soon as they find out he is blind.

Lot of things will change, with Harry seeing Voldemort on the back of Quirrel's head. But let's say Voldemort keeps a low profile and does not emerge out till the end.

In second year, yeah the eye/s will help with the basilisk. Third year pretty much the same.

Fourth year, maybe he can try to connect with 'moody' due to similar experiences and realize he's not who he seems to be?

Not much change really if he gets a magical eye.
