Indeed. [[/u/Macallion]] , [[/u/ThePurityofChaos]] , I think you're both right. There's a literal Portrait of a Large Pile of Ash that makes a cameo in linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), but what ThePurityofChaos is remembering appears to be the fact that I also penned a sequel to /Harry Potter and the Portrait of What Looked Like a Large Pile of Ash/ itself, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Rest of Sentence).

And incidentally, yes, I know, neither story has been updated in a garishly long time. Real life calls, as does original writing. But I'll get back into it /someday/.
