I think the community is too small to sustain 20+ different subreddits. They'd all be dead. I feel it would be more worth our time to make this sub a space were anyone can share their pairing of choice.

I believe that the sub has largely achieved this as I personally haven't seen anyone attacking others for their requests.

It's *fan*fiction for Merlin's sake. Let people enjoy what they want.
