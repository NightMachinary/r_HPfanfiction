I like some Drarry, but it is hard to find good ones - a lot of the characterization is awful. And what is with the feminization? And there has to be some work to redeem Draco, generally. I love most of Vorabiza's stuff. And Keira Marcos' two Drarry fics (and the incomplete Harry/Hermione/Draco one, which is fantastic, though currently taken down until she finishes it).

There are a few Harry/Ron ones I like - mostly Shedoc. I'm willing to read mostly anything, though I generally prefer Harry with his yearmates, or maybe an older Weasley brother. I don't really care for Snarry, with Sirius seems incestuous, Remus - no, still too old. Even the idea of Cedric doesn't really appeal, though I'd try a strong rec.
