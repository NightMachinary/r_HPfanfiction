I really like Remus/Sirius because with a few tweaks it could actually be canon and it wouldn't affect the plot at all. And it just ups the angsty reconciliation in POA if they were former boyfriends as well. Heck, I think Remus might actually be a little relieved to be attracted to men since he has so many hang ups about possibly transferring his lycanthropy to his child in-utero. (Of course, his attraction to men is one more thing to hide from the world...)
