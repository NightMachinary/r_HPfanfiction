big fan of femHarry/Hermione. Holly Evans started that way but that sneaky Tonks.... Effects and Side effects would be much improved by a focus on my otp, but harem..

would love some recs..

Jamie Evans (Fate's Fool?) is good, also Tonks. Ashes of Magic is good but no updates and it quits before much of anything happens.

It's hard to find a good mix of fluff and fight scenes.

Oh, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4752228/Philosophize]] does well, she doesn't tickle my fancy particularly but she's good for nice consistent updates, decent writing skills..

I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1751050/Poetheather1]] writes some good stuff and has even published in the real world.

The Miss Potter community is active and the list is huge, worth poking around.

I'm not much for male slash and absolutely won't do light/dark stuff.. Harry/LV or poor Hermione/every scumbag in the potterverse.. sometimes all at once.. I can see the challenge of writing it so it works, but ick.. Speaking of ick.. Has anyone seen a Hermione/Umbridge? I've not..
