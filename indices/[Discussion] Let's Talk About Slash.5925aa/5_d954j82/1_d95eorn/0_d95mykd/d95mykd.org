There's two Harry/Cedric stories I've liked.

The first fic in this series involves Harry using a time turner to go back and save Cedric. [[http://amalthia.mediawood.net/ebooks/viewseries.php?seriesid=29]]

There's a rec list on this Reddit too: [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2fuocu/any_good_harrycedric_fanfictions/?client=safari]]
