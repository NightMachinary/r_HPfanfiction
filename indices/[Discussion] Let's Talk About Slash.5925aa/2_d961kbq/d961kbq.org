I have a definitive "type" when it comes to shipping, which is doomed couples. It explains why I love reading/writing angst so much.

I've tried Harry/Draco but, for the most part, it leaves me cold; I've read Harry/Ron, which works for me. But my first love in this fandom and the one I read above all others is Remus/Sirius (who were my first slash ship).

I will read almost anything with Remus/Sirius as a primary pairing, but my favourite tropes are post-Azkaban and post-moon hurt/comfort.

I've too many favourites to name them all, but some of them are Linkao3(313895; 1061211; 7064644; 7288462)
