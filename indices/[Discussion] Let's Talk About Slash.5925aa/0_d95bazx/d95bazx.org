I love Deamus and have vague plans to write them one day. I have also written a femmeslash Padma/Astoria (so realistically two OCs). But many popular pairings, like Remus/Sirius or Drarry, I dislike for characterisation reasons, which is a shame. I'd love to see more honest, genuine slash, and tend to find that this is usually written with minor characters.
