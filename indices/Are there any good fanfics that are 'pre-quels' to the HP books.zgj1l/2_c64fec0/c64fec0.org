I'll be back with links...

So, I apparently went through and decided to delete most of my saved/Favorited stories. This is unfortunate, and I'm sorry if I got you excited about it. I'll make note of any ones I do find, though, and pass them onto you.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1226706/1/][Paradox of Existance]] is a Harry travels back in time and meets his parents with a fairly interesting look into Lily, James, Sirius, Remus, and Snape. It is also HP/SS slash, so I'm not sure how you feel about that.

Edit: second and third paragraphs.
