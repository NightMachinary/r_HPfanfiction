The traveler depositing the money doesn't matter, but eventually it /will/ be. They buy something and that shopkeeper deposits it at the end of the day.

And yes, again, I'm not suggesting that the data entry be done manually. Merely suggesting it's not out of the realm of possibility that the goblins, who have their own form of magic which apparently makes them good at specializing for banking, may have some kind of system that records them automatically. :)

None of this is canon, obviously, but neither is the time travel fics that I'm referring to, either. :p
