Ok true I'll concede that point but to totally get nitpicky, when would the goblins handle your gold to get an accurate look at the serial number? The way banking works in the series is you show up, go to your vault, put your coins in a bag, leave. At no time is a goblin going to know which serial numbers you've taken out. Let's say galleon serial number X237PL exists in the Malfoy vault. Draco couldve grabbed that galleon for school supplies or Lucius could've grabbed it to bribe Fudge with. How are the goblins or anyone else to know that they grabbed that specific galleon or one of their other 5 million?

And all of this is ignoring the fact that every time travel/alternate dimension fic I've read where they bring shit with them has them simply keep it on them at all times. I've never once seen a traveler redeposit the money. And once you buy something it's no longer you who is depositing it and a business isn't likely to remember which customer gave you which galleon. Therefore making it hard to trace back to you even if that business then goes to a goblin teller and has them deposit the gold for them.
