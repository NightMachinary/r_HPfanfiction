So I think it needs to be said that in order for a galleon to be caught as counterfeit, someone would have to know for a fact that a galleon with the same exact serial number is elsewhere when looking at the duplicate galleon. And no one will ever know that. The odds of being caught on serial number duplication alone is so infinitesimaly small it's not worth considering.
