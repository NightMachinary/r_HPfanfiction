That's not how it works...

I'm willing to concede that the original 8 movies aren't canon, as they are adaptations that did miss things out due, naturally, to cinematic constraints. But movies such as Fantastic Beasts or plays such as Cursed Child are most decidedly canon. They were sanctioned and approved by Rowling pre-production. Therefore, they are an accepted part of the world building. Hell even her interviews and twitter posts (or other WoG's) are supposed to be considered canon.

We may not like it and not use it as canon due to the contradictions (Rowling was still an amateur when she wrote the first four books after all), but it doesn't change the fact that it IS canon.
