  You could read Hermione's paranoia as simply paranoia over breaking rather serious laws regarding time turners.

Well, logically there would only be a law against changing the past if it was possible to do. But in any case, it's quite clear from the text that it's magically possible:

  “No!” said Hermione in a terrified whisper. “Don't you understand? We're breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen ---”

  [...]

  “Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened when wizards have meddled with time... Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mistake!”

What Harry and Hermione do in PoA is time travel according to the Ministry-approved method (not changing the past). But it's always been canon that changing the past is possible.
