The PoA book was at least consistent with not being able to change the timeline, and the fact that Harry saw his future self's Patronus is a big hint towards this being the case. He didn't change the timeline, but instead fulfilled the timeline he already saw. Of course, the PoA movie makes this much clearer. You could read Hermione's paranoia as simply paranoia over breaking rather serious laws regarding time turners. JKR didn't contradict any of this until her Pottermore post on it, which explicitly said they /could/ change the past, and which I think broke time turners nearly as much as Cursed Child did.
