I can easily see Goblin having some kind of database of Galleons/identified items although likely not instantaneous?

It could be with a hell of a lot of magic ingrained into Galleons and spells which register the arrival and location of the Galleon when it comes into the bank.

An easier but less instantaneous method would involve Goblins transcribing the serial number or identifying way into a group of magically linked books that contain a list of where every Galleon is (,be it in a vault or withdrawn by Specific person from x vault). They could do this while the person is in the bank or after they leave (easier).

I can definitely see Goblins having some kind of method to keep track.
