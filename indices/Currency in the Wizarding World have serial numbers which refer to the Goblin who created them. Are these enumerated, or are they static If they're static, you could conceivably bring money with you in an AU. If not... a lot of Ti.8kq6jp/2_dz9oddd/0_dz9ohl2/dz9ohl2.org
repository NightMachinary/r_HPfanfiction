I believe it's been stated that Goblins have a way of tracing counterfeit coins. It'd make sense that coins of their own creation would make tracking the originator even easier than of coins of which they had no control in their making.

It's entirely possible that I'm just remembering that ability from a long-lost fanfiction, though.
