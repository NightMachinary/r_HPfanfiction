By enumerated i assume you mean serialized? As in goblin Shaftbiter made coins are serialized SB00410833Gxxxxxxxx as in SB are initials, the next seven numbers are a social control number(like a social security number or employee code) G for galleon then a random number linked to its creation either serially to that gobln of to its creation?

If so, then yeah, in a time travel or an au that's gonna cause issues but unless they can track those galleons back to the traveler, then they're gonan mostly just be wondering who learned how to 'counterfeit' their galleons but used the exact same formula.
