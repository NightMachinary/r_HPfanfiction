The one that prompted my thought is the one I'm reading now, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9704180/5/I-m-Still-Here][I'm Still Here]] ( linkffn(9704180) ). I've seen it around but I'd be hardpressed to remember specific titles - Time Travel is pretty much my favorite genre, though, so I've read a lot of them.
