Tropes and cliches are always what the author does with it. And lets use "Dogging Prison, Stealing Witches: Revenge is best served Raw" as an example. It's got Time Travel, it's got harem (seemingly), it's got an edgy Wrong Boy Who Lived Harry. It's got Lord blahblahablahbla.

And it's just so over the top and this sub seems to love it even tough they generally hate all of those tropes. But for whatever reason, that specific fic's got a greenlight here.
