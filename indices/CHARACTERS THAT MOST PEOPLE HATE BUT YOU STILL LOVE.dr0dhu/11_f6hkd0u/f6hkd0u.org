Sirius gets so much shit for leaving Harry and being a bully, going after Peter and being reckless but he was a good guy.

He didn't just walk into Godrics Hollow and see his dead friends and Harry alive before abandoning Harry to kill Peter. He helped Harry and made sure Hagrid could get him to Dumbledore safely by lending his bike.

Everybody hates on Sirius for beig a bully as a kid but nobody bats an eye at Snape because Dumbledore trusts him. Sirius is literally Snape but not an dick. Snape was abused as a kid, so was Sirius. Snape caved to his parents, Sirius held true to his beliefs despite abuse. Sirius was a bully as a kid, Snape was whipping up deadly curses at sixteen because he could. Snape avoided Lily because she was a muggleborn and the Slytherins didn't like it. Remus is a werewolf and Sirius became an animagus to stay with him. Snape joined the DEATH EATERS right out of school and people pass it off as ignorance to what they did. Sirius joined the order right out of school and they call him reckless for fighting for his friends. Sirius grew up wuickly to help Harry and escaped prison because Peter was close to Harry. Snape bullied Harry as a grown man because he looked like James. Dumbledore trusts Snape because Tom killed Lily and Snape liked her despite him having spied on Dumbledore yet still distrusts Sirius after Tom killed Lily and James, tortured the longbottoms and basically ruined his life. Sirius is the Snaoe that made the right choices yet Sirius gets shit and Snape gets pitty and second chances.

Sirius was such a good character and everyone calls him an arse who put revenge before family and a person who bullied those he deemed beneath him. Its exactly what Snape is yet Snape is treated well and Sirius like shit.
