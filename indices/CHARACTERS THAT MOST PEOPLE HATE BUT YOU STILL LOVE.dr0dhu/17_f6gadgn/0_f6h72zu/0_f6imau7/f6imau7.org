No.

As a person, Snape is utterly disgusting with few redeeming qualities. The examples that you give don't show him as a good person or him doing good things. They show him being a teacher. Those are things that he HAS to do, there is nothing "good" or "altruistic" about it. Him not letting Katie die can not be counted as a brownie point. And while that (probably) wasn't the case, him running when Myrtle scream could have been simply because he wanted to push someone. Not to mention, it's quite likely that he didn't take het seriously. And since the victim was Malfoy, saving him can be discounted.

Yes, he did to some degree protect the students while he was headmaster, but that doesn't have to be a good deed. It could very well have been in preparation of having to live in the wizarding world after Voldemort's death. Mo
