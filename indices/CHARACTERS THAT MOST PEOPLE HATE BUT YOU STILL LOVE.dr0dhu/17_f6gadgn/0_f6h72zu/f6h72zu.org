That's the one I was looking for in this thread, and here it is all the way at the bottom! Snape does some nasty things and that is not something I have forgotten, but he's also done a lot of genuinely good things besides spying on Vldemort and his role in the war. One quick example which I think is often overlooked in this community is how quickly he springs to the aid of students in danger.

In the climax of PoA, for example, he enters into the site of his worst childhood trauma to save three kids (who he /doesn't even like/) from Sirius Black, the very man who tried to kill him there when he was a teenager, and Remus Lupin, a werewolf on a full moon. In HBP, he of course saves Katie Bell's life. In the same book, there's also the Sectum Sempra scene, wherein he hears a ghost crying that there's been a murder, and sprints into the scene without any idea of who is involved or what's going on. In Deathly Hallows, if I'm remembering right, he assigns Neville et al. detentions with Hagrid in order to save them from being tortured by the Carrows. The whole reason he stays on to be headmaster at all, in fact, enduring the hatred of his colleagues, is to do his best to protect the students. And so forth. He may not be a great instructor or a master of pedagogy, but Snape cares deeply about saving the lives and protecting the health of his students, possibly to a greater demonstrated degree than any other character (including Dumbledore and McGonagall). And that's just admirable.

I know that, like Ron and Dumbledore and a few other characters mentioned in this thread, Snape actually /is/ liked by the fandom at large, but he is not within this community, so I feel like it's relevant!
