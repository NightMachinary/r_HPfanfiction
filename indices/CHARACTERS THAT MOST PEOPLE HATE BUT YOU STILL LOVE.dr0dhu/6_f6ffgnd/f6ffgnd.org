Percy Weasley.

Its always felt to me like he was pushed to the side and ignored in his family. The whole “oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” Scene and the Big-Head Boy badge, I used to find so hilarious, but thinking back, it's kind of dark how he was so proud of his accomplishments, but then ridiculed for them. As well as this was when he was given the promotion and his family hinting that he might not have got it on his own merits, which may have been slightly true, but you still don't say that to someone who's just told you they've achieved their dream job! I mean, yes he said some things back that were pretty ruthless, but he'd just been told that he had only got his dream job because the Minister had ulterior motives, and to me that seems a pretty normal response.
