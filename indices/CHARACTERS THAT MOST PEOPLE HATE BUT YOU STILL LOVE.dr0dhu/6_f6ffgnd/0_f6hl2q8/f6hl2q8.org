I am currently writting my own fiction and I plan to prtray Percy as a cunning kid and not an idiot. He wants ti be in politics so he had to have a bit of cunning right. My olan is for him to recognise that Fudge is using him and fake the whole out burst thing to distance himself from his family so they can't be hurt. It also means he is close to the higher ups and is informed about the going ons. He even sends Ron a letter that things are changing and he needs to be careful, that openly defying the ministry is not a good idea at the time. Also him being abused by his family for being proud of his accomplishments is bad form from the Weasley family who is meant to be full of love and caring.
