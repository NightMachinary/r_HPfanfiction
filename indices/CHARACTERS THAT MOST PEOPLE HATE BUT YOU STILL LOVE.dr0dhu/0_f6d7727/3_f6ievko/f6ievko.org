I think in the fandom at large, Hermione is much more popular than Ron - but on this subreddit in particular it appears flipped.

In any case, I also quite like Ron, and I think most of the fandom does as well. He's funny and an important part of the trio. I think part of it is that he ended up with Hermione, which pleases some, and displeases others (and will thus acerbate the feelings towards him). That + his fairly memorable angry moments/""""betrayals"""" towards Harry, combined with his normality, make it easy for some to dislike him.
