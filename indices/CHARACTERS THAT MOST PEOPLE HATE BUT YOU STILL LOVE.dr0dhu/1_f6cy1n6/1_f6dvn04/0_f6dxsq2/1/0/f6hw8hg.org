Snape is a "good" guy for selfish reasons, which is an interesting character / set of traits, but not admirable.

I can see why he's written about so much in fanfiction. He's definitely my favorite character in the story, but only because of that dichotomy, not because I think his code of ethics or behavior is in any way, shape, or form conducive to being a good person.

Had Snape survived I think he could have been reformed, but he spent most of his life harboring a grudge against a child he swore to protect. Dude also needed to get laid or find better hobbies.
