And dude, "worst memory" is Snape's worst memory because that was when Lily gave up on him. Not because Sirius and James trotted out some hexes that Snape himself invented for use on his classmates and that were (according to Lupin) used non-stop at the school at that time.

I'm not saying it felt great for Snape to be ganged up on and humiliated, or that the Marauders were angels... but it's hardly a black and white situation.
