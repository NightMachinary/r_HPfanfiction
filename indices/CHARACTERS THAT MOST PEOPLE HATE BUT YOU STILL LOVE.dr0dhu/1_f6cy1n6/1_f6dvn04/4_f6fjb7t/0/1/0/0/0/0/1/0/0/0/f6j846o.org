...because he's also his romantic rival, &snape isn't going to victimise himself in front of a girl he likes? lol

lily already knows he isn't wonderful. *she herself calls him out for bullying snape, & others*

snape does show anti-werewolf bigotry. that isn't mutually exclusive with him trying to get them expelled &hating them because they bullied him. lupin, the one he's discriminating against, is the one who reprimanded james and sirius for how they treated him
