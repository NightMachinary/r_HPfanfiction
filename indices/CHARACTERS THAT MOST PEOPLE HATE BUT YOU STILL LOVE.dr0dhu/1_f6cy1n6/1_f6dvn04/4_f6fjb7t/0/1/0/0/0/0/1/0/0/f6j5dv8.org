Lmfao, did you guys read The Prince's Tale at all? Specifically the scene where Lily and Snape are discussing his friends and James Potter? You know the scene where his biggest gripe is that James Potter /specifically/ is a really good and popular Quidditch player and not him being a bully? The very same scene we learn /Sirius/ had already told Snape how to get past the Willow? You'd think he'd bring up Sirius, too. "The other night" Lily says. That was fresh.

“I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.”

Taken out of context one would wonder why Lily doesn't know James Potter isn't wonderful. In context, one realizes Snape had followed them around because he'd suspected Lupin had been a werewolf. "Not as wonderful" not because they're terrorizing him as you seem to believe but because Lupin is a werewolf and James is friends with a werewolf.
