Does Hermione hang out with Lavender or Parvarti?

You can just...not hang out with people, funny enough. Blaise didn't strut around with Draco, nor did Daphne in canon. There are tons of Slytherin students who didnt become Death Eaters.

Uh you mean Snape started it when James said he wanted to be in Gryffindor like his Dad, and Snape both of them were morons?

But sure, magical nazis are sad bois.
