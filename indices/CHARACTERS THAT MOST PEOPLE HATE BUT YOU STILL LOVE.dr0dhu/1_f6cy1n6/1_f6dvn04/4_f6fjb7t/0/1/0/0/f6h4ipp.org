  Does Hermione hang out with Lavender or Parvarti?
#+end_quote

No, but they don't want to hang out with her either.

#+begin_quote
  You can just...not hang out with people, funny enough. Blaise didn't strut around with Draco, nor did Daphne in canon. There are tons of Slytherin students who didnt become Death Eaters.

I'll give you that, but Snape was a target from day 1 because of the Marauders and LIly, plus his own intelligence.

  Uh you mean Snape started it when James said he wanted to be in Gryffindor like his Dad, and Snape both of them were morons?
#+end_quote

This was the original quote:

James Potter: "'Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad. Got a problem with that?" Snape: "No. If you'd rather be brawny instead of brainy ---" Sirius Black: "Where are you hoping to go, seeing as you're neither?"

  But sure, magical nazis are sad bois.

Snape made one slightly critical comment, and that somehow justifies seven years of harassment. Interesting.
