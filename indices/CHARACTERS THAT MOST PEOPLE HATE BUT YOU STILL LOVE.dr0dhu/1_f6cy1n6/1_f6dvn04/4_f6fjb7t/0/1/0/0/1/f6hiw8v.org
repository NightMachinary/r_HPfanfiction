You think that...the future death eaters were like obsessed with Snape and forced him to hang out with them? You dont think he had to court then by showing off in potions and being super anti muggle? You think Snape was like Regina George and the death eaters were like "his hair is full of secrets"?

A target for what?

Again - Snape gave as good as he got. He invented and used deadly curses against fellow students, hung out with people who used dark curses on other students, and used racial slurs.

What did his students do to deserve his bullying? Forget Harry, a reminded of his past. What did Neville Longbottom do to deserve the terror his teacher put in him? What did Hermione do?
