  Snape was known to run with later Death Eaters in Slytherin House, and to use Dark Magic he invented.

Let's see, Houses are like cliques. Either he denounces his House (which is full of budding rapists and murderers who wouldn't hesitate to make his life hell) or go with the flow for some semblance of protection. Hmmm...

Plus, James and the crew started the harassment from Day 1 just because Snape said he liked Slytherin, and held onto that for seven years! Snape wasn't a DE from the start, but James was definitely a bully. But it's all good though, because James died for his family and Snape ended up spilling the Prophecy!
