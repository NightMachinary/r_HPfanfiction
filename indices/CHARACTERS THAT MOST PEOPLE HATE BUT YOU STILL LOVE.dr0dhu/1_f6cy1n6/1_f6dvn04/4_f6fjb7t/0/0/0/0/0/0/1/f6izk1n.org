  Frankly, I understand why he called Lily a mudblood. I think it's petty as fuck but he's human. Lily was smiling, while he was upside down with soap in his mouth. In front of a big ass crowd. Let's be honest. A lot of people would have said mudblood. After all that's the word that would hurt her the most. Just like she did to him.

I was bullied for years by a black boy, and never once called him the N-word, so I'm going to go ahead and say that all those people are assholes.
