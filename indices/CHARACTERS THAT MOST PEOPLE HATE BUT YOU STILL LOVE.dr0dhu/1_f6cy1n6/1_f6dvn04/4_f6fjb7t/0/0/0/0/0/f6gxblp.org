It's never said if they are in the same year or not.

Hermione doesnt hang out with Lavender or Paravati, and the other two girls that JK said were in that room are never even mentioned. Ron and Harry dont spend a ton of time with Dean or Seamus. That's not even getting into the other students in Griffindor house.

Snape chose his friends, and chose a side of the war (before Lily was targeted). He chose to call Lily and other muggleborns the slur "mudblood".
