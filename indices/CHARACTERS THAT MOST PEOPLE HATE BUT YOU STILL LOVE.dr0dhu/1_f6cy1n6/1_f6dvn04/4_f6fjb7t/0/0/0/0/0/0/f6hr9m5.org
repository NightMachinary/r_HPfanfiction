Oh he did, there's no denying that. But look at what happened to Mary. Something tells me Lavender and Seamus will never use dark curses on their roommates. And Gryffindor is not even close to Slytherin. I'm not making excuses for his horrible choices. I'm just trying to put myself in his shoes. Frankly, I understand why he called Lily a mudblood. I think it's petty as fuck but he's human. Lily was smiling, while he was upside down with soap in his mouth. In front of a big ass crowd. Let's be honest. A lot of people would have said mudblood. After all that's the word that would hurt her the most. Just like she did to him. Then she didn't accept his apology. Any of them. Personally I have a hate love relationship with Lily. I think she's an overhyped Mary Sue who suffers from peer pressure syndrome. But I like her and always the 2nd to defend her. If I had to pick a character to mentor it would be Lily. She has potential. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
