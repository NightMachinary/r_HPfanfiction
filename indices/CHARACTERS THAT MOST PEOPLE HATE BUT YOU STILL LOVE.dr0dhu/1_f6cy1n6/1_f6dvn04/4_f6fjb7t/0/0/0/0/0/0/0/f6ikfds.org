So Lily not associating with James until he cleaned up his act is her suffering from "peer pressure syndrome" but Snape using racial slurs and being a POS because the house he chose is full of dicks isnt giving in to peer pressure? Either ge legit held those beliefs or he was pressured into espousing them.

Poor Snape, he called her a dehumanizing slur after defending his murderer friends and she took him at his word.
