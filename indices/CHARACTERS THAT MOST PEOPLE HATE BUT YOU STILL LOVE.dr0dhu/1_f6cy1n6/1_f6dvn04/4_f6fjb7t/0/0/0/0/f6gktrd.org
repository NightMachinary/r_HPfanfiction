Ah, that could be a possibility. If Umbridge could do it why couldn't Severus? I suppose it wouldn't be wise to tell your pure blood supremacist roommates that you're a half blood. Especially since they have access to wands. Dangerous, those things are. A determined first year could kill someone and get away with it. Smh...🤦🏾‍♀️. I doubt Severus would have lasted long if he revealed much about himself. I've always wondered what Lily was thinking in that scene. How is supposed to ditch his roommates that have the potential to harm him? I live in a dorm, there are 2 of us in my room. Others have anywhere from 1-6. Point is I can't avoid my roommate. They know where he sleeps, have influence, and have an advantage because not a lot of people are going to miss Severus when he dies. It's 1:30 in the morning, I need to sleep. 🤗
