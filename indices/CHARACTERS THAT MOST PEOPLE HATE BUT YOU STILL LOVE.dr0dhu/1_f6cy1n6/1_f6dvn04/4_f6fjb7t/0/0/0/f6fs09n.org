Oh, I get what you mean now. I thought you meant like a fic from Harry (or others) POV calling him Snape.

In "The Prince's Tale" in DH, we see Lily arguing with Snape about his friends, including later Death Eaters Mulciber and Avery (who were also friends with Lestrange, Bellatrix, etc). Like Voldemort himself, he likely pretended to be a pureblood.
