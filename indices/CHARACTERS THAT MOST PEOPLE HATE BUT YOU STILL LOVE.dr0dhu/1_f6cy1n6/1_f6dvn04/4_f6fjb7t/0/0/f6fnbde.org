Yup. It sounds stupid but when he's a main character it irks me. If Harry is the main character of a fic, the author doesn't (usually) call him Potter.

I'm not disputing that he had his roommates. But in the examples I remember from the books, he was always alone. I don't doubt however that he had allies. It's something J. K. would write. Realistically (yes, I'm using reality to judge fantasy) with his status in blood and wealth, I doubt he had protectors. But anyway I'm just saying my opinion. Feel free to disagree. 🤷🏾‍♀️🤗
