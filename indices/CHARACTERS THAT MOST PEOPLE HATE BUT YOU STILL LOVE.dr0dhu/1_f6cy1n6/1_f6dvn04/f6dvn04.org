James Potter!!!! He may have been a dick to Snape, but Snape gave it right back. Worst Memory is just that - the worst memory.

James Potter became an animagus for his werewolf friend, took in Sirius when his family threw him out, and fought on the side of good for goodness sake.

And then he faced Voldemort, wandless and alone, to give Lily an extra second to escape with Harry.

JAMES POTTER DESERVES BETTER.
