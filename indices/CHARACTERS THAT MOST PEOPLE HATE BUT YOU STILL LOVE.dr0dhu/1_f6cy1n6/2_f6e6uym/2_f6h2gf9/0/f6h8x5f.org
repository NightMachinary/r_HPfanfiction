well, we're talking about fandom perception. it's not that i don't think there needed to be a real apology from james re: the bullying that happened to snape, it's that james' good qualities during and after hogwarts vastly outshines the bad (which was unfortunate for snape tbh).

honestly, where james and snape were in their lives at 21 made it too complicated and practically impossible for a sincere apology from james to take place. then james died and there was no closure granted.

idk what to tell you, life is just messy like that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
