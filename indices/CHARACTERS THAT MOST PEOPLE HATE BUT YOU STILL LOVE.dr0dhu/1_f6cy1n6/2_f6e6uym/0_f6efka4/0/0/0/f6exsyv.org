Have you ever heard the phrase "You can't help who you love?"

Snape might be a dickhead, he might have treated Lily like shit, and he certainly may have been a bigot. But at the end of the day, he loved Lily.

Being able to love someone certainly doesn't make you a good person, and that's not the argument I'm trying to make. I'm also certainly not saying that Snape "deserved" Lily.

But the idea that someone could love someone so fiercely that they would do anything, endure any torture, and undergo any mission to try and avenge them, Snape being the vehicle for that vengeance or not, is certainly, on its own, beautiful.

"Always," is a pretty apt summary of that feeling and, for what it was worth, being delivered by Snape's character shouldn't diminish its affect.
