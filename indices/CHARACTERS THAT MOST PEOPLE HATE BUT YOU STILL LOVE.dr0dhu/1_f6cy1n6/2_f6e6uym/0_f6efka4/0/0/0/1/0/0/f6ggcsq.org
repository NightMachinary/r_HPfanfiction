  Snape might be a dickhead, he might have treated Lily like shit, and he certainly may have been a bigot. But at the end of the day, he loved Lily.

This isn't love???? If literally anyone came to you and described how their s/o treated them like shit, would you tell them they love them? Because being mistreated is abuse, those words are synonymous. How can you love someone if you hate what they are? It's like saying a Nazi, an actual honest-to-God Nazi, who subscribes to their ideals and actively engages in it, loves a Jewish person. How can they?

At the end of the day, Snape was just a piece of shit incel so obsessed with a girl who wanted nothing to do with him that he fooled himself into believing he was some sort of persecuted hero, justified in his CHILD ABUSE.

I really hated that JK Rowling tried to play Snape as some hero. He's done maybe two heroic shit. Maybe. Probably just once, actually. Sending the Sword of Gryffindor to Harry, which is literally nothing. I mean, I can send a parcel in the mail too and I won't get anyone to almost drown with it. Meanwhile, he lets children be tortured in the school he's the Headmaster in. Nice and upstanding. Delivering this one thing totally cancels that out, I guess????

Edit: I went too hard. This sounds so condescending, I'm sorry. My point still stands, tho. Snape definitely didn't love Lily because love is good and he's an evil bitch, possibly incapable of love. I'm not sure how much sense I'm making. This subject frustrated me to no end and I can never properly verbalize what I mean.
