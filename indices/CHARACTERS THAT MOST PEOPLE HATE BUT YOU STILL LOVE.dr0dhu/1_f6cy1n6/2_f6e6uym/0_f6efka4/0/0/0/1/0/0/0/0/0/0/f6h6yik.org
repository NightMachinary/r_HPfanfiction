Do you think there's a clash between love as an emotion and the magic of love researched by the DoM? If the result of the magic of love was good only because the emotion was pure and real or if it would have been like that anyway even if the feelings weren't as pure?

Do you think the behavior of the Carrows were a personal choice or mandated by Lord V? Do you think that Lord V still "retained" any of his previous charisma or social intelligence (I think he either was pretty bent or just gave zero fcks at that point), or that he couldn't be reasonable even if given a sufficiently good argument? Do you think he could have been convinced to catch more flies with honey at Hogwarts like he presumably did back in the day?

Do you think that Harry wouldn't have sacrificed himself if Dumbledore told him about the scar earlier or that he needed to be told at the last possible moment?

You don't think the heroic act was needed to retrieve the sword out of the Sorting Hat in particular, then? Dumbledore used it to destroy the ring and before that, it was just kept in his office. Was the very act of destroying it the heroic part?
