Snape obviously cared more about Lily than whether or not she returned his affection if she'd been dead for 16 years.

  It's not what Lily would've wanted.

To be honest, I'd think it was creepier if Snape pulled a complete about face and became a good person after she died as some kind of, "Look at me, look how much you'd have been happy with me."

Lily died. She died hating Snape. She died fighting against a cause that Snape was a part of.

Snape fully understood that. He didn't need or want to change into what Lily would have wanted. He lost that chance for her to see that he could be better. Perhaps, even, he felt he didn't deserve to be anything other than bitter and unhappy.
