I'm not missing your point, I just disagree with your assessment.

Say what you will about Snape as a person, but he flipped sides before Lily was murdered. Even after Voldemort agreed to spare Lily, he flipped sides to ensure it from both angles.

Then, after she was murdered anyways, he spent the next 16 years working against her murderer.

That seems out of the realm of normality for me if it's not real love.
