  Do you think there's a clash between love as an emotion and the magic of love researched by the DoM?
#+end_quote

I don't believe they're fundamentally different things.

The cliche of hyper-rational (or just evil) characters who scoff at Love as a blinding, irrational and hazardous emotion aren't /wrong/. Love can be categorized quite neatly. It is an emotion evolved by humans (and, arguably, in a few other species of animals) to encourage reproduction and ensure we care for our young.

However, by virtue of being a sentient, thinking species, we have turned it into something more. Something extremely powerful. It's why I dislike the idea that hyper-rational characters would discard it so easily. We humans put so much value into feeling loved and cherished, that it can accomplish amazing feats. A mother can lift a *fucking car* to save her child. We'll jump in front of bullets, a sure death, to save our loved ones. The ultimate sacrifice.

The "love as an emotion" isn't different from what the DoM would be researching. However, I think the DoM, with any sense, would be researching how extremely powerful such an emotion could be. Lily loved her son and, with that love, took down the most evil and powerful Dark Lord to ever grace Britain's shores.

Dumbledore, I think, says it most aptly.

  "There is a room in the Department of Mysteries that is kept locked at all times. It contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than the forces of nature. It is also, perhaps, the most mysterious of the many subjects for study that reside there. It is the power held within that room that you possess in such quantities and which Voldemort has not at all."

  If the result of the magic of love was good only because the emotion was pure and real or if it would have been like that anyway even if the feelings weren't as pure?
#+end_quote

Love doesn't need to be pure or even reciprocated to be real. Could not an evil person have a happy enough memory to fuel the Patronus?

  Do you think the behavior of the Carrows were a personal choice or mandated by Lord V?
#+end_quote

I'd probably say personal choice. I don't think Lord Voldemort much cared what happened to the children in the school, so long as they /stayed/ in the school. They were his hostages, and nothing more, I think.

#+begin_quote
  or that he couldn't be reasonable even if given a sufficiently good argument?
#+end_quote

I don't think, nearing the end, that Voldemort was a very rational person. There's ample evidence for this, such as killing Snape to gain control of the Elder Wand, despite having literally been the person to kill Grindelwald in his cage. Voldemort, had he any rational bone in his body at that point, should have known that either he was the master than and there, by virtue of having killed the previous master, or that killing wasn't necessary. Only defeat. In which case he would have suspected Draco.

To actually answer your question, I don't think that Voldemort would respond to any argument rationally. With his position of power, the only things that may have changed his courses of action would have been a significantly persuading threat to his goals.

  Do you think he could have been convinced to catch more flies with honey at Hogwarts like he presumably did back in the day?
#+end_quote

I don't think Tom caught many flies with honey while at school. He put up a front to his teachers, but to everyone else he was already gathering a base of power. This is the boy who went on to ask Horace about Horcruxes and murdered another student and opened the Chamber of Secrets to start petrifying students at the age of 16.

  Do you think that Harry wouldn't have sacrificed himself if Dumbledore told him about the scar earlier or that he needed to be told at the last possible moment?
#+end_quote

Oh, there's no doubt in my mind that Harry would have sacrificed himself no matter when he was told. I think Dumbledore delayed telling him because he knew as soon as Harry was aware, he'd want to end it as soon as possible. It was two-fold, I think.

One, Dumbledore knew there was at least a chance, perhaps the greatest chance, that Harry would survive.

Two, having Harry sacrifice himself at the last moment would ensure that the Horcruxes would be gone or, at least, would be well on their way to being destroyed. If Harry was kept unawares of his potential survival, it would allow him to pass on his mother's sacrifice to the rest of the school.

#+begin_quote
  “SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and *silence was forced upon them all*.

  “He beat you!” yelled Ron, *and the charm broke*, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second, *more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.*

  But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. *Someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort*

  “I'll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. “Dumbledore's Army!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from *the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed unable to hold.*

  You don't think the heroic act was needed to retrieve the sword out of the Sorting Hat in particular, then? Dumbledore used it to destroy the ring and before that, it was just kept in his office. Was the very act of destroying it the heroic part?
#+end_quote

I do think a heroic act was needed to pull the sword from the Sorting Hat. Beyond that, I think a courageous or heroic act is necessary to even properly wield the sword.

1. Harry was preparing to fight a Basilisk, when the sword was introduced.

2. Dumbledore used to to destroy the ring, yes, but we're unaware of *when* he obtained the sword. It's entirely possible that he, knowing it was imbued with Basilisk venom, took it to the Gaunt house and intended to destroy the item there. I'd say setting out to destroy an item of great danger and evil was quite courageous.

3. Snape wielded the sword, at least temporarily, to take it to Harry in the forest. You could debate whether or not this action, just transportation, would require triggering that requirement however I think, should you force the issue, an argument could be made that defying his Lord would be quite courageous.

4. Ron jumps into the water to save his drowning friend. Quite heroic.

It is, I suppose, entirely possible that such a requirement is a self-fulling prophetical myth.
