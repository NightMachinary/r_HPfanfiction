I'm going to copy/paste one of my other responses, so please don't think I'm putting words in your mouth with my quotes.

I think you were so frustrated you missed the entire argument. I'm not trying to redeem Snape's character, I'm saying he actually, truly, loved Lily. As I've said to someone else, being an irredeemable asshole and being in love aren't irreconcilable positions. You can be both.

  described how their s/o treated them like shit, would you tell them they love them?
#+end_quote

There's a difference between an unhealthy relationship and being in love. You can love someone and be an asshole/shit-flinging monster. That doesn't mean they should /stay/ with you, or that because you love them you deserve that love to be returned.

  How can you love someone if you hate what they are? It's like saying a Nazi, an actual honest-to-God Nazi, who subscribes to their ideals and actively engages in it, loves a Jewish person. How can they?
#+end_quote

There are literally mountains of stories of Nazi's turned traitor because they fell in love with Jewish people.

  At the end of the day, Snape was just a piece of shit incel so obsessed with a girl who wanted nothing to do with him that he fooled himself into believing he was some sort of persecuted hero, justified in his CHILD ABUSE.
#+end_quote

This is a point of view I'm not trying to argue at the moment. Being a piece of shit has nothing to do with being capable of honest feelings.

  Sending the Sword of Gryffindor to Harry, which is literally nothing. I mean, I can send a parcel in the mail too and I won't get anyone to almost drown with it.
#+end_quote

It was made plain in the story that you had to have undergone some heroic (read, stupid and foolhardy) act to retrieve and wield the sword. I'm not saying that placing it under water was the recommended solution, but you certainly would not have been able to mail it to someone.

  Meanwhile, he lets children be tortured in the school he's the Headmaster in. Nice and upstanding.
#+end_quote

I mean, for all the valid reasons to shit on Snape, you have to be pretty out of touch to miss this one. He was between a rock and a hard place with this. There were Death Eaters at the school who would have reported any suspicious activity. If you think Snape was /actually/ the headmaster in anything but name, you weren't paying attention. And still, he managed to stop any children from actually dying and was rather lax with punishments when he could be for serious offenses.

  Snape definitely didn't love Lily because love is good and he's an evil bitch, possibly incapable of love.
#+end_quote

Love is not "good." It's a human emotion that practically everyone but sociopaths are capable of feeling. Even evil people.

Snape, a mostly rational person who was fairly firm in his belief in the cause of the Death Eaters, turned traitor immediately once he found that Voldemort might be targeting Lily directly. Even after receiving Voldemort's assurances that he wouldn't kill her.

Then, after she was dead, and the "obsession" would have been far out of his reach, he spied on Voldemort at his own peril for at least 3 years, before eventually being murdered, using his last seconds to pass on the vital knowledge to Harry on how to kill Voldemort, despite the fact that he would be /long dead/ before Harry could make use of it.

I'm not saying Snape was a /good person/, I'm saying he /loved/ Lily. There is no obsession in human history capable of imitating love so closely.
