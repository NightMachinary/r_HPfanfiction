Did he really, though? To me Snape loves the idea of Lily he has in his head. It's not really loving a person if you don't care about their desires, interests, etc outside of them returning your affection.

He also kinda went around it in a... not super great way. As a teacher he was petty, spiteful, and malicious. It's not what Lily would've wanted. In the Legend of Korra, the way Katara treats Korra as her person, despite being the legacy of her dead lover, is healthy and emotionally mature.
