oh yeah snape's probably in my top 3. def in my top 5.

i won't lie, there's certain aspects to snape's backstory i find sympathetic and relatable. and i think he actually does have a few good qualities. it doesn't excuse the countless shitty things he did, but it perfectly explains the trajectory of his life.
