You might be the first Snape fan (if that's what you are) I've encountered with this take. Most people can't admit to or see the flaws of their favorite characters. They find Snape relatable, Alan Rickman handsome, and most totally ignore all the terrible things Snape did The Prince's Tale because "Always", which is also a, imo, terrible, terrible scene taken way out of context.
