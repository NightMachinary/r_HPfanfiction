  James is maligned in ff for the most part and even more outside the ff community because he was a rich, popular boy who bullied Snape

Well he was a rich popular boy who bullied Snape, who was an abused kid at that. Why? Because he was friends with Lily and was in Slytherin. And it's not like the bullying started in 3rd or 4th year when the DE movement was really picking up. This was all from day one.
