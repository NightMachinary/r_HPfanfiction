A lot of it is conjecture though.

We do know Snape hung out with the crowd that became death eaters, so I don't think it was 4 on 1 always, and James put soap in his mouth and flipped him upside down. Snape sent a cutting curse.

The issue is that even Marauder's era Snape seems bad, unless you were Lily.
