  Snape grew up in a dysfunctional family, there's no conclusive evidence he was abused like Harry.

Fair enough, but dysfunctional usually means abused.

  Snape also was deep into the dark arts as well. James at least grew up.

/After/ Lily ditched Snape. Hmm, wonder why. James died at 21. I'm 21 and while I can say I'm not the same person I was at 17/18, I wouldn't say I'm a full grown adult emotionally. Maybe the war sped things up for him? Who knows?
