  The marauders being absolutely evil and Snape being defenseless is what bothers me in fanon.

Never said that, but if it's a choice between Marauder-era Snape vs the Marauders, I'm choosing Snape. I can kind see where Sirius and the others were coming from in their misguided justice/cowardice, but James had no excuse.

  And after their deaths, he definitely doesn't come across as "good".

I agree. After James died he should have lightened up and gotten some therapy, not pushing his baggage to Harry and the other students.
