Yup.

The entire WBWL trope is based on the idea that James would have been a terrible father who ignored Harry.

Many Snape fics (and there are a lot) are based on the idea that Snape was forced to join the Death Eaters to protect himself from big bad James. There's a fic I've seen rec'd here more than once that makes Snape Jewish and James an anti-Semite, so the other Marauders decide to be friends with Snape instead. Or the popular fic where the Weasley twins travel back in time to learn that the Marauders were bullies not worthy of the twins' worship and Snape was a put-upon abuse victim.

This sub is quite anti-Snape, but go to the main sub and say something pro-James. You'll likely get a response like "I'm not interested in your bully apologism, maybe if you'd been bullied in school you would understand that James left lifelong scars."

Then there's the entire "anti-marauder" tab on tumblr. Look no further than the infamous "James Potter was a bully who sexually assaulted a fellow student and deserves no redemption, you can't change my mind" picture.

Or take a look at the Harry Potter movie tour. No mention of James/Sirius/Remus in addition to no Marauder merchandise (beyond a few things with the map). There's a reason Snape gets marketed and the Marauders don't.
