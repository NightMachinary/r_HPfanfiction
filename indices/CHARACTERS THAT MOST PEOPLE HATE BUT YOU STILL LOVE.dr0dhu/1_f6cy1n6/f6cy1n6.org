Albus Dumbledore. I really wish he and Harry had hashed a few things out and OotP/HBP will always leave a bad taste in my mouth, but I really do still find him hilarious and enjoyable.

James Potter, Bellatrix Lestrange, and Sirius Black. Great potential 3D characters that were flattened in the end. I'll never be over Bella dying at Molly Weasley's hand when Minerva McGonagall was standing right there and Sirius dying so Arthur could live.

Cho Chang. Another great potential character done dirty. I don't mind the splitting in the end because Marietta is still an issue, but the narrative that she was just over emotional doesn't sit right with me. It should've been a source of character growth for Harry and i get he was 15/16, but he walked away only learning he didn't like crying girls.
