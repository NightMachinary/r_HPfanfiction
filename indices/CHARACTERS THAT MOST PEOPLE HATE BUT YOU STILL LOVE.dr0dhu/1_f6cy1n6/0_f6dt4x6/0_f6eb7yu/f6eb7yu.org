I like Lavender with Ron more than Hermione, sure Lavender in the 6th year was kinda bit overbearing and clingy, I mean you really can't blame her she was a teenager and had a huge crush on Ron... anyway I always assume that after the battle/war Lavender developed and became a more sensible mature woman because of what she went through the war.
