Add Lavender: she is maligned a lot in the fandom for behaving like real teenagers. But despite her somewhat humiliating breakup with Ron, she did not hold a grudge. During year 7, she braved terror and torture, actively pursued Trio's cause, fought in the Final Battle against overwhelming odds, and might have given up her life.

How could anyone hate such an admirable girl?
