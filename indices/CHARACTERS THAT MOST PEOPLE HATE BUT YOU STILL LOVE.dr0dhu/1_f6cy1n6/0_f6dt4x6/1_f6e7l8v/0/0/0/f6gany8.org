Malfoy (and Snape, for that matter) aren't only popular due to their actors. Rowling specifically coded them to be sympathetic, compared to other villains in the series such as Umbridge. Read up on the phenomenon of hurt-comfort.

If it was only that an actor looked good, then why should Lavender still have a problem?
