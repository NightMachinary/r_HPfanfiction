Well, if we look at the early books as entirely serious there are a lot of situations that get far worse than they are when viewed from an in-genre way (eg - all the adults being incompetent, the abuse the Dursleys use, etc etc).

Malfoy fits in fine there - like, he's clearly incredibly bigoted, but it's just as clearly a function of his upbringing and he's a child. It's hard to look at a 12 year old and say that they're a monster, or at least it is for me.

For Snape, in a society where it's perfectly acceptable to toss a child out of a window to see if they're magical, is his acerbity that bad? And for Neville's parents, I'm not actually sure how early on JKR decided they'd have been tortured into vegetables (they only get mentioned as such in book 4, so it may be a situation like Dumbledore not using Apparition in book 1 because it didn't exist). In any case, everyone's had that 'Mean' teacher - I had one in elementary school who you could hear from three room away when she was mad, and who scared the parents. That's a pretty trope-y inclusion for Snape
