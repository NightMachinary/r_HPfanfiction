Malfoy calls for racial purges at 12 and shows clear sadistic tendencies throughout year 3 when he enjoys Hagrid's misery. Snape is an abusive teacher who ends up being what Neville fears most, managing to trump the terrorist who tortured his parents into vegetables. Lavender gets annoyingly accurate predictions about her pet dying.
