For Malfoy (and Snape), the reason they're popular/likable is because those actions aren't particularly emphasized or presented in as horrific a light as they really /would/ be. It was a stylistic choice from JKR to make the reader not /hate/ them as people by the end.

For instance, if we look at Snape, we get some of the backstory that leads to him disliking Harry - so that puts the earlier interactions with him into some context, instead of us simply hating the guy. He comes across as a tragic figure, which the reader will tend to find sympathetic.

For Malfoy, most of my opinion of him got formed in the first few books - where, although he's an antagonist, he's not a particularly /serious/ one. When I see him pop up, it's usually somewhat incompetent, schoolyard rival kind of vibe. His bigotry and superiority complex are also explained by how he was raised, which makes it easy to not blame him for it. It's only in the later books that we see him commit some truly horrific acts - but they're not particularly emphasized there, and IIRC the passages emphasizing his doubt/how he's being made to do it are more of a focus. So we combine that to have an impression of him as a schoolyard bully that's that way because of his family, a fairly /incompetent/ character there for Harry to triumph over, and not a real threat.

Lavender, in contrast, gets scenes that are really focused on her being annoying and clingy and doesn't really get many redeeming characteristics - simply because those are the only scenes that we get that focus on her. In a vacuum, she's a lot better than Malfoy - but when reading, she's very easy to slot into the 'annoying' box and never shift away.
