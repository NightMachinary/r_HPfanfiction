Dumbledore and Ron. It's getting more and more difficult these days to find a fic where Dumbledore's a leader for the light who has the right ideas but gets a little lost in practice (or something around those lines) and Ron is Harry's best mate who is constantly being overshadowed and doesn't believe in himself as much as he should. It's why I loved Stay Standing and To Shape and Change - fics that do them justice.
