Oh yessss, this is the thread I've been waiting for /cracks knuckles/

I have a real soft spot for Percy Weasley. I see how he's easy to hate/overlook - he's pompous, arrogant, and a huge stickler for the rules, but he ultimately does what he thinks is right... even if his interpretation tends to be pretty black-and-white. He's /very/ different than the rest of his family, which must have caused some tension, and his frustration with them / the family's reputation is understandable, especially considering his ambitions in the ministry. And thinking about OOTP/HBP, and Percy's choice to side with the Ministry after the return of Voldemort... something about him abandoning his family and then realizing he was wrong hits me in the gut. That must have been a brutal realization. Again, he did what he thought was right... he just put his faith in the wrong place.

Another surprisingly unpopular character... Remus Lupin! When I started reading HP fanfic, I was heavy into the Marauder Era. I think a lot of my love for him comes from my headcanon/fanon of his time at Hogwarts: I imagine him being very insecure about his placement at Hogwarts, and somewhat high-strung because of that, but also funny, clever, gentle... I don't think Remus made great choices during the series, but being non-human in the Wizarding world would be incredibly mentally draining, and I think the public's beliefs around werewolves really screwed with his head and his self-worth, especially, you know, after all of his friends died :/

Speaking of the Marauder Era... I want fics to include Peter Pettigrew as well. I have a lot of sympathy for him, especially as a child and his choice to betray the Potters to Voldemort. He was an average person who was friends with some exceptional people. Not particularly smart or brave, and /very/ motivated by fear... life-and-death choices bring out the best and the worst in people, and Peter just couldn't measure up. If I was up against Voldemort, I don't know what I would have done.

And then to name two obvious characters, Albus Dumbledore and Ron Weasley :') Dumbledore is a phenomenal character that highlights JK Rowling's strength as a writer - a brave, strong, flawed man who did what he thought was best, with mixed results. And Ron Weasley... this sub is pretty good about recognizing the differences between canon/HP movies/fanon, but there's still very few decent Ron fics out there. Ron was a /very/ good friend: caring, supportive, light-hearted, and shockingly willing to risk his life for Harry. He had his flaws, but did a good job working around them, especially with his jealousy. I think JK Rowling really screwed him towards the end of the series... he never got the chance to shine in the way that he could have.

And to top off this already overly long list, why are there no stories about Charlie Weasley?!?! Just because we "barely see him," SMH, that doesn't stop people from writing a million stories about Daphne Greengrass... Charlie and Hagrid would be an iconic duo, and yet I've never read any stories featuring the two of them, or even any oneshots where they hang out and ramble about dragons... where are all the Charlie stories?

Edit: grammar :p
