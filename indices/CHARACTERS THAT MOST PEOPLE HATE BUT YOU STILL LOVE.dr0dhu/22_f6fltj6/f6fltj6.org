I love Severus, Narcissa, Andromenda, Sirius, Regulus, Lucius, and Bellatrix. If I could I'd give them all a big hug and send them to therapy. They all need it. Bellatrix didn't leave the womb flinging torture curses. Narcissa and Andromeda had the same household as Bellatrix. Severus's need for therapy is obvious and I doubt Lucius's first word was â€˜mudblood.' Sirius was so obsessed with not being prejudiced like his parents that he ended up more like them than he'd like to admit. Regulus was fiercely protective of Kreacher. Based on the treatment of house elves, it's clear that he didn't have many friends. All of them have a place in my heart.
