Half the problem is that a lot of people use Hermione as their self-insert character and cleanse her of her faults. She's a good, multi-dimensional character. Some of her greatest strengths are also her most egregious weaknesses. Unfortunately, this dichotomy gets washed over because people want to see themselves as the “smartest of the age.”

This whitewashing then leads to people hating the character because they're pelted over the face with people ignoring the incredible depth that was written into her. She's a good hearted person, but she's also flippantly cruel when she believes she's right. She's an advocate for the dismissed and the downtrodden...who approaches everything from the perspective that someone of her station would: she knows better than you, if you'll just let her help. She believes that authority should be listened to...but only if it's working for the good of the people, at which point she will rebel to extraordinary lengths.
