A good response, but note I said the least, not none.

SPEW on it's surface looked great. Getting better treatment and rights for house-elves, with the eventual goal being freedom.

But then she tries to free house-elves in contrary to that. Then SPEW is promptly dropped from the plot.

Book 5, it's fine and dandy that she's challenging Umbridge, but Harry ends up suffering for it. Keep your head down is an odd bit of advice from her.

I like growing characters. I want her shine leadership wise. As she is, she reminds me more of nice Umbridge than anyone.
