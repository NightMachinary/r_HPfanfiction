She has some growth in later books. For instance, in PoA her character growth comes from realizing that she can't, indeed, do everything. There's a lot of focus (as a secondary plot) on her overworking herself to do /all/ the classes, on her fear of failing, etc - until she realizes and accepts that that'll be the case (resulting in ditching multiple classes, and at least /some/ self reflection in other areas). Book 4 we can see some of her growing understanding of relationships/others - she showcases a good amount of social perceptiveness that goes right under Harry and Ron's eyes in some scenes. In addition there's the whole SPEW arc, which although I have a lot of problems with /is/ character growth.

In later books we see her starting to be more comfortable as a leadership figure, romance, and further realization of more than just book smarts being important.

I think it's fairly wrong to say she's not getting character growth, as just like Ron and Harry she does change a good bit as a character from early on to the end. Sure, Hermione's most /visible/ growth happens in book 1, but that's by design - we could say the same about Harry, as his evolution with having friends and people who know /him/ and don't see him as a freak seems pretty sizable to me as well. That doesn't mean he doesn't have any growth after book 1.
