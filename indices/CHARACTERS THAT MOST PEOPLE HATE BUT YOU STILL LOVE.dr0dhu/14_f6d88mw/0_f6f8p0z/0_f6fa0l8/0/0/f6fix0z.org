There's no coherent "fanon interpretation" - in many, many stories, Hermione is reduced to eye candy, damsel in distress, or research assistant, losing all agency in favour of Harry the Hero. And yet in the stories she is actually a protagonist, the misogynists complain about "Mary Sue" and other shit.
