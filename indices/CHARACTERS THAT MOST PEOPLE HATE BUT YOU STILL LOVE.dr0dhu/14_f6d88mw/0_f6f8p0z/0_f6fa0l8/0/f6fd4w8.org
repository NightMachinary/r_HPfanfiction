I think we are both arriving at the same conclusion just from multiple angles. I give more stock to the fanon interpretation of Hermione fueling the hatred you see of her, while you see it more originating organically in canon. Either way we both agree: the lengths people go to destroy her character are horrible.

To me it's worse than the DLP Ginny-Kill Off's because Hermione is a fully formed character.
