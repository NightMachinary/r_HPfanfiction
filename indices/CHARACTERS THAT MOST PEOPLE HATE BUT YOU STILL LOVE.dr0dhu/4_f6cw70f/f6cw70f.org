- Ron -- he is my favorite of the trio. I love his personality and flaws and that he isn't wish fulfillment. Just wish he had been more plot relevant in GOF and OOtP.

- Dumbledore -- I understand the hate because I have my gripes as well, but I still really love his character. I especially love his backstory (my personal favorite in the series).
