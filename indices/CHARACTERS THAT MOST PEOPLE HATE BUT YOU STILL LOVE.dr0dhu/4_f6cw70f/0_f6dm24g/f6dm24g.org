Romione is the wish fulfillment, not Ron. And I think "Ron is terrible" and "Romione is terrible" get conflated. The first is kinda dumb and the second is kinda obvious.

People should talk more about how Hermione doesn't believe in Ron, doesn't respect him, is borderline abusive to him, and her idea of them getting together revolves around her thinking she can change him. And I mean in the context of Romione being bad. I have literally had people present these things as reasons they'd be good together.

"Ron isn't good enough for Hermione" is kinda true in the movie verse, but in the books they're both good but flawed people who should never be in a relationship.
