I always felt cringy about her and Ron getting together. I realize that she and Harry were a little bit more like siblings, but I always thought they fit better than her and Ron. I don't even know that it makes sense to stick them in relationships in the end. I like Harry and Ginny and feel like they could be good for each other in more than shared trauma, but I always felt like Hermione deserved better and there were none of those small moments of people who clearly like each other despite their conflict.
