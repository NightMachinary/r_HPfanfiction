Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson.

Unpopular opinion, furshur, but I'm a big believer in Martin Luther King's message of forgiveness. Can we all please remember that these two characters (like most others TBH) were only pre-teens when the story started? They were literally raised in an atmosphere of bigotry, hate and superiority-complex-inducing parentage. Honestly, the very fact that they managed to see sense and do what was right at the end (not true for Pansy, I know but I like her more for her fanon! representation) is admirable to me.

To this very day, I am somewhat disappointed that we haven't seen an official redemption arc for these two characters.

Talking exclusively about Pansy now, I really love how she is portrayed in the fanon! and especially when it's the Dramione shippers that are doing the writing. Also, since we're doing unpopular opinions anyway; Harry should've ended up with Pansy. Don't care how or why, I just root for that ship.

Thank you for your patience with my babbling. <3
