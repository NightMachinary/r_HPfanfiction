This was exactly what I was going to say! Not only that, though, but his family hinting that he might not have got it on his own merits, which may have been slightly true, but you still don't say that to someone who's just told you they've achieved their dream job! Besides, I hate how he's kinda left out of the family and ridiculed - the whole big-head boy thing I used to find hilarious, as well as the “oh, are you a Prefect, Percy? You didn't mention”, but it's kinda dark to think back on because it seems like every time he mentioned these accomplishments he was pushed down and mocked. Percy's actually one of my favourite characters, and I honestly don't think that his character is treated as it should.
