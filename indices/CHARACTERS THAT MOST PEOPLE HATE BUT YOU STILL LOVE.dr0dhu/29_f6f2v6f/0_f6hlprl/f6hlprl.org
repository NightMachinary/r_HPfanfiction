I love Draco, he is honestly a confused kid that was abandoned by the teachers. He was spoilt as a kid and taught sime bad things from his father but Hogwarts should have helped to put a stop to his bigotry and racism. He is never disciplined for his name calling or bullying and it just progressively gets worse. I love stories when anyone at all takes a bit of pity on him and points him in tge right direction. He would make a much better character for who Ron was supposed to be and back up Dumbledores beliefs that people are capable of change. Draco has way more knowledge of the wizarding world than Ron and is easier to move past his racist beliefs due ti his father.
