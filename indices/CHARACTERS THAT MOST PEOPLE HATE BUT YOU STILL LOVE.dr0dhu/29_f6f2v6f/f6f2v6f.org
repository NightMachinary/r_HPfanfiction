Draco Malfoy. I like him as a character because he is morally grey (kind of like Snape/Dumbledore to some degree) but because he is a teen I feel like he has lots of room to grow (in fanfiction). As a writer Draco is appealing because I see nothing but opportunity for him to grow and evolve.

Draco is also a character that aides in exploring world-building/events that canon didn't cover: the inner-workings of pureblood culture, what Voldemort was doing the summers before 6th and 7th year and the entire 7th year while Harry and co were camping, exploring real love and family in "evil‚Äù characters (like Lucius and Narcissa). Plus post-books, what punishment and consequences does Draco get? How does he survive in a wizarding world that hates him for good reason? How does he seek/find redemption? I love reading how different fics address the above stuff and it's why I keep coming back for more of him!
