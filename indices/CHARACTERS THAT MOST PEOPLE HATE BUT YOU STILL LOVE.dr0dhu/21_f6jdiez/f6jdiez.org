Ctrl+F "Pansy" -> 0 mentions.

Okay, look. Pansy isn't a good person. Pansy is, in fact, a racist bullying piece of shit. But she's tamer about it than Malfoy (No "Enemies of the Heir, beware!", she seemed genuinely sympathetic to Malfoy after Buckbeak hurts him and thus righteously angry at Hagrid, and so on and so forth), but she never physically harmed a fly, she was not a Death Eater, and yet she winds up alone and unredeemed?

Her advocating selling Harry out even makes sense. One life in exchange for not fucking over the entire resistance? Even if she was on the side of good, I'd have appreciated /someone/ making that call. The fact that there are probably friends of hers on both sides of the fight only makes it more poignant. Oh, and what does Harry eventually wind up doing anyway? Exactly.

If people had taken Pansy's advice, Fred, Lupin, and Tonks would all be alive. Don't @ me.
