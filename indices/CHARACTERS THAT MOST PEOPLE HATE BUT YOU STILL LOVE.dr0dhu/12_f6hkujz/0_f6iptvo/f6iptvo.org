I feel like I'd have enjoyed Ginny as a character a lot more if she didn't end up with Harry. Narratively I don't /really/ like the choice (not a big fan of the 'super infatuation' -> 'relative non-character' -> 'Harry's love interest' evolution), but part of it is that we just don't see much of her.

If I had my choice, I'd have had her + the rest of the Weasley family more adopt Harry, to have her as more of a sister figure to him. Or, if going with the relationship route, having her be more of a character before book 5, with some more scenes involved (particularly at school).
