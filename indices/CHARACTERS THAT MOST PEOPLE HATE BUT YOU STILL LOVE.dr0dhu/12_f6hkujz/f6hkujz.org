I dont know why she gets so much hate but I LOVE GINNY! Im so over the fangirl trope or the love potion trope (usually found in Harmony fics ) The movies did her character no justice, I know, but the Ginny I read in the books is a badass, and thanx to some great fanfic, thats the Ginny i want to read about. And while i dont hate the character Hermione, and think no one could have played the role better than Emma Watson, I despise how the fandom has elevated her to goddess status.
