Tonks and (moreso) Lupin are fairly unpopular on this sub, but I like them both. Both flawed, both guilty of a long list of mistakes, but both basically decent people trying their best in a ridiculous situation.

Damn it, Arthur Weasley! I like you, but you living meant that Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks ALL had to take a dirt nap??? And Lupin and Tonks didn't even get the dignity of an onscreen death?
