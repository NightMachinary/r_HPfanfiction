Hey, I have bias and I admit it, but I enjoy discourse on canon that doesn't amount to "I dislike canon, so I ignore that." And I understand the meaning of it, I just dislike how it was implemented, like Ron/Hermione in book 6.

Shame the main Harry Potter subreddit is meh.

The movies making Sirius this stuck in the past figure in book 5 hurt, because his tragedy is the biggest one.
