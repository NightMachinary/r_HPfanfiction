I'd honestly forgotten about the Patronus. I do think it's a bit different from the Snape situation because (1) she's young enough that I can forgive her for being dramatic (2) we see the Patronus a few months after she gets rejected, not twenty years and (3) she knows perfectly well that her connection with Lupin is actually mutual, and that his objections are practical rather than emotional.

I can't argue the too old point because that's completely subjective once everyone's a legal adult with a career. I wish they were a bit closer in age because it's heading toward ick territory for me, too, and if Lupin hadn't been concerned about the age gap I would have thought less of him.

  The whole scene about publicly declaring her love is pretty much what sucked for me though, where they pressure Lupin into accepting her advances.

Agreed, but I give her a pass because it's an isolated incident. Most of the characters mess up at one time or another.

  I dislike Molly in book 5 for treating Sirius poorly.

At least we can be in complete agreement on this. :) Thanks for the thoughtful conversation.
