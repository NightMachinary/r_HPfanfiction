There is quite a bit of subjectivity in it, but perhaps I'm being harsh. The patronus changing to match his gave me eerie vibes of book 7 Snape.

That being said, Lupin had a point, even if he didn't believe it. He was too old for her at the time, and he did let her down easy.

The whole scene about publicly declaring her love is pretty much what sucked for me though, where they pressure Lupin into accepting her advances.

It's a bit how I dislike Molly in book 5 for treating Sirius poorly.
