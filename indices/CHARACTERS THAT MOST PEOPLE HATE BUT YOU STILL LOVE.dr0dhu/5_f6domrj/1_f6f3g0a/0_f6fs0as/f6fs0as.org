  Her "love" for Lupin is written as a creepy obsession.

I just didn't read it that way. (Hey, this is an unpopular opinion thread.)

I wasn't at all bothered by her depression in book 6. She had just been seriously wounded by her aunt; her cousin died picking up the duel when she fell. She knows that the war could accelerate at any minute, putting her Muggle-born father in serious danger. And to top it off, the man who had been a work partner/personal support to her had not only rejected her but run off on a suicide mission. Add in her well-documented family history of mental illness, and I'm not surprised that she had a rough go of it.

I didn't care for her public declaration of love in the aftermath of Dumbledore's death, but I can forgive a young woman under a great deal of stress for making a poor choice. If Lupin had said "I'm not interested, I don't love you," and she had carried on, THAT would have crossed the line to creepy obsession for me. But he didn't. He made excuses for why she shouldn't feel the way she felt... and she knew how she felt. She wanted him regardless of the age gap, the money situation, and the lycanthropy.

Maybe Lupin just didn't say "this isn't mutual" in the moment because it would have made for an awkward situation. But he didn't have to marry her or have sex with her. He could have said "no" at any time in the next few months. He didn't. And when he DID leave, he again pulled out the "for her own good" card rather than "I don't love her." In the last scenes in which Lupin appeared, I thought it was abundantly clear that he wanted a marriage and family with her; he'd just been convinced that he would hurt her.

I do wish she'd come to the final battle talking about Teddy and the cause they were fighting for rather than Lupin alone. The cut scene from the film improves upon this nicely when they see each other and do talk about Teddy. Probably the one time I think the movie does something better than the book and it gets cut, lol.
