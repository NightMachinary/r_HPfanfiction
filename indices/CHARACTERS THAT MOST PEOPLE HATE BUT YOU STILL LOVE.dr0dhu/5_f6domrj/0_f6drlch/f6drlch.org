I was super pissed when Sirius died but also mad that both Tonks and Lupin died too. I get that she was trying to do a message but they all had how many years of fighting and such? I feel like at least one of them should have survived. There was an entire book devoted to Sirius and the gang and they're just gone at the end? It just doesn't make sense. To be fair I'm probably mostly mad that Sirius died and died a somewhat stupid death. I'm reading shayalonie's Debt of Time fanfic and he gets brought back from the veil. I also have been reading Mauraderlover7's series where Sirius gets to raise Harry from the age of 8 and really takes that parental roll and takes care of him. She's an excellent writer and develops all the characters incredibly well, including Snape and Draco. Its a wonderful read.
