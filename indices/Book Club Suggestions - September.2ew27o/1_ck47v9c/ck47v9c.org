So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

Complete and wonderful and pretty long. I'm sure most of you have heard of it if not read it as it's pretty popular.

When a Magical game of Truth & Dare goes wrong, the Gryffindor Quidditch team must 'bare' up and face the consequences. And as the news spreads like wildfire in mmail things get quite out of control.

Takes half a chapter to get used to the mmail format but totally worth it. This was one of the first fics I ever read ans it's hilarious. Even if it doesn't get picked I recommend reading it, it's not too long.
