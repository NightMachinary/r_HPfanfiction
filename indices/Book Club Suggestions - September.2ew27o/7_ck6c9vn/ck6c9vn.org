I recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9807593/1/Harry-Potter-the-Geek][Harry Potter, the Geek]] The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc. Rated: Fiction M - English - Humor/Adventure - Harry P. - Chapters: 23 - Words: 65,238 - Reviews: 338 - Favs: 880 - Follows: 717 - Updated: Jun 7 - Published: Oct 30, 2013 - Status: Complete - id: 9807593

I laughed out loud almost as much as from A Black Comedy and this one is lesser known. Its full of pretty contemporary references to internet jargon and anime, totally worth a read for fellow geeks!
