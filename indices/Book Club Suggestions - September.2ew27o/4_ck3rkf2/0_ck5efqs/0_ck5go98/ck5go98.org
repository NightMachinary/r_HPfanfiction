I think you're thinking of Partially-Kissed Hero.

Dumbledore is not the villain in Make A Wish, though he does get some criticism. There are a few canon-related errors that arise from it being published before the last book was written and it's never been through an edit so there's a wide range of formatting and word-substitution errors, but it's still a hilarious romp.
