I've not heard much about the game, but it is nice to see games being delayed instead of rushed. Idk if I'll ever play the game since I don't have playstation but in general it's good development practice. The trailers look very pretty though, and it'll be fun to see some old-fashioned wizarding stuff, rather than the same era rehashed.
