I think a lot of people, when thinking about wizarding drugs, kinda jump to and focus on potions a bit too much. There is the Cheering Charm, I can imagine there are plenty of spells and charms that illicit the necessary effects on the castor (or you can invent one) that may be used by those who can't afford to buy potions/don't know how. Maybe they're better in effect than potions and are obviously cheaper.

Maybe consider those?
