So magic drugs would be able to have some seriously crazy effects. There are potions that affect the brain in extremely complicated ways, seemingly with very few side effects (take veritaserum, for instance - how does the potion's magic even begin to understand what truth is? not to mention how to entice only it? and how to force the user to answer? all this in a tasteless, odorless, colorless form?). I took the liberty of making up a few.

The Third Eye - a drug that opens someone's "inner eye" forcefully, regardless of otherwise manifested sight. They don't usually speak prophecies, as those seem to be dictated by magic itself, but it can happen (it usually favors a proper seer though). Users become completely trapped in their own mind, seeing possibilities and events playing out with no clear correlation. Withdrawal symptoms include extreme paranoia and panic. It is made by heavily enchanting a centaur's eye.

Hawkeye potion - A substance that sharpens your senses to an incredibly high degree, making you able to hear and see everything to its fullest extent, coupled with a pain reliever so you don't feel the sensory overload. See every pore on someone's face a mile away when you focus on it. Repeated use causes damage to your nerves similar to the cruciatus curse. Withdrawal symptoms are significant worsening of the natural senses beyond their initial state.

Mindscaper Charm - a spell that forcefully descends the user into a pensieve-like trance state. They can recall and experience all they remember. Withdrawal symptoms are worsening of natural memory, as well as short-term memory loss.

Repeated use of the Rennervate Spell shortly before falling asleep - can make you stay awake for nights and days on end, all while never feeling a bit tired. The effects of tiredness, apart from the feeling, still happen. Withdrawal symptoms are long-lasting insomnia which is resistant to sleeping potions.

Sands of Time - if you snort a line of this, time distorts in one of two directions for your mind. Either it moves faster, or it moves slower. The strength depends on how much you took. It doesn't have withdrawal effects, but repeated use makes it so your body starts feeling the accumulated time by aging faster/slower.

Casting a confundus on something consumable - has an effect similar to alcohol, but without making the person sleepy or poisoning them. You just become more and more "drunk" until you're too dumb to eat/drink more.
