Jesus, I NEED this fic. It's so hard to find good drug addicted (or even potion prodigy) Harry honestly. I'm interested that you're planning to have him sell them too, though - it's very like him to self-destruct, and to be private and secretive, but it seems out of character for him to intentionally expose others to something that's likely harmful. Although drugs/having with an addiction is known to alter normal behavior so I suppose that might make sense. And it would definitely increase his chances of getting caught, if that's a goal of your fic? Idk I'm very curious what your thoughts are!

As far as ideas for drugs Harry would actually use, I think you've actually pretty well covered what he would look for: happiness/cheering potions for stress and anxiety, which might lead to using the harder stuff you mentioned if he builds up a sort of tolerance. I especially like [[/u/Lord-Potter-Black]]'s suggestions of Sandman's sand, for general nightmares or for self-medicating his connection to Voldemort. That one in particular I think he would abuse to dangerous lengths. Another possibility is trying to get /into/ Voldemort's head to obtain information instead of/as well as trying to lock him out, depending on where you would want to take that.

There was one fic I read a while ago that's still one of my favorites, I'm not sure if you've read it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2301238/1/Fizz][Fizz]] by Kiki Cabou features a Harry addicted to cheering potion with unfortunate consequences and sounds pretty similar to what you're thinking.

Do you have an outline or ultimate goal for the fic, or specific scenes you're wanting to include? That could help narrow down or inspire different ideas for what drugs Harry would be wanting to use or sell and what side effects or complications might come about.
