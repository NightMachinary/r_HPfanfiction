Pain potions probably have a similar affect to opioids.

Polyjuice is also one. It's probably one of the worst considering that fact the a semi competent potioneer can make it with the right supplies. I'd be like porn where one person looks like a movie star except it would be a prostitute who physically is that person.

There's also shit like the cheering charm which sounds fine but is really pretty fucked when you think about it.
