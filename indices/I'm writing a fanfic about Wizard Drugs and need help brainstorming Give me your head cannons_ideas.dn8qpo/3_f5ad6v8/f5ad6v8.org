Cheering charms. A single "hit" is harmless - similar to how chocolate and exercise can elevate your mood. But, at 5 to 7 hits, it can cause significant euphoria.

Arresto momentum. When applied inside the ears (or nostrils? Lol), you can achieve a floaty sensation. Works better while walking.

Neutral amortentia. A love potion not linked to person mixed with a bit of firewhiskey. Slows down perception and motor skills. Causes euphoria and frequent bouts of "oh my gah. I love you." spontaneous Sobbing or giggling fits occur as the concoction wears off.

The Drunk Lion. A student favorite. A result of Lily Evans' attempt to brew veritaserum. Perfect drink for truth or dares and making your crush/friend/significant other confess their true feelings for you.

Draught of Peace. Harmless and useful for anxiety attacks and calming agitation. High doses can cause complete detachment from one's experiences/surrounding/thoughts.
