There are things they use to help them studying similar to Ritalin, Ron and Harry tried to buy something called Baruffio's Brain Elixir from a sixth year, but Hermione destroyed it, Ron also mentioned that powdered dragon claw is supposed to give your brain a boost and strongly increase cunning for a few hours.

I assume that the blood of various magical creatures also works as drugs, from Canon we know Unicorn blood and its healing effect with horrible side effects and we know Re'em blood which gives the drinker increased strength, and for all we know one of the twelve uses of dragon blood could also be as a drug.

Its not really a drug, but cheering charms could probably also be used similarly to them, with the risk of addiction being real.

My personal headcanon is that Wizards dont really use muggle drugs, since they barely work because of wizards resistance to Poisons, and that they need to involve some magic to be truly affected, so a couple glasses whiskey wouldn't be enough to get them drunk, but fire whiskey would.
