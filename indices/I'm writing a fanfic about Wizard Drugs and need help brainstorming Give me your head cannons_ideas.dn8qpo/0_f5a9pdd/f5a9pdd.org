- Something that works like weed
- maybe apart from potions there are a few magical plants you can smoke/eat and work like lsd or so
- maybe a potion that enhances your ability to stay awake to get work done
- maybe some potions that enhance your mind. You can memorize stuff better and do well in school but you get a super headache afterwards.
- a potion that makes you super calm but you also are very apathetic to all things around you
- let him deal with dreamless sleep potion but you get addicted to it
