*The Minister*

We know from Pottermore that the Minister for Magic is elected once every 7 years (unless they resign earlier):

#+begin_quote
  The Minister for Magic is democratically elected, although there have been times of crisis in which the post has simply been offered to an individual without a public vote (Albus Dumbledore was made such an offer, and turned it down repeatedly). There is no fixed limit to a Minister's term of office, but he or she is obliged to hold regular elections at a maximum interval of seven years.

Even if Pottermore hadn't told us this, the books consistently portray Fudge as extremely concerned about public opinion, something which would only really make sense if he is elected.

*The Wizengamot*

In the books we only see the Wizengamot act as a court. However, there are hints in the books that it holds more than judicial power:

#+begin_quote
  â€˜My dear Prime Minister, you can't honestly think I'm still Minister for Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I've never known them so united in my whole term of office!' said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile.
#+end_quote

Fudge was sacked before his term was up (i.e. properly sacked, not just failing to be re-elected). For him to be sacked means there must be a body with the power to sack him. The Wizengamot is the only body we know of which could fit the bill (other than perhaps the International Confederation of Wizards).

Further, the name "Wizengamot", as a play on the old witenagemot, suggests a role beyond the judicial.

Pottermore conveniently confirms that the Wizengamot acts as wizarding Britain's legislature:

#+begin_quote
  The Order of Merlin (sometimes abbreviated to O.M.) is awarded by the Wizengamot, an organisation that predates the Ministry of Magic and nowadays functions as a combination of court and parliament.
#+end_quote

*Conclusion*

We know that there are elections, we know that there is a legislature. We even know that Fudge is a member of that legislature, from his sitting on it during OotP.

It doesn't take a big step from there to say that the system is a Parliamentary one where the Minister is whoever commands a majority in the legislature, with the members of the Wizengamot being elected to the position.

The problem I have with this is that it would mean that Dumbledore sought election as a member of the Wizengamot, which rather goes against his "will not actively seek political power" characterisation.
