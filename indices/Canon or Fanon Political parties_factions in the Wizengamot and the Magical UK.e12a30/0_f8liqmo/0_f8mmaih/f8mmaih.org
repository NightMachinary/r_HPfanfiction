  The problem I have with this is that it would mean that Dumbledore sought election as a member of the Wizengamot, which rather goes against his "will not actively seek political power" characterisation.

It could simply be that Chief Warlock does not have to be an elected member of Wizengamot but serves at the pleasure of the majority. It would also explain why he could be removed so easily during OotP.
