The fact it is a judicial branch and a legislature at the same time is something that only makes sense in the context in which Harry Potter was written, which is 1990's UK.\\
I think the confusion on here comes from the fact most writers/redditors are US based, or are too young/not interested in 90's and earlier British politics.

Until 2009, the UK did not have a Supreme Court, instead the highest court were the 'Law Lords', who also sat as legislators in the House of Lords. Also the name Wizengamot is a play on witenagemot, the parliament of Saxon England.

In the context in which HP was written, it is a likely assumption JK intended the Wizengamot as both a legislative and judicial branch. Actually, the idea that is purely judicial is unlikely given the UK didn't have a US style separation of branches at that time.
