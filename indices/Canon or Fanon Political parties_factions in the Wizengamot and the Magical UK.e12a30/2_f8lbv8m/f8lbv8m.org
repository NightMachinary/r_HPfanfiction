It's fanon. or at least mostly The Wizengamot in the books is shown to be some sort of judiciary organization rather than a legislative body, and I don't remember them ever being shown to have any sort of political power. The only time I remember them being called is in OOTP to decide Harry's fate after he 'performed underage magic'. You mostly see the idea of the Wizengamot as a legislative body in Lord! Potter and Indie!Harry based fics that want to include some semblance of poltics.

What we do know is that British Wizard World is run by an elected official known as the Minister Of Magic who acts as a head of state, and the government bureacracy is known as the Ministry of Magic. You see various department heads overseeing areas of interest, and sub-department heads heading specialized departments. The MOM seems to be at least modestly corrupt under Fudge, and not really all that effecient. It also seems to be pretty male dominated, but not entirely. JKR didnt delve heavily into the structure of the MOM in her writing, and we didn't really get a good look at wizarding politics in Britain due to it being Harry's POV.

There's also the ICW or International Confederation of Wizards which is like the Wizarding's World UN, but we learn lmost nothing about it in canon.
