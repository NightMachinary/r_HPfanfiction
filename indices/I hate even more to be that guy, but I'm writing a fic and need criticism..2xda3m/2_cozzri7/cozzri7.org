Okay, a few things: the series is called "a Song of Ice and Fire", not "Game of Thrones". GoT is merely the first book.

Now, I've never read "a Song of Ice and Fire" so I can't say too much about the specific content.

But a few pointers in general:

- How did Harry (I assume Potter?) end up in this universe? This is a really really big question that needs an answer ASAP. I will forgive the prologue, but it really should have a proper answer in chapter 1.

- In the same vein: what kind of cross-over is this? A full crossover? Do you acknowledge that Harry is THE Harry from the books that traveled through dimensions to get there? If so, how? When? Does he attempt to get back? Will Hermione and Ron try to find him? Perhaps show up later? All questions that need an answer.

Other than that, I did not see any spelling or grammatical mistakes. So keep that up.
