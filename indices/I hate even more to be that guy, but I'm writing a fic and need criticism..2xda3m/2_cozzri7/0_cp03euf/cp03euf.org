Thank you for the feedback!

Game of Thrones is the TV series and A Song of Ice and Fire is the book series afaik. The events are practically the same so I'm using the words interchangeably until that changes :D

Those concerns have been raised before so resolving those are on my to-do list. In essence, he's not the same Harry, but his 'memories' will slowly come back to him over the next few chapters. I'm not sure how to explain this in the actual writing, though...

Again, thank you!
