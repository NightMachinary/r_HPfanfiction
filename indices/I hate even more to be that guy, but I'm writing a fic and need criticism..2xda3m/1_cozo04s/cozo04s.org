I'm kind of confused, honestly. I'm not sure if it's because I left off GoT after season 2, but I have no idea where we're supposed to be, or who's who. Why do we know Harry to begin with? Who is Harry? I'm assuming Potter, but he could just as easily be a minor character from GoT.

If you added a sentence or two at the beginning, just describing the room, or at least the meeting, that would really help. You could even use the councilor dude as a mouth piece, i.e., "may the meeting of the blank about the blank commence," or whatever. A bit clarifying why we care what gods Harry follows would also be helpful.

whether you want to write clearly from Harry's POV, it would probably be best to find a way to introduce him, rather than giving one of the two dudes a name right off the bat. Whether you introduce them both by one physical trait, like glasses, hair colour, height, dress sense, or general presence, you could always pan from Harry giving the introduction of the room to the further perspective of the two men exchanging glances.

or something. sorry for going off like that, but you asked for advice, and I figured I'd just throw that in there.

The general concept is pretty cool, and the pacing is good. I certainly haven't read this particular combination before, which is pretty rare, and also pretty awesome. I liked it! :)
