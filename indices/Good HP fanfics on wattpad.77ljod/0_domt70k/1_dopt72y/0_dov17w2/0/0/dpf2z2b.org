I've read a fanfic about a girl paired with Draco. The plot was good but the character is so energetic, bubbly and happy, even after losing her loved ones. She's probably a mary sue. She aso made Draco nice by being Harry's friend.

I don't know what the title is but I figured I wouldn't need to since I wouldn't want to read it again.
