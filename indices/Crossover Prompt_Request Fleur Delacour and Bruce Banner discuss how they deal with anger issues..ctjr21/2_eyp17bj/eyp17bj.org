Fleur was making her way through New York City, finished with her days work at Gringotts. Wanting a treat, she decided to head to a Muggle place she knew of nearby that served her secret pleasure... sushi. On the way there, she passed an alleyway which, at first glance, was just like all the others; overflowing with dumpsters, litter all over the floor, a cardboard house and a man getting beat up by three muggers. Wait. Fleur took a step back and peered closer, yes, that was definitely a man being mugged. Although, from his clothes, it didn't look like he had much to steal, but it was what she could hear that was out of place.

"Please, leave me alone, I don't want to hurt you!" Surprisingly, it was the man on the floor who said this, causing the attackers to pause and laugh, before they resumed kicking him. With his face towards the entrance to the alleyway, Fleur had a clear view of his face, and specifically his eyes. His face was strained, like he was struggling to contain something, but it was his eyes that drew her attention and kicked her into action; his eyes were a bright, glowing, toxic green.

"/What/ do you think you're doing?"

Bruce wasn't having a nice day. In fact, he could probably say that this was the worst day since, but not greater than, Harlem. Volunteering at the nearby medical care centre, he had just finished a tiring day where he had watched a child die of sickness and had to deal with the most aggravating person imaginable. The beached whale, as Bruce thought of him, showed up at the clinic insisting he needed steroids for his 'chronic asthma' and within a few minutes, Bruce had established this man was an idiot. He told him that, for one, he had to have a prescription, for twom they were a centre to determine and treat illnesses, not a pharmacy, and three, he didn't have asthma and his breathing problems were due to severe obesity. The whale, not impressed and threatening Mr Banner, must have caught a glimpse of his eyes flashing green, for he started ranting about freaks and stormed out with a final threat that freaks shouldn't pollute society.

So, as he was heading home, anger closer to the surface than normal, he was only slightly surprised to be dragged into the alleyway. Spotting the man from earlier, he stayed silent, used to being mugged. It wasn't until the rant about freaks and how he must have murdered the child earlier in the day that his anger levels rose too high, he called out for them to stop, but he knew they wouldn't listen and soon he would have more blood on his hands. A shadow blocked the light coming from the street and he looked up, into the scowling face of a woman.

"/What/ do you think you're doing?" The woman called, anger clear in her tone.

"What does it look like, bitch? We're putting the freak in his place and if you don't leave, you'll join him!" Instead of cowing the woman, it only served to deeper her scowl, but what amazed Bruce were her eyes; her eyes had changed to a glowing orange, like embers from a fire.

"What did you say?" She took another step forward, her voice sickly sweet. "I suggest that you leave him alone, before I teach you /exactly/ what we *freaks* can do!" Unnerved, the men backed away further into the alley, freeing Bruce to stand up and move closer to his saviour and escape.

Later on, while the woman, who introduced herself as Fleur, was treating him to sushi, Bruce decided to ask some of his questions.

“Um, Ma'am-“ A sharp glance from Fleur made him correct his mistake. “-Fleur, what made you stop and help me? Weren't you afraid they would hurt you too?” She grinned, it was a predatory grin.

“Them /imbeciles/ hurt me? Non, there was nothing to be afraid of... Well, besides me.” She smirked, picking a piece of sushi up with her chopsticks and ate it slowly. “Anyway, who were they anyway? That didn't seem like a simple mugging, it seemed more... personal?”

“I don't know about two of them, but the leader, you know, the one that looked like a hot air balloon, was causing a ruckus at the clinic where I work, his name's Dudley Dursley.” Immediately, Fleur's eyes transformed from blue to the burning orange from earlier and, were those /feathers?/ To Bruce it looked like the outline of feathers had appeared along her cheeks and hairline.

“Dursley! I should have torn him apart, I should have set him on fire, I should have-“

“Woah, woah, woah, you *know* him?” Bruce asked incredulously. Fleur shook her head.

“Not personally, merci les dieux, but he made one of my dear friend's childhood a, how do you say? Enfer? Cauchemar?”

“Hell? The other was Nightmare.” Bruce translated, knowledgeable in French, having spent time there when in hiding.

“Oui, thank you, he made young Harry's life hell-“ She slumped, anger draining away, “Harry would never forgive me if I hurt him though.” She continued eating and they spoke about inconsequential things for a while.

“So, do you want to explain why your eyes glow orange when you're angry?” Bruce asked, his curiosity getting the better of him. Fleur looked at him and raised an eyebrow.

“I could ask you the same thing, Bruce; do /you/ want to explain why your eyes glow green when you're being attacked?” Bruce looked away, and then looked back with a sheepish expression.

“Uh, ladies first?” She laughed, gave him a scrutinising look, then answered.

“It runs in my blood, I have to control my anger otherwise I turn into an avian with the ability to throw fireballs.” She looked for a reaction from him, but he only had a look of mild surprise instead of disbelief.

“Well, that makes it easier, I was exposed to a massive amount of radiation and I have to control my own anger too, otherwise I turn into a giant green beast that destroys everything around me.” She looked inquisitive and again, surprised but lacking disbelief.

“You can't control it?” She asked, feeling sympathy that along with the struggle of maintaining calm, he had to worry about destroying everything if he turned, when all she had to do was worry about being too angry to care about burning everything that angers her.

“No, I can try and control my anger, but there are situations where I can't control turning. Being attacked for example, if I'm in a life threatening situation, I'm forced to turn. I think, whatever it is, it knows that if I die, it dies, and so it will protect us both at all costs.” Bruce was, he was surprised to admit, feeling better than he had in years, and being able to talk about his issues was very cathartic.

“I may have something that can help, here, let's pay and you can meet my husband, I'm sure he would just /love/ to talk to you about all this; see, he knows someone who has experience in turning into a beast that they have no control over, we could all get together to see what helps.”
