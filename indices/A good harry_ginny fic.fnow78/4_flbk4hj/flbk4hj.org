Linkffn(The Darkness Within) This is a master piece. I was hesitant to read it due to the pairing. I'm so glad I did, it's one of the top 3 fanfic I have read. It's full of surprises but the strongest aspect is the writers ability to make readers fall in love with his character, not just Harry but all of the main players like Voldi, Bella, James, Lily, and especially Harry's little brother. It has a lot of angst, but in a good way since this saga is extremely emotional to say the least.
