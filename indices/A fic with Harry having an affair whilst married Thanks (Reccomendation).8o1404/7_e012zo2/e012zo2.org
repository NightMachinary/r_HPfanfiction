"A Harmonious Affair" by Eternity Sword: Harry + Hermione, as the title indicates.

"Pardon My French" by Tintern Abbey: Harry + Fleur, although this isn't an "affair" so much as a brief lapse of judgement that draws out into a brilliant comedic farce. Sadly abandoned, but what's there is top-notch.
