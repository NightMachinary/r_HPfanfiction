There's a fic very like that one where both he and Hermione get with Fleur while they're at Shell Cottage, and the affair(s) continue well into their adulthood, with Harry fathering the children both of them have.

There's even a kind of follow up written to it by someone else, where Harry who goes back in time to . . . I want to say his fourth year. He gets with Hermione and and kills Voldemort, then he and she go and seduce Fleur.

Terribly sorry, but I can't currently remember the names of either story, however.
