I seem to recall Harry is having several affairs in The Dark Lord's Equal linkffn(The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Insanity). Most of its by flashback or dialogue due to it being a time-travel story that is more than a little crack. The irony of the whole thing is Harry is in no way ashamed of it at any point.
