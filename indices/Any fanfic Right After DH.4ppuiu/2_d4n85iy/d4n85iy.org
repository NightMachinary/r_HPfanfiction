/Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation/ is a superb piece of writing. Unfortunately, it's abandoned, but what exists has some of the best and most distinctive writing I've ever seen in fanfiction. The "voice" is crazily well executed, and the large number of erudite references and allusions only add to the story.
