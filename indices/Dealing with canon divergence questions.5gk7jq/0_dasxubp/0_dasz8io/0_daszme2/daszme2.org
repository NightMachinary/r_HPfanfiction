You don't even need a conversation. If you are using Snape's POV, just have him be angry at the twins, and compare them to "The two bookkish Weasleys", Percy and Ron in his inner monologue. He doesn't even have to know the reason, since it's not important, only that the boy was an avid reader from teh start. Maybe mention chess as his hobby too.
