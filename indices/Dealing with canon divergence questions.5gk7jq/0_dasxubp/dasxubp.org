Maybe you could have Snape overhear a conversation about how different Ron is from his older brothers (Fred and George) and why? Like a conversation in the staff room with McGonagoll talking about how pleased she is that he's followed in Percy's footsteps instead, or something.

Personally if I was reading it, I'd rather have no explanation than a clumsy, forced one, but what I'd like best is to have a really subtle exposition, with hints dropped around so that curious readers can put it together themselves, but it stays out of the focus of the story.
