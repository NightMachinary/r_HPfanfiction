Yes, pretty much. So with that (and I will note that knowing this already puts you ahead many a person trying to write him), you just need to come up with a reason for why would he see reading books as something that would be an exception to this, or perhaps even something more. If you can think of a reason for that to happen and can put readable enough hints about that, you should do alright.
