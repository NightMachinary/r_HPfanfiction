So, basically my thought process is this.

Slight backstory, Harry gets misplaced in the muggle world and doesn't make it to Hogwarts until the summer between 5th and 6th year. Thus the divergence.

In the story, Ginny dies, killed by the Horcrux in Ron's second year. Ron spends a lot of time blaming himself, maybe if he'd paid better attention to his sister, maybe if he hadn't been so wrapped up in his own life, maybe if he'd listened to that know-it-all Granger (granted, Hermione doesn't know the monster is a Basilisk, since she doesn't have the "snake" clue from Harry, but she still spends a lot of time in the library trying to figure it out). Anyways, massive case of survivors guilt. He essentially spends a summer knowing that the Dark Lord is back (Dumbledore knows stuff and order meetings start earlier than canon), knowing that people close to him could die, and realizes that learning is less about living up to others expectations and more about surviving what's to come. It basically scares him straight. At the beginning of third year, he approaches Hermione, eats some humble pie, and asks for help. Thus, bookish Ron that's friends with Hermione.

Does that logic track?

The annoying thing is, if the story was written from Harry's PoV, I would have no issues putting that whole back story into a few conversations between Harry, Ron, and Hermione. But it's harder from Snape's PoV, because he doesn't really care about teen drama.

And of course, this wouldn't be the only change. Some of it will be easy to work in (why the Dark Lord looks mostly human is obviously because he used the diary to come back), some bits probably don't matter (Umbridge never taught DADA), but other stuff (dealing with Horcruxes and other things Dumbledore never tells Snape about) is going to be harder.
