Diary Riddle provided the body, the Dark Lord possessed himself, essentially, and merged with the Horcrux. Because yes he can feel remorse if he really really tries. Also, Myrtle's death was a legitimate accident, and he botched the making of that Horcrux because it was his first go, and it was rushed because he was using a death he hadn't planned. My headcanon has always been that the diary was so much more sentient than the others because the Dark Lord massed up when he created it and actually shoved half of his soul into the diary rather than just a small piece of his soul like the rest of the horcruxes. The also explains why Diary Riddle was more sane than the Dark Lord; the horcrux actually had more of the Dark Lord's soul than the Dark Lord himself. So technically, the soul in the Horcrux was able to feel remorse and merged with the smaller bit of soul that was possessing Quirrell, that could also kinda feel remorse for what he had become.

Uh, this is actually one of those things that is not exactly relevant to the story (all that matters in that the Dark Lord is human looking and slightly more sane, and this has something to do with the diary), but readers would probably ask the same question, and Snape wouldn't be able to explain it because he wouldn't know the details of the Horcruxes, lol.
