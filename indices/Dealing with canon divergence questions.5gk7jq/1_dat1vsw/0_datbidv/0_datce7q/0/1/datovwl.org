Hmm ... well, by itself it does make a bit of sense. But if I were to nitpick---and I presume you want me to do that because better be harsher earlier on than lost later---then that could serve as a reason for Ron to try doing something in memory of his sister but that does not necessarily translate to actually reading, and as his second year (with Lockhart and his many books and his uselessness) still happens he still has a potential reason to dislike them as a means of getting somewhere. The bit about Hermione, sure, I can accept, but her whole thing was more about studying with books being just means of getting that done rather than about the books themselves (though she did hold them in general in high regard, that much is true).

With that in mind, I'll say that it /would/ work if something made Ron think more positively about books earlier on, without making him more motivated outright, and then his motivation after Ginny's death resulted in him capitalising on this. The next paragraph is thus going to be a “Kazeto is rambling but there might be something useful in this rubbish” one.

So, the things you have all stem from lack of Harry. With no Harry in that compartment, maybe Ron would have gone further, or maybe he would have stopped there and maybe someone else would have sat there too, the way Ron had in the original story. Considering that most people are already seated, let's say that Ron did stop there, and nobody sat there with him; there is no Malfoy coming to taunt him because there is no rumour that “Harry Potter is on the train”, and likewise there is no mocking of his ability with spells from Hermione because with she only did it as a result of Ron trying to cast a spell to show it to Harry. Thus, he arrives to Hogwarts only knowing of Hermione that she'd tried to help another kid (whatever) rather than being a smart-arse who told him that his spell was wrong. He still gets sorted into Gryffindor (damned if you do, damned if you don't), as does Hermione. With Harry not being there he does not run into as much trouble as he originally had, and whoever he decides to mouth off to about Hermione being annoying, it's farther away from her because he's not talking to Harry who (in)conveniently happens to be there. Thus, the troll incident passes through with no danger to Hermione. But once they do get to the common room she does start talking about trolls because she has to show off her knowledge, and it is then that he tells her about how annoying she is. She escapes to her own dorm, but because there is no danger she simply cries alone, whilst other girls chew into him for being a pillock. The next day he apologises (since he'd proven in the later books that he can apologise for the mistakes he makes), and though they are not exactly friends the way they were, as far as Hermione sees it they kind of count that way, for as long as she doesn't nag him. Then comes the Mirror of Erised incident, with Ron losing something or whatever other excuse you could use, wandering out of the gryffindor dormitories at night with Hermione in tow because she wants to be of help, and finding the Mirror of Erised. She figures it out and tries to ask what he got so that she'd know what is it that he wants, figures out after a few days that he wants to get out of the shadow of his brothers, and suggests that since none of his brothers were accomplished in anything involving books then maybe that would help him. He discards it, obviously, because he's kind of given up by that point, and he tries to discard all the times in the next few years where Hermione's books proved to be helpful, but once Ginny dies it all returns to that question and with this being the one suggestion he has he decides to push in that direction, swallows /that/ piece of humble pie, and goes to Hermione to learn how to like books too.

If you decide that you like this rubbish then just say and I'll try to pick whatever could be good clues for the audience from Snape's perspective; and if not, well, happens, I'm not pretending that my ramblings are anything close to perfect.
