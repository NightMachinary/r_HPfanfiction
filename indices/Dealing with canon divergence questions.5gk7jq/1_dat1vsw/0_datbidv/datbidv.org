I actually don't know lol. I think I do. I know why I believe Ron acted the way he did in canon... Being the last son, feeling he could never live up to his older brothers, and feeling that even if he did succeed at something, it wouldn't actually be appreciated because one of his brothers had already done it, and probably done it better. I believe that he didn't put the effort in because he just didn't see the point.

Would you agree?
