  So my question is, what is the best way to handle this? I've considered throwing it into the story, but it seems really really forced, especially coming from Snape. I considered (and tried) throwing in a few chapters from other character's perspectives, but it messed with the flow of the story. But I worry if I just gloss over it, I'm going to end up with a bunch of annoyed readers? And much as I shouldn't care, lol, I really really do care...

Generally, it begins with the question of whether you are doing it because you care about Ron as a character and do not want him not to make sense, or whether you are doing it in order to avoid people with torches and pitchforks.

Assuming it is the former, then what you need to do is give people some kind of reference that something had caused Ron to change in such a way, and that in itself should be enough for as long as you do not do anything that would realistically make it impossible for Ron to change in such a way. That said, for Ron his unwillingness to spend time on books is something that is caused by something else, something that is a core attribute of his character, so if you want to do it realistically then you /will/ have to rebuild his character from the ground up.

I guess the thing to start with would be to make sure that you /do/ know what kind of character Ron actually is. So, do you?
