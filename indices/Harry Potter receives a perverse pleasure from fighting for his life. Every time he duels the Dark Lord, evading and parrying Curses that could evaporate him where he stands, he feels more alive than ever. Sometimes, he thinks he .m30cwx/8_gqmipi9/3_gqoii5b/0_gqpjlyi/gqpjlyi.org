Only Enemies is kinda this with basically insane harry/bellatrix that somehow get transported to another dimension. Warning, it's long since been abandoned and is very dark/disturbing, but still my holy grail of what this pairing could/should be. No redemption arcs here, just starts turned up to 11 and then goes to 12
