It's as the other user said: Rupert Grint didn't turn out that handsome although he was a beautiful kid (not in that way) while Neville's actor grew out to be quite handsome despite being a fat buck-toothed boy. It's about that time when they hit puberty that we see the switch even in the movies... with Ron turning into a comic relief and Neville turning into this badass whose only hold back the whole time had been the fact that he'd been using his dad's wand.
