I've just finished the last part of the Firebird trilogy by Darth Mars. Now the author is not everyone's cup of tea since scenes can be brutal. Expect violence, gore, death, torture and rape, although never in explicit detail, nothing that I would call graphic except for the violence. It's a very captivating world he creates though and I tore through the 3 parts very quickly. It's Harry/Multi but not in a standard fanfiction way if that makes sense, main pairing is Harry/Luna.
