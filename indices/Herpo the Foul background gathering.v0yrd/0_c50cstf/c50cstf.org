Horcruxes absolutely do not grant agelessness. They simply prevent the soul from passing on. The simplest way to avoid having a crypt-keeper type character in your story is to have them use some sort of potion that temporarily maintains vitality (like the shrinking solution that was used on Trevor the Toad).

Another way I've seen it done is through the use of simulacrums / humunculi.

Or I suppose you could just not give a fuck and say Horcruxes don't allow you to age past a certain point.
