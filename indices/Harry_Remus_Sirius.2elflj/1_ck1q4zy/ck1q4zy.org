OP, I'm not sure if this is your type of thing but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3963147/1/Once-in-a-Blue-Moon-COMPLETE][Once in a Blue Moon]] is a pretty good long fic (400k+ words) between Sirius/Lupin at Hogwarts. It follows their relationship almost exclusively and heavily features Lupin's lycanthropy and Sirius' family. Just finished reading last night, absolutely loved it.
