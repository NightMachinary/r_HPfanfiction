Completely fanon.

However, in the Muggle world we have the concept of /in loco parentis/, the legal principle giving schools/teachers the ability to act in a child's best interests in the absence of that child's parents. This principle, or something similar, is kinda necessary for a school to be able to run, especially a boarding school. So while Hogwarts students are at school, it's likely that the school has partial parental rights with respect to the children.
