The only ones I've read from your list are /Circular Reasoning, Too Young to Die, and Emperor/, and in neither of them is Harry evil --- merely immoral (granted, I don't remember that much from /Circular Reasoning/).

But in context of those stories I could recommend (descending by quality)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690][HE & the Spiral Path]]/ (fem!Harry), /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]/ (OC as protag), /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]]/ (some imported creatures and universe mechanics from Dresden Files).

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5333171/7/The-Weapon-Revised][The Weapon Revised,]]/ /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]]/ (crackfic), /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/][Evil Be Thou My Good]]/ (HP × [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser][Hellraiser,]] crackfic, wishful thinking), /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11589304/3/Blood-is-not-family][Blood is not family]]/ (HP × [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.E.A.R.][F.E.A.R.,]] crackfic) /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]]/ (TMR as protag, crackfic, wishful thinking).

There are also several stories in which the author tries to portray Harry as evil; but his character was rather inconsistent in those and the stories themselves were rather poorly written in general, so I'll skip them.

p.s. Maybe also check out /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind hunting]]/ (FUBAR ending) and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings,]]/ though in those Harry's not even immoral that much, just lacking the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill][Thou Shalt Not Kill]] bullshit towards enemies.

Oh, and there's also the /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Sacrifices heptalogy]]/ (slash in later books, but can be skipped without missing the plot) in which the overarching trope is of Harry trying to fight against corruption by Dark Magic™ while a bunch of supposedly smart characters are doing everything they can to piss himself off into the dark cookie zone.
