I like them sparingly - but ultimately I'm more likely to read a fic in plain English than I am one with poorly written accents.

Also being from yorkshire, whenever I read Fleur if it's not stated before the sentence who is speaking, I wonder who the character with the Yorkshire accent is! 'Ello 'arry, 'as tha seen tha' lass over thee-uh with tha' French-Yorkshire accent?
