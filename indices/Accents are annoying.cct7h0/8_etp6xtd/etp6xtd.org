I agree. Personally, I feel that if the reader has time to stop and be angry about the fact that Fleur is speaking perfect english, the story of the fic clearly isn't engaging them all that much. It's perfectly reasonable to write a normal speaking Fleur and expect the reader to give her an accent in their own head.
