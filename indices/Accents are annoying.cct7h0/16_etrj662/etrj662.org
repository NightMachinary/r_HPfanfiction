In my opinion a heavy accent should only be used if a character only appears very briefly, like giving Fleur a really heavy accent, but only ever having her speak one time in the whole fic, because she's not an important character in that particular fic. Or having Hagrid be barely understandable, but because Harry isn't friends with him he only has 2 or 3 lines of dialog throughout the entire story.

Otherwise accents should be toned down as much as possible, or eliminated entirely. You can always mention their accent in a quick description after the dialog, e.g. "You are an idiot!" Fleur exclaimed, her French accent adding an extra level of scorn to her already biting tone.
