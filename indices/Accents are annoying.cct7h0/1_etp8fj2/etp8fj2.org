As with anything in fanfiction it's all about moderation. Dropping the 'h' at the beginning of Fleur's spoken words gets the point across without having to alter every word like in your example. The Hagrid accent in particular grates on my nerves.

Adding on to your point I find authors who overemphasize local, more obscure slang in stories to be maddening. Post Hogwarts stories in Australia are the worst offenders of this sort of thing. Some get so enamored with emphasizing the Australian accents as well as local phrases I legitimately struggle with understanding anything the character is saying.

It blows me away that authors don't realize that these artificial barriers hurt their stories and drive away readers. I mean...good for you that you used the Australian term for 'jerk' but I have no idea what it means so you've lost me.
