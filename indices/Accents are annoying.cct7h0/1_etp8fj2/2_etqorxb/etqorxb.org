I think adding obscure slang to stories is generally a really good thing to do as it adds some colour to the character and setting. It's something I like to do, but there are rules:

- Don't to it very much; once every 20 paragraphs at most,
- Make really, really sure the meaning is completely obvious from the context. Is the meaning of the sentence still clear if the slang term is replaced with a random, made-up word?
- The slang term must be one the character would plausobly know and use, based on their background.
- Only put the slang the charater's speech, never in the bulk of the narrative. The exception to this rule is first person. And then only for some narrator characters. For example, if a story is first person from Hermione's PoV, then the author's pretending this is something Hermione actually wrote. And she would never use slang terms in writing, even if she occasionally used them in speaking. If it was FP from Ron's PoV, then you might get away with some occasional bits of slang.
