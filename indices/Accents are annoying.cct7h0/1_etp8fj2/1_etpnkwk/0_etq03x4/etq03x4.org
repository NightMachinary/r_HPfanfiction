Harry: Hey Ron, are we gonna go tobogganing today, eh?

Ron: Sure Harry, let me just get my Loonies and Toonies so we can buy some Two-four!

Hermione: RONALD WEASLEY, ABSOLUTELY NOT! Instead, spend your Loonies and Toonies on some Timmies.

Ron: yeah, I guess. We can get a double-double and Nutella beaver tails! What do you say, Harry?

Harry: ok just let me grab my Toque first, it looks pretty cold outside!
