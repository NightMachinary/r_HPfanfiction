omg yes. I tried to read this one fic recently that seemed good, but the the accenting was really out there. The character has a british accent but the author kept dropping the g like lyin' instead of lying or annoyin' instead of annoying and i'm reading that as a southern USA american accent and it just absolutely ruined it for me. I also couldn't read the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in high school for the same reason. I figure if it's a central character, use it sparingly. In the books Hagrid and Fleur show up in bits and pieces so reading their accents isn't so intense, but if they were the main character it'd be awful. In the same tune when authors have foreign language lines and you have to scroll all the way to the end to figure out what was said. like, just italicize it.
