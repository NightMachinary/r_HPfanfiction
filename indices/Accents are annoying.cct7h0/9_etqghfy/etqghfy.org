Hmm my opinion as a writer is that it is very challenging to write accents, especially if you're not that familiar with it, or the fact that English is not your first language. I agree with that, and also with the fact that it is complicated to hit the nail with Fleur's accent. You must find a way for her speech to sound french but find the correct words and phrases as not to use the h' as much and to avoid making the sentence almost impossible and tiring to read.

On the other hand, for me as a reader, it is /very/ important the british accent. I almost can't stand when people write in american accent. I've read fics in which they use american slang and it is the worst for me (can you imagine Ron saying “ ‘Sup dude” instead of “ Oi mate!” ? Yeah, thought so). I almost immediately click away because imo being immersive is one of the most important things when writing; I want the characters to feel as real as possible, and feel like I'm in England and not in Brooklyn. For example, Seamus' accent is Irish, and I believe the accent also gives personality to the character. I want to read the difference between his accent and the others because he's Irish, and not feel like everybody talks the same. I know it can sometimes be very tiring to write accents, but I much prefer a fic in which they use the phrases “bloody hell”, “mate”, “loo”, “pissed”, “piss off” than the American phrases. For me, it makes the author much more commited to the work and the fic much more real.

It is hard to nail accents, and if you're gonna write a character like Fleur/Hagrid/Tonks/Seamus, one must be an excellent writer to be able to project the accent without making the reader go nuts deciphering what it said. So my advice to that is: If you can't write it, then don't push it. If you're not that good at accents, just try to avoid writing characters that have a prominent one. It is a hell of a work to write accents, but it makes the work much better. Just keep practising until you nail it.
