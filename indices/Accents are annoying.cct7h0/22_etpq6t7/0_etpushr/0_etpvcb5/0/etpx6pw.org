Maybe. But in my experience, losing the accent completely requires active effort on the individual's part unless they're a child still in their formative years. I've also known people who have lived in Australia for decades, married an Australian and even lived in rural Australian communities (where the Australian accent is even heavier), yet still speak with a heavy foreign accent.
