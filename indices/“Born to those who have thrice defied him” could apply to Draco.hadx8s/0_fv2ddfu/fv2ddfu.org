We know that 'defied' is more specific than wearing muggle clothing (for one, Lily is muggleborn) and can be made through process of elimination - both the Potters and the Longbottoms had a son born at the ending of the seventh month, so by working backwards Dumbledore and Voldemort were able find 3 concrete instances of both couples defying him.

Draco isn't born to Sirius, Andromeda or Regulus though, which why the wording of the prophecy is so important. Not to mention that he is born near the start of the sixth month, automatically disqualifying him.
