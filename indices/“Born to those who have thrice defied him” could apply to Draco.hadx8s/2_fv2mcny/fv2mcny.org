I think you could make it work in fanfiction, the wording is vague enough that it could be interpreted any number of different ways. For example approaches implies soon but soon in terms of time doesn't necessarily mean within the next year. Canonically Harry and Neville are the most logical subjects, but the whole point is that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy it only comes true because Voldemort thinks it means Harry and continues to act on it.
