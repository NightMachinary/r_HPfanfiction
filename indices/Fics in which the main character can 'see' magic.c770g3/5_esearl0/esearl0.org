There is linkao3(Rose Petal Red). In it a self-insert is reborn in the HP world as Ginny's sister. She has certain abilities like Magic Sight and Clairvoyance but those are IMO handled quite well since they are the center of the story and the main character, not only power-ups, and are very balanced with weaknesses that come with them. The writing and story become less organized and strucutered around the end of year 3 but up until that point it's one of the best SI fics I've read. I think you'll like the story if you enjoy the first chapters (premise, writing, perspective).
