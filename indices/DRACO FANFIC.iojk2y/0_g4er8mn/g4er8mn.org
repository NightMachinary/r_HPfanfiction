logistic wise you should publish on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] and ao3. Once you have a few more chapters you can make a post about it here with the tag "self promotion"

Story wise good luck, but I am not convinced by the current plan. A big part of fanfics is to change the classical story, but here we know in advance how Drago will develop... I think it needs to diverge from books fairly quickly.
