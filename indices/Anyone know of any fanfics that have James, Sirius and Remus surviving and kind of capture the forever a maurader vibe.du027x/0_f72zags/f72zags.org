It seems that you'd need something that focuses on humour and I don't think I know of something like that. The only fic I know that has everyone, including Lily, surviving the war, is a series by aidan chase. But it has a lot of chapters from Harry's point of view. What I liked about it,though, was that the author made it clear they were a family. It does have some very amusing moments, but there's a lot of angst in the fic covering OOtP year. And it will apparently end up including all canon parings.
