It's pretty much the only thing left, apart from DLP. HPFF.com is completely falling apart, Portkey effectively no longer exists since 2010 (even though stories are still being updated), Fictionalley is full of spam, Sugar Quill is no longer being updated since 2009. SIYE.co.uk (Harry/Ginny) is still going strong though, has been around since 2003 and it's still very popular.

But in terms of a general hub for HPFF? It's this one.
