I don't know if it's what OP is looking for, but I do know what you are talking about:

His Own Man - linkffn(5453054)

It is time travel, with Harry going back to his younger self. The general theme involves Harry getting closer to Slytherin students because he wants to give them a choice. He doesn't want them caught between the impossible options of following Voldemort and following Dumbledore. Slowly and gradually, he makes an impact while also struggling to remain independent of Dumbledore's manipulations. Dumbledore isn't evil, I don't think, but he's not quite “good” either - at the very least, his use of immoral mean to achieve otherwise moral ends renders him unacceptable to Harry.

It's sadly not finished, and given the time since the last update I doubt it ever will be.
