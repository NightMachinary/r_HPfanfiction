Sorry, all. I have spent literally hours looking through my history and saved files, and can't find it. (Strangely I've learned that the word "hate" is very prevalent in HP fanfics.) I clearly remember him thinking his house is going to hate him for this, when he decides to stand up for what's right.

Here are some more details, in case it spurs somebody's memory.

- Harry really, really doesn't like Dumbledore in this fic. It might be time-travel, it might be that he learned early that Dumbledore is the one who left him at the Dursleys, or it could just be that he recognizes attempted manipulation. It might be one of the ones where Dumbledore blocked all attempts by the Muggles to remove Harry from an abusive home. Bottom line: Harry really doesn't like Dumbledore.
- Harry has played many pranks over the course of the year. (I'm leaning toward a time-travel because of what he's able to do, or maybe he just has a time-turner or elf accomplice.) Dumbledore is the butt of most of them, which has caused him to be very angry with the prankster, whom he can't identify. Of course initial suspicion falls on the Weasley twins, but they are able to convince others it isn't them.
- When the Sorting Hat is first taken, Dumbledore announces in the Great Hall that there will be no questions asked if it is returned. He gets angrier the longer the hat is missing (and the other pranks continue), prompting him to announce the massive loss of points to whomever is caught with it.
- When Dumbledore gives the extra points at the Leaving Feast, Harry stands on the table and announces that if last-minute points are given, then they must also be taken. He reveals the hat. Dumbledore obviously doesn't want to take the points, so McGonagall does it. Then he announces being out after curfew, and I think another offense. Ron is unhappy but joins Harry by standing up to announce that he too was out after curfew.

I hope somebody can track this down, because after all these hours of searching, I want to read it again, too.
