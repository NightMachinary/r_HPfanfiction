A lot of the Voldemort schemes we see in the books do rely on information security, don't they?\\
"Quirrel is being possessed by Voldemort, and is seeking to steal the Philosopher's Stone." "Ginny Weasley is being possessed by a cursed book and is releasing a basilisk to petrify students." "Peter Pettigrew is a rat animagus disguised as Scabbers." "Mad-Eye Moody has been captured and replaced by Barty Crouch Jr." "Voldemort survived because he created these horcruxes..."

I wonder what a fic with a decisively un-stealthy Voldemort would look like? Where knowing where he is and what he's doing isn't sufficient to foil his plans?
