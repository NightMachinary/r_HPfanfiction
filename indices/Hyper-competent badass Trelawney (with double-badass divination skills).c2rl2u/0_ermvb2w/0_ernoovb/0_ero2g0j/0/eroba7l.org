What kind of a plan could Voldemort possibly make that would work regardless of who knows about his plans? If that were to happen, he'd have to stage a complete and total coup of the ministry AND Hogwarts AND kill off the resistance very quickly. How large are his Death Eater forces? Anyway, Voldemort's stealth or lack thereof wouldn't matter if Trelawney could instantly tell everyone everything about Voldemort's plans!
