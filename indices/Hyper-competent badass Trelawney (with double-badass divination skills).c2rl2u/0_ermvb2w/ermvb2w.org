I would love to read a fic like that :

- 1st year : "Oh don't mind me, I'm just here to watch. Harry I hope you didn't forget your flute, this harp will soon stop to play.
- 2nd year : Hello again Harry, finally found the entrance. Better speak to it in parseltongue if you want it to open.
- 3rd year: Good for you to join us Professor Lupin, now if you could get on the side so the kids can knock out Snape that followed you with an invisiblity cloack, then we will be able to expose Pettigrew and leave. Then Black will have to fight you because you forgot your potion today, and Pettigrew will use it to escape . . . I should not have said that right?

I'm not sure how she would be able to watch Voldemort return thought (if we even reach this point considering how much of a plot breaker she would be).
