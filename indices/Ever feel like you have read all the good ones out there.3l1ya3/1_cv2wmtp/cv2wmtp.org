After about thirteen years of reading fabrication, having high standards, and generally enjoying only a certain kind of fic (Harry centric), I often feel that way.

Then I happen across a fic I've never read before, and fall in love all over again

Can't really rec any fics at the moment, laptop is dead with all my bookmarks, and running on a tablet at the moment. I will say that someone recommended Cadmean Victory, which I found borderline unreadable, even being the Harry/Fleur fanatic that I am.
