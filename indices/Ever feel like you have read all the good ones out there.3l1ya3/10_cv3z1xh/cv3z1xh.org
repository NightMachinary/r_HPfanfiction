Yes. I am a huge Snape/Hermione fan, and am constantly combing thru Ashwinder looking for more. I feel like I've read everything worth reading. I save every 'Snape/Hermione Rec' thread I find here, and see if there's anything that catches my eye. I recently read The Twenty, and found it to be a bit of a let down. I honestly don't know why is it so highly recommended.
