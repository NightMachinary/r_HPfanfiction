  Based on "Ever After". After his parents die in a coach accident, Earl Harry Potter is brought up as a servant in his own house by the Dursleys. One day, when money has reached an all-time low, they decide to sell him for taxes. As his best friend and fellow servant, Hermione, determines to save him from being shipped to the Americas, she sets off a startling turn of events. HG RH
