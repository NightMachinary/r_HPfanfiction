  In a post-Voldemost British Empire, Harry Potter rejoins society after a long period of Umbridge-enforced solitude in a manor house won by conquest. What is the Granger Institute, why do the Unspeakables want to talk to him, and just what happens if you ignore all your mail for fifteen years? Rating provisional. AU.

#+begin_quote
  Having been treated as a servant his entire life, Harry is more sympathetic when Dobby comes with his warning, avoiding Vernon's wrath and gaining a bit of freedom. That freedom changes his summer, and his life, forever. A long character-driven story that likes to play with canon.

  The war is over and Hogwarts still stands. A few "eighth years" choose to come back to finish their schooling in peace, to mentor war-weary children, and to patch together the ends of their teenage years. Hermione learns what she was missing while out with Harry and Ron, Neville flexes his newfound confidence, Parvati brews a perfect Amortentia, and Draco lets go. "M" to be safe.
