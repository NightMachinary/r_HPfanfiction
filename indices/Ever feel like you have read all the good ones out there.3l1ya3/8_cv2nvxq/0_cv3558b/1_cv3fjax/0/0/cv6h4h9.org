Then you would die (sooner or later - not matter how good your are at thinking on your feet and no matter how good your luck is!)...it's what should have happened (he dies, the horcrux gets destroyed (note: I dislike that plot device, though it has been used well in fanfiction IMHO!), someone else (no, not Neville -.-) kills Voldy and gets to be the hero (and the wizarding world changes...it does not restore the status quo like in canon where people like the Malfoys get off the hook, again! (no, they should maybe not have been killed, but they should have been imprisoned (for a - long! - time!) and fined heavily (if you add charges like threatening the governors and using the diary (which endangered every living - and dead (ghosts!) - person in Hogwarts!), then Lucius should have looked at live in prison because at that time Voldemort was not threatening him and coercion can't be argued...hell, Voldemort was (probably? - Don't remember if he asks Lucy about the Diary) furious about the diary being gone!))
