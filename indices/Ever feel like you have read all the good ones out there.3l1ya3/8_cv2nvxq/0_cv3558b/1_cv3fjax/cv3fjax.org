Well, I don't think it really is super Harry (after all, while he's good, he's not just everybody is getting their ass handed to them - and he has problems, too (social ones mostly!))...IMHO it's closer to what somebody with a madman after them would be like than JKR's books are (come on, nobody would be a damned slacker if their life could depend on knowing to defend themselves -.-)
