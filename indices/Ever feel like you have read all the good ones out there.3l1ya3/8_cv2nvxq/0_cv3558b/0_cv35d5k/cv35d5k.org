I read it because I got the notifications. Once I found the will to delete the alert, I didn't check it anymore.

I can't remember anything that happened in the story that I'm sure was that story and not just me confusing it with something else.

I appreciate the effort and I might go back when it's complete but I just can't work through it right now.
