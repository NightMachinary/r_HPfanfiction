Well, sometimes it seems like it - but then again:

I only read certain types of Fanfiction (no slash for example!) and I don't like all the pairings either (like say Hermione/Ron as the main pairing...having them as a background pairing is bad enough -.-)...and then something new comes along (or I stumble across something I haven't read), like ATM:

Cadmean Victory on Fanfiction.net (it's Harry/Fleur...a pairing I really like which could use more people writing it -.-)

=> Note that's WIP and doesn't have the required length yet, it was just to show that there's new fictions popping up all the time :)

ps: I agree that giving additional criteria would be helpful (so that no one recommends stuff you don't want to read about anyway...like for me: Slash, I always put in my requests that I don't like slash (well: main character slash - slash in the background is ok!) recommendations!)
