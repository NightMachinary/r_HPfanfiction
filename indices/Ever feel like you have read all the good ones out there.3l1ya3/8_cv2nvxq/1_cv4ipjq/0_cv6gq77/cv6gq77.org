Can't stand him in slash (and I've tried multiple times to read slash-fics...there's damned good which are well written etc. but slash always kills it for me in the end (and I don't think I am homophobic...hell, I am pro-gay-marriage, though I hate the idea of marriage itself (but everybody should be allowed to ruin their own lives IMHO!))...and I don't like Snape and Draco all that much -.- (I love it if their character is changed...like say Severitus is nice to read sometimes, as is Draco!friendship)...I just hate bullies and bigotry!

Adventure stories are the best (they don't have to involve Voldy...hell, some really good ones out there are either AUs were Voldy never existed or did kick the bucket before the story starts), as long as they have some romance (pure gen. stories bore me (most of the time, there are exceptions!) - and I started out reading those as I was no shipper when I was younger!)
