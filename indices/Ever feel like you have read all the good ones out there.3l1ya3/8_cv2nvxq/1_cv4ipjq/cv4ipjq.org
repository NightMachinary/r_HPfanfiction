I'm the same way, must be Harry centric, must not be in Hogwarts (I feel like I've read everything interesting that could happen there; there is usually a lot of railroading in Hogwarts fics and I want to read something original not a canon rehash), my current filters are -Harry/hermione, -draco, -snape, -romance, +adventure.

As I was writing this comment I've just realised I don't want to read fanfiction anymore just original works that contain magic.
