You can't find any and you've only been at it for a year? I find that to be rather shocking. I am curious what your parameters are. Personally I tend to only read 100K completed stories and are still able to find many stories. Granted, less than I used to, but there are still plenty. I have learned how to wade through so much of the crap to find the gems over the years. If you tell me what kind of pics you are looking for, I would love to see if I could help you find some. I started as a G/H shipper for a little while, then became a HUGE Hr/H and have since branched out to many other ships that I enjoy reading. H/Tonks, H/Daphne, H/Luna, H/Susan, H/Fleur, etc. Eventually you learn to branch out a bit more but you always have a soft spot for your personal ship
