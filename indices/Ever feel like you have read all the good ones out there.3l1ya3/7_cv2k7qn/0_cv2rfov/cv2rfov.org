You say you hate it, but Harry Potter is easily the most popular fanfic community with 724,000+ fics on fanfic.net alone. That isn't even counting crossovers.

Trying enjoying another fanfic community, say Dresden Files, and feel the despair when there are only 900+ works.

Even assuming Sturgeon's Law is in effect, 10% of 724k is a lot more than 10% of 900.
