the story archetype is either

1. badly written "manipulative" and "cunning" harry potter because he got abused at the dursleys
2. badly written harry gets raised by death eaters or voldemort or whatever dark wizard or witch and is dark himself and ofc AlL sLyThErInS aRe DaRk so he gets sorted into slythering
3. the occasional good fic that uses this archetype

â€‹

this one actually has a good premise for harry to go into slythering and would turn out great imo. harry is raised by dark ppl , therefore dark , and all slythering are dark thefore harry gets into slytherin , or harry is raised by dursleys or abusive guardians therefore is manipulative and cunning arent decent tropes , they could be at best slightly decent if written well but at this point they're so cliche all the stories that use them are kinda meh.
