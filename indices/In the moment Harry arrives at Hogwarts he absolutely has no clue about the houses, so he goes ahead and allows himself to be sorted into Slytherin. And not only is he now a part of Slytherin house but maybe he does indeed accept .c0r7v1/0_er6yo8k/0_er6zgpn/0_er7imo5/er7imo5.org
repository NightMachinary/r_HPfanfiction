I hate these fics where everything changed yet it's still the same. Like a Slytherin Harry where he is manipulative but : ○ He doesnt have good grades (in fact he is better than Hermione but he is hiding it because reasons ) ○ He still live in a cupboard and suffer the often worse than canon Dursleys' abuses (he is biding his time before finally showing them their place at his feet ) ○ Once at Hogwarts, he goes to Slytherin and befriends all the baby Death Eaters, but still saves Hermione at Halloween and become his best friend (because reason I guess ? )

Seriously, if you change a character, change the world around him accordingly. I want to read a Manipulative Harry where he is really a mini Riddle. Living in his own room before getting his Letter and his relatives being really afraid or wary of his "freakiness ".
