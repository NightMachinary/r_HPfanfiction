Sadly, if such a fic exist, I don't know of it. Maybe "Harry Potter and the accidental Horcruxe ", which fit at least partly (finished, sequel in production ) but I cant think of others. In fact, because I cant find a fic like it, I thought about writing one, but while "maping " the ideas is easy , it should be finished around 2050 if I keep this rythme of writing.
