Linkffn(Fantastic elves and where to find them)

Harry gets dropped off in a forest by the Dursleys and grows up in nature, talking to snakes and figuring out magic on his own. When he arrives at Hogwarts he's completely clueless, ends up in Slytherin with Draco but he prefers sleeping in a tree in the forbidden forest. Draco has to explain literally everything to him.
