My main problem with Slytherin!Harry is how rare it is for authors to actually diverge from canon in any way besides superficial (everything that happens in canon inevitably happens in Slytherin!Harry fics as well -- while understandable for the Tri-Wizard Tournament to remain which was probably years in preparation and completely unrelated to Harry, almost nothing else has reason to stay the same).
