When someone write a Slytherin Harry (or honnestly any Harry that is different from canon), he should make a list of the events, and every time see if Harry directly influence this event or not, most (if not all) of the evenements influenced by Harry should change if he is himself different.

For example, no matter how Harry is, Mr Weasley would win some draw at the end of CoS, but if Ginny doesn't survive CoS, it is unlikely the family goes to Egypt, and so Sirius has no reason to escape Azkaban.

But, a Slytherin Harry has less reasons to go into the Chamber to save Ginny, since he should not ba as close to Ron than in canon. His relation of hermione should be different, meaning he may not know about the basilisk (in fact, Hermione would not even be friend with him, since his lack of presence in Gryffidor would mean that Ron either didn't insult her that day, or nobody saved her from the troll).

It's really easy (and annoying) to fall into Canon rehash with a different Harry.
