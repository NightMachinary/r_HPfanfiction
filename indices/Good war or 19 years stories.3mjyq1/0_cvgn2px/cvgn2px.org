For the nineteen years part, try any of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]] or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][Little0bird's]] fics.

For what happened at Hogwarts during DH, try linkffn(The Enigmatic Headmistress). It's not meant to be realistic at all, but aside from A Call to Arms, it's all I've got.
