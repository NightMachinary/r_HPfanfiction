Think Kronk from Emporer'z new groove or Brendan Frazer in pretty much every one of his movies. In particular there is a trope of the villain having a really pretty and kind of wholesome henchman who isn't really into killing or most of the evil stuff the villain does. And like Kronk, they often have peculiar hobbies, like learning squirrel.
