The goal was met. A chapter wasn't released when it should have been. The Patreon donators withdrew their donations.

I looked at it. The goal was $50; the amount raised was $50. The day after the chapter was supposed to be published, the amount raised was less because (presumably) they were backing out because the agreement was breached (a chapter wasn't published).
