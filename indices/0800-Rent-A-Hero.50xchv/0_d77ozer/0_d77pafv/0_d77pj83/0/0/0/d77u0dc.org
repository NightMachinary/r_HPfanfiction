People do make money from other people's work constantly, but it's typically much more transformative content with a focus on the person who is producing it. For example, most people who play video games for Twitch or YouTube (a bit of an ongoing issue for Fair Use) would argue that the game is just a medium for their commentary, so the main focus is on them and thus transformative enough that it's fair use.

With regards to fan fiction - it's rarely legal, but many authors (including JKR) allow it. Authors (or other associated rights-holders) pretty much have the right (and some exercise it) to prevent any and all derivative works of fan fiction being published on any website. It's difficult to enforce, but ff.net would certainly be one of the first sites hit, and this is actually why it specifically doesn't allow you to publish anything based on stories by certain authors.

Apart from understanding of the rights-holders, one of the key aspects of fan fiction that has allowed it to flourish is that it's free. Monetisation is taken into account in fair use cases. Parody, satire and review are allowed, but, apart from that, you have to question if the story could stand by itself if you removed pretty much every aspect the original author created. For Harry Potter, this means characters, locations, spells, etc. The more you have to change, the less it's fair use. I'd argue the vast majority of stories on ff.net (including 0800-Rent-a-Hero) need to change pretty much everything, so shouldn't be monetised.

Might also be worth noting that smut and racism have specifically been banned by JKR, so you are breaking the law by including them. Which seems odd, given that one of the 'themes' of HP is the anti-muggleborn racism.

Morality is subjective, but I fail to see what is crazy about saying that making money off another's work is immoral.

TL;DR: fan fiction doesn't fall under fair use anyway (unless it's satirical), and exists solely because the rights-holders allow it, so monetisation just makes it even more illegal.
