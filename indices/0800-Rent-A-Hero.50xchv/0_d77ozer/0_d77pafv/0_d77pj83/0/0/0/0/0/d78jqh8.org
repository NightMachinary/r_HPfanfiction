I want authors to make money from writing, but I want it to be their own work. The vast majority of fan fiction is purely derivative and could not exist without the original work, so why should fan fiction authors be paid for it? JKR and Warner Bros would lose money. Legally, for a derivative work, they'd be owed royalties. Unless the fan fiction author has a legal agreement to pay the rights-holders 25% (the 'golden rule' figure for royalties according to KPMG) of any money made, the rights-holders are losing money. In accounting and legal terms, not getting money you're owed is equivalent to a loss.

There's also legal precedent for the fact that monetisation of fan fiction is illegal. JD Salinger successfully stopped publication of "60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye" in 2009. "60 Years Later," as a fan fiction sequel to "Catcher in the Rye," was deemed to be copyright infringement by a US court of law

Besides, people shouldn't need money to justify a hobby. It should be done for enjoyment, or why would you ever do that activity in your free time? Why should they be paid money for one hobby to fund another?

Again, morality is subjective. Without even touching on whether or not it is immoral, I think it's "completely insane" that you can't see why someone would find taking money for an illegal activity to be immoral. The fact you'd completely disregard another's view, supported with sound logical reasoning, and go so far as to insult that perception, is baffling
