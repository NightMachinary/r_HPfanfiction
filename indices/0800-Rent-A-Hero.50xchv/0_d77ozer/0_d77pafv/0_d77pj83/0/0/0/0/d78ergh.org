Again I'm not talking about the legality of the issue. Copywrite and intellectual property and everything else involved is convoluted and it comes from a time without internet. It doesn't make much sense and requires a law degree to debate. A great deal of things are in the legal grey area and fanfiction is certainly one of them.

What I commented on is how a fanfiction author asking for donations isn't immoral. Clearly it isn't. No one is being hurt, JK Rowling and Warner Bros and anyone else who owns Harry Potter isn't going to lose money because people contribute to a patreon. No one is being hurt, it is not immoral. The suggestion that it is so is completely insane.

This topic has come up on this sub before and I continue to be surprised at how people don't seem to want authors to make money from writing. There aren't enough readers to make much but even earning beer money is enough for people to justify time spent on a hobby which increases content. This is good for those writing and those reading.
