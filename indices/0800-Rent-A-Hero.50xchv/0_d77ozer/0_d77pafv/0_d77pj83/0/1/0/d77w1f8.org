Legally, it is not actually legal but people simply don't out such behaviour because they want content and if those people got a Cease and Desist order and then got fined they'd probably stop.

It's a legally grey area if you are releasing stuff regardless and only do it more often if people pay you but don't promise anything of that ilk, as you may justify it with “well, lack of money means some of my free time goes towards additional work, so if I have money I have more time to write” which means that the people are technically paying you for the fact that you write and the content just happens to be whatever you are releasing. But when you only release stuff when paid (as was with that author; do note that the fee on Patreon is per chapter you are definitely paying for the work) it stops being a grey area as you are then basically selling that work which is not legal.
