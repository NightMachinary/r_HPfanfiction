I mean, morality can be argued, the Patreon is supposed to be a donation service to support things you like. If the fanfiction was pay to read that is a bit more damning, but the author is donated money and then the product is released to the general public.

Legally I am unsure, but I am pretty sure it's no more illegal then the rest of fanfiction, which to my knowledge is indeed illegal.
