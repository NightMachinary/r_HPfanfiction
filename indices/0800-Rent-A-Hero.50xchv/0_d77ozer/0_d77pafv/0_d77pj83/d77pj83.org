See, I have no problem with authors using patreon. If people wanted to pay they could, hell I pay monthly on a RWBY writer. The thing that makes me mad is once you accept payment you have an obligation to fulfill your end of the bargain, and not doing so is super scummy to me.

The RWBY author I was talking about has 5 stories, and updates based on the patreon goal. About 5 months ago(or longer I can't remember) they hit a threshold and now updates one of those stories every week on sunday, and the other four update once every 2 weeks, on alternating Mondays or Fridays. They set a goal, people have paid it, and they deliver every single time without fail.

The author of Rent A Hero really upsets me, they set a goal, people paid, and then they stopped. If life got in the way then take down the patreon and put up a notice. If they died, well then that is outside their control and I apologize for the ill will.
