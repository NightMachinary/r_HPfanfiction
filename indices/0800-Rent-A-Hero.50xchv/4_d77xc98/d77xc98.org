The greatest tragedy of this thread is that the OP thinks Rent-a-hero is a great fic. I could say "you must be new to fanfiction, OP", but I think there's a probability of "the OP has questionable taste when it comes to what constitutes good fiction". Fanfiction expertise isn't needed to determine that Rent-a-hero leans toward the shit-tier end of the spectrum.

Certainly, there may exist a version of reality where Rent-a-hero is a great piece of fiction. Such a world is likely a post-apocalyptic wasteland where all that's left of fiction is a copy of Rent-a-hero with nothing to measure it against and everyone who knew any other piece of fiction perished in the armageddon.
