Postwar would be disappointing even if they didn't have to shoehorn CC in. Unless they disregard the epilogue entirely.

What would be interesting if they explored various "what ifs" Black Mirror style. Each episode a different scenario (eg Pettigrew is caught in 81), basically plausible canon divergence fics, the series.
