After J.K. Rowling's comments, I stopped engaging in the fandom in any way that brings her money. Basically, reading fanfic is the only Harry Potter interaction I get. I'd be hesitant to watch a show that she was involved in because of her activism.

Edit: by activism, I mean transphobia. I was kind of pussyfooting around, but it's the transphobia. [[http://www.galop.org.uk/transphobic-hate-crime-report-2020/][Considering that one in five trans people in the U.K. have been threatened with or experienced sexual assault in the last year,]] I think it's safe to say that trans people need to be protected more, not advocated against.

Do whatever you want with your money. It just doesn't feel right to me personally to support a brand that is still so closely creatively controlled by someone who is unapologetically bigoted.
