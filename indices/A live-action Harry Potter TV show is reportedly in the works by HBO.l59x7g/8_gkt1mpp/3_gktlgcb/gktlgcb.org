I get what you're saying. I guess I just don't feel the same way.

I guess I'm just able to separate the product and the creator?

I patronize Chik-Fil-A (sp) because I am a fan of delicious chicken, and that is the product I am using my money to purchase. Am I a fan of all of the company's policies and activism? No, but I'm not making a charitable donation to their causes. I'm signaling support of their delicious chicken, not signaling support of their activism.

If I started treating all my purchases not as transactions for products, but a referendum on the companies/individuals that created those products, I think I'd drive myself crazy.

That's why it's easy for me to ignore JK. JK can believe whatever she wants because I don't give a damn about JK. Just her books. The second I don't like her books, I won't.

Maybe that makes me selfish. I'd prefer to say that my life is difficult enough without being forced to give up something I like just because I don't like the person that created it.
