I understand where you're coming from. My parents boycotted Disney for political reasons all through the 90s and all it really did was alienate me from other kids my age. However, I don't feel comfortable spending my money on a product that is so closely tied with a creator. JKR's vision is inextricably intertwined with the world of Harry Potter. She still has a lot of creative control.

I want to be clear. I am in no way saying anyone is a "bad" person if they engage with Harry Potter commercially. Maybe I'd even feel differently if I had actually enjoyed Fantastic Beasts or anything that's come out in the past decade or so. But when I think about buying something, I think of my trans cousin's face. I wonder how they would feel.

Again, this is a personal choice for me. I'm not campaigning on the streets and I certainly wouldn't force anyone to give up something they love. I probably would have scrolled by if the OP hadn't asked for opinions. But not buying HP stuff feels right so I'll keep on until it doesn't feel right
