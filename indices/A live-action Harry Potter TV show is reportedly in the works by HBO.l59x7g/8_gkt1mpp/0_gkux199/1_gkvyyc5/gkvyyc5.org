I edited my original post to clarify, but "her activism" was referring to the transphobia. She is an artist whose works shape young impressionable minds and I don't want to give her further power and voice.

It's great that she has donated ao much of her personal wealth. Considering where she was when she started writing Harry Potter, she has come a long way and she's paying back into the system and society that saved her from an abusive situation. We all contain multitudes. However. This is where I draw the line in the sand. That might be different for you and that's fine. I'm not interested in taking things away from people.
