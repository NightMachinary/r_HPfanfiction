Okay, I think we've had a breakdown in communication. I have said multiple times in other comments that I wouldn't expect anyone else to not watch this show. I have also said in this thread that anyone who feels attacked (i.e., JKR right now) is not going to feel open to changing their mind. I never said that this was an issue with good people on one side and bad people on the other and I'm not sure where you picked that up.

I'm also really confused by your comment

Can you point me to where I did that?
