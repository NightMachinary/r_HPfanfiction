I think it would be cool to have a TV show set in the /world/ of Harry Potter, but not the actual Harry Potter stories. The reason for that is because there were so many iconic actors who worked on HP, and I couldn't deal with someone else playing that part.

For me, Alan Rickman /was/ Snape. Helena Bonham Carter /was/ Bellatrix Lestrange. Maggie Smith /was/ McGonagall. (I could go on.). You're not going to ever improve on Rickman, HBC, or Maggie Smith, no matter who you hire.

If they tried to do a straight-up Harry Potter adaptation, I'd constantly be making comparisons and I can almost guarantee that the TV show actors are not going to win that battle.

Now, a show set earlier than the books, perhaps in the Marauder's time, or during the time of the Founders would be cool. Likewise if they set it today and there was a new threat to face. (The benefit of this would be that you could occasionally have the original cast members drop in, because they'd be the appropriate age, in a nice bit of fan service. Except for those actors who are unfortunately no longer with us. RIP Alan Rickman.)

Either that, or you could set it in Harry Potter's time, but somewhere like Durmstrang, or even someplace like Australia, which I'm sure has a magical school. But since it's never mentioned, the writers would have plenty of scope to be original and not step on canon.

There are a lot of ways they could do this right. Hopefully they choose one of those instead of sticking with the books.
