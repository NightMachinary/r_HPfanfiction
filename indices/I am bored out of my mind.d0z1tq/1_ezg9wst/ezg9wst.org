Well, if you like, I can suggest some really long stories for you to proofread? You'd have to check with the actual authors whether they're responsive to typo fixes, but at minimum, reading them will keep you busy.

Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) and sequels.

Linkffn(The Arithmancer) and sequels.
