I don't think it's a good or a bad concept, it's a nothing concept. There's nothing inherently wrong with the idea of partial metamorphmagi, it's that nobody really ever does anything with it beyond adding a little bit of flavour to a character or explaining something that happened in canon, like Harry's haircut incident.

Given that United's star player is an overpriced Jack Cork, there's hardly a difference between the two.
