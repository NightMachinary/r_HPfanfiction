I'm not sure how having a different taste for meat, and being more moody can be compared with being a partial werewolf, to be honest - there's no transformation (partial or otherwise), and no reaction to the full moon.

I mean, the moodiness is most easily explained. He was green before, a young man who thought he was playing the hero, and finds out that no glory will be found in battle, not the kind of glory he thought of, anyway. Or the fact that he and his family are in constant danger - that can make anyone have a bit shorter temper and be more stoic.

I think it's just HS being HS.
