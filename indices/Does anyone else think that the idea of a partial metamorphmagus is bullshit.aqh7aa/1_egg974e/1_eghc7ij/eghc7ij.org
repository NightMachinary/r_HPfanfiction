  I mean, Hagrid establishes that you can be part-giant and Fleur is either quarter or half Veela, so why not different levels of metamorphs
#+end_quote

These two are by sheer virtue of birth. A metamorph is by virtue of magic, as in it's a magical ability like Parseltongue or tha ability to become an Animagus.

  why would metamorphs be binary? I mean, there are various skill levels in everything. Football isn't "not playing" or "star player of Manchester United", so why would a specific magical ability be?
#+end_quote

Parseltongue is a magical ability, so how would a partial Parselmouth sound like? Being able to speak half sentences in the language? Being able to speak only at night, or on select days of the week?

You definitely cannot learn the language through instruction, otherwise someone like Crouch or Albus would have tried asking Harry to teach them - they're both established as polyglots.

  Canon even has partial werewolves

What's this partial werewolf thing?
