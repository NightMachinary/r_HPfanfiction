I wouldn't write it myself, but I don't think it is a bad concept. I mean, Hagrid establishes that you can be part-giant and Fleur is either quarter or half Veela, so why not different levels of metamorphs? And if you want to argue that it is an ability and not a genetic trait, why would metamorphs be binary? I mean, there are various skill levels in everything. Football isn't "not playing" or "star player of Manchester United", so why would a specific magical ability be?

Canon even has partial werewolves.
