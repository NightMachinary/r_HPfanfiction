I don't like he idea of a quarter or half Veela because unless there is such a thing as a male Veela there would be no such thing as a full veela.

I prefer the idea that every daughter of a Veela is a Veela and that there is no such thing as a quarter or half or full Veela.

but we don't see enough of Victoire Weasley Fleur and bills Daughter to prove or disprove this.

I know its not Canon but I just find the idea more logical.
