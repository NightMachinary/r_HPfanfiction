You still fail to explain WHY you dislike the idea of partial metamorphmagi. Why is this idea so bad? I mean, I get why Draco in leather pants sucks, or rape which turns into love and not bloody vengeance, but not what is so inherently bad in making Harry a metamorph without the "full potential". For all we know the killing curse did the damage there.

As for the half/quarter Veela thing, just assume that Veela can reproduce through mind magic with another Veela like the Asari (monogendered aliens) from Mass Effect (or some futa stuff) and regularly with non-veela, resulting in partial Veela.
