Its mainly just the way its used like harry walks up to Tonks and is like "look what I can do" and then changes his hair or its just something that comes up on one of the terrible Goblins inheritance test and then it never relevant again.

I would love for a story were Harry changes his Hair in front of Tonks its like " That's some impressive self transfigeration kid but you aren't a metamorphmagus".(Really to me the Self transfiguration is more impressive)

In both cases its almost always irrelevant to the plot so basically chekhov's gun.
