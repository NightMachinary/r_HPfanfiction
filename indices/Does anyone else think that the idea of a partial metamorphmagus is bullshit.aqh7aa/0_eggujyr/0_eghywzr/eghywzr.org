I bet there's a bit of back magic somewhere in fanon that'll let you sacrifice Tonks for the desired effect. I'm not saying you Should do it, but magic is limitless in my eyes, so I'm sure it Could be done, if you were willing to pay the price. How does half your humanity sound? Half your magic? Half your sanity? Have your sense-of-self? Or maybe just Tonks' lifeblood and a crack to your soul.

Who knows what'll happen if you're experimenting with ritual magic. Didn't Pandora die while spell crafting? Maybe it'll kill you, maybe it'll drive you mad, maybe you'll lose sight in one eye. Maybe your hair will turn blue.
