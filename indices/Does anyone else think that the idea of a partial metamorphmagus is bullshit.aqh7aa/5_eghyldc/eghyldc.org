I like the idea of a full on Shapeshifter, and think the idea that a metamorph can turn into anything (but MUST stay humanoid) is stupid. If you can change, then you should be able to become an Elder freaking Dovah Dragon if you want to. Become Smaug or a Morrowin or a Balrog, magic is Limitless! You Can do anything, sure, there's plenty you Shouldn't do, but you Can.

I get that's to broken to exist in anything but a crack fic, but I'd still love to see it. I bet Voldie wouldn't last ten seconds against a dementor. Bet â€˜he' can't form a patronus. Happy thoughts, Heh.
