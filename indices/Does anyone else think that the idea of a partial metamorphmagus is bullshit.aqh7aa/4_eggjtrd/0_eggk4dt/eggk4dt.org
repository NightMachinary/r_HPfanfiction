I don't mind the Idea that if Harry worked at it he would one day be able to morph at the same potential lvl as Tonks that would be fine with me.

Its the Idea that Harry would only be able to morph his Hair and eyes that its the thing that really annoys me about the idea of partial Metamorphmagus.
