Firstly: AMEN TO THAT! I have Hermione hair, basically. Secondly: I do mostly agree that it is about how they want to appear, or how they don't want to appear, but I also think it's not completely within their control. If it was completely, consciously controlled by the individual, then Sleekeazy wouldn't be a thing and Hermione's hair, at least, would be a bit more manageable. I think it's a representation both of how they want to look and also their magic. Like Harry's is wild powerful, whereas Lucius Malfoy's (seems to be) controlled and refined. (Picked for the stark contrast and because I've read some things... ðŸ˜§)
