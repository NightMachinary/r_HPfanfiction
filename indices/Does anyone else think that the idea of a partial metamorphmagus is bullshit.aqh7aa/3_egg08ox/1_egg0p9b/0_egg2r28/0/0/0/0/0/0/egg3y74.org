Ah, but the restriction of her magic in Azkaban is what truly sent her over the edge. I think her magic was actually keeping her more sane and when suppressed by dementors, along with the depression they cause, she went nuts. I noticed that the portrayal of her immediately after leaving Azkaban and the way she behaved after being out for a year or so are slightly different. Immediately after Azkaban, she seems completely unhinged, then as the finale approaches, she's still a nut job, but she is more level-headed and methodical. While she's totally evil, she is more in control of herself.

I feel like we're writing the premise for a Harry x Bella, but I won't be touching that story with a 10-foot pole.
