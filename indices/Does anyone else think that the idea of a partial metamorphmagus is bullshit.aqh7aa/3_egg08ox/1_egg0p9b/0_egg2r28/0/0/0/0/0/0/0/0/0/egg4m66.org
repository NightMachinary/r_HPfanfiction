Someone who wants to murder people everyday without acting is innocent and a moral person - I would say they are more moral than someone who doesn't have such urges. If Bellatrix wanted to do so yet didn't because of whatever reason, then the push that her magic did to force her to is rather despicable. She would be innocent in this scenario just as we would say someone who was mind controlled is innocent - which we happen to have a precedent set in the canon HP universe.
