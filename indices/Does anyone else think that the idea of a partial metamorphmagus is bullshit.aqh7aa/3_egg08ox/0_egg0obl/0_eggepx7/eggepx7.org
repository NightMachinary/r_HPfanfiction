I like the idea of old wizarding families having strange or peculiar genetic traits caused by family magic gone wrong or just plain curses; the Potters have their unruly hair that always grows back in a day, the Marchbanks live incredibly long, the Dumbledores are magically gifted but with a few screws loose, Greengrasses have the blood curse but one in a generation isn't affected, Blacks are historically more prone to being Animagus but a bit insane, etc.

It's another reason for purebloods vilify the muggleborns. No family magic, no old traditions, they are sort of like wildcards when it comes to magical ability and expectations.
