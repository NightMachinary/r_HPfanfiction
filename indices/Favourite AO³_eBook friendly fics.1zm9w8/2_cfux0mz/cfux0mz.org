If I really am completely 'on the go' I just save the current chapter (for example from an email alert or just something I found while on my phone in a lecture) to my [[http://www.getpocket.com][Pocket]] and use the app. For anything else (especially as I use both a Kindle and [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flyersoft.moonreader][Moon+ Reader]]) I just download the fics from all aorund the web (mostly ff.net though) using [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] and the [[http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=163261][FanFictionDownLoader Plugin]]. If you put the library folder in your dropbox (or similar) you will always have your favourite fics at your fingertips ;)
