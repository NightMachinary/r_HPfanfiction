Looking at the figures, I think it's questionable to argue that school shootings in the USA are "one off events", but other than that, what you argue should have happened is what was happening.

The school was about to be closed, and all the students sent home, when Harry went into the Chamber.

That was because they had the first student whose life was directly in danger, and until Harry was able to explain events, no-one actually knew that a basilisk was involved at all - because the victims all were petrified.
