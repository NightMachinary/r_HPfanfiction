One thing I wonder about the idea that dangerous events would immediately result in school closure - how many schools in the US close (permanently) following a school shooting?

I mean, there are (sadly far too many) instances of schoolkids being killed in the US, but I don't hear about those schools being shut down afterwards.

Why would Hogwarts be held to such a different standard? Particularly when it appears to be the /only/ school for British magical children.
