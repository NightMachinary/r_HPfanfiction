So what I actually do is this. I use the program at [[http://www.fanfictiondownloader.net][www.fanfictiondownloader.net]] to download the fics straight to the Dropbox folder on my pc. Then I use moon+ reader pro to access and read the books, sometimes listening to them using the Ivona HQ tts engine with the British Amy voice module. I only use the ff.net app to keep track of incomplete fics that I am following.
