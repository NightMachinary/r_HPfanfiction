Thanks. I got super excited when you told me this and immediately downloaded it to start playing with it. I should have known there would be a drawback. Apparently the app uses its own tts engine instead of using the system's engine. In most cases that would be fine, or maybe even better. But I went to great pain to install an engine that sounds a lot less robotic. I may be able to get used to it, but I'm not a fan. And I don't see why they would do that instead of just using the system default engine.
