The app isn't in the store anymore. It doesn't support versions of android later than either gingerbread or ice cream sandwich. But if you can find the apk on the internet and install it that way, it still works.

Another one that's almost as good is vocalizer TTS. Unfortunately each voice is $3.99 but they do sound nice. If ivona ever breaks that will likely be my first choice.
