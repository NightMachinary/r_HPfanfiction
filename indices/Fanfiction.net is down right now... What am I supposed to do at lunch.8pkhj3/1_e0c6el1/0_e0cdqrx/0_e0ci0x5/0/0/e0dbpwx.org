My definition of slash, in this case, is anything marked with a "slash" keyword. It's not the greatest search definition but, hey, it should get /most/ things.

There are now *168,224* works in Harry Potter on AO3, an increase of 47 fics since my post 9 hours ago.

Of those *168,224* fics, there are *13,203* fics with a *slash* tag. Or around *7-8%*.

Of those *168,224* fics there are *29,616* fics marked as *Explicit* (an increase of 8 since my post 9 hours ago). Or about, still, *17-18%*.

Of those *29,616* fics marked as *Explicit* there are *3,928* fics marked as *slash*, or about *13%*.

To summarize, about *7-8%* of all stories on AO3 are marked as *slash* which almost doubles to *13%* if its an *Explicit* fic.

EDIT: I just realized I forgot to answer your question. However, there's no really good way for me to answer you. The search feature on FFN isn't a standard any archival site should strive for.

To theorize on why you may have made that observation, however, AO3 displays all of the Work you're looking for as well as ALL crossovers. Fandoms like Twilight, for instance, bring in a HUGE amount of slash. But on FFN you have to travel to each individual crossover. Additionally FFN used to heavily enforce their sexual content guidelines and MOST slash is explicit, meaning FFN over the years would naturally have less of it.

EDIT2: To clarify my point of "MOST slash is explicit":

Of the *13,203* works marked as *slash*, *3,928* of them are marked as *Explicit*, or about *30%*.

On reflection, you can't really call *30%* "MOST" but it is a fairly large percentage.
