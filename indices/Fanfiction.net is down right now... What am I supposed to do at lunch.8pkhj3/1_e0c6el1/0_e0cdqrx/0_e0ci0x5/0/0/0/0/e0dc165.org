I would say the vast majority of slash stories include the slash tag. Enough that it's not particularly worth creating some convoluted search filter to improve my statistics above.

Also, I've added an edit to my first response to you that you may find helpful to understanding your observation.

Edit: Also, it's worth noting that the [[https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Slash][*Slash Keyword*]] on AO3 encompasses more than just the word itself, but many similar keywords. AO3 does this with all their tags.
