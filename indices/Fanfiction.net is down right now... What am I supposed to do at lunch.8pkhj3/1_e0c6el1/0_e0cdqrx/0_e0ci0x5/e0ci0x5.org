That's just... not true, though.

There are 168,177 works in the Harry Potter fandom on AO3, with only 29,608 being marked as Explicit. If you assume that EVERY work marked as Explicit is smut, which isn't the case at all, then only 17-18% of the content is smut. That's hardly the "Grand Majority".
