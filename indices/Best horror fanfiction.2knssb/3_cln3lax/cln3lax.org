[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2837735/1/Temptations-of-a-Dark-Soul][Temptations of a Dark Soul]] would be my favorite of the genre although it is incomplete. Apart from that, there are maybe a handful of good Horror/Psychological Thriller fics ( [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3292913/1/Skepsis][Skepsis]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9172846/1/Deathly-Hallowed][Deathly Hallowed]], etc) which is a shame.
