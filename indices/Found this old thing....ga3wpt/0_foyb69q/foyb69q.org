I absolutely love the idea. Instead of harry going on adventures he is dragged there by harly, it doesn't have to be an antagonistic relationship more along a silently suffering friend going along for the ride. Harry is very powerful but nobody actually notices him when he is around his hyperactive, loud friend harly and he loves it. I imagine a scene where Draco comes and insults harry and his companions in the train compartment but suddenly hears harly voice behind him " Are you being a ponce again drakey?" he runs away and harly says " hmm we need to talk soon". Also considering Harry's mentality if harly remains loyal to him or at least defends him he will remain a loyal friend to her no matter the circumstances. The twins love her along with Dumbledore so they usually cover up for her as much as possible. she blows up a room Dumbledore " Ahh learning by experimenting, 10 points to gryffindor" . she floods a whole classroom, the twins take the blame " it would not do for our protege to be expelled so soon"
