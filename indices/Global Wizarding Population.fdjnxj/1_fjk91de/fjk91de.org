First off it is difficult to estimate because of how inconsistent and horrible JKR is with numbers.

However we are led to believe that Hogwarts is the only magical school in UK. Considering that it has roughly 300-400 students (40 in Harry's year * 7 + round up a bit). Secondly wizards have only a single purely magical village, which is not even a town and a single proper shopping street in London. While I am sure there are magical corners, nooks and crannies all over the place, it is still telling.

11 to 17 year old are about 9% of the total population (in UK), however due to longevity of magicals we can probably halve that. With that in mind - about *10 thousand witches and wizards in UK* does sound realistic. UK muggle population is about 66 million. Hence the ratio is more likely to be 1:6600. Bringing global population (7 billion muggles) to *roughly 1 million witches and wizards globally*.

Add to that various other magical races (goblins, centaurs, hags, house elves, ...) who don't attend Hogwarts. However all these races appear to be a minority themselves.

We don't know if ratios are the same everywhere or if they remain constant over time. Considering entire Europe seems to be served by only three schools (that we know of at least).
