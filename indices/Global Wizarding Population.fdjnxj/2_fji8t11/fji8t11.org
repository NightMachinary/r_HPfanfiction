I generally prefer a magical Britain with a population of around 20,000 to 30,000. That's a number that feels like a good middle of the ground compromise, in light of the nature of the economy, government and schooling we see.

If we say Britain's population is 1% of the global population then we're looking at 2 - 3 million wizards globally. That feels quite high - intuitively, if you were to ask me the global wizarding population without having me think of it in relation to Britain, I'd probably say around 750,000 feels about right.

Unfortunately I don't think there's any way to achieve that figure while maintaining a reasonable figure for the British magical population - not unless you say that magic is unequally distributed, with Britain having a much higher concentration of magical people than the global average. Not only is that contrary to word of god, it's also the kind of thing that would require a very good worldbuilding behind it, and I think any worldbuilding along those lines (e.g. leylines) would go against the nature and tone of the worldbuilding we see in canon.

In any event, I see the wizarding population as largely fixed and *not* a ratio of the Muggle population. I imagine there's approximately the same number of wizards in the world in 1990 than there was in 1590. In the Muggle world, the single greatest driver of population growth has been the delay between the decline of infant mortality and the decline of birth rates. But magical infant mortality has always likely been very low, meaning that wizards probably went through that demographic adjustment long, long ago.
