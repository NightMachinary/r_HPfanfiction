I think that depends on which word-of-god you choose to go with regarding the origin of 'muggleborns'.

At one point, JKR said that the wizarding gene is dominant, which would mean that all 'muggleborns' are in fact by-blows of wizards. If that were the case, then the rate of muggleborn appearance would not follow the rate of muggle population growth.

But at other points JKR has made statements that would only make sense if the magical gene were recessive. So all in all, it seems to be up to personal preference which world-building you choose to build off of.
