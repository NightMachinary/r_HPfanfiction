Hmm, doesn't the existence of half-bloods and (especially) Muggleborns throw that idea out? While there don't seem to be a stated abundance of them (though purebloods are seemingly the minority, if I correctly recall Ron saying this), it seems like that would cause the population to generally increase beyond 16th century population levels pretty quickly. Only the US, as far as we know, had something like Rappaport's Law, or the UK with out and out government sanctioned repression of Muggleborns.
