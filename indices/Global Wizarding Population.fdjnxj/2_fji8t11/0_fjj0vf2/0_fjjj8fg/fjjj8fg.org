Of the wizards we know of in Harry's year, 3 out of 34 are said to be Muggleborn (excluding Dean Thomas, who is wrongly identified as Muggleborn).

While we don't have anything like a complete list, this is the best information we have, and would suggest Muggleborns are below 10% of the wizarding population.

If the number of Muggleborns was a ratio of the Muggle population, you'd expect that by the 1990s (after massive Muggle population growth), they would have swarmed the wizarding world.
