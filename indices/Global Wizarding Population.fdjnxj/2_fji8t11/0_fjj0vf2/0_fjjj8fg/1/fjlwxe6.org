It doesn't really matter if it's a specific ratio of the muggle population at all. As long as the wizarding population not a closed system - which it's not - then the population will tend to increase over time, barring the issues I mentioned. It's not just Muggleborns, half-bloods from partnerships with Muggles factor into this. As Ron said, if it weren't for this group, wizards would have died out already.
