Considering the numbers of roughly 0.1% of the population then Britain's wizarding population in 1991 would be 57 440 000 /100/10=57 440

Doing this with world population would be 5 375 000

While I did once think that the 0.1% was a legitimate thing, it apparently isn't [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Wizarding_world#Behind_the_scenes]], but it is a number that I would say I'd rather work with as it's small enough that you could reasonably manage tho think it'd go unnoticed but still large enough that one could have fun with it instead of counting heads everytime something happened.

If one were to take Rowlings 3K at face value then Wizarding Britain would be at the cusp of a demographical disaster. 1K is apparently students so not too bad yet. But considering the amounts that died throughout the books and it seems like the population would be down 500 people by the end of it. That might not seem like much, but 3000/500 is 1 in 6 dead
