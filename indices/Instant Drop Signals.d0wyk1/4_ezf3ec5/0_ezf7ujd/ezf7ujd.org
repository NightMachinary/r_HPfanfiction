Why wouldn't Snape listen to Freddie Mercury? I remember older fics where Harry is all emo now and namedrops anachronistic bands because the author is obviously a fan, and that was cringy, yes, but I totally see Snape listening to Queen. Aretha Franklin is a less obvious choice, but not beyond the realms of possibility either.
