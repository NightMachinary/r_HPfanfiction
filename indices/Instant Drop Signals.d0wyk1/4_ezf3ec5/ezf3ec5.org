- Coherent summaries. I take them as a sample of the writing style of the fic inside. If you can classify your own story with a trope label (dark!Harry, pureblood!Hermione) then it's a hint the story will be tropey.

- Point of view. I prefer third person limited, past tense. The same tense format as the books. If a fic diverges from this format, it had better be good.

- Interesting premise or divergence point. If the first chapter is a rewrite of Mr. and Mrs. Dursley were proud to say they were perfectly normal, it's a red flag of a story veering hard into the stations of canon. How about starting where the actual plot begins? Eg, Lockhart's wand doesn't backfire, Snape doesn't get knocked out in the Shrieking Shack.

- Americanisms and anachronistic pop culture references, or Muggle pop culture included because the author likes it. I read one fix where Snape talked about listening to Aretha Franklin and Freddie Mercury and it was too weird. I could tell it was the author speaking, not the character.

- Elaborate translation guides for every single chapter. *$$Parseltongue speech$$*, /regular speech/, you know you've seen it. Fuck, it's eye cancer.
