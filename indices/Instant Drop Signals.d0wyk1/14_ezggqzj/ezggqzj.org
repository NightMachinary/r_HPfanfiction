I have very low standards on the quality of fics (if a fic is really low quality, I'll probably drop it after a few chapters, though). However, while quality isn't a standard of mine when it comes to instant dismissal, there are other things that are.

- Bad grammar/spelling errors/etc.
- Mpreg. Stealth-mpreg (when it shows up in a story I've picked up without being marked from the start) will on top of this also make me really annoyed at the author.
- Creature fics (As in, the concept of "creature inheritance", not merely the presence of creatures in a fic).
- Fics with bad endings or with unresolved angst, if I am able to sense it. I have spoiled last chapters in fics in the past to make sure there isn't a bad ending before, and will continue to do so.
- Good guy/Death Eater (or Voldemort), main focus or not. Exceptions: Draco/anyone, main focus only if Draco has a clear redemption arc. Snape/any /female/ who isn't a student (past students are OK), except Minerva.
- Major ships which I avoid as main focus on top of what I already mentioned: any slash, any femslash, Hermione/Ron, Nymphadora/Remus, Lily/James.
- Romantic ships that involve more than 2 persons at the same time.
- Fics which portray SS as devil incarnate, or a saint. I'd rather him not have any presence at all if he's going to be put into an extreme.
- Soulbonds interfering with romantic ships. I don't mind the concept of "compatible magic affinities" or similar shenanigans, as long as it isn't interfering with their free will to choose who to love romantically.
- Manipulative!Dumbledore that deliberately sacrificed the Potters. While I dislike it in general, only this particular choice generally results in an instant drop.
- Unhappy oneshots.

Beyond this, I mostly choose what to read or not on pure whim. One story that I might have utterly avoided and scrolled past one day might get a proper look another day.

My proper preferences are larger than this, but these are the main ones that results in instant drops when not followed. For example, I don't like bashing, but given how unfortunately common it is, it isn't an instant drop.
