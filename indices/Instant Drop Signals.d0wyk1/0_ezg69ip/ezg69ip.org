In no particular order:

- Atrocious orthography\\
- Names misspelled (Imperious Curse, Prewitt, etc.)\\
- I'm-Smarter-Than-Rowling-And-This-Is-Why-Canon-Is-Stupid -- fics (most commonly time travel)\\
- Needless bashing\\
- Teenagers outsmarting everything and everyone\\
- Compound names (Especially if they're extensive, a mouthful, and annoying. Sadly, they all are.)\\
- Nargles
