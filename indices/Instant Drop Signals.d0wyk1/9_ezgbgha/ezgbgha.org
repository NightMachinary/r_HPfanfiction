Ron bashing, just to get him out of the way

I understand a Hr/anyone pairing depends on rewriting the Hr/R relationship so that it doesn't evolve the way it does in canon

I've read fics where he's depicted as a sloppy, angry, stupid Neanderthal who has an irrational hatred of anyone from Slytherin

I prefer fics where the relationship just hasn't worked out for whatever reason and they move on as friends

Having said that, I love Romione as a canon pairing so my standards are high
