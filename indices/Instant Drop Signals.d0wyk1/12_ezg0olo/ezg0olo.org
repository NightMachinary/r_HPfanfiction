- Friendly Goblins

Some exceptions can apply, but not to the point where the character is pretty much sworn in to the Goblin nation and can get away with just about anything because Goblins run everything. They run a bank, not an all-in-one government building... and it's likely they don't care about Wizards no matter how long one can remember the name of one of them.

- Thrown in Azkaban

Unless the story has a /very/ good reason, I just can't accept Harry being tossed into it... especially when it's likely he's only going to get stronger when he gets out (likely for no reason beyond because the author said so...) also using the word Durzkaban can see me drop a story pretty quickly.

- Slash for Slashes sake

Not a huge fan of Slash/Yaoi/whatever you want to call them stories. If they're in the background and it's not shoved in my face every couple of sentences, fine... but sometimes it's like they're thrown in there just because the author thinks the characters are cute together.

- Snape/Student

I get that Alan Rickman made the guy likeable and everyone loves a "was really good all along" character, but I just can't see this guy actively dating anyone he's ever had to teach... or just about anyone else either. Sure throw a bone for him every once in a awhile with someone who can appreciate his Mastery of Potions, or is just weird enough to get past his personality flaws, but not a student he's old enough to be the father of.

- Entire chapter of buying cool stuff you'll likely never see again

Yes. Interesting. Fantastic. You've managed to write several thousand words of picking out clothes and other inane objects with insanely useful features nobody has ever had before. You've also managed to lose a reader if they haven't skipped that entire chapter (or skimmed it.)

Can't think of many others... but there's likely some more.

Linkffn(2829366) has several hilarious interpretations of some of the above stuff. Best part is that it was written in 06 and is still possible to find most of them still being applied in stories today.
