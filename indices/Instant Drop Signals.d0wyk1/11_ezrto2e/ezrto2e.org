*Seemingly Random Things that Result in a Dropped Story.*

*Do note before list, I have checked pairings I don't read Slash m/m, she is old enough to be his Grandmother( Unless he travels back in time), or transformed girl Harry with boy or the other way around. (I do not mind Feminized characters as long as they were born that way in story.)*

*Well for me I have check list before I'll even open story, then another before I read it.*\\
*1. Look at title are all words that should be capitalized done so?*\\
*2. Summary, does it exist? (None of that I suck at summary shit)*\\
*3. Summary, Proper capitalization (Mostly Names, and the Letter "I" when it is a word.) 4. At least 1k words per chapter (Prefer 2.5k Words) and at least 10k words already written.*

*Story Itself.*\\
*1. Paragraphs, no text wall, no multiple people speaking in same paragraph.*\\
*2. Sentences, Proper capitalization, (First word, Names, and the Letter "I" when it is a word.)*

*Reading.*\\
*1. Soul Bonds that Force things. (Sex, Emotions, Freedom)*\\
*2. The word mate used when describing a relationship (ex. Ginny is Harry's Mate)*\\
*3. Stealth Slash or author refuses to say if story is going to be slash or not.*\\
*4. Main character Rapes someone of their own free will.*\\
*5. If I'm reading a non-pwp harem story, no more then six girls( though I prefer 4 max)*\\
*6. No teacher/student relationships before 5th year or 15/16 years old.*\\
*7. Normal age 1st or 2nd years having full on sex with anyone. (Some stories start school at 16)*\\
*8. When authors give Harry a boost but it really changes nothing. (Harry still goes to Dursleys, listens to Dumbledore, Padfoot still dies, etc).*\\
*9. When Dark Harry becomes Baby Killer Harry or Joins Voldemort.*\\
*10. Non-Willing Slavery (Some people are Subs, some like full on Slavery as long as it is their choice)*\\
*11. When Authors boost Voldemort when Harry gets stronger because they must be equal. ( Really? Voldemort 50 years of training learning vs Harry a School boy and Tom gets a boost because Harry gets stronger?)*
