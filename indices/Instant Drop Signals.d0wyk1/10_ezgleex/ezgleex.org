​

mine depends on the Genre?

In general -

Any story where a the authors prejudices, thoughts etc. bleed through and don't fit the story<looking at you for the love of magic. which i found OK outside that near end>. Any story that basically takes a characters negative faults to 11< spinal tap!> disliking a character, painting them in a negative view or even high lighting their bad sides can be well done. but yeah.. bashing for bashing sake. no. Though i am not the best writer? and am not a master of grammar? not even using spell check or something. and finally making a char so oc, why name it the char. While i love some twists on chars. If Luna becomes a dark evil slytherin with quirks hiding in raven claw? do your own OC

​

If smut-(yes i admit i read it) anything with the kids to young right out the door and hidden kinks/etc. as someone said before. Hidden mpreg, beast out the blue etc. I am a perverted bastard, but jesus. also writing that's horrible porn you can tell written by someone whose well. not experiencing it lol
