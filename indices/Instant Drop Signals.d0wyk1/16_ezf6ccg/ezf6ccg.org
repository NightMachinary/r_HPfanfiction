- Weak pathetic Harry. I can't stand it when people are rude or obnoxious to him (Snape, Malfoy, whoever) and he does NOTHING.

- Dumbledore's bitch Harry. I would like him to become independent if not immediately at the start then at least through the story.

- Dumb Harry. He has to read books and learn dueling at the very least instead of wasting time with MoRon.

- Asexual Harry. He must be interested (and successful) with girls, preferably more than one.

So many fics make him a loser even more pathetic than in canon, what's the point? I hate start reading a decent looking fic and finding out that he doesn't even beat Quirrel or tell Snape to piss off. Or he meets girls he's interested in but nothing ever happens or he gets cucked when they go out with others.
