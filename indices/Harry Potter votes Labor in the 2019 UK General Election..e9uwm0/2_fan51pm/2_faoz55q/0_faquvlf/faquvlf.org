Obviously. Survival, fighting for your life, growing up, friendship, realising adults have faults and even people you look up to can make mistakes, doing what is right instead of what is easy.

There are obviously parallels about racism in today's society. However, it is not the main point of the series. Far from it, in fact. And real-life politics like labour vs conservative are never discussed or even mentioned. And if they were the series would have aged terribly. Stop bringing real-life politics to entertainment. This is not the place to push your agendas.
