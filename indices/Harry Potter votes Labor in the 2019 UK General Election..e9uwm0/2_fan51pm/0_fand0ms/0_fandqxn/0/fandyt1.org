In Britain voter ID has been trialled on a very small scale but is generally not a Thing. Given the basically non existent level of voter fraud at polling stations there's no point. When I voted yesterday I told them my name and address and that was enough. If I'd told them someone else's details and they'd already voted it wouldn't work, and likewise if the real person shows up later after I've stolen their vote then provided they could show who they were then my earlier vote in their name would I believe be invalidated and a police investigation opened.
