Gandalf's a walking deus ex machina and, were he in the "real world" of Harry Potter, would best be described as a literal angel. Tolkien's magic "system" is metaphorical and mythical and driven entirely by the needs of the story. If the story needed Gandalf to win, he'd just use the music of the ainur or some shit to unmake Dumbledore.

HP magic is just as bullshitty, but there's still some underlying mechanics (wandwork, potions, runic artifacts, etc.) that would constrain Dumbledore.
