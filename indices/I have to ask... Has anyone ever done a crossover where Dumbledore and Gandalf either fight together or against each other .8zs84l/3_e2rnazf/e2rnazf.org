I recall a fic that may have had the title "With a little help from my friends" where Dumbledore gets the help of Gandalf and Optimus Prime in resolving the events of Half Blood Prince. With a premise like that, you can see that this fic is crack. It was also written right after HBP came out so no Deathly Hallows events were ever mentioned.
