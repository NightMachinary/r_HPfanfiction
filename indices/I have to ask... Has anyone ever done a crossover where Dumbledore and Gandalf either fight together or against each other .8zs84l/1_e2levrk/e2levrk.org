I think Dumbledore and Gandalf would be much more likely to just sit down and have a long chat about various things.

Neither of them strike me as very likely to want a fight -- Gandalf is more temperamental, more snappish and quicker to anger, but he's in no way quick to violence. He generally prefers to try and talk sense into people before a fight even becomes an issue. Dumbledore, likewise, is never the first to draw his wand; he only fights in defence of himself and others and usually not with lethal force. He's unfailingly polite and friendly, much more so than the pedantic and occasionally surly Gandalf, and he never seems to take offence at anything.

Even if there was a minor misunderstanding between the two, Dumbledore would defuse the situation by apologising profoundly and ask Gandalf if he would care to join him for a cup of hot chocolate or maybe some particularly fine honey mead that he recently purchased. And Gandalf, not being unreasonable by nature, would agree to solve things peacefully.

Now, what the two could accomplish TOGETHER, that would be something to write a fanfic about!
