*Tom/Harry:*

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/266699/chapters/419431][The Love of a Good Wizard]] by SweetSorcery

History of Magic has something to teach after all, and two resourceful students decide that the key to having any future at all lies in the past, and in Tom Riddle's heart. Assuming he has one.

Then he did it, setting the nib carefully down and imparting his darkest secret: /Perhaps I should have let the hat sort me into Slytherin like it wanted to. Gryffindor friendship is a fickle thing./

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]] by MayMarlow -- /ongoing/

There are no rules in a war, Harry knows, when he decides to go back in time to be the father he thinks Tom Riddle should have had. Except that nothing goes quite as planned, and the rules of what's proper and what's not are twisted and tried by Tom, who is ready to do anything to keep Harry by his side.

*Voldemort/Harry:*

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/Dreams-and-Darkness-Collide][Dreams and Darkness Collide]] by Epic Solemnity -- /ongoing/

How different would Harry be if he was given a life without the expectation of saving the world? How different would he be if his hero-complex was still intact, but so twistedly dark, that he has to go through desperate means to hide it?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9591343/1/Some-Other-Beginning-s-End][Some Other Beginning's End]] by Beloved Shadow

Harry reveals the fact that he is a horcrux to Voldemort during the final battle, and Voldemort decides to keep Harry safe and protected. Knowing that he and Voldemort are the only two people who will live forever, Harry distances himself from everyone but Voldemort, and develops a growing fascination with the man and his dark, peculiar, ways.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1161859/chapters/2360947][House of Snakes]] by flitterflutterfly -- /ongoing/

At 30 years old, divorced, and headmaster of Hogwarts, Harry Potter doesn't have the life he'd always dreamed would come after defeating Voldemort. A chance discovery in the Chamber of Secrets allows him an opportunity to go back in time and change some things.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1485385/chapters/3134746][47 Days to Change]] translated by snow_owl01 -- /ongoing/

An unfortunate tale of one man's failed attempt to mold young Tom into a decent, law-biding citizen. Instead, as Fate will have it, young Tom grows up to become the same twisted psychopath, who is hell-bent on winning the love of his adoptive father. Harry's consent be damned.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2526410/chapters/5614550][A Beast's Virtue]] by Arliene -- /ongoing/

Schooled at Durmstrang, forced into political upheaval, pursued by dark and light wizards alike, Harry Potter becomes a leader and icon for his entire generation, thus turning the Dark Lord's attention to him - A tale of intrigue, bloodshed and manipulation coupled with an unhealthy fascination with the enemy.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/294722/chapters/471501][Train to Nowhere]] by MayMarlow -- /ongoing/

In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supermacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

Yours, in Murder by Pain au Chocolat (MayMarlow)

A series of frequent murders in London leaves SOCA and the Scotland Yard helpless... Eventually the case is handed over to a group that has never failed in an investigation before: the Mugwumps. Psychiatrist Harry Potter with his team of investigators must solve the case before another murder occurs... but to do so he'll have to face his past and the memory of hatred that has haunted him ever since his childhood - he'll have to face and ask help from his worst enemy... Tom Riddle. ---- This is no longer online but I have the PDF; shoot me a PM if interested.
