There's the [[http://hplvslash.tumblr.com/][The Harrymort tumblr]] with useful links, and there's [[http://ao3feed-tomharry.tumblr.com/][this tumblr]] that tracks the [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter*s*Tom%20Riddle/works][HP/TR tag on AO3]], so it may be easier to go through if you dislike the AO3 search page. I have no idea whether it tracks the [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter*s*Voldemort/works][HP/LV tag on AO3]] or not. Also, The combined search results can be viewed [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Harry%20Potter*s*Tom%20Riddle%20%7C%20Harry%20Potter*s*Voldemort/works][here]].

#+begin_quote
  Harry's main goal for his time spent at Hogwarts College was to get through it without any trouble, as a normal student hanging out with friends and doing well in class. Nowhere in his plans was he supposed to end up rooming with the prestigious, or pompous prick in Harry's honest opinion, vice-president Tom Riddle. But it seemed fate's plan took a higher priority over his own and that just happened to involve tangling the lives of Harry and Riddle into one chaotic mess.
