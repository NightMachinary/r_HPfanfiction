This post is a /monster/. Have fun ;D

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8988616/1/In-Somno-Veritas][*In Somnio Veritas*]]. You will not be able to read anything else for like a week after reading this. Nothing else will be able to compare to how heart-wrenchingly amazing this fic is. It just.... Takes your heart and tears it up and puts it back together and it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my existence. I'm not good enough with words to describe how amazing this fanfiction is. It just is. It's just beyond fanfiction. I can't.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8648528/1/][Mirrored]] I just got recommended yesterday and read last night (well... Early this morning). It was a little bit like In Somnio Veritas, in that it was 100% about Lord Voldemort, not Tom, and in Harry being so full of love and willing to put up with a lot in his effort to heal Voldemort, and I enjoyed it a lot. But it's not In Somnio Veritas. It's just not. /Nothing/ is In Somnio Veritas. That fic is in like its own dimension. And you can still easily continue to read other fanfic after the end of mirrored.

The one where they settle on the moon is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/Xerosis][Xerosis]], it starts off fun but personally I'm not a fan of the moon or space or sci fi. But it's better than the one Carnivorous Muffin wrote about [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][Ubik]] because that one makes me feel like I'm sitting next to a dementor when I read it, and I just couldn't handle it anymore. Xerosis was supposed to be a shipping fic but the author said it wasn't working out for her so it ended up being more preslash.

The parasel one I'd think is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3532054/1/Paraselenic][Paraselenic]], which is long and complete and Harry/Voldy, so that's good, but it also has an annoyingly depressing twist just before the ending that I don't like. It gets resolved, and there's a happy ending eventually, but I think the fic could have done without, so I haven't read it in like.... Three years? At least?

I adore Athey's fics, even though she only has one completed fic (with an incomplete sequel) and appears to have stopped writing entirely, but it's /completely/ worth it. She's /amazing/. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Descent into Darkness]] and the sequel [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6367096/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Breeding-Darkness][Breeding Darkness]] (which someone on AFF has [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600095379&chapter=27][adopted]]) were her first fics I read, and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] is also amazing. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8116678/1/Professor-Monroe][Professor Monroe]] has a different characterisation of Harry than her other fics, but I liked it a lot anyway. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7048321/1/The-Pocket-Watch-that-Changed-the-World][The pocketwatch that saved the world]], or whatever that fic is, is a really short little story idea from her, but it's still really funny and I liked it :D

I think [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7552026/1/Liquida-Tenebris][Liquida Tenebris]] is similar to Descent into Darkness, in that the basic premise is Harry + Dark Magic = Harry/Voldemort. The beginning is fantastic, for some reason I adore dark magic addiction fics, and I like it because in this fic, Voldemort is pursuing Harry (unlike in Descent of Darkness). But, I always decide the 'end' is at chapter 37, and anything that comes after that just doesn't exist. I think the end of ch. 37 makes an ok ending D;

I've also been reading [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6592361/1/Words-Fail][Words Fail]] recently, which is like.... Everything I ever expected in a time travel fic, pretty much, except Abraxas Malfoy and Tom's empire. I mean, Tom is still obviously in charge, but he's not exactly the same /undisputed emperor/ that he is in, for example, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5736901/1/Past-s-Player][Past's Player]] by the Fictionist (which is another fantastic one, but looks like it'll never be finished). I think, in Words Fail, the best part is how strongly Nea Marika's characterises her secondary characters. She doesn't let them be just cardboard cutouts - especially Avery is fantastically characterised. And LeStrange isn't a loser :D unlike in PP.

The sequel to Past's Player (well, really PP is the prequel...) is complete, and fantastic. I got scared when I read other people's reviews about how well [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]] portrayed a psychopath and how Harry was enthralled with him, I was like oh no, what did they do -__- and both the author and the people recommending it were careful to remind everyone that it's /not slash/... But that's bullshit. They're not making out, but that's about it. It is one of the most emotionally fulfilling relationships I have seen in a story, sex or no sex. I mean, they called Xerosis slash, FF is way more slash than Xerosis despite the author saying no slash. So.... We can call them biromantic, even while they both insist they're straight. This fic is amazing. Just read it. Please.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2240236/Little-Miss-Xanda][Little.Miss.Xanda]] has written both [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8195669/1/The-Rise-of-a-Dark-Lord][Rise of a Dark Lord]], which is epic-style, and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10486840/1/Young-Princes][Young Princes]], which is guilty-pleasure style. I haven't read her other fics, but I love those two, and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9290286/1/Death-s-Son][Death's Son]] looks like it might be interesting from the summary, though I haven't opened it yet. Rise of a Dark Lord is about Harry if he were raised differently and sorted into Slytherin. He is the Dark Lord rising. He catches the fascination of Voldemort, first as Quirrel, then as Lucius's business associate. It's incomplete, but still great. Young Princes is about Harry and Voldemort's children accidentally coming back in time and getting their parents together a few years earlier than they previously were. It's really cute. Also incomplete.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4088363/1/Hollow-Thunder-Vital-Lightning][Hollow Thunder Vital Lightning]] I think has a really good Tom. I haven't read it in ages, so I can't write a lot about it, but it's a classic Harry going back to Tom's time fic. Tom is made appropriately genius enough, and although I can't remember if he's as emperor as he is in Past's Player, he's definitely boss.

I completely forgot about [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5081493/1/Burning-Desire][Burning Desire]], which is..... Okay. There have been both better and worse Harry/Voldy fics. Basically, Voldemort no longer wants to kill him, is trying to win him over to his side, and he finds out Ron and Hermione don't like him, which pushes him over to the Dark Side. But I'm pretty sure it was written before light!bashing became such a cliche. He spends the summer training in Little Hangleton with someone else who Voldy got to switch sides from the Order.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4791550/1/An-Idle-Mind-Is-The-Devil-s-Playground][An Idle Mind is the Devil's Playground]] is about the time when Harry is banned from writing to friends in the summer, so he starts exchanging letters with Voldemort. Both of them are funny in their sarcasm. Voldemort begins to grow possessive over him. Harry is oblivious. I don't think they've gotten together /yet/, though I haven't checked in ages, but they both know they will eventually ;) it's basically just a really light-hearted humour fic, nothing epic-length or dramatic or anything.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5874614/1/New-Divide][New Divide]] by Aisling-Siobhan (who I love) is a really interesting premise - basically that Harry is the reincarnation of Anathema, Voldemort's dead lover, (this will feel really weird for anyone who's read Good Omens...) and he starts getting Anathema's memories. I don't think I've read another one like that, and I haven't read this one in ages, but I'm pretty sure the ending is sweet.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2289300/Paimpont][Paimpont]] has amazing fics, her writing style is /so unique/. I first read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6655266/1/To-Kill-You-With-A-Kiss][To Kill You With a Kiss]] in high school, foolishly didn't go back to check the author. It's a time travel Harry goes back to Tom's time, very much a classic in my opinion. It has pretty much a happy ending. Then, I recently discovered [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7985679/1/To-the-Waters-and-the-Wild][To the Waters and the Wild]], which is about a Harry raised by fairies and aware of his horcrux going to Hogwarts. He's so sweet and naive, he has very little idea what humans get so worked up over, and it's /adorable/. That's really the best word for this fic, is /adorable/. It was amazing enough that I luckily went to check out the rest of her fics, and you should too ;) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8828401/1/The-Dance-of-the-Dreoilin][Dance of the Dreoilin]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9683102/1/The-Flaw-in-the-Plan][The Flaw in the Plan]] were just /adorable/ oneshots (Paimpont is just adorable in general!) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7241394/1/Surrender][Surrender]], if I'm remembering which one it was correctly, was fantastic..... [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6021134/1/A-Twist-in-Time][A Twist in Time]] was cute, and luckily had a happy ending, thank god.... Just go read all of them! Paimpont's fics are like cookies. They go quickly and you can't eat just one. (She also has the best titles....)

I've read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7471063/1/All-For-Show][All for Show]] a bunch of times, although it's a bit disjointed. I just can't get over Harry's obsession with Voldemort's scales ;D

I know I've forgotten a whole bunch of fics, but I'm starving, so.... I hope you find stuff you like here :D
