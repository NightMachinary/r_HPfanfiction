  Death of Today: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402147/1/Death-of-Today]] (Technically the main character isn't quite Harry, but he exists where Harry was and Lily is his mother) Harry and Voldemort have a very antagonistic, competitive relationship. Dreams and Darkness Collide by the same writer is also fantastic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6996054/1/Dreams-and-Darkness-Collide]] Their relationship is extremely compelling - their interactions are more like a game with each other.

  Not slash, but I'm sure you've read the classic - Prince of the Dark Kingdom. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]

  Mirrored [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8648528/1/Mirrored]] - is absoloutely fantastic, hilarious to begin with and epic at the end. The only good!Harry I've seen paired well with Voldemort.

  I haven't read Little Seer recently, and don't remember it at all, but the name popped up for some reason, so check it out if you run out: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8347216/1/Little-Seer]]

  Quite a lot of the stuff by Batsutousai [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/577769/Batsutousai]] is quite great:

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10724291/1/Stand-Against-the-Moon]] As with Xerosis, the writer is fantastic for a strong Harry as an equal to Voldemort.

  Not slash again, but worth a mention for being pretty cool: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8704528/1/Enveloped-in-the-Darkness]] It has a sequel now, too.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290286/1/Death-s-Son]] Death's Son - Harry was killed by muggles, and goes back in time to do it all again with less muggles and more killing. Another Harry being an equal story.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8808516/1/In-a-World-Gone-Astray]] In a world gone astray. Harry struggles for vengeance, but the dark lord has more sinister plans. Antagonistic relationship abound - Harry is very much determined to kill him.

  [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/294722]] The train to nowhere. Really very good, centres around Durmstrang and has delightful curious aspects of Harry's relationship with a certain empty train station.

  [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/689909]] The spellmaker. Harry loves latin and is a spellmaking genius.

  [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/838184]] Hit the ground running. Not slash.
