I don't remember the exact quality of this fic, but I do remember liking it, a little.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1485385/chapters/3134746][47 Days to Change (a translation)]]

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter and Tom Riddle are nemesis, born adversaries, prophesied leaders of opposite fractions. 2001 to 1932, forty-seven days to change the fate of the Dark Lord. This is a 'Harry travels back in time to raise Tom' story. An unfortunate tale of one man's failed attempt to mold young Tom into a decent, law-biding citizen. Instead, as Fate will have it, young Tom grows up to become the same twisted psychopath, who is hell-bent on winning the love of his adoptive father. Harry's consent be damned.

It used a tired cliche and remade it into something interesting, but its also dark and creepy. Even if it is dark and creepy, I remembered that I did like it.

On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things. Rated: Fiction T - English - Humor/Fantasy - [Harry P., Tom R.

It has the HPTRjr. in a bracket, so it might mean that its going to become a relationship in the future. Right now its only some funny and entertaining ramblings. I recommend that you give it a go though :D
