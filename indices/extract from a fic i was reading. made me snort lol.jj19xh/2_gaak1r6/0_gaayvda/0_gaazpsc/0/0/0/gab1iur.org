so i just checked shockingly, there are currently [[https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=word_count&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Draco+Malfoy%2FRon+Weasley&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][1257]] works on [[https://ao3.org][ao3.org]] for ron/draco :O

which isnt a massive amount when you consider that theres little over around 250k harry potter fanfctions on ao3 alone.

however if you were indeed hinting at writing a snarky one shot between the pair, please go right ahead because i would literally love to read it ;)
