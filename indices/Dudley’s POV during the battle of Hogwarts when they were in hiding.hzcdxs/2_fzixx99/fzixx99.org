Linkffn(Dudley Dursley and the Quest for Truth)

This is a great fic for what it is. It struggles a bit in that it feels like it's trying to name drop every named character, forcing them in when it doesn't always work. But overall worth the read. I also have a very weird memory of this fic having a lot more at the end of the fic, but maybe I'm just imagining it.
