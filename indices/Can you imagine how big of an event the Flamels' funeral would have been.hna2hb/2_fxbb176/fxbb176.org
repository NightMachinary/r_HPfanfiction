I always just imagined the funeral being a smallish event where most of the mourners are close friends or high level officials that couldn't be kept away and the flamels just chilling in the background in disguise enjoying the show until dumbledore spots them towards the end of his eulogy and after finishing quickly drags them away because the whole point in “destroying the stone” was so that they weren't in danger anymore and they show up to their own funeral
