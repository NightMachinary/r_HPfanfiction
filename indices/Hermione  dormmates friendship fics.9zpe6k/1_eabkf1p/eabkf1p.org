I've recently discovered linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16304039/chapters/38134826]]). It's a fem!Harry fic, with strong female friendships all around (not just dormmates). Mostly fluff.

Incidentally that fic really made me angry that there aren't many good "The Tonks adopt Harry" fics.
