If you want inspiration on how it could be done:

Casters:

Magazine in the gun handle is the spell rod.

Bullets are all the same, a cheap material with a simplified runic inscription that links a target to the gun.

When a link is made the effect of the spell rod is applied to the target.

Lobbers:

Basically airsoft guns with potions in the balls.

Blink Guns:

Teleports the projectile forward in time. Mostly an assassination tool.

Painters:

Puts a temporary runic tattoo on the target. Mostly a police weapon to paint magic blocking runes and tracking runes on targets.
