so you think but imagine someone with some sort of automatic riffle with a 500 round drum of enchanted bullets charmed to reduce weight until impact and explode maybe even some sort of runed shrinking charm that releases on impact and is loaded with 500 kg worth of TNT in an explosive of your choice how long do you think a wizard could hold up to non stop explosions on their shield probably 100 times faster than usual casting no need for superiority when you have overwhelming firepower just keep a wand in hand and apparate around with gun of doom
