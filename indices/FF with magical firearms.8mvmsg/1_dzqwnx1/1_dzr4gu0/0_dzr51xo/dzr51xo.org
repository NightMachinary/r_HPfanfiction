Well, sure, if you want to kill stuff, it'd work pretty amazingly, but wizards would be used to the sheer 'I can do anything with a wand' to spend the time it'd take to create one. It's just the difference in the mindset of muggles and wizards, where wizards don't have the drive of necessity, as they have an easier way to do things, if not as good a way.

If you talk about some fic more muggle based, I think it'd be plausible, and I think it's been done well in some fics by DobbyElfLord, so maybe check it out.

Also, I have no idea why, but I'm thinking of linkffn(Bungle in the Jungle). Did it have such a concept?
