I muse on magical firearms as an alternative to wands now and then.

What I keep coming back to is that they have the big downside of not having the versatility of a wand; no transfiguration, no charms, just enchanted bullets or possibly some lasers.

But on the plus side, they don't require magic words, concentration or focus, or any major gestures; just point and fire. Which means they could be used in conjunction with a wand, or used by beings untrained with wands.

So, imagine if you would, Harry walks into the Death-Eater-controlled Ministry, his wand in his right hand, a laser-pistol of sorts in his left, and a couple more varying weapons on his belt.

When the fight starts, he evades to the side, raising an earthen barrier with a wave of his wand; with his other hand, he fires a volley of piercing hexes at oncoming foes, with a magic cape displacing his image and making him harder to target.

Bell-like chimes ring out, the hexes being reflected by Shield Charms, while returning Blasting Charms chip away at his earthen barrier. Outnumbered, Harry stows his piercing-hex-gun and pulls out a handful of statuettes from his pouch, tossing them with a brief command 'fly'; the statuettes instantly turn into a gang of giant birds, ordinarily time-consuming and distracting to summon with a wand, and swoop down on his foes to draw their attention.

With a crash, Harry's barrier is finally blown apart, but he's already raising his wand again; casting a powerful shine charm, he shields his eyes as a massive sphere of light blinds his foes and blocks their view of him. Ducking down and scuttling for cover amidst a volley of blindly thrown spells, he pulls his next trick out of his belt, magma grenades, and tosses them.

Within seconds, half of the floor of the Atrium has been transfigured into red-hot lava, ensnaring and painfully burning the Death Eaters there; several of them manage to reverse the transfigured floor around them, but several more are rammed and knocked over by the surviving birds, being horribly scorched by the lava, and throughout it all everyone has lost track of Harry Potter, who has re-drawn his piercing-hex gun and is silently sniping at those still-standing Death Eaters whilst they're distracted by burns, birds and blinding light...
