I like it. What if said firearm was from Judge Dredd? Can you imagine Harry with the red X helmet?

Harry going through his rounds, taking shelter while bogged down by Death Eaters:

"Expelliarmus!" (Empty)

"Stupefy!" (Empty)

"Petrificus Totalus!" (Empty)

"Incarcerous!" (Empty)

He sighs then tries one more.

"Reducto?" (Fully loaded)

Harry goes on a spree.

Haha. Possibilities are endless.
