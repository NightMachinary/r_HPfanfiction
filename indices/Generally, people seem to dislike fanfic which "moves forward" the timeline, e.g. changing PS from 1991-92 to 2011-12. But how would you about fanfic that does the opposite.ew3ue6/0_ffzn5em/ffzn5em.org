I wouldn't say many people outright dislike shifting the timeline. I think a lot of people strongly dislike pointless or silly change.

What often causes the dislike of time shifting are stories that change the timeline wholly, so they can have Harry listen to an ipod and the author can tell us how cool Harry is for listening to a certain song and what that says about him as a person. It is irritating when the timeline is moved just so the author can natter about their favourite band. I would also say that it's the same dislike of change that leads to people looking down at a lot of wandless magic fics. Any change that tells you more about the author than the characters is probably a bit hamfisted.

If you move the timeline for a good reason that adds to the story then go for it but the reasoning has to be clear. Trying to be too mysterious about why you've changed the timeline can lose readers, readers invest nothing in a fic, so they have nothing stopping them dropping it if they think it is stupid.

To make a sweeping generalisation, people dislike bad writing.
