sometimes, you need to shift the timeline for crossovers, like for example with Stargate. The interesting and "setup" parts happen when Harry's still in school or extremely young, and if you wanna write about an adult Harry that joins the Stargate Program as part of the all-magical team, then you have to shift one of them. I actually prefer shifting Stargate into the future, because those characters don't have the extreme attachments to historical events.
