The thing is that, because the series takes place almost entirely on the Wizarding side, the timeline on the Muggle side is almost completely irrelevant. Time-shifting things to enable the use of technology (standard caveat: as long as it's done well) can work, and a lot of crossovers almost require a time-shift.
