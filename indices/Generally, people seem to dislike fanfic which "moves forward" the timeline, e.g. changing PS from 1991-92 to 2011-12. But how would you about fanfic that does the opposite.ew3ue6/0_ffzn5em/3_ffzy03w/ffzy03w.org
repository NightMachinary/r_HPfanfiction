I agree to an extent - but I can also see an argument for shifting the timeline if the author is more comfortable writing in a contemporary setting.

After all, the original series was just set in what was at the time the present - and, interestingly, I believe that it targeted a very different feel in the UK compared to abroad (IE, that it was meant to feel very 'real' in the UK, with a lot of familiar elements - and then abroad, a lot of that familiar culture aspect got rolled into the wizarding world).

What I mean by that is that if someone would rather not have to look up what was available in the 90s for muggles and just write them all with smart phones and the like, the Wizarding World is generally removed enough (and long lived enough) in relation to muggles to make shifting it back a few decades not a big deal in my book.
