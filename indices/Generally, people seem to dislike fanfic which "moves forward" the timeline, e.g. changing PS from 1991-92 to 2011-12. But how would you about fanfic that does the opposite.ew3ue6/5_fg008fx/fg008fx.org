I wouldn't like either variant to be honest. If the marauder era is 1970s, the fic has to be set in that time because it's that time I want to read about. If I wanted to read about something in 1930s, I can pick up an original novel and do that. I think I'm just very picky when it comes to this. I can read time travel, but I strongly dislike time shifting.
