Well, it takes more research and diligence to write a fic taking place in 1961 and prior, because most fanfic writers haven't grown up in that time period. They grew up in 21st century. And quite honestly, I don't want to read about Harry's texts and social media posts. The magic in the series is about meaningful connections and real-life adventures. Not to say that doesn't happen anymore but...that's not why the timeline is being bumped. Otherwise they'd just leave it in the 90s.

Personally, I'd read the heck out of a story that pushed back the timeline. All of my stories are set in pre-canon 1940s. But the reality is most readers aren't into that because they can't relate.
