What if you rewound it /way/ back? Like, before the statute of secrecy, before the muggles had steam power and during the early days of the British Empire? Or maybe even earlier still, perhaps shortly after the founding of Hogwarts itself. Maybe Slughorn learned potions from Salazar Slytherin himself? Maybe Dumbledore is Gryffindor's personal protege? You could do a lot with that.
