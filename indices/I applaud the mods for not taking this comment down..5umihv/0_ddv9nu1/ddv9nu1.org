So, you posted a thread asking for creepy disturbing fics whose authors should be on watchlists, then you're offended when someone calls out an author who writes creepy, disturbing fics? He does, and everybody who's a regular on this sub knows it.

It was reported once.

Based on your account being a couple days old, your comments in that thread and you now posting this one I'm pretty sure you're GryffindorTom's sockpuppet and were baiting exactly this kind of thing. And if you're not, you're a troll. So kindly fuck off.
