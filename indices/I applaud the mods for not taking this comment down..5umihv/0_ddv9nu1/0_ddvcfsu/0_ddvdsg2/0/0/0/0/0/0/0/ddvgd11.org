That works, as long as there is a VISIBLE response. Otherwise people will assume that calling someone this or that slur is OK. In the long run, you'll either keep getting reports because people break rules "less excessively", or people will assume that you approve of that stuff.

A simple comment how something breaks a rule, for example, will take care of that problem, and show that you are actually responding - and will inform readers that yes, that comment was breaking a rule, even if the comment was not removed for it.
