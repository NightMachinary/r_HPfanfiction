You shouldn't remove every comment that could be interpreted as a rule violation - but you should remove every comment that does, in your opinion, violate the rules. That's your job as a mod.

And yes, it certainly is annoying - been a mod myself on another forum. But if you have rules, you need to enforce them. Consistently.
