So, I think you have a different perspective on this because you don't actually have to deal with the reports. A lot of them are not the kind of thing you're describing. They're people reporting someone who argues with them or criticizes something they like or for just.. no reason I can discern whatsoever. It's pretty annoying.

Sometimes someone will go overboard in an argument and start calling someone stupid or something like that, and I feel downvotes and warnings are a better way to deal with that. I've already said I probably handled this particular instance the wrong way, but that doesn't mean I should just start removing every comment that can be interpreted as a rule violation.
