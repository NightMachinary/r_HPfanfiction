That's pretty much saying "Homophobic/racist slurs are allowed, as long as they don't really cross the line". I might be biased, since I just re-read the wiki article about lynchings, but "mob rule" should never replace "mod rule".

Imagine a school teacher telling you "Oh, I don't care about bullies unless they go too far, since usually, the other students will deal with bullies".

Yes, a number of slurs will get downvoted - but insults? If aimed at outsiders, people will vote them up, as seen in the thread that started it - 36 people voted the comment up. I think that pretty much shows a failure of your system.
