The original request was for creepy and disturbing fics. There are certainly plenty of those to go around. The title was a bit over the top, but It didn't seem to merit removing.

Maybe I should've removed herO_wraith's comment, but I didn't consider it an attack... possibly due to my own bias. Everyone around here knows that his fics fit the creepy and disturbing description, but linking to his fics would have been more appropriate than calling him out.

And as a note, I also don't remove most comments that are reported, only extreme violations or repeat offenders. I generally let votes take care of it or give a warning.
