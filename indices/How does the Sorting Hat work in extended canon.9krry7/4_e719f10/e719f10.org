What does extended canon mean? Pottermore?

I know JKR planned to have equal shares in the early versions of book 1, but I would assume that idea was scrapped, given that it doesn't fit the final version and was absolutely unjustifiable setting-wise. It's hard enough to manipulate the houses into being internally consistent without putting further strain on that poor wretched hat.
