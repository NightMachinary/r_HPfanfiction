Time magic fuckery. The hat already knows beforehand where each student is to be sorted and any alteration that needs to be done on-the-fly can be compensated for and won't have a significant impact.

It doesn't hurt that the hat is free to choose the reason for sorting any particular child into one house or another - "this house will benefit your development", "you show the qualities of that house"...
