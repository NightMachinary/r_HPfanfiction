1. I'm sure there are slight differences in the number of students in each house every year, due to the number of students being indivisible by 4. Likewise, the hat probably attempts to make sure that no house has an obviously disparate sex ratio but doesn't get to concerned if they aren't exactly equal.
2. students are first sorted by personality, but obviously no one is just made of personality traits that embodies one house - and reasonably complex mixtures are probably a question mark anyway - and are what I expect solves the issue of student imbalance in houses.
