I feel like its better this way honestly. With how much the Hufflepuff is made fun of for being "useless" im sure over time the house would barely have students in it for not wanting to be made fun of. Same with Slytherin it had a reputation of breeding dark wizards according to the students and eventually that would dwindle out as well. You said if theres 20 potential Gryffindors the keyword there is potential. They have potential in other house as well and can fit in to those one as well. The hat wanted Harry to be in Slytherin because it would be the best for him but when Harry asked it to put him in Gryffindor he did because he would do well there also. Theres exceptions to the rules. But whether you choose to make it part of your canon is up to you. If you dont like it just leave it out especially since it such a small part of the universe.
