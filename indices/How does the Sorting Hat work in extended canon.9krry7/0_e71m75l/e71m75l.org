We know of "fate manipulation magic" already - the jinx on the DADA position, which guarantees that events will conspire to oust the DADA Professor. Felix Felicis might be considered a type of "fate magic" as well.

So the Sorting Hat could be another example of this: fate itself is manipulated to guarantee that the numbers will always work out just right.
