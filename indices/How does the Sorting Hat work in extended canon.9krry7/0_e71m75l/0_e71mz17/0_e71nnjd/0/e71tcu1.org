That's a fair objection, but I'd look at it the other way around --- those grave events were happening /anyway/, would have happened regardless of whether there was a Jinx on the Defence Professorship. Given that both Snape and Moody were closely associated with these big and dangerous events, it only makes sense the Jinx would "pick" circumstances related to these events to kill or oust them, simply because those were the most statistically-probable way for these people to lose the job/their lives.

This is, of course, assuming luck-spells will gravitate towards more likely ways of achieveing their good or bad effects; but that seems a plausible conjecture; after all, no Defence Professors, to our knowledge, died through all the atoms of oxygen in the room spontaneously migrating to the ceiling, leaving only carbon dioxyde around their lungs (a turn of event which is technically possible, just vanishingly unlikely).
