The thing is, the events which result in the exit of the DADA teacher are sometimes (if not often) the result of events on a grand scale as well. Fake Moody and Snape stand out in particular as individuals whose exit as DADA teacher coincided with events of great importance.

This is why I don't really see the DADA jinx as a "bad luck spell" - it can go beyond the bad luck of a single individual to coincide with events occurring beyond the walls of Hogwarts and involving the fate of wizarding Britain as a whole.
