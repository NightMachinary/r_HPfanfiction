  We know of "fate manipulation magic" already - the jinx on the DADA position, which guarantees that events will conspire to oust the DADA Professor. Felix Felicis might be considered a type of "fate magic" as well.

I'm kind of surprised you're putting these two on different footings. I always thought the two were precisely the same type of magic --- /Felix/ forces good luck, the Jinx on the Defence Professorship forces terrible luck, same basic principle.

The theory that the Sorting Hat works the same way... is not bad, I suppose, though I'd rather go with the "slightly prescient" explanation, because manipulating what the personalities of the new generation of wizards are going to fundamentally /be/ seems to me to be a much greater, much more god-like type of fate-manipulation that merely encouraging discrete events corresponding (or opposite) to a particular individual's wishes.
