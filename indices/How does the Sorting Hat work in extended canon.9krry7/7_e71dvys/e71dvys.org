To make that work the hat has to be at least slightly prescient, doesn't it? We know that magical artefacts aren't necessarily fixed in time - time turners are the limit case, but the Mirror of Erised can predict how you'll look in a few years' time to give you an image of yourself with the Quidditch Cup and Head Boy's badge, Foe Glasses can predict the movements of enemies at least slightly and there may be others that I'm not thinking of.

So, the Hat is able to shift its data-gathering outside linear thermodynamic time so that its decision matrix is populated before the sorting starts by its foresight of how its readings of and conversations with all of the incoming firsties will go. It sorts them all and then goes through the ceremony to populate its dataset back then with the data it has predicted right at the start, at the same time announcing the decisions it made before the sorting even began. Enough kids are, or ought to be, edge cases between two or more houses that it can divide them evenly.

We also see the Hat issue warnings about future events, which is also suggestive that the Sorting process involves at least some prescience on the part of the Hat.
