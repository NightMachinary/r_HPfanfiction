  the Mirror of Erised can predict how you'll look in a few years' time to give you an image of yourself with the Quidditch Cup and Head Boy's badge,

I dunno, I thought the Mirror's aged-up versions were probably more like photo-realistic extrapolations of how the kid might imagine himself to look like, as opposed to actually fitting what they'll end up as. I mean, we're explicitly told that the Mirror "does not provide true knowledge unknown to the viewer" or something like that, so it would be a bit off if it /was/ a reliable source for one's future appearance.
