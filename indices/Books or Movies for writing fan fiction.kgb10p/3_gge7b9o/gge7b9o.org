The main reason you should read the books/audiobooks is to see how characters develop through them, especially if you want some self inserts/another POV from canon/another adventure from canon(aside from the fact you like the universe and want to be immersed in it). Movies are great as a standalone thing, but books are canon (sry not sry).
