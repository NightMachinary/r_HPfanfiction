My thoughts of the "Greater Good" Dumbledore's endgame is for the society of Wizarding Britain to survive with as few loses as possible.

After the first war /a lot/ of wizarding familes got exterminated or almost exterminated (Potter and Bones being the two noticeable ones, Prewett if you are a little bit of a researcher). The death toll was enormous for the overall population.

JK had 40 people a year at Hogwarts (At least initially) during Harry's years which would be end of war time. That is not a lot of people in a school when you have Britain and Ireland to pick from.

Dumbledore in my mind is also an academic and not a fighter, a "General" sort of fellow rather than a soldier. He chose to send Newt Scamander against Grindelwald. He had his Order of the Phoenix against Dumbledore, not once but twice.

If Dumbledore could use Harry as a sacrifice to save the overall wizarding population (This includes Death Eaters and their kids) then it would be "For the Greater Good".

The problems as a writer in this scenario is that if you want a somewhat (1st Person)3rd person perspective from Harry's POV then Dumbledore will be seen as "Evil" because the man who wants to sacrifice you will automatically be just that "a threat to your life".

Now, that doesn't mean that people sometimes (Myself included) don't go too far with it... (Still embarrassed about my first depiction of the man) but that is the preface of it.

To Dumbledore and every other politician it becomes a numbers game. How can we end the conflict with as few people dead as possible.

The whole cloak and dagger part of the situation (Ministry take over, Both Dumbles and Voldes had spies don't even lie to me) lead to a few high profile assassinations, Bones, Scrimgeour, Bode, Burbages (Or whatever that Muggle studies professor was called).

The highest number of deaths was in book seven and there was only ONE large scale battle in the entire canon series. For a civil war that is rare if not impossible (And this is all after Dumbles fucks up and dies to the horcrux-curse).

​

"Greater good" is an oxymoron. It justifies doing bad/evil actions for good results. Sacrificing Sirius to get Voldemort into the open when Fudge is being an ostrich is a "Greater Good" result. Was it on purpose? Speculation at best. Making Harry die so Voldemort dies as well? Speculation at best. Sacrificing a small number of people instead of launching open warfare? That's also a "Greater Good" decision.

Canon Dumbles is just suspicious. (And JK is not at fault for this as much as just the limitation of world building).

1) Why is Remus Lupin the only werewolf to ever attend Hogwarts?

2) Why does Snape get to stay to teach when he clearly isn't good at teaching and therefore screws an entire generation of potion brewers?

3) Instead of sending the philosopher's stone back to flamel in the beginning of book one he builds an obstacle course three eleven year olds can get through to lure out Voldemort? Endangering an entire seven years worth of magical people. If voldemort did a massacre EVERY magical in seven years would have died.

4) He knows that Tom Riddle opened the chamber. He has had fifty years to find out that Myrtle (Same last/first name) is the dead girl from the first time. It isn't rocket science to find out it is a basilisk. Talk to the spider, talk to the ghost and hide that specific bathroom. Buy Mandrakes from outside of the castle or something. Like there are so many things where something or someone gets sacrificed to teach Harry something or test him.

5) The Portraits would have spotted Sirius in his dog form. Dumbledore knows about the entrance from the shrieking shack. He made it for Remus. After Halloween where Sirius gets into the castle it isn't that hard to check if Sirius or someone else has been in the shack.

6) The portraits again. Unless Crouch froze them all or blind folded them when he put in Harry's name in the goblet then Dumbledore should have found out. He does nothing to stop it. He needs "Hard Proof" of Voldemort's return. Fudge fudges that up but the idea is there.

7) Umbridge. I don't care what people say if enough evidence was found against her then people could and probably would do something against her. That or Dumbledore just doesn't have time anymore to be a proper teacher.

8) The Horcrux Curse was a fuck up. He wanted to see Arianna. He planned to live and now his grand Horcrux hunt has to be performed by Harry instead of himself. I don't think he actually minds dying all that much. Snape killing him is a two fold thing. One he doesn't know how the alligience of the Elder Wand works when it comes to a cursed artifact (The ring) and second he wants to make Snape an unquestionable person in Riddle's eyes.

9) Book 7. fuck it.

​

That's the basis of the whole Greater Good Dumbledore. IMO it's just cynical writing of an already suspect character. We get the fairy tale grandfather in canon (Except Skeeter's book and because it is Skeeter we don't trust it) and in fanfiction people write the other side of the coin with cynicism and skepticism. People don't lie until they are caught in a lie.

Dumbledore's endgoal is the survival of magic. (Death Eaters and non-death eaters alike).
