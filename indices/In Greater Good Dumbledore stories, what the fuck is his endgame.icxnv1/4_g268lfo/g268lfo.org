I think the original idea of Greater Good was to justify killing/harming people in order to achieve the betterment of society. Grindelwald used it to justify starting his war to create a society where everyone lived in peace, with the wizards leading at the Muggles obeying. In fics, it's just Dumbledore being evil for the sake of being evil.
