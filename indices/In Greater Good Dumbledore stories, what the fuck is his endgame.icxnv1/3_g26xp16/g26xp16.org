IMO, "Greater Good" Dumbledore has two issues that concern him. 1)He wants the Light to win in the fight with the Dark, and 2) He wants to be the one that takes all the credit - and rewards.

Dumbledore defeated Grindelwald, and was made Grand Sorcerer, Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump for it. He has held the titles (and their power) for decades. Power changes a person. By the time Voldemort showed up, he has become accustomed to it.

Then he realises that if Harry defeats Voldemort, the wizarding community will take his power and titles and give them to Harry. Dumbledore does not want that to happen, hence manipulation and talk of the "Greater Good" ie it is for the Greater Good that Harry went to the Dursleys, as they would make him meek and submissive, therefore easy to control.
