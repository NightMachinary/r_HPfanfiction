Greater Good Dumbledore makes sense in the context of him using people as chess pieces and being willing to sacrifice individuals for the "greater good" (i.e. how he thought things would go with Harry until Voldemort used Harry's blood to revive himself). It can even be used to explain some of the more irrational decisions he makes in canon, as well as him keeping information from literally anybody who could use it well

Unfortunately, most fanfic authors take it well beyond that. I would love to see an indy!Harry who has Dumbledore as an antagonist to himself, but have Dumbledore actually want good things for the Wizarding World, and not the nonsense currently out there.
