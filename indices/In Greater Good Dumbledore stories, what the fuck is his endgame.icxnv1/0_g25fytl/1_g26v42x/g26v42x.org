  Actual Greater Good Dumbledore

I don't think it's that clear cut, especially since "the greater good" is rather nebulous. By our morales he may have acted the way you described, but that phrase can mean anything from eugenics to a "we need a war a decade to keep our people sharp". Or that the weak have to serve the strong for the greater good. I'm even pretty sure that Hitler thought that he was acting towards the greater good, despite his atrocities.
