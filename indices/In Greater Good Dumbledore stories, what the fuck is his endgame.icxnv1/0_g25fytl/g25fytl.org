"Greater Good" Dumbledore is because the Author is following the Trope. It's just Evil Dumbledore ruling the world politically with a Smile using his fame/influence to control everything, and the Author generally refuses to acknowledge that, by saying "Not Evil but Greater Good Dumbledore" and having Fawkes "A CREATURE OF LIGHT" stay with Dumbledore.

Actual Greater Good Dumbledore would have burned down Azkaban "Oh no, Fiendfyre broke out at Azkaban, Oh well, it's for the Greater Good" whilst setting some way up to trap the Dementors and starve them. Voldemort would have either been stuck as a Wraith until Harry died a natural death, because all of his followers would have been killed, or come back to very little support with just Pettigrew left.
