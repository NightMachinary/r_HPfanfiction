Greater Good Dumbledore is a power-hungry pseudo-narcissistic sociopath that also happens to have no actual desire for power (as he for some reason still doesn't accept the position of Minister in this universe) along with the fact that he is very stupid but also a master manipulator that just so happens to get caught by a fifteen year old that decided to read a few spellbooks for the first time in his life.

Dumbledore in canon /is/ a greater good Dumbledore, he orchestrates many canon events in the way we see them so Harry/Voldemort get in place and eventually Harry has to die. He says as much at Kings Cross. But Dumbledore is not unrepentantly so, he genuinely feels remorse for doing so but recognized it as the only way.
