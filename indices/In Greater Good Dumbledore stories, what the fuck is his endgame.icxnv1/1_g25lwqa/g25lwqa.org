Depending of how you look at it, Canon "Greater Good" is either Grinderwald excuse for his massacres, or Dumbledore life (the man who used his own death to make his spy gain the trust of the enemy).

Fanon "Greater Good Dumbledore" is this guy who does very bad things, but who is somehow not Evil, a bit like "Grey Harry". Both are like this D&D player who has been forced to make a "True Neutral" character even though he really wanted to be "Chaotic Evil". A murder hobo with excuses ready.
