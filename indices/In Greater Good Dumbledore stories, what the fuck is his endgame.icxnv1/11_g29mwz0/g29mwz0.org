there is one fic that I can't remember the name of and haven't been able to finish as it's super dense and slow moving, but has some ducking amazing OCs and world building and they made the ultimate Dumbledore in my opinion. On the face of it he's this righteous and shining dude, but in reality he's blocking opportunities for the underprivileged peeps and making life harder for literally everyone. You know those politicians who say shit like â€˜if disabled people don't work they'll have no dignity' at the same time as making life impossible with cut wages and little to no aid.

I wish I could remember what it's called, because I'm not explaining it right at all
