I believe that Dumbledore is a few things listed here:

a) Dumbledore is a succesfull politician and in being so, necessarily, also a manipulator. He knows how to bring people to his view of things and how to use clout.

b) A well educated and philosophically inclined idealist.

c) An extremely powerful mage.

d) A genuinely good person.

We've gone through many threads about this, but once again I'll argue from a point of view that /includes/ the "necessities of the story". That means that I keep in mind that Rowling needed Harry to be the hero, and nobody else.

So argument number one: The traps to the mirror room were never meant to keep Voldemort off, but only functioned as fancy alert systems. The real trap was the mirror. And we know from the book that Voldemort would have failed at that stage. He wanted the stone for himself, and therefore he was completely locked out from it. It was a perfect safe for the stone against one singular thief.

And who is to say that the Flamels /personally/ protected the stone for so long? Maybe it being in Gringotts was par for the course in terms of its safekeeping. But Dumbledore knew Gringotts would not be adequate - and was proven right. An adequate safe place for the stone was a) close to Dumbledore and b) behind magics Voldemort lacked knowledge of, or was incapable of dismantling. And their survival had gone on for long enough, we were told as much. Or "bringing their affairs in order" is just code for Nicolas making another stone. If he could make one, why not make another one?

Sirius' conviction is, honestly, to blame on the Marauders as a whole. Who the secret keeper for the Potters was, was key information to have for their dedicated leader in this fight. But instead they let their General believe that Sirius was the secret keeper, which opened up every opportunity for the actual traitor Peter to fudge the dices. When it was time to throw Sirius into prison, Dumbledore was steadfast in his belief that Sirius was the secret keeper, and therefore the traitor. Sirius even "confessed" to it, to some degree. Enough at least to be proof within the war tribunal he had been subjected to. Which is another thing many people forget about this: Not a single Death Eater had gotten a trial according to british muggle standards. The magical justice system is prone to manipulation anyway, but Sirius was judged under Barty Crouch's authoritarian war tribunal that had no patience for the defense of the accused, or a multitude of evidence and witnesses. Sirius was a man who would have needed a psychologist and then a good lawyer, caught in a situation where society wanted vengeance.

When we talk about Malfoy, thats where Dumbledore's idealist side definitely shone through the most. He believed so much in the redemption of the guilty, that he sometimes forgot about their victims in the process. He understood that Draco Malfoy was in an impossible situation. He either did as he was told, or he would bring Voldemorts wrath upon himself and his family. Unimaginable torture and a crueling death were assured if he didn't deliver. Dumbledore knew that he had to die not so far in the future. So his decision was to *let* Draco succeed once he had gotten enough information to Harry. Until then he set Snape onto Malfoy to control him. We know that didn't work well, but in the end even Dumbledore is only a person, and not infallible. He even said so himself. He makes many mistakes. He made many mistakes. Its just that when he makes them, they tend to have horrible consequences, proportional to his power and influence.
