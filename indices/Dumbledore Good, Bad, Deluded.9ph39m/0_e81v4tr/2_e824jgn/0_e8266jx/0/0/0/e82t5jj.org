It was a mistake to do tell a completely lost young man - barely not a child any more - that his friends getting hurt, almost dying, doesn't matter. That the well-being of a Death Eater is more important than of his victims.

Dumbledore showed far more consideration to Draco than to Harry and the other innocent victims of Draco in that moment - with Harry listening and watching.

And /that/ isn't what you do to your friends and allies. You should never, ever value the guilty more than the innocent. At the very least, he should have informed Harry far in advance of this plan - not spring it on him like this.

Not that he should have ever considered saving Draco instead of Katie Bell, Ron and Draco's other victims anyway.
