You mean it was a mistake to tell a completely lost young man - barely not a child anymore - in his face, in one of the most stressful situations of his life, that there is no redemption for him and that there is damage done he can never rectify? That now he is on the side of darkness and there is no return, no matter what he does?

Dumbledore is a bit more intelligent than that. He tried to use the situation to tell Draco one last time that there is a possibility to turn his back on this path he walks. None of Draco's victim would have any benefit from Dumbledore laying into Draco right there.

If Dumbledore knew one thing its people. And he was sensitive enough that he understood that judgement was the last thing Draco needed, or would respond well to after that year, in this situation. Any judgement would have pushed him towards the reasons why he did it. But Dumbledore told him that whatever he had done and does, he is forgiven and there is redemption to be had. And /that/ is the only way to talk to someone like that, in such a situation.

Justice can be brought upon him later.
