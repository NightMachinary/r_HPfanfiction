*Watsonian:* Harry would never have been able to take Snape on in a fair fight, but he could easily beat Draco. Dumbledore needed Draco to disarm him, so Harry could get mastery of the Elder Wand, but he didn't want Draco to kill him, as Snape killing would be more useful. Dumbledore's words to Draco shook him badly, badly enough that later on at Malfoy Manor he decides not to identify Harry Potter to the rest of the Death Eaters, saving his life. This leads Harry to decide to save Draco in the room of requirement. Draco being alive is what makes Narcissa lie directly to Voldemort's face, allowing Harry to escape detection until their final confrontation.

Dumbledore also needed Snape to utterly prove his loyalty to Voldemort if he wanted Snape to remain safe to work his plans. So the DEs needed to witness this confrontation. Snape killing Dumbledore convinced Voldemort and the DEs so completely that they never suspected anything until Harry told Voldemort after Snape was already dead. This shook Voldemort badly, giving Harry another edge in their final confrontation (not because Voldemort cared about Snape, he had just killed him, but because he's a paranoid maniac).

*Doylist:* Dumbledore did have risky, illogical, unlikely to succeed plans, but magic and magical society in canon seems to embrace this. So much about the magical world is risky, illogical and unlikely to be successful.

"Public safety" doesn't seem to be a concern in the Wizarding World, so to criticize Dumbledore for not caring about it is a bit unfair. They have a school with moving staircases, a forest of dangerous creatures next door where detentions are served in and a lake full of potentially dangerous Merpeople that first years that don't know any magic cross yearly with only a half trained groundskeeper as protection. Even magic itself is unsafe. Floo travellers and callers are one batch of bad powder away from severe burns instead of transportation/communication, apparition requires strong concentration or you leave body parts behind, wands are essentially dangerous weapons given to 11 year olds. A Triwizard tournament has dragons and other fatally dangerous creatures involved, as well as binding people whose names appear in the goblet to compete, whether they want to or not.
