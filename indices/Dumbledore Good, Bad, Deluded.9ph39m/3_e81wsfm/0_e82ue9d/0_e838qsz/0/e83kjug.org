Those are interesting arguments, but regardless of the illogicality of the magical world, Dumbledore was expecting quite a lot of very nebulous good. How does Dumbledore know that Harry will disarm Draco? An auror could have, or he could have accidentally been disarmed by someone else, etc.

The Doylist argument makes the most sense, honestly, if you're looking at it from a perspective of “Rowling said so.” Doesn't make it any less asinine.
