This is also the same man who let a kid nearly kill his classmates several times over, bring death eaters into the school, etc. in order to save a kid that hasn't yet decided he wants to be saved, let alone actually repented for anything. He could have put Draco under watch, expelled him, and let Snape do his thing. He may not have been bad but he was certainly deluded.
