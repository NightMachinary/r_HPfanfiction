  You can't really make sense of his actions in a Watsonian way; it's all pure plot device.

Other than by reading him as deeply, deeply damaged in ways that give the deep, abiding lie to the fanon notion that Mind Healers are a thing. The man was barely out of his teens before he was culpable in his sister's murder in ways that, with even an ounce of hindsight, were very avoidable. That /has/ to leave a mark. Then he spends the next half century trying to hide away from it all, and they keep dragging him back in, until he ends up having to join in a war he wanted no part of and they declare him a hero for subduing and imprisoning a man who was in many ways already beaten, a wreck of the young man he'd loved, who had failed before he had even begun because he clung to the grand vision of an over-excited teenager.

The sensible thing for him to do - for his own sanity - was retire in about 1946 and go live quietly somewhere else under an assumed name, but under all the damage was still the Albus that wanted to conquer the world For Their Own Good. Sure, he knows it's a fool's errand now - even if Gellert had won, there's nothing about being a wizard that makes you any good at government, as the Ministry proves on a daily basis - but sometimes he just thinks that if he /really/ cut loose he could stomp some sense into the blighters. And there's that tiny little whisper from the slice of Death in his wand-holster that says he has the power to do it.

So he ends up with a bad case of decision paralysis, the lassitude that comes with the bone-deep weariness of a chronic depression that he knows is /all his own fault/ and then young Tom - who has clearly read his Mao Zedong - devotes his followers to making Dumbledore look ineffective with classic guerrilla tactics and Dumbledore is starting to believe it...

(Is my Watsonian-fu strong enough?)
