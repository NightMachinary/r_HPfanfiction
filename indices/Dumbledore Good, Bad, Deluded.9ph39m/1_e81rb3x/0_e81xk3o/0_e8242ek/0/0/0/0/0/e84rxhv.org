Well, we know from book six that Scrimgeour is only slightly more useful than Fudge.... We don't know anything about Elphias Doge so we can't say. Frankly we also don't know anything about Bones or Augusta Longbottom. It's implied that they're both terrifying and scrupulously fair, but how much interaction do they have with Dumbeldore and how much are their hands tied by bureaucracy? I agree with you on the first set, but frankly McGonagall and Flitwick have suspect judgement too, co sideri g their own inaction and complicity with the issues of Hogwarts. Hiding Voldemort bait in a school is not a good idea, no matter how unconcerned with student safety you are.
