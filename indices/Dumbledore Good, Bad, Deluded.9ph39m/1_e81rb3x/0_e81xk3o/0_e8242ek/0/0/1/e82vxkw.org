The first people to notice would be his political opponents. His supporters then immediately cling to every possible evidence of him being in perfectly good form, or straight up publicly deny that there's anything wrong. Given a sufficiently polarised political atmosphere - and wizarding Britain has such an atmosphere, by the time the books start the civil war has been in cease-fire for less than ten years - as apparently noncontentious an issue as the mental health of one side's leader can /easily/ be a hill people are willing to die on. Sure, in private they'll admit he's gaga, but in public? They'll wax poetic on how finely-tailored the Emperor's New Clothes are, because otherwise they're giving ground to the opposition.
