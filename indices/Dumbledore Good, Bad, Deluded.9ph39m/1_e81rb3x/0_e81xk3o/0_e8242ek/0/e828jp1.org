  Not only do you need everyone around him - McGonagall, Moody, the entire Order, the entire school staff, and all politicians to be stupid enough to miss that Dumbledore is a mess and, arguably, a fraud, they have to miss that he's responsible for all the screwups as well, and still blindly follow him as "the best of all the leaders"

Clearly, you have a less cynical view of how politics and leadership actually happen in practise.
