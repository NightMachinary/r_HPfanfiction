No, it's not enough. Making Dumbledore into a barely-functional mess ruins the character even more. And such a mess wouldn't have been able to fight Voldemort in two wars, much less done what he did to Harry. "Decision Paralysis, apart from when the plot needs Dumbledore as a plot device" is not in any way better than "pure plot device". Not only do you need everyone around him - McGonagall, Moody, the entire Order, the entire school staff, and all politicians to be stupid enough to miss that Dumbledore is a mess and, arguably, a fraud, they have to miss that he's responsible for all the screwups as well, and still blindly follow him as "the best of all the leaders" resp. "fight him as the most dangerous of our enemies". Effectively, you need to lobotomise everyone to keep Dumbledore as an ineffective (outside plot needs) mess.
