I would say the core problem lies with Voldemort who was fairly incompetent despite all the received accolades in the Books. If Dumbledore showed slightly more competence or common sense in the first 4 Books, the canon plot would be instantly shot, for example as in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467).
