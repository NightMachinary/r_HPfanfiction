Dumbledore: Plot device is my take on it. During the early books, he is struck with the "adults are useless" trope so kids can be the heroes saving the day. And in the later books, he's not allowed to derail the plot by acting in character - like everyone else forced to become an idiot and acting OOC to keep the plot going.

You can't really make sense of his actions in a Watsonian way; it's all pure plot device.
