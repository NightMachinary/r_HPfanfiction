Exactly!!! Ive never really liked her, even as a child. And fic tends to portray her as an all knowing, gorgeous, sex bomb, who never makes mistakes. And I blame a lot of that on the movies for giving her all of Rons positive personality traits. This girl is not perfection. She can be bossy, and rude, and almost never thinks shes wrong. She hold the opinions of books higher than those of her friends and never trys to stop her cat from chasing scabbers instead saying 'its not his fault'. Shes not all bad but she has some major flaws.
