Everyone talks about that time he left Hermione and Harry during the Horcrux Hunt. I have to ask one thing, tho.

Where is the boy who spent monthes following the guidance of a ball of light that entered his body, in the hopes it could bring him back to his friends? The boy who saw a friend dive deep into a cold lake, and didn't hesitate to jump in to save said friend?

We always talk about Ron's failures as a friend, but never about his shining moments.
