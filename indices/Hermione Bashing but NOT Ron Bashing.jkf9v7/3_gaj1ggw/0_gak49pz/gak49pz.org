Im just so tired of it by now y'know? Ron is so much more that a jealous prat!!! And hes a really hard character to get right, trying to write him is a constant struggle to find the balance between jokster, jealousy, seriousness, loyalty, and loving warmth. Half the time bashing Ron feels like a cop out and im sitting here like "Where's the kid who stood on a broken leg in front of his friends and told a serial killer to his face that he would have to kill him first to get to them"? "Wheres the boy who offered a lonely boy his only food to make him happy"? "Wheres the person who would give everything including the shirt off his back for his friends"?

I just want Ron to be done justice.
