I like this story for the most part but Harry's meanness always bothers me. He's not very nice and goes out of his way to antagonize Ron, which is totally unlike Harry's canon character. I guess the case could be made that Harry acts mean because he has (in my opinion) mean friends but his character just always feels off to me in this story. There is also lots of unnecessary Ron-bashing.
