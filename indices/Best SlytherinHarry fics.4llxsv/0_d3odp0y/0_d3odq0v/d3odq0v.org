[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3559907/1/][*/What Would Slytherin Harry Do?/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/559963/Big-D-on-a-Diet][/Big D on a Diet/]]

#+begin_quote
  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.
