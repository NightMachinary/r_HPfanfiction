linkffn(What Would Slytherin Harry Do? by Big D on a Diet) is a great little fic with Slytherin!Harry. It's a little unrealistic, but if you don't take it too seriously, it's a really fun read.

This'll probably get mixed reviews, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) is a great subversion of many of the tropes in the fandom (especially surrounding Harry). It starts of a little weak though, but the second year is awesome so far imo. Not perfect as it has its missteps, but really good.
