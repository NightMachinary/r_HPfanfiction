Check out linkffn(magical relations). It features magical Dudley and that's the catalyst for Harry winding up in Slytherin. It's extremely well written and the characters and friendships that develop are very real and enjoyable. And it has some really great humor moments!

One of my major issues with a lot of the canon rehash fics out there is that Harry doesn't really act like a kid, but in this one his character feels real and authentic.
