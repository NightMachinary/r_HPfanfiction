We are those who, when we go full Dark Lord, desire ultimate power, so that we can make things run more efficiently and make more time to read interesting books and experiment and do the really esoteric mathematics. I mean, seriously, if you go deep enough it sounds like magic. and feels like magic. For example (read in ominous latin chanting):

- Let F be a holomorphic bijection from C^{n} to C^{n.}
- Let Î¶(s) be the extension of the Riemann Zeta Function to the Complex Plane less the real number one.
- Let G be the function 1/z for Complex z, the ill-behaved function that makes far points near and near points far.
- Consider a spectral function....

~cue maniacal laughter~

- Hell, the first time you see the proof that e^{i*pi} + 1 = 0.... What can you think other than "What is this magic and how do I learn it."?
