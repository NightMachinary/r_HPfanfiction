Ok but we did see a fair amount of them throughout the books? You cannot just throw away Luna because you feel like it she's a raven claw.

That's like me saying I don't think we saw any Gryffindors because I think Harry was an oddball and would be a good slytherin, Hermione was a raven claw ofc, and Ron wasent much fun so I pretend he's not in the book. That makes no sense OP.

And furthermore describing every aspect of a 1000 students will not further the plot. Everything written in the story has a point, and the point is to tell the story, not please you with obsessive, trivial details.
