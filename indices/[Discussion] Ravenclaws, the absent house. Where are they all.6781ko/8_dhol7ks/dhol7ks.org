Yes you can! They don't just "like books" (and even if they did: It's probably books about magic that the 'claws like the most, sure many of them might pleasure read, too (stuff like us reading HP or Star Wars novels etc.)), they like KNOWLEDGE (!)

I mean it wouldn't be out of character for a Ravenclaw to look into dark magic out of intellectual curiousity (!) or to challenge the ministry deffinition of dark magic (who are they to judge what magic is dark? I mean you can kill with a levitation charm or with a cheering charm etc. it's the intent that makes something dark IMHO!)

People just seem to prefer Slytherin (because of the potential for conflict that you mentioned) or because Draky-Poo (Sorry, I hate Draco - that damned ponce literally gets away with murder and I've seen people like him do the same in RL (I've been bullied at school by people like him!) and I absolutely hate it!) is in that house or because you can bring Snape in easier (he's after all their head of house!) etc.

Gryffindor is a given (canon Harry and a lot of characters close to him are or were in that house!)

As for the Puffs? A lot of people like them because they seem to be the friendly underachievers who had their one bright star (Cedric Diggory!) murdered by Voldemort...what people often forget is that the 'puffs are a cruel lot as well (they loved wearing Draco's badges and they also shunned Harry the supposed heir of Slytherin!), quite unlike what the hat says (fair and open minded indeed!)

I'd love more Ravenclaw Harry fictions (I myself am either Ravenclaw or Slytherin in house tests, so I like those houses best - no, I am not tailoring my answers on tests especially for that, it's who I am! I am an ambitious bookworm...sadly it's not educational books, I prefer reading for pleasure!)
