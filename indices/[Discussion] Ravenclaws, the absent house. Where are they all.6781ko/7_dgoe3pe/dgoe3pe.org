Studying.

Ravenclaw as a house is only as boring as the author writes it to be. Then again, thanks to tropes and the like, houses (with the exception of Gryffindor and Slytherin of course) tend to not play a huge role in the story, but rather serve as a plot device to make the MC seem 'cool' or super progressive by either switching houses, uniting all the houses (of course) or just plain disregarding any and all tradition regarding houses.

Read a Ravenclaw!Harry fic if you want them to be acknowledged :P
