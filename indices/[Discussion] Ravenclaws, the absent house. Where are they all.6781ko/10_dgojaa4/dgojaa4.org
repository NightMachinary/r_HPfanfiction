I see Ravenclaw as the House of learning. People who go there want to learn. They have no ambition to take over the world/magical Britain, their morals are not strong enough to justify Hufflepuff but they do not think that the end does justify the means like in Slytherin.

If you go for tropes you could do the marriage contract thing with Padma Patil (whether she gets a contract with Harry or tries to avoid one her parents want).

The superiority of muggle society and morales could be done with Penelope or any minor character instead of Hermione.

Of course, there's little we know about anything besides what the books say (and sometimes that makes little sense) therefore the author can always tailor Ravenclaw to meet his needs. Ravenclaw can be the House of bullies, the house of learning, the house that actually thinks, or have it as framework for their plot. It works good with obscure but not necessarily evil magic.
