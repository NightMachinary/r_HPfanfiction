  There's a war going on, and Death Eaters have taken Hogwarts. Michael isn't brave; Terry isn't wise; Anthony isn't a leader. Ravenclaws aren't meant to be rebels, but then again nothing else this year is normal. There's a war going on, and it's time that they figured out what's right, what's easy, and what they want to risk. [Set during Deathly Hallows.]
