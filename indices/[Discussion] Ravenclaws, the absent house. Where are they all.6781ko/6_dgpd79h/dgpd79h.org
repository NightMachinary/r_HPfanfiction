I recently read: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12330043/1/Tell-Brave-Deeds-of-War][Tell Brave Deeds of War]] and was really quite impressed with it. It's certainly risen up my favourite list. linkffn(12330043)

  There's a war going on, and Death Eaters have taken Hogwarts. Michael isn't brave; Terry isn't wise; Anthony isn't a leader. Ravenclaws aren't meant to be rebels, but then again nothing else this year is normal. There's a war going on, and it's time that they figured out what's right, what's easy, and what they want to risk. [Set during Deathly Hallows.]

I never really thought all that much about the Ravenclaw characters so it's pleasantly suprising to read a fic that features them at all.

I think that Ravenclaw characters didn't come off well in the novels, Luna is of course a fantastic character but she was seemingly bullied by those in Ravenclaw house, which probably doesn't sit well with most people. Other Ravenclaw characters: Cho Chang, Marietta and Michael Corner all have mildly antagonistic relationships with some of the main characters.
