Wherever Harry ends up is where he will be having most of his interactions realistically speaking you'll see people in your own house way more then others especially with how divided the houses are. I mean Harry actually dated a Ravenclaw in canon which was Cho Chang. Off the top of my head the only Ravenclaw females I can think of are Luna and Cho which is certainly the problem. It's not really the house that's the problem there just isn't much to go off of you'd damn near be creating OC's. The lack of Ravenclaws isn't even a problem only in fanfiction we barely see them in canon. The same goes for the other houses that aren't named Gryffindor.
