IIRC, on Pottermore, Ravenclaws are described as the opposite of boring. They're more about quirkiness and individuality, and value learning new interesting stuff and experimentation over getting good grades grades and reading lots of books. This would make the quintessential Ravenclaw someone who doesn't particularly care about what other people think of them, or external judgment scales like grades, and just does them and what makes them happy, and likes exploring and discovering new things. So basically, luna is the ideal ravenclaw.

We never really find out enough about Cho or Marrieta to see how they handle school work, but they clearly care at least somewhat about the actual stuff they're learning, otherwise why wouldn't they just do Umbridge's assignments and get good grades rather than join an illicit study group? I think a story about a ravenclaw would make for a good mad scientist plot, or a ravenclaw who is really interested in how magic works and discovers the core system of magic and revolutionizes the Wizarding world, sending it into a kind of magic renaissance.

I think there's a lot of material to work with in regards ravenclaw plots, but as it is we only know of school age class 3 claws, 2 of which aren't portrayed in the best of ways and 1 of which is written as an omniscient omnipotent God half the time, and a crazy ~lol I'm so random~ lunatic the other half. If you take into account adult ravenclaws however, you can extract a lot more information. I don't know anyone that would call flitwick a boring professor, if anything he seems to be the most fun teacher at hogwarts. And Lockhart, for all of his flaws, would never be described as having a common personality.

tl;dr: Ravenclaws are the opposite of bookish boring nerds, I have way too many thoughts about them and accidentally wrote an essay.
