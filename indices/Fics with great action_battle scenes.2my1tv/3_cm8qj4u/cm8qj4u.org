[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4894268/1/Sitra-Ahra][Sitra Ahra]] has a couple I really liked. Very first chapter/prelude has a pretty good one but if memory serves the one I really liked was the fight in the 15th movement.

The fights are more sparse though so for constant action there is, of course, the Denarian Renegade etc. series.
