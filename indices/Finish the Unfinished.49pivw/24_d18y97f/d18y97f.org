There are others whose individual chapters excite me more, but none that I invested quite as much into as Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(3766574)

It's the only 7-year fic I've read that far into, and it was worth the million words it took. It is no small thing to see such an ambitious task be so well-written and engaging, and then to simply stop so close to the end.

I'd also give a shout out to Forging the Sword - linkffn(3557725) - if only because it is simply criminal that no one else has mentioned it. Whilst far earlier on, that fic is perhaps my favorite, and it says a lot that I'd rather see an update to it than OTWTG or The Changeling, despite their being in far more exciting periods.
