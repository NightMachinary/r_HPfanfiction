Right? I would have loved to see McGonagal's reaction to Teddy getting into Hufflepuff or something when they thought that he'd definitely go Slytherin. That would be amusing. I totally want to see Portrait Dumbledore and Portrait Snape react to Harry, as well. Like Teddy gets in trouble or someone bullies Teddy like an idiot and Harry comes to talk to McGonagall about that. That would be brilliant.
