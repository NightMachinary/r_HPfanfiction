The Ministry could have deliberately waited until Harry was unguarded, or even bribed or threatened Mundungus.

You could have a scenario where Harry is even more CAPSLOCK after a whole summer at the Dursley's and completely breaks off with Ron/Hermione.

Or whoever protects Harry takes him away immediately/becomes an ally.
