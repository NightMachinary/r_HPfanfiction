Not really, in fact the only character we know /for sure/ what he contributed with is Snape as a spy, and even then he could potentially have other jobs that were not addressed (was he tasked with killing/sabotaging discretely some DEs? Did he brew complex potions for the order - Felix Felicis or polyjuice for example? Was he responsible for keeping an eye on Harry or investigating his mind-link with Voldemort on top of -supposedly- teaching him occlumency?...) all in all we don't really get to know much about the order since we see it from Harry's eyes and he was mostly acting independently of them up to the end.
