It's always bothered me that he didn't say his cousin who already knows about magic. Or how no one from the government went and checked Harry both times. Or the fact that Tonks cast a spell to help Harry pack but that does nothing to set off the underage magic.

I'm mean I get the fudge kept interrupting him but still.

And I know the government relies on the parents to discipline their kids but really? Did Dumbledore remove all knowledge of where Harry Lives? Because a few witches and wizards have met him growing up. Bowing to him in shops. And we all know Petunia's not taking him to London for that. So they all kinda know he lives in Surrey.

Then does this mean that they put up a anti magic detector around Harry's house. Because they all just apparate in and all that.
