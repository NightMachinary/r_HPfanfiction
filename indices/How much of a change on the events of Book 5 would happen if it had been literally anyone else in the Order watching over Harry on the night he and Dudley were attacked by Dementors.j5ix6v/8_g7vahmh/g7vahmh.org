If the different Order member is unable to cast a Patronus then it'll go as it went in canon.

But even if the Order member manages to drive the Dementor away, then it'll not change much. Firstly, Harry wouldn't attract Dumbledore's attention, and probably wouldn't get moved to Grimmauld Place for the entire holiday, or at best towards the very end of it, like the last one or two weeks to shop for school equipment (he got moved on 6th of August, so he only had 25 days to go, or three weeks and four days).

Dumbledore made no effort to bring Harry into the fold, until his hands were tied by the Dementor attack and court hearing, so he could very easily think that he's keeping him safe by leaving him at Privet Drive. He believes that with Voldemort on the rise, the safest place for Harry is the place where Voldemort can't even touch him.

Harry spent the entire July by himself, so half of his holidays were already spent in isolation. He would give his friends and adults even harder time for leaving him out of loop, but beyond that, I can't see anything else changing; Harry is not a spiteful kid and he treasures his friends so he would forgive Ron and Hermione eventually. Umbridge would've probably become the DADA instructor regardless, to spy for Fudge, and things would've gone normally.

Nonetheless, I would love to read an angsty Harry who's moved to Grimmauld Place only one week before the term starts, and simply loses it at everyone, his anger would be justified.
