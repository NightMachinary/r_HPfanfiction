Not really? In HBP Dumbledore implies (when they are recruiting Slughorn) that since he was with Harry the trace wouldn't pick up spells casted by either of them, and in the end of the book Harry casts all those spells in the cave and (not sure if I remember correctly) I think he was also the one to apparate Dumbledore and himself back to Hogsmead, which the ministry had no idea about. Beyond that there were all those spells casted around him during the World Cup at GoF, whatever magic happens at Hogsmead... my HC is that the actual reason the order didn't tell Harry that they were around at Privet Dive was to prevent him from figuring out that the Trace wouldn't pick up any magic he did and using the opportunity to curse the Dursley's into a grey blob on the wall.
