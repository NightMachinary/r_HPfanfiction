It would have been the same? Given how hard a patronus is meant to be there's no guarantee other order members could cast it. We know some of the strong ones could but if Mundungus was a guard then anyone could be. Could Doge do one? Could Molly? Harry ends up having to do it anyway and events proceed as normal.

Or, depending one how you interpret the trace, Harry is in the clear because there was an adult nearby. We know Arthur's fireplace fixing and Tonks's pack spell go unremarked so there's every chance Harry would have gotten away with it.
