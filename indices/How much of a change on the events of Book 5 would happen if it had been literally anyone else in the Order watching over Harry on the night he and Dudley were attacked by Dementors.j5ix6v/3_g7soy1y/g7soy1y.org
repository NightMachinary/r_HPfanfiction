Let‘s assume Umbridge‘s attemt at making Harry use magic would have failed, since...let‘s say Tonks conjured up a patronus. In this case there would have been no immediate need to take Harry to Grimmould place and most likely there would have been a rather heated debate between Sirius, Molly and Dumbledore, all of them wanting to protect harry in their own way: Molly: Dementors? Dementors! You can‘t possibly plan to let him stay there?! Albus: As you are well aware there are certain protections- Sirius: Yes, sure. And they clearly work, don't they? Ah wait...there was this incident with the house elf... Albus: Who meant no harm- Sirius: And the mass murderer who got close to him without being noticed Albus: That was you- Sirius: And now those soul sucking bastards- Molly: Language! Sirius: -which means we might have the whole fucking- Molly: Sirius! Sirius: -ministry against us. /whispering among the order members/ Molly: He does have a point. What excactly is that „protection“ Albus: Um Sirius: Yeah, tell us. Albus: Nope can‘t. Sirius: Why? Albus: /throws firecrackers/

Meanwhile in little winging Tonks decided that after having dropped off a little less traumatised dudley at the dursleys it wouldn‘t do any bad to invite Harry over for tea. So she takes him to her parents place, where he gets to meet her parents for the first time. Tonks also invited Hermione and Ginny ( since they seemed to have already built an even sister-like bond), whom Harry is quite pissed at for around five minutes, before they fall into easy conversation. Also at some point the family pictures are discovered: Harry: Waaaait is that a picture of you and Narcissa Malfoy over there? Andromeda: Yup. Harry: Cool, why though? Andromeda: She‘s my sister. Harry: Wow, having a sister, who's a pureblood supremacist and a death eater‘s wife...must be pretty much the worst thing to happen to you... /the Tonks family exchanging looks/ Tonks: Hm yeah, the only thing worse than that must be having a second sister, who is a mass murderer and you know who's first lieutenant. Harry: .... Andromeda: I have that too. That's her over there. Harry: Oh Hermione: Well, she‘s kinda hot though. Ginny: What about your parents? Andromeda: Banned me from the family. Hermione: Aunts/Uncles? Andromeda: Burnt me from the family tree. Harry: House elves? Andromeda: He hates everyone. Harry: A goldfish? Andromeda: Someone ate him. Harry: Oh Andromeda: Nah only kidding-never had one. /silence/ Hermione: Well...let‘s change topic...maybe some fun stories? Tonks: Lucius Malfoys hair? Hermione: Huh? Tonks: I bet he uses bleach. Harry: But Draco‘s a natural blonde, right? Andromeda: I think so...he‘s got his mothers hair. Why are you interested anyway? Harry: I, well, that, I have to go to the bathroom. Ginny & Hermione /exchanging looks/ Ginny: /giggling/ that's why his scarf was green.

Very much later this year: The department of mysterys: Lucius: The prophecy, Potter. Neville: Or what? Lucius: Or we will torture and kill every single one of you. Harry: Bet those threats are fake. As some other things here. /giggling/ Lucius: Excuse me? Hermione: Are we getting in your hair? Lucius: I don't- Ron: Makes your hair stand on end, that we discovered your secret. Lucius: What nonsense are you children- Luna: You know...blonde people are way less affected by Nargles, but with all those swarming around your head... Bellatrix: /emerging from the shadows/ Itty bitty potty knows how to play! Now- /gets interrupted by muffled discussion/ What?! Ginny: No, no. It's nothing, go on. Bellatrix: Tell me this instant! Ginny: Well Herione and I were just discussing- Bellatrix: What?! Hermione: We saw that old picture of you.. Ginny: And oh boy do you look less hot in real life.

A quite long discussion about Lucius's natural hair color and Bellatrix probably catfishing the order managed to stun the distracted death eaters from behind.

And that‘s how it would have happened. CHANGE. MY. MIND.
