Probably very little, since the nature of the Dementor attack plan was inherently to put Harry in a no-win situation and contrive justification to punish him whatever he did, but Dumbledore having Figg as a backup negated this by adding reasonable doubt as to the Dementors' presence.

If, say, Tonks had been on guard instead, she'd have cast the Patronus and then Umbridge would still have accused Harry, only for Tonks to provide his alibi instead of Figg. Same outcome.
