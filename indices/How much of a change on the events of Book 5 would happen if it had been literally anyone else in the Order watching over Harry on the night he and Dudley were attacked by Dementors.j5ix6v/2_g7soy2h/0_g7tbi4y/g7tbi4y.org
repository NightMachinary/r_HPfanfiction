Not really?

I mean, Statute of Secrecy forbids revealing magic to uninitiated. If they already know, or are a close relative of a magical citizen, it's fine. Offensive spells cast on Muggles have their own set of laws, but Patronus doesn't count as one. Since the wizard/witch would have been of age and fully qualified, underage sorcery would not apply either.

â€‹

As everyone present was aware of magic and no one was harmed, nor any lasting magical effects remained (like Biting Doorknobs), the adult could cast any spells they wished.

*"Mr. Anon, why did you cast a Patronus Charm?"*

*"Dunno, I felt like it. But since no unaware muggles saw it, I was well within my rights to do so."*
