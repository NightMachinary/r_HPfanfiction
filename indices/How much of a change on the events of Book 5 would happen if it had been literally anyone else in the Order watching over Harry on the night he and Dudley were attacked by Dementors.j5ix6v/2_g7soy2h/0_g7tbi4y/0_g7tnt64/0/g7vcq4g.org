He may try, but the only reason it somewhat worked with Harry is the months long smear campaign. Trying that shit on someone who isn't a teen (Harry) or willing to play the game (Dumbledore) would not be good for Minister.

Additionally, we'd need to look up exactly where is that law? Because there are 2 given as basis, without distinction as to which law demands what.

I am leaning towards "underage sorcery", because there is ample precedent of adult wizards casting spells in that neighborhood without reprisal. (It might be just Rowling screwing with consistency of detection, but it happens).
