  /â€œThe charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International Confederation of Wizards' Statute of Secrecy.

In Fudge can try to blame Harry for using Magic in front of Dudley, he definitively can do the same for a random adult wizard who doesn't have any connection to Dudley. And even if you remove Dudley, it doesn't change the fact that he cast the spell in a "Muggle-inhabited area".

It is only an assumption on my part, but I think that only the "parents" and "siblings" of a wizard can know about Magic, and that Dudley only get some kind of exemption because Harry is living with him. Exemption that is completely ignored by Fudge.

But that's not really the point there. Because, as seen in the chapter, Fudge was not there to determine if Harry was "in his right" to use magic, but to put him in troubles. If it could be used against Harry, Fudge was totally ready to ignore his own law, or be completely dishonest. I mean, when he saw that the Patronus charge wouldn't stick, he tried to attack Harry about his accidental magic, back in 3rd year, even though he had forgiven him himself at that time.

If he sees that he can't attack Harry on the Patronus, because an adult wizard claim to have used the spell, he would probably go all out on this wizard, if only by pettiness. And according to the charges, using magic "in a Muggle-inhabited area" is a true offense against the Statute of Secrecy. Which means that to be cleared of all charge, said adult wizard would have to prove that he used the spell because of Dementors, which put him exactly in the same situation that Canon Harry.
