I doubt it would change much from the Canon plot.

Even if someone else used the spell, Harry would be accused of Underage Magic since it was used in his "zone", he would still be brought to Grimmault Place for his own protection, he would still have to go to a trial where Fudge would try everything in his power to condemn/ silence him.

If anything, the defense of Harry would change from "He had to protect himself from Dementors" to "Someone had to protect him from Dementors". But Fudge would still refuse to admit that Dementors ever went there, and the wizard who protected him would have to justify his presence, and explain his connection to Harry (which is not a very good idea in the political climate of that time, especially if it was a Ministry Employe like Arthur).
