  Sorry, I must have missed those chapters that had Lockhart and Quirrel showing their brilliance at teaching.

That's actually kind of my point: within thirty years, Dumbledore had already scratched the bottom of people who were simultaneously good at Defence, good at getting students' respect and attention, and not evil. All the teachers hired by Dumbledore in the books display at least one characteristic, and he may have thought they had the others:

- Quirrell was really good at Defence, but lacking in charisma, and also secretly evil. ((Dumbledore didn't know Quirrell had gone evil, nor that he would be such a pathetic wreck of a man; since that was a disguise put on to fool people into not taking him seriously as a threat, it's likely that when Dumbledore knew him as a student he was much less jumpy and pitiful.))

- Gilderoy Lockhart was very charismatic, but turned out not to know much of anything about Defence, and also to be kinda evil. Not very much compared to Quirrell, but still.

- Lupin looked like the mythical three-in-one, charismatic and good at Defence and not evil, but unfortunately, the "not evil" part only concerns the times of the month when he's /not/ a furry hellbeast.

- â€˜Moody' was great at Defence and inspired respect, but was secretly evil.

- Snape is certainly not lacking in authority, he's not evil per se, and he's certainly competent at Defence. How unfortunate, then, that he hates children.

In all cases it was probably a choice of evils, you know? There was no doubt someone more charismatic than Quirrell, but they were probably really evil. There was surely someone less evil and more competent than Lockhart, but they were probably a weak-voiced half-Goblin old lady with a face full of warts.
