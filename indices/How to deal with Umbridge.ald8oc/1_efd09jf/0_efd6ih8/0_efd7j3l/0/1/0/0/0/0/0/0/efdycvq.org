  Both Quirrel and Lockhart were rather poor teachers, meaning that no one would have batted an eye if Albus had chosen someone who was average or below average at teaching for 1995-96.

Which is why there might've not been anyone at all who wanted it. Who knows if Dumbledore even knew what kind of person Fudge would place at Hogwarts. It being his Senior Undersecretary (literally his second-in-command) is actually pretty surprising. It's also possible that Fudge made sure no one else took it.
