You still don't get it.

Both Quirrel and Lockhart were rather poor teachers, meaning that no one would have batted an eye if Albus had chosen someone who was average or below average at teaching for 1995-96. The students weren't really expecting anyone good by that point, and literally anyone who was sane would have made for a better teacher compared to Umbridge.

Even Crouch Jr isn't that good of a teacher seeing as he uses human transfiguration on Malfoy as discipline for what is the equivalent of a schoolyard fight - while this is understandable from the POV that Crouch was a Death Eater with a corrosive hate towards all who forsook Voldemort, the remainder of the student body would still be too wary of him to actually foster a decent student-teacher relationship.

As for Snape, he knows his stuff, sure, but couldn't care less about his students. Again, a mediocre to bad teacher.

From all this, we can clearly see that hiring someone who was good at Defence, but not so great at teaching would have OK. In short, anyone not named Umbridge.
