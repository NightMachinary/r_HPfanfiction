  Not all of them would be good at teaching, however

Sorry, I must have missed those chapters that had Lockhart and Quirrel showing their brilliance at teaching.

As for the respect from students part, look, I've had freshly graduated teachers in college who were just a few years my senior. That didn't stop the class from treating them with the respect they were due, and college students at 18-20 can be a lot worse than 16-17 year olds in high school.
