  Except we see teachers get dealt with before a year. Even before 10 months

Who exactly? Quirrel makes the attempt on the Stone after the students finish their year-end exams. Lockhart does his thing when there's roughly a week left. Lupin - well, can't say about Lupin. Crouch Jr stays until June 24, the night of the third task - the students leave in a couple of days time. Umbridge, Hermione and Harry take her to the centaurs after their OWL exams. Snape flees either during late May or early June.

All of that is nearly always the ten month mark.
