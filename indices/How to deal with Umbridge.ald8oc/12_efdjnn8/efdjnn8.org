The biggest problem with Umbridge is she is a master at using the rules, but also feels no need to be beholden to the rules herself. So any sort of clever tricks to use the rules to your advantage should pretty much fail outright because Umbridge doesn't actually care about the rules.

Really the only way to deal with her short of ... /illegal actions/ is to drag her into the light of day. The problem with that is that the ministry is in her pocket and the newspaper is in the ministry's pocket.

There's only a few people we can be sure both have sufficient power to deal with her /and/ are not under the sway of those who support her. One of them is Dumbledore... and he doesn't have sufficient power to deal with her. Apparently. There's nobody both willing and able to hold that flashlight to see the cockroach for who she really is.

Her literally torturing kids with the quill is something of an open secret among hundreds of children (some of which are children of very influential people) as well as adults who, theoretically, have a responsibility to keep such things from happening.

Probably your best bet is to try and arrange it so that someone like Amelia Bones is present when Umbridge tries to do something hella illegal like using the cruciatus on a child.

You either have to kill/long-term ward at st. mungos her, or get her into such a position that there would be literal riots if she didn't end up a lifer in azkaban or worse. Anything less means you get a Dementor to the face, courtesy of her viciousness and connections.
