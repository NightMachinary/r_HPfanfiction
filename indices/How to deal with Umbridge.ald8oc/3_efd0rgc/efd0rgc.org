[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11102515/1/][Uncle Quentin's Spy]], linkffn(11102515), has a very reasonable solution: A more knowledgeable Harry recognized the danger in losing blood to the enemy, and stunned Umbridge immediately with a backup wand. He reported her blood quills to Dumbledore right away, who then memory charmed Umbridge and made her think she had cowed Harry into submission. Later, when Dumbledore was still forced to leave the school, he took Umbridge with him and turned her over to an allied paramilitary organization, who interrogated her exhaustively. After determining it was her who had sent the dementors, they executed her by slow hanging.
