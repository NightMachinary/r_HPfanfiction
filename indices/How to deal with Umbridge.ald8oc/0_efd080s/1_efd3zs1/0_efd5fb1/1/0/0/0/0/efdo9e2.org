Let's be clear that autonomy is a big thing in the Wizarding World. We recognize that children setting people(or their nerves) on fire, mind washing them, mind raping them or indeed putting them in solitary confinement is wrong. There should be a system of law enforcement and government that deals with crimes so children don't have to and that they SHOULDN'T be able to in the first place.

​

But that just doesn't exist in the HP universe. What that says about the personalities of the people who do things like that, well...

More fics should explore this to be honest. I'd imagine muggleborn(specially the ones who are smart/good with spellwork) would go quite mad with the kind of power the WW gives half educated teens.
