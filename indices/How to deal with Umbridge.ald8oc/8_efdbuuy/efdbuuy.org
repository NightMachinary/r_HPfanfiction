The problem with killing Umbridge is that the Ministry will just send someone else instead, and this someone won't necessarily be any better.

Creating a scandal using Skeeter is probably the best option. This way Fudge will want to distance himself and the Ministry from Umbridge, and it will show whoever comes next that they don't have a free hand to run Hogwarts without consequences.

Alternatively, the Order can always take a leaf from the previous professor's book, doze her with a sleeping potion in a secure location and have somebody impersonate her under Polyjuice
