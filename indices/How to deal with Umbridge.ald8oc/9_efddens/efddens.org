Arrange to get some hairs from Remus Lupin while having his furry problem. Add to Polyjuice potion. Feed to Umbridge. Retreat and see what happens.

Option 1: changing into a werewolf is so stressful that it kills her

Option 2: while raging through the school in a combination of animal rage and sexual dysphoria (since she's now also a male werewolf), the staff is forced to kill her

Option 3: because it's partly inhuman hair in Polyjuice, she stays that way even after the hour is up. Confronted with the fact that she will live a life as a werewolf without even the respite of most of the month being human, she commits suicide

Option 4: somehow by accident this leads to a permanent cure for lycanthropy. Umbridge is made the poster child for werewolf rights. She commits suicide (or becomes a better person, which essentially solves the problem anyway).
