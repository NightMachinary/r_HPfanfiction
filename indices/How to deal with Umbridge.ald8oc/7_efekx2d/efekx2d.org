I'm rather disappointed with how Rowling wrote Hermione in some moments. I mean; Hermione doesn't try and let the other Professors know that Harry is being forced to use a Blood Quill during detention, but she gets all huffy when Harry uses the Potion book that the mysterious Half Blood Prince, used? (That actually helped Harry in class); That's kind of some messed up priorities there.

I mean yeah, Harry would have been upset about it; but if someone (Not even Hermione but Ron or someone) had told the Professors about the Blood Quill being used on Harry, maybe they could have done something about her earlier.

Also; I forget, was it ever confirmed that it was Umbridge who sent the Dementors to Harry where he lived? I can't remember if it was ever confirmed; but that was a headcanon of mine. Maybe Umbridge could accidentally let it slip out that she did it, and they arrest her or something as well.
