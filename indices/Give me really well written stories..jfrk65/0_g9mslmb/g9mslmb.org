I thought linkao3(The Sum of their Parts by holdmybeer) was unusually tight and well paced for a 100k+ word fanfic. It was suspenseful and the ending held up ok. There were some typos and other flaws here and there, but not enough to get upset about. It is a Dark Lord Harry story with no shipping to speak of. The basic premises are a bit dubious but the story makes up for it.
