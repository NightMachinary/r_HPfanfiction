The usual intended approach is probably as [[/u/Avalon1632][u/Avalon1632]] describes, but the literal nazi dogwhistle aspect is still absolutely an indelible part this this phrase's use in HP fanfiction. "{insert minority group here} is destroying our culture"-type rhetoric has been in use for well over a century now, and has continued to be in use through to current day, which is how this kind of phrase enters public consciousness and (usually)-subconsciously becomes part of people's rhetorical arsenal. From that point on, the authorial choice to use this phrase to "redeem" purebloods is a rather textbook application: given the canonical situation of a minority group who's been dealt incredible violence in the recent past and an authorial desire to explain/justify/excuse/(ie generally blunt to whatever degree) the actions of the perpetrators, sympathizers, and bystanders in both past and upcoming conflicts in the interest of providing "nuance" to those perpetrators, sympathizers, and bystanders, authors will be on the search for some sort of communal deleterious^{\}1]) change experienced by the oppressing group that can be blamed on the oppressed group (^{\}1]) at least in the oppressing group's view), and cultural shift f/ an influx of newcomers (and, more generally, increased cultural visibility of a minority group) fits the bill rather neatly.
