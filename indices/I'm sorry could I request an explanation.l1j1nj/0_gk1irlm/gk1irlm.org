I don't know for certain, but I suspect it came from one of two places - either a pro-Draco/pro-Slytherin fic trying to make them the good guys, or a Pureblood-Culture fic trying to do the same. There's some feeling that the canon disregard for all Slytherin's being Magic-Nazis isn't the best way to go, so I'd say someone decided to change that and put it in their fic. Then some people read that and thought "Yeah, that's so cool!" and put it in their fics as well. And so on, and so on.

It's pretty hard to pinpoint an exact origin for things in a fandom as old and as large as Harry Potter. Especially given that, in the early days, a lot of things were posted in social media blogs and privately hosted places that no longer exist. But I'd be relatively confident betting on that suspicion.
