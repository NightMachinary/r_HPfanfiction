I prefer to view fics in two categories.

Those that create a different world/situation so that the racism allegory doesn't exist. Maybe there are similar canon events but you can pull in characters by appealing to things other than “don't be racist”. Like I kind of agree that the Wizarding World is heavily Christianised and maybe it'd be good to explore old and forbidden types of magic (so long as there are consistent values of do no harm etc).

The second are the ones that play the allegory straight and work it into any redemptions or character arcs.

Some others get a little confused or just ignore it and those I can deal with (it's fanfiction, can't be too picky or I'll not read anything). It's really just the ones that royally bungle it up that are a problem and I just nope outta there
