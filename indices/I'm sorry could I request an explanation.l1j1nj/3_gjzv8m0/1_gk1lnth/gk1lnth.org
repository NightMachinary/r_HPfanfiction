  Well, I think part of it comes from the wizards in the books celebrating the Muggle/Christian holidays of Halloween (All Hallows Eve) and Christmas rather than Samhain and Yule.

Why would wizards celebrate Samhain and Yule instead of Halloween and Christmas? What in canon (as opposed to pureblood-pandering fics like the one you quoted) suggests either of those are traditionally celebrated by wizards, pureblood or otherwise?
