Honestly I think this is good writing but an absolutely terrible take. Equating support for and joining a the Death Eaters with Hermione making off hand comments is spurious. Its like comparing an Al Qaeda fighter to your slightly embarrassing uncle who makes poor taste jokes out of ignorance. They are not the same thing.
