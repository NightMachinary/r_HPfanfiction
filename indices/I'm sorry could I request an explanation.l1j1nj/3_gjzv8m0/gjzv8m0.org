Well, I think part of it comes from the wizards in the books celebrating the Muggle/Christian holidays of Halloween (All Hallows Eve) and Christmas rather than Samhain and Yule. As is usually pointed out in those fics, the Christian attitude to magic-users in the past is the entire reason for the Statute of Secrecy, so why import their holidays rather than the more "traditional" ones?

It's used as the basis for the purebloods' anti-muggle rhetoric, to indicate that it came from a "valid" complaint that got escalated to mindless bigotry.

And when you're discussing bigotry, let's not forget how Hermione says that wizards "don't have an ounce of logic." The reverse bigotry of muggleborns ("Wizards are so backwards! They haven't made any progress since the Victorian age.") is just as bad.

The best (and only, really) treatment I've seen of this in a fanfic:

  “What?  Why?” Hermione demanded, clearly aghast at the idea of anyone not hating Draco Malfoy.  “He's absolutely foul!”

  “No more than you,” said Harry bluntly.

  Her jaw dropped and her eyes immediately sparkled with tears.

  Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes.  Merlin, he hated girls!  “My point is that you're both opinionated and prejudiced, Hermione,” he said firmly before she could start crying or leave in a snit or anything else that would cause him more trouble later.

  “I'm not-!”

  “You are,” Harry interrupted before her righteous indignation could get much traction.  “You are prejudiced against the Wizarding World in general.”

  “I'm not-“

  “You /are/,” he cut her off again.  “I've heard you make a thousand little comments that illustrate your feelings on the matter.  You think the Wizarding World is archaic and stagnant.  You see their traditions as outdated and barbaric.”

  “They are,” she muttered petulantly.

  “Exactly,” Harry sighed.  “Malfoy's not that different from you.  He's prejudiced against muggleborns because they come into the Wizarding World looking down their noses at it.  You go ahead and join the world and expect to be treated equally even as you're disdaining everything in sight because it's different from what you've always known.  You think yourself /above/ people raised in the Wizarding World because the muggle world is so much more /advanced/.”

  “Isn't it?” she challenged, her chin tilted up defiantly.

  “No,” he said bluntly, internally wincing at his harsh tone and scolding himself to be careful.  This was a subject about which he felt strongly and he could easily go overboard.  Hermione, like Draco, was extremely opinionated.  If simply told she was wrong, she was likely to clam up and stubbornly believe what she wanted to believe.  The truth had to be spoon-fed to her in order for her to absorb it.  “You think cars and computers and airplanes make the muggles /advanced/?  Honestly?

  “Wizards have been capable of nearly instantaneous travel over thousands of miles for more than six millennia since the portkey was invented.  Prejudice against homosexuals doesn't exist in the wizarding world because the process of combining genetic material from two individuals of the same sex and forming it into an embryo that can be grown in the uterus of a surrogate was perfected eight /thousand/ years ago.  Cancer doesn't exist in the Wizarding World because it was /cured/ eight thousand years ago.  Our healers only see it now in muggleborns, and it can be cured with a single potion.  The Wizarding World has been /civilized/ for over twenty thousand years.  We lived in sprawling cities while muggle tribes still followed herds on yearly migrations.”

  There was a long moment of silence in the compartment while Hermione stared at him in shock and Harry silently told himself to shut the hell up, already.  The arrogance of the muggleborns just pissed him off, and Hermione was one of the worst.

  “The reason that the Wizarding World seems outdated to you is because, over the last three hundred years, since the Statute of Secrecy was established, the Wizarding World has tried to blend into the muggle world.  Bit by bit, they've done so, but they're not very good at keeping up with the constantly changing trends in the muggle world and therefore they /seem/ outdated.  You took one look at them and made up your mind without ever paying attention to the fact that the muggle world's ‘civilization' is an /infant/ in comparison.”

  There was another drawn out silence before Hermione quietly said, “I thought you said you weren't racist.”

  Harry blinked at her, “What did I say that led you to believe I was racist?  What I just told you were facts.  I don't hate anyone because of them.”

  “You hate the muggleborns for not learning more about the Wizarding World,” she said with certainty.

  “Well, if that's true, then I'm not racist.  It's not racism to dislike someone because of their actions.  I only dislike the ones who exhibit that behavior.”

  “So you admit that you dislike me,” she said, her voice quavering on the point of a sob.

  “Hermione, this whole conversation started because I was explaining why I didn't hate you /or/ Malfoy.  I dislike some of your behaviors and opinions just as I dislike some of his.  Doesn't mean that I can't be friendly toward you both.”
