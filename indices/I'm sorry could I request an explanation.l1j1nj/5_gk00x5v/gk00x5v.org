In one fic I wrote which explored how someone could be radicalized as a pure blood I used 'Affirmative Action' eg giving Muggleborns jobs in the ministry/public office because they didn't have family connections and were disadvantaged as something that Pureblood extremists picked on to argue how Muggleborns had power and influence they didn't deserve.

Those extremists then followed up with 'its our world they shouldn't tell us how to run it' etc and pointed to every Ministry bungle as an example of why this policy shouldn't work.

Later on the radicalized character argues that the Muggleborn Registration commission will help them by making them acclimate.
