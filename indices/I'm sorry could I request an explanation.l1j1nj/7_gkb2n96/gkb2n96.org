I don't know much about where it comes from in the fan fiction sphere, but there IS some backing for it in the magical world. In A History of Magic (the book from the books) there are whole sections that talk about how the magical community was persecuted by muggles, that they were basically tortured and made to perform magic “for muggle ends”, so my interpretation is that it isn't all bigotry. The old school, pure blood witches and wizards were used and abused by the muggle community, and it made many of them pass that fear and hatred onto the next generations. So you end up with families like the Malfoys and Blacks who are seen as bigots for no reason, but who had a lot of trauma back in the day that now manifests as “muggle borns bad”, muggles are bad, we are superior, you can't take magic from us. They don't want to go back to the previous abusive culture, so they stomp out muggle influences whenever they can.

I wish this was better conveyed in canon, but instead it just comes off as bigotry without reason. And isn't that a damn shame.
