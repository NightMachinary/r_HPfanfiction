I've been reading fanfic for years now. Of course I've heard of HPMoR. It was actually one of the first fics I've ever read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it at the time, although I admit I've soured on it as my exposure to (in my opinion) much better fics increased. Still, I have been meaning to go back it now that its finished.
