My absolute favorite is The Alexandra Quick series by Inverarity, if you can count that as fanfiction. Other favorites (in HP) off the top of my head would include Backwards With Purpose by Deadwoodpecker, Harry Potter and The Boy Who Lived by The Santi, and With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat.
