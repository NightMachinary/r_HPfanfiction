Butalerner's A Curse of Truth is likely the best one out there. Absolutely incredible (edit: compared to other self-inserts), or it was when I read it a few months ago.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8586147/1/A-Curse-of-Truth][*/A Curse of Truth/*]] - /An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot!/
