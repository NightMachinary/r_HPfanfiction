I remember reading some story where Voldemort had a wife, and Evil!Dumbledore allied with some Vikings who had a tradition of making horcruxes. It was a pretty long story. The light side also used a prison in the Caribbean, which Voldemort found and pretty much nuked.

It sounds like a shitty story, but it's not that bad. Does it sound familiar to anyone?
