I don't tend to notice these, probably because I'm from Australia and already exist with a weird mix of British/American cultural influences.

That said, some stories are obviously well researched in various areas, so I don't really see why looking up aspects of British culture and language is any different? But I also don't have the skill or patience to write, so no judgement lol.
