I don't know British English well enough to do it reliably. I sometimes remember things and correct them when I find them, but...

Well, consider the Naruto fandom (which I used to write fics for). I am monolingual. I /cannot/ speak Japanese. But when writing a fic set in a Japanese setting with its own terminology, how do I deal with that? And honorifics, that's a system entirely alien to me. So do I purely go the American route, do I try to shoehorn in as much Japanese as I can based on what I've picked up through cultural osmosis, or do I go for some mix?

Obviously, there's only one right answer: whatever helps me write the best story. So if I say color when I should have said colour, or jerk when I should have said prat, then whoopsie-fucking-daisy. It's fanfiction, I'm an American, and if I need to, I'll dump British words like my ancestors dumped British tea. In the end, it's just a story.
