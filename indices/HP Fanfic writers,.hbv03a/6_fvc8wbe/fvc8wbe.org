The two that always really jump out at me are these.

Cream in tea. Please, please, don't. We take tea with milk, or if it's a lighter tea such as Earl Grey, lemon. I think the confusion on that has come from people hearing about a cream tea, which is a light meal - you get a pot of tea and a tray of cakes, small sandwiches and scones. The scones are served with cream and jam, which is where the term comes from.

Pancakes and waffles for breakfast. This always seems to crop up in fics where Sirius gets Harry early on and wants to spoil him. In the UK in the 80s, we would not have had pancakes for breakfast. They're a very American thing that haven't really taken off over here and definitely hadn't at that point. A "treat breakfast" in the UK is much more likely to be a Full English.
