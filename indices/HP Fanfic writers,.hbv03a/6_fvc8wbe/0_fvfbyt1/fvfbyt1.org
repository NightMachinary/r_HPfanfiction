One other thing that I want to add.

In the US, gun ownership is common. In the UK, it's very much /not/ - Vernon is an exception.\\
It's downright jarring to have guns discussed as if they were common threats, and especially for gun-safety to be common knowledge among Muggleborn kids (looking at you, Accidental Animagus).
