In fairness, handguns were only banned in the UK in 1996/97 and there was a huge amnesty for people to hand them in. Vernon having a gun in 1991 is less weird than a character who is a business executive rather than a criminal or a farmer having a gun in 2020 would be.

But yeah, even before the handgun ban the culture around guns in the UK is totally different to the US. Here, you know gun safety if you grew up on a farm or you went to Army Cadets. It's definitely not something that people were taught as a general thing, because even when we had laxer gun laws people didn't just go around carrying them for no bloody reason. Most kids in the UK know nothing about gun safety and the first thing they would do upon getting a gun /is/ point it at someone because they're only used to handling toy guns and water pistols.
