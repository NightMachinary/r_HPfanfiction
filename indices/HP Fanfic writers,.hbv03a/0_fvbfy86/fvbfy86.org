While overt Americanisms break your suspension of disbelief, I would hesitate to say that American writers should go out of their way to "Britishise" their fics. The problem with this is that more often than not, the attempt backfires and you end up with (for example) characters who speak in nothing but a string of cliched British idioms rather than having their own voice.

So many fics where authors look up a load of British slang and have Harry going around speaking like a chav.
