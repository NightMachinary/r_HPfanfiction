Surely you're used to reading American work by now? It's not something that I imagine US writers consider while writing. They're going against at least a decade of being immersed in mom, color, -ize, etc. And as a British-speaker myself, I see enough of it that it's not really disrupting when I read US spelling.

It makes me happy when I see characters written as British ones, but I'm not too fussed about it either way. Seems like something to put a Beta on (if you have one), and if not, not really worth dealing with.
