I wonder if I'm not so bugged by the difference because I'm from a country where English is one of our official languages and we use predominantly British but very occasionally North American spellings. Maybe I'm more flexible because of that, but I understand the original text is heavily committed to British English.

Fan fiction is made by people for free, with a huge donation of hundred of hours sometimes invested in their works. I take my time to let people know when there are differences if they invite feedback - for example I recently explained how a British GP practice works - but I'd say it never peeves or upsets me. I've always been interested to understand why the spelling in particular gets under people's skin. We have heavy deviations from canon in many other ways, in characterisations, in universe differences, sometimes physical traits etc, but the firm preference for British English is fascinating.
