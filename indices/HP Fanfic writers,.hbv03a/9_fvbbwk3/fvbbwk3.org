I agree that can be quite annoying. I personally get quite irritated when Harry Potter characters start fixing their tea with "cream and sugar*" like it's coffee - but I acknowledge that's kind of a cultural thing that you either know or you don't. Tbh, Sherlock fics are far worse for clumsy Britishisms and random Americanisms.

If anyone has any Britpick questions when they are fic-writing, feel free to DM. I don't have time to commit to full-on Britpicking, but I'm always open to answering questions when I'm not at work.

*Tea preparation is a highly controversial and contested topic in the UK alone (nevermind anywhere else), but it is usually milk and not cream that is added. Some nutter probably does, but it is not usually the done thing. The "cream" in cream tea refers to a practice of eating a light meal comprising of bread/scones with jam and clotted cream which can be dated back to the 11th Century. (Obviously there were no scones in the 11th Century). And North American style coffee creamer/half and half is not very common or widely-used in the UK, especially with tea.
