The go to "what the fuck am I reading, why is this so good, wtf wtf wtf" fic is linkao3(Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce) It's about what would happen if Gordon Ramsey is the potions master instead of Slughorn in book 6. It's long, ridiculously good, and will destroy your emotions, while also involving GORDON RAMSEY AND ALL THE SHIT THAT COMES WITH HIM. It's not particularly focused on Harry though, more of an ensemble, and has a great take on Ron.

If you like time travel, I'd suggests linkao3(of a linear circle)
