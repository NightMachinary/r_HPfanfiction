[It's fifth year. Everyone's in the DADA classroom waiting for the Professor to show up. Umbridge walks in, smiling.]

“Good morning every-"

[Harry interrupts, standing up from his desk.] “Oh for the love of- /seriously/? /Again?!/"

[Umbridge's smile twists.] “Is there a problem, Mr. Potter?"

"Yeah, I'd say there's a problem, /Professor Voledmort/." [A handful of students gasp in surprise, but most are just exasperated by this point. Ron and Hermione almost look bored.]

“I have no idea what you are talking about Mr. Potter." [The false Umbridge is calm and unconcerned.]

[Harry begins making his way to the door, followed by Hermione and Ron.] "Since you're using Polyjuice this time, you've probably got Umbridge alive and locked up somewhere. C'mon guys, let's go save the toad."

[Faux-Umbridge moves to stop the trio.] “You can't just-"

"Just what? Go and prove you're Voldemort? If you try to stop me, you'll just show everyone here I'm right." [Harry shoots Faux-Umbridge a smirk as he closes the door.] "Have fun teaching today. It's going to be the last day you can."
