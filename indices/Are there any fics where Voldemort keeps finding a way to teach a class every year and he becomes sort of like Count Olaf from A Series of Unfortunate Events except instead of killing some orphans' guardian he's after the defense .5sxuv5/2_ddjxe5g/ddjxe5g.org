*Q:* Why doesn't Voldemort like Muggleborns?

*A:* The first time he tried this, his [[https://i.imgur.com/VlMhcw2.jpg?1][very clever disguise]] fooled the Professors, the Foe-Glasses, the Probity Probes, the Secrecy Sensors, and the Sneakoscopes; but the Muggleborns kept laughing at him for some reason, until he couldn't stand it anymore, cursed one of them, and that Muggle-lover Dumbledore fired him!
