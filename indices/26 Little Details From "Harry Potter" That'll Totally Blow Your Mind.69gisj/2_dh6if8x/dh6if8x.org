I'm sure there are more (like when 13 dine together, the first to rise is the first to die "prediction", which I'm not going to waste time investigating), but number 12 is just wrong:

#+begin_quote
  Throughout the series, whenever Harry faces the Dementors, he is forced to relive his parents' last moments alive through his memories. However, thinking logically, Harry was only a baby when his parents died and wouldn't have any clear memory of that night. We also learn in Deathly Hallows that Harry has carried a piece of Voldemort's soul with him since that night. So the logical conclusion is that Harry is actually reliving Voldemort's worst memory -- of the night he came the closest he ever had to death.

Harry hears his father yell for Lily to take Harry upstairs. Voldemort was outside by the gates at this point, and couldn't have possibly heard it for it to have been Voldemort's worst memory.
