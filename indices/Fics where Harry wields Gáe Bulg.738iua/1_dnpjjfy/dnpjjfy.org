I wish i could help you, i do remember this occuring in one fic i read years ago but i dont remember the name.

I remember the basic premise being Harry trained and raised by Scathatch and when he proved himself as a worthy inheritor he became the carrier of Gae Bulg, MÃ³ralltach, and Beagalltach. I distinctly remember it wasnt a F/SN crossover but i dont remember the name or catagory.
