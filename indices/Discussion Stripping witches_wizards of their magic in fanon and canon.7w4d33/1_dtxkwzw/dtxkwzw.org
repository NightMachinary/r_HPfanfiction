I think you are confusing between losing the ability to 'use' magic and 'losing' magic.

Tonks lost control of her meta abilities, she didn't lose the ability to use magic altogether forever. She was still magic. Same with Merope. She lost the ability to use it because of heartbreak, which then lead to her inability to survive childbirth. She didn't die because she didn't have magic, she had it, but lost the will.
