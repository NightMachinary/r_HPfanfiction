It was said you cant steal magic not you cant loose it.

Merope Gaunt lost her ability to use magic after Tom Riddle Sr broke her heart by escaping.

And Tonks powers as metamorphmagus became very bad when she was very depressed because of Lupin.

meaning to make someone loose their magic you would probably have to traumatize them quite a bit.
