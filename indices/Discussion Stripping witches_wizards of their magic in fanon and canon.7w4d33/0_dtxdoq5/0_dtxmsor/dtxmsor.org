  Merope Gaunt lost her ability to use magic after Tom Riddle Sr broke her heart by escaping.

Source? I always took it (and am quite sure for the Tonk example) that this is just a case of losing the will to use magic, or, rather, the collectedness of mind. Using magic takes concentration and level-headedness that the broken Merope just couldn't muster. That doesn't mean she wasn't still technically a "witch" in the same way a pre-Hogwarts muggleborn is a witch --- she has magic within her and could physically cast a spell if she managed to perform the actual motions of it.
