In CA Dreamin', I have the concept of Binding a witch or wizard away from their magic---making them unable to use it. It's definitely on the Dark end of the magical spectrum, requires the person's blood and can't be done from a distance and is very obscure. As a result, the person is still magical and can pass on their magical genetics, but they are unable to perform magic themselves.

In the story, Harry relates a case where he saw it used on a very old wizard who was going senile and losing control of his magic, creating a very dangerous situation for his family, who turned to it as a last resort to keep grandpa from burning the place down.

To me, it makes for a more interesting story if there's a risk of losing something so integral to oneself. In HP canon, magic is an endless, boundless well that just seems to need a few swishes of a wand and that can get a bit boring after a while.
