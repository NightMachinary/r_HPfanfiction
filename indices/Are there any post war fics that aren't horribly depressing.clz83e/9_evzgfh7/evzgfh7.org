Here's a fluffier Dramione post-war fic. Admittedly, it's also a "secret pureblood Hermione" fic, but it at least doesn't have her go down the path of forgetting that she was raised by muggles in this one. If you do like Dramione, Colubrina is an excellent author for that (one of the few authors I actually enjoy reading Dramione fics by). linkffn(11149377)

The Sum of their Parts is a fairly classic and believable rise of Dark Lord Potter. And I mean that when I say you see the rise of Harry becoming a dark lord, because you see very few of the actual effects beyond what's implied. linkffn(11858167)

Here's a currently unfinished fic where Harry becomes the DADA teacher after trying to be an auror for a few years and realizing it doesn't make him happy. He's working on mending the Gryffindor/Slytherin rift and also trying to mentor a muggleborn student who doesn't want to be at Hogwarts. linkao3(15813657)
