I just skim through chapters until I find a passage that's interesting to me. Most of their fics are militaristic in some way, sometimes muggle wanky, have extensively headcanoned Europe, etc. Just a completely different tone from the actual Harry Potter stories. Not necessarily a bad thing but yes not for me.
