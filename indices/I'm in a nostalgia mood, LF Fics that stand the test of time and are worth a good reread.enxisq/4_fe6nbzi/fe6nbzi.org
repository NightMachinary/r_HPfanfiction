A few of my favourites that I go back to:

Linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

Not everyone's piece of cake but I do enjoy the premise of Harry striking out on his own to become the most powerful he can without anyone's help...with all the expected negative consequences as well.

Linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter)

A bit darker but refreshing in the way it looks at the world as a more cynical reader.

Linkffn(Seventh Horcrux)

Classic humour piece. You've probably read it already but you should try it if you haven't.

Linkffn(The Sum of Their Parts)

My favourite fan fiction to re-read.
