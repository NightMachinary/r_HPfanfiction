Technically it's never mentioned in the books that Harry lost the ability to speak parseltongue in the books- it was an interview with J.K. Rowling afterwards that confirm it. I would put forward that the Main Series books are the primary canon with interviews and movies as optional canon. I like incorporating details where I can but the loss of parseltongue was dumb so I discount it in headcanon.
