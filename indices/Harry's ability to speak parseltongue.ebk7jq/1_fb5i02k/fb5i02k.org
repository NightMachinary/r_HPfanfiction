There's certainly no suggestion that he had to be /possessed/ to any extent to use the Scar Horcrux's knowledge of Parseltongue --- rather, the way it's phrased is that due to the unpredictable magical effects of a bit of a soul being forced into the same body as another full soul, Harry's whole soul ended up absorbing some of the magical abilities inherent to Lord Voldemort's soul fragment.

So obviously it's quite possible (and, indeed, what /Cursed Child/ forces us to assume if one takes it to be canonical, but it's a reasonable assumption to make either way) that once the power has been transferred to Harry it doesn't just disappear just because the original source is removed --- in much the same way that picking up the toasted bread will not get the butter stain off the carpet.

Besides which, there is the matter of how "being a Parselmouth" works. Is it a permanent translation spell, or do you gain magical knowledge of the actual language? If the former, the magic disappearing would mean even a long-time Parselmouth who used Parseltongue every day would stop understanding it if they lost the gift; but if the latter (which has always made more sense to me), you wouldn't just /forget/ the magically-learned language just because the thing that "taught" it to you is gone.
