I personally have two theories : 1. Parseltongue is an hereditary magical trait of the slytherin family and is a consequence of magic signatures or some form of magical ADN that determine access to this sort of magic. Now Hosting a Horcrux has forced Harry magical signatures or magical ADN to change to match Tom Riddle magical ADN as is demonstrated by the brother-wand ( wand choose their wizard by matching the magical ADN) . Destroy the Horcrux would not restore Harry original magical ADN. 2. Parseltongue is an hereditary magical trait of the slytherin family. Just as blood of a father determine an heritage be it magical, monetary or others entitlements, a piece of magic that is donated to a child determine magically a magical heritage ( Tom Riddle is considered to be a secondary father to Harry). Destroying the Horcrux would yet again don't change this fact
