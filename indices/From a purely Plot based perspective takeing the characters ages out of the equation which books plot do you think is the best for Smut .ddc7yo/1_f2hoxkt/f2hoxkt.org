The creation of DA and the whole defense club leaves a lot of potential for introducing people to each other in situations outside of the normal class routine. you can put as much or as little drama into it as you want with many potential partners, the ministry and the growing threat of voldemort for outside pressure

First year quidditch leaves some good openings too. mixed gender team, everyone has their blood up from practices/games, locker room shenanigans. you can play it off as mentor/student too if you want. then there is all the potential with other teams and their interactions.
