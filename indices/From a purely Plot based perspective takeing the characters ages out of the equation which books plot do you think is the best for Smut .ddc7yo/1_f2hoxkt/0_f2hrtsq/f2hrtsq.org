Wasn't there a time were it was a common trope in stories that Exercises and high adrenaline and emotional stuff brought magic to the surface and one of the ways that The Gryffindor Quidditch team(and other teams) bonded was threw Naked cuddling(and team orgies for older students) so their magic could get to know each other and make the team closer and able to work together because it would make them work better as s team on a magical and subconscious level?

I remember it from years ago, Normal Harry and Katie would be Naked left to cuddle naked while the rest of the Team went of to have a Orgy.
