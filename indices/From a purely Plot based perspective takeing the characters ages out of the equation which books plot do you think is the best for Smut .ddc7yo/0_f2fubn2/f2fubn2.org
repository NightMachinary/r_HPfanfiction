By takeing the characters age out of perspective I assume you mean aging them up so that Hogwarts is more college age ? If so yes the fourth books plot with the other schools and the tri wizard tornement does lend itself best to a smut fic plot wise.

I also agree that smut should be left to dedicate Smut fics and not forced into stories were its not the main focus of the story.
