If you mean make hogwarts a Uni?

Hmmm.

Gobelt of fire is a good choice not just the other schools but if you rpefer a story competition and life or death fighting is good. Most pairings work if you wanna do it.

Order of the Phoneix is angst as well bit well tbh read any romance novel or smutty novel or story Angst is soooo useful oets you do tons of different types of emotions while writing.

Also I have seen more than a few slash fics play around with umbridgees reign lead to a spike of homophobia. Which is good tho I usually prefer if a gay writer is writing that stuff.

Half Blood prince as it is... Is just Drarry fuel it is far far far too easy to turn into drarry fuel. Granted it also is good like really good for Ronaco and Tharry.

Granted Tharry is just gay Harmony.

Deathly Hallows is iffy.

It hads MOMENTS but it requires a lot of changing.

I like to see people play around with Dean x Harry during this periord idk why but having Harry x dean be established and then it gets to Deathly hallows just feels right.
