By the end of the Movies weren't a lot a the actors for Harry, Ron, Neville, Draco,Hermione ect like 3 or 4 years older than the Characters they were playing. so even the Harry Potter films by the end had a minor case of Dawson casting by the end.

I am pretty sure by the time of Order of The Phoenix film even Emma Watson who was one the youngest when they filmed the Philosopher's Stone was over 18 years old.
