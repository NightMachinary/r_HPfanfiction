My headcanon has Peter as the Marauders' potions guy.

Pettigrew:

- Made the temp body of Babymort.
- Did the potions component for the ritual.

These two things sounds like something that you can't get talked through. Or blindly read the instructions while doing it. I also headcanon more stuff being required for the ritual. Like the liquid in the cauldron before? That can't be just water. That has to be something that spent months brewing.

Pettigrew isn't a potions master by any degree. But he had the potential for it if he didn't spend most of his life being a spy and a literal Rat.
