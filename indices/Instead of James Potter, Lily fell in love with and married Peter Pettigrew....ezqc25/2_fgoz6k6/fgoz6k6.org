Poor Lily ends up with awful guys for some reason. I wonder how you'd make her marry him without noticing how awful he really is. I mean, selling out your own family is a different level of awfulness. Unless Peter becomes a charmer and manages to fool her. Or maybe like with Snape, she can make excuses for him. But marrying him is a bit too much because that's a different level of stupidity. Even if I do think she could pretend to not see things she didn't want to see. It would be interesting, though. Harry's own father selling him out. The shack scene would be impressive.
