I see. But I think that the whole idea of him convincing her would be an important part of the story. It's one thing to convince people they should make you a secret keeper, but here we are talking about a relationship. They'd have to interact at some point. And since James fancies Lily, this would affect his friendship with Peter, I think. Also, there should be something that attracts her to Peter. Lily and James seem rather similar to me. I can't help but think it would all start with pity because I can't get that scene with the marauders out of my mind. I think there are other interesting things in addition to that reveal I'd love to know about. I have a feeling there simply isn't an HP fan who would be willing to put Peter in such an honourable role of Lily's husband. Some of them conveniently ignore him in the marauder fics.
