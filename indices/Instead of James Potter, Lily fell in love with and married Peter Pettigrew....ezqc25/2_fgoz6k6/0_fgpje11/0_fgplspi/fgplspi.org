i didn't say it's completely impossible. But it would be a story with a dark turn, not only because he betrays his family, but also because he manipulates Lily. After all, she managed to ignore what Snape was doing, probably convincing herself she can change him. As for James believing Peter was a good person, I'm not so sure. He might have simply believed Peter wouldn't have enough courage to join Voldemort. As much as I want to believe this was a matter of trust, I have my doubts. Sirius was the one who convinced James, and I have a feeling he said no one would suspect someone like Peter. That's hardly a compliment. The problem is that Rowling makes it clear we are supposed to dislike him, at least judging by that one memory we've got in canon. That just proves your point about manipulation. But it does make me wonder about the strength and sincerity of that friendship.
