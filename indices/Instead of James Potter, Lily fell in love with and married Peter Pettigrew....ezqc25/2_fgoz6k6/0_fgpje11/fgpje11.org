Womrtail has shown himself to be a great manipulator in canon. He was able to convince James and Sirius to switch him to the secret keeper instead (if James didn't think he was a good person do you think he'd risk his wife and child's safety by trusting him?), and he become a spy for Voldemort without anyone in the Order of the Phoenix ever suspecting him of betrayal. Everyone is questioning why Lily would be interested in him, but remember that until Harry's third year no one (except Sirius, and he was doing his time in Azkaban) knew how much of a terrible person he was. I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility for him to have manipulated her into a relationship, especially when they were still at school and everyone thought he was harmless.
