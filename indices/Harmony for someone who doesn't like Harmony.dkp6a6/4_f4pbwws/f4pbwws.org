Error of Soul is fun, it was rec'd earlier.

*Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire* is well written and has pretty canon characters. It also fits your request to a tee.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

Hermione gets her name out of the goblet (due to her trying some advanced magic). Harry gets stuck playing Hermione's role (Mediator between Ron and Hermione), and Ron's jealousy points toward Hermione.

I feel the story avoids many of the issues you usually see in Harmony. The Ron/Hermione falling out is based on his jealousy over the Goblet toward her (which Hermione takes... much worse than Harry did). They eventually make up, but it kills the possible Romance. McGonagal gets to play matchmaker, which is cute.

​

The only thing I didn't like about it was the whole 'Lucius Malfloy and Fudge try to get Hermione stripped of her magic by expelling her'. I donno, i've never been a fan of that plotline.

​

*A Little Child Shall Lead Them* and *Stages of Hope* both have Harmony elements, but they are not the focus of the plot. More, it provides a good motive for Harry / Hermione while they do other things. They also both have the relationship pre-established.

I'll also call *Escape* a guilty pleasure. It does gloss over a few of Hermione's flaws, but the whole "Fuck the Ministry and its Marriage law I'mma become a Yank" is a fun plot, and other than that the writing is very good. Also, Best Hermione parents.
