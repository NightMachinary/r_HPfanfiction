I maintain that I don't object to Harmony in principle. But I've yet to find a fic I liked where it was core to the story.

I had high hopes for Moments in Love recently, which at least did a good job of justifying the pairing, but it went rather downhill later with scenes like Harry getting the golden egg just by writing Dragon Friend on himself in runes. And it was getting really soppy.
