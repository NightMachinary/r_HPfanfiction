Despite (or maybe because of) me reading a lot of Harmony, I never know what to recommend in these threads. I'm always doubting myself on whether my favorite fics were good on a technical level...

Here are some old portkey fics I've read recently, They were written before some of the tropes you dislike were even invented.

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5188/1][*/Hermione Full of Grace/*]] by DeliverMeFromEve

#+begin_quote
  Hermione takes on life after Voldemort with renewed enthusiasm, only to discover that unresolved issues of the heart can't be forgotten. In her brave quest for a happier future, she meets eccentric wizard billionaire Lysander Athanasius, a suitor who seems to know exactly what she needs, and seems to raise the hackles of her dearest Harry and wayward Ron. NC-17 for LATER chapters. WARNINGS: Fluffiness abounds. Tooth decay imminent. Will not write so much fluff again, I swear.
