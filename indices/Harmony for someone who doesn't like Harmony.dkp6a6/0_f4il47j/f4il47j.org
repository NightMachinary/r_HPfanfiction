As a fellow detractor of Harmony (it's not bad, but it tends to be very bland), I can recommend a few that I've enjoyed.

!linkffn(Lord Hermione?) is a very different take on Hermione's character where she was alone at Hogwarts for over three years before she became friends with Harry, and is much more abrasive and cynical as a result.

!linkffn(A Fair Life) is another one I enjoy, though I generally find Harmony more palatable as a lesbian pairing.

!linkffn(Thresholds by Stanrick) is a pure fluff, and it's pretty cute fluff, too.
