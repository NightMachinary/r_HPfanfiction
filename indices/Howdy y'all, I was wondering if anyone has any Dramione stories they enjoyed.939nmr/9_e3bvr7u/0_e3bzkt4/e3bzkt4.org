Actually not so much, I have always like the books way more than the movies. I didn't even get into the movies much until the later ones came out. Like I said, I'm not sure why I like them together, perhaps it's the drive they both have to improve themselves (Hermione through knowledge and Draco through power). It might also be that they are both vocal in what they believe in. I also like to think that Draco somewhat redeems himself later in life, seeing as he doesn't go to Azkaban. I do agree that they would never EVER get together while still in school unless it was an AU.
