Depends on what you count as canon.

It is loosley supported at best through the books with the almost throw away line about "The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black".

It is likely hubris and fabrication on the Blacks part but if the claim of Nobility is true there most likely are at least some wizard lords.

Pottermore, love it or hate it has definitely expanded upon the concept with the outlining of the Sacred 28.
