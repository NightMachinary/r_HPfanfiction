I remember having the same thought when I first read the book. To me it was the obvious answer to their Horxrux killing problem. But as you said, it would probably have been a pretty boring solution compared to the whole Basilisk venom and Sword of Gryffindor thing.

As to whether Harry would be able to cast it in the first place, that's up to debate. Personally I think at least canon Harry doesn't have enough hate for Voldemort to use Avada Kedavra successfully. Plus he's probably afraid of using it as even when face to face with Voldemort he still goes for Expelliarmus.

If you're thinking of using this solution in a fanfiction, I'd say go for it. Just be careful to spin it as believable (make Harry sound generally more hateful/vengeful towards Voldemort).
