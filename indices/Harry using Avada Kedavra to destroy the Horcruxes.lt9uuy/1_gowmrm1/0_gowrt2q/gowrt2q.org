Yeah, lol. Two words compared to the whole "Sword of Gryffindor" quest isn't too interesting.

I agree, there are good arguments for both sides. I think, for me, it seems like canon Harry could cast AK successfully in Deathly. He's dealt with child-abuse, terrible situations, deaths of classmates, lost Sirius, lost Dumbledore, ruined his relationship with Lupin (he's in the tent so he hasn't met with him again yet), and has the general pressure of ending Voldemort. He's definitely set on killing Voldemort and isn't disturbed by the concept so I think it stands to reason that he could cast AK successfully when the horcurx's influence pushed him over the edge. The whole Expelliarmus schtick is a bit comical at times imo. Yeah, it makes sense in the final confrontation with Voldemort since he just talked to fairy-godmother Dumbledore and was "enlightened" and whatnot, but in other situations? My two cents at least.
