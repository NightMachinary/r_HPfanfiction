Well, to be fair, it was Harry's first time ever casting Crucio so even if he felt an enormous amount of rage and hatred, it's unlikely that he would've gotten it perfectly on the first time. Even then, he still knocked over and surprised one of the most dangerous and powerful witches to ever live.

With the Carrows, I agree that there are quite a few events that resulted in his success but even still, the point is that Harry had sufficient hatred and intent to cast the Cruciatus. And from what I could tell in the books, that hatred arose when Amycus insulted and spat on McGonagall--a very different trigger to say, horcrux-fueled anger. I wouldn't personally call it a failure as Harry very clearly caused Amycus excruciating pain and then threw him ten feet across the room, knocking him unconscious. Not a bad second attempt at the spell. I don't think it's fair to compare Harry's Cruciatus with Voldemort's and Bellatrix's as those two have spent /decades/ utilizing and perfecting the curse. I mean, it was said that Bellatrix was a master of using the Cruciatus, able to modify and intensify the spell at will. For his second attempt, judging the intent and purpose of the spell, I'd say Harry performed admirably.

Even if Harry didn't want to hurt or kill anyone, using the Imperius /properly/ required Harry squashing the victim's will with an intent to control them. Given the similar intent-requirement for the other two unforgivables, it is evident that Harry /could/ utilize them.

An intent to kill? To sever the soul and defeat Voldemort? I think it's fairly possible that, while in the tent, tensions could have easily and DID rise to the point where it's definitely possible that Harry, fueled on aggression, hatred, and Horcrux-inspired rage could've AKed the locket properly. I doubt that the other two members of the Golden Trio could've accomplished it (like you said) but I'm certain that Harry, after everything that has happened to him, could've accumulated enough hatred to try and destroy Voldemort with an AK.

That said, why is AK considered the most terrible unforgivable curse in the Wizarding World? Compared to losing control over your body and debilitating and mind-wrenching agony, painless and instantaneous death doesn't seem so bad...
