Yup, just one minor irritation could've pushed him over the edge to AK the locket in a fit of rage.

Yep, definitely agree. To be fair, however, Harry's gone through and experienced far more than the average civilian or Auror (who could cast AK successfully). Hell, didn't Harry feel the Cruciatus every time Voldemort cast it during his dream-vision things? Pretty crazy.

True, the victim could survive, but imagine the emotional and physical trauma. With the Imperius, imagine having killed your entire family with your bare hands or something equally horrific. Living after that happened would be an exceptionally cruel reminder of what happened. And with the Cruciatius, imagine the damage caused to your nervous system after, say, a few minutes. Even Voldemort never used the Cruciatus for more than a few seconds when punishing his servants and even took breaks in between for minor recovery in the hopes of preserving homeostasis. And this is Voldemort! AK is far more tame imo.
