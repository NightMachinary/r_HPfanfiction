A Horcrux is not truly alive and therefore cannot be killed.

The killing curse's effects on objects are variable and unimpressive, sometimes it bounces right off, other times it explodes. I'd imagine Horcruxes fall into the bounce of category, but even if it does explode, blowing up horcruxes just doesn't work.

It'd work on Nagini of course, she's very much alive and killable.
