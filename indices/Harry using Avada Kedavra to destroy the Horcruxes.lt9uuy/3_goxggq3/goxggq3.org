I don't think the Killing Curse could "destroy" an Horcruxe. While it was never confirmed, the Killing Curse seems to attack the target's soul (it kills the target while leaving the body intact), while an Horcruxe is supposed to work as the opposite of a soul. The Horcruxe is supposed to be fine as long as its vessel is intact, so I don't see why a spell that is not supposed to do any damages (though I guess they broke some things in canon) could work.

Also . . . I think it kinda feel cheap. I know that Canon Harry is not a Dark Wizard, and using the Killing Curse would be extremely hard for him, but it would still be relatively easy to cast for most people looking for Horcruxe (usually Dark Wizard wanting to kill concurence). But Hermione read the explanation on Horcruxe (and how to destroy them) in /Magick Most Evile,/ an extremely dark book. Most people who read this kind of book would not be adverse to using the Killing Curse, so I don't see why the book would not mention such a convenient way, and rather send the wizard on a quest to look for Basilisk Venom, or to learn the very dangerous spell of Fienfyre.
