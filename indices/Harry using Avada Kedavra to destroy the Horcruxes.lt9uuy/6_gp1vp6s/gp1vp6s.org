"There's only one thing left to try, I think." Harry said quietly. Ron and Hermione, who had been arguing loudly about what else they could try, fell silent. Hermione, always the sharpest of them, choked as she cottoned on. Ron wasn't far behind. They both turned to Harry, whose gaze was locked on the Horcrux with an intensity that terrified them.

"You don't mean that, Harry! You can't mean that. Those curses, especially that one..." Ron started. "... Are completely unlockable. There's no magical protection from them." Harry interrupted. Hermione thought furiously as Ron gaped, coming to a sobering conclusion. She gripped Ron's shoulder, turning him around to face her. Hermione didn't need to say anything; ever the chess master, Ron had came to the same conclusion. They walked to Harry's side, bracketing him silently.

Harry smiled for a moment, then frowned as he asked the question. "How...?" Harry tried to ask, trailing off uncertainly. Hermione understood anyway. "The Killing Curse requires but two things to obtain an outcome that is certain and final. Hatred, and intent. The successful caster must believe, with all certainty, that the world would be better served by the target's death. He must be willing to take the ultimate act without hesitation; he must, in the end, desire to be the hand of Death himself." Hermione recited clinically. Harry nodded, and closed his eyes in concentration. This would be painful, he knew.

What did he want, really? Was Voldemort's destruction merely a means to obtaining a better life for himself? If Voldemort had never heard the name Potter, would Harry want to kill him? As he pondered this, Ron's shoulder brushed up against his, and he knew the answer. So many people had lost everything due to that monster. Ron's brothers had nearly been killed at various points in the years that Harry had knew him, as had Ron, and Mrs. Weasley, sweet and motherly and strong, had lost her brothers, Gideon and Fabian, to the war.

Hermione, who he could see nervously shifting next to him, had given up much, as well. Her parents, who Harry had only met in passing, had not understood the danger their daughter was always in because Voldemort had stirred up violent bigots against people with heritage they disagreed with. Hermione had done the unthinkable; she had erased her parents' memories of her and their life together, moving them to Australia so that they could not be targeted by Death Eaters, Voldemort's followers. Here she stood, never knowing if she'd ever see her parents again, all because of the Dark Lord. Harry understood that pain.

Neville, whose parents were tortured into insanity.

Dumbledore, who fought against the dark, killed by his command.

Barty Crouch, killed by his own son who Voldemort had twisted into a cruel mockery of himself.

Sirius, the white sheep of the Black family, killed before he could truly live.

Voldemort had caused all of this. Harry's wand slipped into his hand of its own accord, the holly and phoenix feather creation responding to the rage of its Master. His friends noticed his movement, and stepped back and away from him. Harry spoke once more, raising his wand to point at the cursed locket. "The wand movement?" he asked. "Like your scar. Sowilo, the rune of victory." Hermione answered.

Harry once more locked eyes with the Horcrux, and raised his wand another fraction of an inch. Then, Harry spoke two words that all present would remember for the rest of their life.

"AVADA KEDEVRA."
