  From what we understand in canon and even in "Fanon," the Killing Curse severs the soul from its physical shell--whether it's in an organic body or something artificial.

I'm pretty sure that's purely fanon. In canon, the curse just kills you. And your soul does leave your body when you die, but that's just a side effect. When a dementor kisses someone, it does remove their soul, but they stay alive.

So I don't think it's a given that the Killing Curse could destroy a nonliving horcrux. I wouldn't complain about a fic that decided it does that work way, but it's not canon.
