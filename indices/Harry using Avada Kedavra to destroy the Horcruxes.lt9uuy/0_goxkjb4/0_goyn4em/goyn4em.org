  I'm pretty sure that's purely fanon. In canon, the curse just kills you. And your soul does leave your body when you die, but that's just a side effect. When a dementor kisses someone, it does remove their soul, but they stay alive.

This 100%

But also the proposed mechanism directly contradicts everything we're told about horcruxes. There's a pretty detailed description of them in DH that everyone just seems to ignore:

1. A horcrux is not like a person, but its opposite. A person is a soul with a physical body; a horcrux is a physical body with a soul.

2. This has a fundamental impact on the relationship between body and soul. A person's soul is not affected by what happens to their body, because the soul is primary and the body secondary. With a horcrux, on the other hand, the body is primary, meaning the soul shares the fate of its body.

3. This is why the *only* way to destroy a horcrux is to destroy its physical body, because the soul and physical body are one (unlike a person, where the soul and body are independent). With a horcrux, there is no way to directly "access" the soul, because it does not have the dual body/soul nature of a person. Rather, the body is the soul and the soul is the body.

So no, using the Killing Curse on a horcrux would not work, because it does not destroy the physical object beyond magical repair.
