  So no, using the Killing Curse on a horcrux would not work, because it does not destroy the physical object beyond magical repair.

The only counterpoint I'd have there is "living Horcruxes", of which we have 2 examples: Harry and Nagini.

The soul-fragment within Harry was, in fact, destroyed/sent to the afterlife by the Killing Curse. However, there exists a counter-argument in that that soul-splinter was never confirmed to work by the same rules - after all, unless Voldemort went the full length in preparing Baby Harry as a Horcrux vessel, he wasn't exactly made to be one.

The real question, then, is whether the Killing Curse would have worked on Horcrux!Nagini - and that, I'm actually not sure about. The fact Voldemort did bring Nagini into battle suggests he was at least comfortable enough with his Final Horcrux being in the thick of a warzone with Killing Curses (and all manner of other nasty spells) flying all over the place, but then Voldemort did suffer from a terminal case of hubris.
