Probably looking for something more traditional 2D. That said, beggars aren't choosers :).

I get that it's sort of a weird request as this is typically something someone is paid for. But considering that the text is "free", I'm really not likely to pay someone for the art. It definitely feels weird as I've normally paid people for this type of thing with my other work. It's a weird grey area...
