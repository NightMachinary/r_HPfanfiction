This series has Harry doing a lot more interhouse activities. The first one (the one I linked) is kinda odd, more like a setup of the premise than a story, but it's quite short, and the sequels where Harry is at Hogwarts are really good.

FYI, the premise is that the Dursleys are abusive and Harry reacts to this a bit more realistically. Or maybe I should say typically instead of realistically.
