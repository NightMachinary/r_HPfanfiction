Been a long time lurker, finally signed up for an account.

I am actually working on a crossover fic (not published anywhere yet) that has Harry raised by Michael Corleone in a Godfather universe crossover. My difficulty is staying true to Puzo's rather ... specific ... prose style, rather than that of Rowling. I will try to get a chapter or two of it up this weekend.
