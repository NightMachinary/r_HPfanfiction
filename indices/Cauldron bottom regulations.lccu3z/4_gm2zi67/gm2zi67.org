Percy gets shafted a lot, even by canon. Sure, he has his heroic moment there at the end, but JK Rowling really went out of her way to make him as unlikeable as possible. It wouldn't have taken much to correct that; a single line from Hermione about how dangerous bad cauldrons can be, a blurb about him looking uncomfortable at Harry's trial, Mrs. Wesley mentioning a letter from Percy apologizing for his actions. Something, anything that wouldn't have added more than seven words to the word county of each book.
