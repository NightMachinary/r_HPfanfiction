I have an irrational fondness for Percy. He's not the most likable character in canon, but I feel like it's because we don't get to know him enough. But also I have done the exact same thing he did in that scene. Prattling on about some subject that I find fascinating only to watch the person's eyes glaze over with boredom. I've always understood why he was passionate about it. It's his job, he's excited, it is an important safety issue, but he really should've realized no one else would care. The poor little dork.
