I'm not sure if cauldron bottom thickness is really that much of a defining trait for Percy. It was his project at a certain point in time, and he's passionate about the work, but I suspect after the regulation gets passed he'd move on to a different policy issue. If anything, Percy's character traits should be that he's passionate about his job and wants to make the world a better place with diplomatic means because that's what he's good at. It seems a bit disrespectful to reduce that to "obsessed with cauldron bottoms" just because that was one of his successes.
