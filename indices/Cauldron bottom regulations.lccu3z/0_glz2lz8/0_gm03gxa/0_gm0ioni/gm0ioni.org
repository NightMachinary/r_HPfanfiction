I want to see a moment where harry takes an interest in metallurgy/potions or something and happily talks to Percy for hours about cauldron bottom thickness.

That being said I accidentally got captured by the quality guy from a powdered metal factory at a career fair for a whole hour and couldn't tactfully escape. So I see both sides.
