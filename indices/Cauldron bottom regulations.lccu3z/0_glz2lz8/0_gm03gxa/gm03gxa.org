I don't know if I would agree w/ your last point. I think canon-Percy /does/ realize that no one else cares; he's just---rightfully---aggrieved and irritated that no one in his family seems to appreciate that he's working on an important issue that affects a large number of people. What's come to being one of my big pet peeves in /Harry Potter/ fanfiction are those "Percy, [having taken]/taking a level in self-awareness, realizes how /boring/ cauldron bottoms are and shuts up about them"-type moments, especially when they're treated as some sort of character defining/affirming moment.
