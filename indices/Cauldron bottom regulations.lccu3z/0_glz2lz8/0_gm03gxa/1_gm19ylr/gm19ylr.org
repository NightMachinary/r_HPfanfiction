Any Muggle counterpart of Percy would be thrilled to be doing his job too.

He's a diplomat. A minor one, given how young he is, but still. The Foreign Office (State Department for you Americans!) is one of the most competitive, highly sought after civil service roles there is in a Muggle context, and he's slotted in as an assistant to the boss /straight out of school/.

That's genuinely impressive. Percy's done brilliantly well for himself...and no one seems to value it.
