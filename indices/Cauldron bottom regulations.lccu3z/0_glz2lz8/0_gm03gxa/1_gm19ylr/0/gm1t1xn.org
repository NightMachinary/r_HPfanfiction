Now that I think of it, it's kind of odd that the position that Barty Crouch Sr is shunted off to in disgrace is Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. I know it's not the same thing as "demoting" the Attorney General to Secretary of State (I guess for the UK it'd be Justice Secretary to Foreign Secretary?---I don't know UK government positions nearly as well as US ones), but still.

I wonder if that's why ^{⟨spoilers for summer of Year 3 of The Sinister Man's} /^{Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin}/^{, ie} /^{Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace}/^{⟩} The Sinister Man decided to deviate f/ canon regarding Barty Crouch Sr's fall f/ grace the way that he did, reframing the post of Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation as a political concession f/ a newly-elected longshot-candidate "considered green, but at least better than the authoritarian-ish guy whose son turned out to be a Death Eater" Minister of Magic Fudge to his considered-more-experienced opponent.
