I always wished Harry had been friends with Percy. I think Percy would've been the perfect friend for him. He'd have helped him learn everything there was to know about the wizarding world without simply assuming that Harry knew already. I feel like he would've avoided getting into so many dangerous situations though, might've made for a boring series of books.

It seemed rather ridiculous to me that Percy would even consider reading that book, but for all we know that was a fascinating read. I doubt it though.
