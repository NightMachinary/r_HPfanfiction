I agree. He doesn't ever display as much fondness for Hermione as for Ron or Ginny either. Even in book 7 he is always quite annoyed by her but he keeps it in him. He only expresses awe in her when she does something unconventional. My best guess is that Harry doesn't like "proper" people that much because of the fact that he had to grow up with the Dursleys who were proper normal people.
