That is very true, but Harry is fairly loyal and when he first met the Weasleys he had had no friends up to that point. I could easily see him becoming, and then staying friends with Percy in the right circumstances. He also couldn't stand Hermione when they first met. It wouldn't be a simple matter to make it work though.
