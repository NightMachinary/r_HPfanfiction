Harry forms a team of himself, Hermione and Percy. The three of them construct a plan for The Project and move with it. Percy is an important character there and can be regarded as Harry's friend. The culmination of the first project is actually very sweet and emotional, and everyone in the school finally acknowledges Percy.
