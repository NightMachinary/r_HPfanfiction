When I first read the book, Percy was like my fictional avatar. He really resonated with me.

Just like Percy, I tried to discourage my siblings from following my non conventional parents and pretend to be conventional instead just because a Dark Lord was rising.

And just like Percy, when the Dark Lord rose and we were in a Deathly Hallows-type situation, I realized I was wrong and my parents were actually right.

Every ref to him makes me LOL. Remember in COS, when they are visiting Diagonal Alley and Percy is holed up in Florish and Botts reading "a perfectly boring book called Prefects who made it"? LOL.
