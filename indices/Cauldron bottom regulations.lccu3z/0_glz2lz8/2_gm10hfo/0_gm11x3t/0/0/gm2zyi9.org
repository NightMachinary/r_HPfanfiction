I agree wholeheartedly, on both counts. I would love to read a fic exploring a more nuanced portrayal of him. But I agree he has his flaws, but everyone does. I've seen so many fics which act like his dissatisfaction with his family's reputation is unforgivable. He was a jerk to them, and he did behave like a pompous idiot, but he was also a teenager at the time. People do stupid things at that age and he regretted it in the end. I find him weirdly compelling.
