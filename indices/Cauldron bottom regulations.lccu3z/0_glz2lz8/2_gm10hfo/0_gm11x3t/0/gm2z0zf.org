Honestly, out of all the head canons out there I rather like this one. I wouldn't mind reading a fic with this type of Percy as a side character or storyline.

That said, I think Percy's biggest flaw is that he's bigheaded. He wanted to be important, and wanted others to recognize him as such. He was constantly dropping names of people he viewed as important and talked about how he was fighting against his father's and family's bad reputation. He abandoned the magical regulation job for one as Fudge's assistant, publicly denouncing his family for a career boost. I don't think Percy is a bad guy, I think he was a bit full of himself and ambitious and that all went to his head.
