I can see it that way if I try, and that type of Percy isn't someone I would enjoy being around very much, but I automatically slide back into thinking of him as being fascinated by the subject. Partly because I like him better that way, but mostly because I have more in common with him that way.

His wearing the badge at home could easily be viewed as him being boastful and wanting to rub it in, but I always saw it as him simply being proud of himself. I took it as him wearing it for his own sake. It made more sense to me that way because it's not like he didn't get flack for it. But that's just the way I saw it and I'll be the first to admit that it's just as likely that he was being a jerk.
