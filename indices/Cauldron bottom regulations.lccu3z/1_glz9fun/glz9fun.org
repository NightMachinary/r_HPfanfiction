Linkffn(Inspector No.13) uses this as a minor plot point. In the terms of how cauldron bottoms are about to be standardised for safety purposes.

I remember another fic that talks about weaponising badly made cauldrons. I think it's linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter).

But I've always been interested in this topic.
