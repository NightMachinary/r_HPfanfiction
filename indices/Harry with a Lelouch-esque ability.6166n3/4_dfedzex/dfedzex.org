The Imperius Curse is already a Geass-esque power, but far superior. Lelouch can't Geass the same person more then once whereas Imperio can be used infinitely on the same target as Harry proved in DH. Magic, just like Lelouch's Geass, does not tire, exhaust, or limit its user.

If anything, Imperio already OUTCLASSES Lelouch's Geass since unlike Lelouch's Geass, the Imperius Curse can:

- Be used more than once on the same person.

- Be cast non-verbally and can give orders without verbally commanding the Imperiused target. Lelouch can't use Geass without speaking nor can he give commands non-verbally.

- Be impossible for muggles, Squibs, or nonhuman beings (I.e. Goblins, Centaurs) to resist. By contrast, C.C, V.V, and Charles were completely immune to Lelouch's Geass and at least two people (Euphemia and Nunally) attempted to resist it.

*TL;DR: People forget just how powerful Imperius Curse was in canon. The request might as well have been "Harry uses the Imperius Curse to its true potential". Its easily the third most powerful spell after Voldemort's DADA Jinx and the Fidelius Charm.*
