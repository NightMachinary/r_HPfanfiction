I suppose.

I will agree that he has a much better Ginny than canon, and the relationship is built up semi-well.

I still wouldn't think it natural if this Harry got with Ginny though, and I'd also find it disappointing storytelling - for a Slytherin!AU, he's managed to divert canon somewhat well, but it still falls very close to canon.

If he get's with Ginny as well, and it /lasts/, I'd be sorely disappointed. I don't think she and what she represents fits very well with this Harry - the author is already skirting close to a very canon Harry, although he redeemed himself somewhat with Pettigrew - this Harry settling peacefully with Ginny would be the final death knell for him as an original canon independent protagonist.
