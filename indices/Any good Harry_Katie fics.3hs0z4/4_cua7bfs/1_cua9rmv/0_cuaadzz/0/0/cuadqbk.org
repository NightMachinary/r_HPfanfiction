Ginny's had proper build up so I'm not complaining, I liked what the author's done with her as it's significantly better than the real books an comes across natural. In comparison the girls he dates are almost like distractions, Katie in particular. He basically just makes out with them in his free time to relieve stress and Katie ended up being almost an after thought because that's basically all she was. He's getting pushed down, but really the Katie thing was going to happen regardless. I honestly don't like that the author labels the latter installments with who Harry is paired with because in Pansy's case for instance she only gets with him towards the end, but she's there like she's the main character, same with Katie.
