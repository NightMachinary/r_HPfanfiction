Eh. Canon shows us that houses are more or less irrelevant when it comes to choosing personalities. Hermione was studious despite not being a Ravenclaw. The Puffs were all affected by rumors of Harry being a Dark Wizard, and when they hear him speaking in Parseltongue, they make him out to be the villain immediately. Pettigrew was a coward, but when push came to shove, he showed more cunning than any Slytherin ever did. The two prodigies, Voldemort and Dumbledore, weren't from Ravenclaw. Slytherin accepted Half bloods into his house, despite 'Purity' being its motto.

TL;DR Houses matter very little, and anyone can have any personality regardless of House. I suppose in Daphne's case you can include some token, overdone conflict of being in enemy houses if the story takes place during Hogwarts years, but that's pretty much it.

(And what's the matter with being foreign anyway?)

EDIT: I suppose that's where perceptions come in. I find OCs (or quasi-OCs) in main roles to be generally annoying. If a canon character can do a similar job, use the canon character. I'm reading fanfiction after all, I want to see Harry Potter characters in them.
