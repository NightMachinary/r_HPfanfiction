linkffn(The Second String) deals with squib issues brilliantly. There's Fakesquib!harry though, but it's a time travel story, so he pretends to be a squib so that in case it's not an alternate dimension, he won't wind up in the middle of Hogwarts and the wizarding world possibly interfering with him and his friends being born. He's still magical, and still practices in secret, but the gambit leads to really interesting developments of how squibs are treated.
