It's more a background thing, but in my story "Patron", Daphne keeps trying to get into Harry's pants, even though all her friends (including Pansy, who is not quite certain if she should be included in that definition, despite Daphne feeling that way) tell her that she has no chance and she constantly fails. It's pretty low-key, though.
