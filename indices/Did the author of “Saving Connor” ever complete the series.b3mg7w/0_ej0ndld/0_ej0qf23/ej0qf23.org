I'm reading it there but for some reason it wasn't showing up as complete for me. Thanks for letting me know. Also, do you know if Harry or Draco dies permanently by the end of the series? MCD/non-happy endings are a trigger for me, and I just saw the author's note at the beginning of the second book that “no one is safe.” I'd like to know in advance if Draco or Harry dies, so I can avoid reading that scene.
