Alexandra Quick is definitely a series worth making audiobooks of, and all honour to you for doing it! :) I love audiobooks and listen to a lot of them.

I didn't have time to listen to it all, but from what I heard, I think I can say this: Your reading of the dialogue is GREAT. The characters sound distinct and the way you read their lines is engaging and emotional. I have no complaints about this, you totally nail it.

When it comes to the NARRATION, though... that's where I have a problem. The narration isn't very engaging to listen to because you don't really insert any emotion or variation in it. No matter what the tone of the scene is supposed to be, you tend to read it in the same "trailer voiceover" style, with very little variation in tone and inflection between sentences.

The way the narration is read is really important in an audiobook; it can give new life to the text, or it can just make the story fall flat. I don't know if you've heard the Harry Potter audiobooks, but they are a very good example:

Personally I find the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone REALLY boring. When I read it in the book, or when I listened to Jim Dale's reading of it, it was just a really dull chapter and I wanted the story to GET A MOVE ON already.

However, last year I listened to Stephen Fry's version of the audiobook, and something interesting happened: When Stephen Fry read that first chapter, he managed only through tone of voice to make it interesting and engaging. He narrated the events and descriptions in such a confidential, almost gleeful tone... and instead of just reading about boring events I had more the feeling that Stephen Fry was coming up to me and saying conspiratorically: "Listen, I just have to tell you about these AWFUL people! You won't BELIEVE how awful they are!" He sounded like he had so much fun telling me the story, that I ended up having fun listening to it.

That alone taught me something about audiobook narration. The narrator has to insert as much emotion into the narration, as into the dialogue.
