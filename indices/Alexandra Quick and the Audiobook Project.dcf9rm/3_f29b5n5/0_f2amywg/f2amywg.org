This is phenomenal feedback, thank you very much! Having listened to the Jim Dale books several times through, I've actually just recently started listening to the Stephen Fry ones for the first time, and I know just what you mean. What you speak of here is something I've been trying to work on throughout Thorn Circle, and I'm hoping to improve on as I begin Lands Below. I'm also a part-time radio DJ, and shaking my on-air delivery style isn't easy to do. Honestly, that's one of the reasons I started this project. Thank you so much for taking the time, I'll redouble my efforts with this going forward!
