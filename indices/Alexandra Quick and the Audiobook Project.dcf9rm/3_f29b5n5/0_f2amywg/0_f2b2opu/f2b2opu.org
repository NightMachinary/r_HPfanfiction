It's interesting, actually, because while so far I think I prefer Dale's myriad character voices to Fry's approximations, Fry's narrator is the best character in his reads, and he certainly outstrips Dale in that regard. In truth, the main challenge I focused on while reading Thorn Circle was to make sure every character sounded distinct. I've done two major audio projects before. The first, a video game where I did every voice, had 20 characters in it. The second, another young adult fantasy audiobook, had 10. Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle has around 45. So I threw myself into that, made lists and workshopped important characters, blew up Inverarity's inbox with questions (which he was a great sport about), even re-recorded some characters entirely during the edit when I worked out new voices for them. And for all that, while I was honing the narrator voice, I did, to an extent, forget that the narrator is a character.

Definitely a lot to work on for Lands Below.
