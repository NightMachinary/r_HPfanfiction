Definitely agree that Jim Dale, on the whole, does better character voices... and it's not like his narration is BAD. It's just that narration-wise, Stephen Fry does a so much better job, and a book usually has more narration than dialogue.

Another Stephen who does a great job with audiobook narration is Stephen Briggs, who reads a great number of the Discworld books. Not only does he have an impressive array of character voices, but his narration is also really good... it really brings out the wry humour, as well as the occasional dark tragedy, of the writing. Before Stephen Briggs took over the audiobooks, they were mainly narrated by Nigel Plainer, who isn't bad either... and two of them were narrated by Celia Imrie, who was a very interesting choice.

See, Celia Imrie narrates the audiobooks in a very sweet "read to children" kind of way... and this REALLY worked for the book Equal Rites, because the main protagonist, Eskarina, is an eight year old girl, and she thinks and acts like an eight year old girl. In fact, she's so realistic as an eight year old girl that she's not always that likeable; she's not EVIL but like a child she's often thoughtless, petty, self-centered and unthinkingly cruel... but in the audiobook, she became adorable because Celia's reading and voice for her was so endearingly innocent.

The other book Celia Imrie narrated was Wyrd Sisters, where the protagonists are notably older, and the perspective and writing more worldly and sophisticated. It is a better book than Equal Rites overall, but as an audiobook it's much worse... because all of a sudden, Celia's sweet-natured reading just RUINED the book; what had worked so well for the previous book now suddenly just seemed syrupy and vaguely patronizing.

So you're right; the narrator also has to be a character. And pretty much more than any other character in a story, the character of the narrator can make or break the whole thing.
