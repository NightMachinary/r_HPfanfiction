Will you do compilation files of each book together (or in parts if it's too big for that) to easily download once it's finished? I'd rather not save a ton of individual chapter files.

This is one of those series I've meant to get into but never got around to yet, so I'm looking forward to it being completed. I do a lot more audiobook listening than reading these days.
