Thanks for this, I hadn't thought about it and I'm glad you brought it up. I certainly can and will do that once books are finished. You'll be able to find this in whatever form I do it in on the podcast wordpress blog I linked to above.

Are you asking for a .rar file or whatever of the chapter files, or a massive gigafile of an entire book? I don't see why I couldn't do either or both, but I'm curious as to which you mean.
