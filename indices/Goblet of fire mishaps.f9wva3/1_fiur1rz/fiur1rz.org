The goblet burned steadily as the three schools wrapped up their dinner. For a short time immediately following dessert there had been a hush over the crowd, but people were quietly chatting again. They still glanced over at the goblet and at the staff table ever few seconds, but nothing seemed to be happening, so they would keep waiting.

After several more minutes of waiting, Dumbledore stood and walked over to the goblet and gave it a few exploratory taps with his wand. The chatting stopped as they watched him fiddle with the cup. His face grew concerned and he cast something that sent a cold glow across the great hall. The glow collected and sank into the goblet before Dumbledore gave it a few more taps. He straightened and collected his features then said, "Ah, yes. It seems we were a bit premature. The Triwizard Tournament will not be conducted this year. The goblet has postponed it for two years." Then he excused himself and the diners, directing them back to their regular schedules and apologizing to Beauxbaton and Durmstrang.

Harry Potter had a perfectly normal year 4 at Hogwarts.
