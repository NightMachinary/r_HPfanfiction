There are zillion of these. Just randomly linkffn(13182437), which contains my beloved dialogue (after Ron storms off for Hermione not making him champion when she admitted of putting Peter Pettigrew and Tom Riddle through it):

  'Ron,' Hermione said in an uncomprehending voice, 'you do realize that I deliberately entered Wormtail and Riddle in the hopes it would turn out to be a deathtrap, and whoever entered Harry was undoubtedly thinking the same thing?'

  'What the bloody Hell does that matter?' Ron demanded. 'Why did you go to all that trouble for that pair of Dark wizards, but not me? And you really expect me to believe you entered the two of them and someone else just so happened to enter Harry - the one of us you like better? That would be a bloody great coincidence, wouldn't it?!'

  After a confusing but heated argument, Ron stormed off. The two of them stared after him, then turned to each other.

  Hermione was the first to speak. 'I'll tell you mine if you tell me yours,' she said to Harry. 'Ravenclaw.'

  After a moment, he understood. 'Slytherin.'

  Silent understanding passed between them as they held eye contact. 'I don't understand Gryffindors,' Harry said eventually.

  'Neither do I.'
