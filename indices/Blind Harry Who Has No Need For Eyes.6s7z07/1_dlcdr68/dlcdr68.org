As far as I know there is only 1 blind Harry story that is remotely good and recommended consistently and thats Blindness which someone recommended already.

This is a list I stumbled across a while back that has "Handicapped Harry" stories on FF.net

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Handicapped-Harry/32134/]]

Its got a few blind ones but no idea how good they are.
