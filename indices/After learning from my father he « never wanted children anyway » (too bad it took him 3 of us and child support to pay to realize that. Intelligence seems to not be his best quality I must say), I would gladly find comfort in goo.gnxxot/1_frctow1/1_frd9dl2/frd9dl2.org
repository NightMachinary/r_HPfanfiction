Ah yes, my favorite FanFiction ever. I so hope it could be finished one day. I go back to read it from time to time, maybe I could seek it out. Although, personally, I tend to read it when I need a “push” in being studious. I'm not sure it could quite correctly satisfy my need for bashing. Thanks anyway, it's always sweet to know other people do see what I see in this fic.
