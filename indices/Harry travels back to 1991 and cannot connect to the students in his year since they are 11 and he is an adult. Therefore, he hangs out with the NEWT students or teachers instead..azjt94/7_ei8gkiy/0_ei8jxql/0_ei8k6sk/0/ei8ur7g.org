They may not see him as a *peer* per se, at least not at first, but in my personal experience, /friendship/ at the very least /is/ possible. Granted, in my experience (from both the younger and the older position) there were definite maturity differences (because none of us are actually time travelers) and yet there was still friendship and respect. It would take time, but with Harry's increased maturity, I believe he could eventually be accepted as a peer by NEWT students (I especially see the Revenclaws and Hufflepuffs accepting him).
