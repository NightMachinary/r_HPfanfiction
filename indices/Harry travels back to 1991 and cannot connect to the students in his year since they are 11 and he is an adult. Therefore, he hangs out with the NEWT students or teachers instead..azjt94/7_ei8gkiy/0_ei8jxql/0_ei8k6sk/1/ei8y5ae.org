Eh. I dunno'.

Have Harry tear it up on the quidditch pitch. Show him being confident and witty among a crowd of the older students. Have him get into a fight with a bigoted 7th year Slytherin and kick his ass to the hospital wing.

Do that, and I'm pretty sure there are a certain type of people who would be happy to hang out with this ridiculous kid. The Boy-Who-Lived, no less.
