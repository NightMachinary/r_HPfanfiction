  Interesting idea. I can imagine him being in a dilemma where he tries to hang out with his former friends, only to realise they're different now than his older self expects them to be (maybe thinking they share a stronger bond when he's just meeting them)

How about just the fact that, surprise surprise, they're little children. There's a reason you don't typically see 17+ year olds hanging out with a bunch of 11 year old kids.

I just want to see Harry go to hang out with them and within an hour he realizes that, holy shit, there's no way he can do this.
