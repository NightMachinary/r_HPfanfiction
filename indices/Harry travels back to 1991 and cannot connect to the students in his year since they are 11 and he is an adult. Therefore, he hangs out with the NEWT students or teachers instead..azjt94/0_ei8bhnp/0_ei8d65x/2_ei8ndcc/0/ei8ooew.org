She is born in 73, which can mean December as well. Which would put her into the year which graduates in PS. And I know that the date of birth is calculated based on the duration of the Auror training, but that assumes that there is no probation where you are already an Auror but still in training and that she did not take a gap year or tried her luck in another field first.

Also, we are already considering time/dimensional travel. Would shifting her birthday by a few weeks really be such an unbearable change?
