It was Lupin for leaving Tonks. Since most wedding vows involve some form of "be together, in good and in bad times", he broke those vows three months into the marriage. I think that was a case of "you fuckhead are making her a single mother! Fix it."

It says a lot about their marriage if it takes a 17-year old who has not even gotten to second base to save it. Something which Harry would realise a few years down the road.
