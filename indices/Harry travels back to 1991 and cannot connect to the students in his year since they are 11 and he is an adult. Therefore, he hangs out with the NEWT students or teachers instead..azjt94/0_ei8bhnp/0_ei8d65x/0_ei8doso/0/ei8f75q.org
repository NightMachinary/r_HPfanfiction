  do you think he would resent her for leaving the child and fight or not?

No. If the battle is lost, her and Teddy are doomed to be executed or deported to Azkaban (which is not that different). Fighting was a horrible choice, but it was the best out of many horrible decisions she could have made if you disregard simply leaving (since that would be the obvious thing to do for the entire Order if they are unwilling to fight for real). He might, however, resent her for taking Lupin back or marrying him in the first place since Lupin has a lot of issues, but that is a different debate.
