Shipping the people around you based on an alternate dimension/timeline is a really psycho thing to do. And let me elaborate why "they were the parents of X" would not work if you want to ensure X exists.

Basically, you would have to ensure that the same sperm and egg get together. Even if you exclude the randomness of cell division, the guy would have to come the exact same number of times he did in the original timeline to deliver the same sperm cell at the right time into the right egg. They would also have to fuck exactly the same way to ensure the right swimmer makes it. You see why this is getting very close to statistically impossible, right? And even if you get that part right, unless the child grows up exactly as it did in the OG universe, it will not be the same. Which would mean doing everything as it happened before, rendering the whole time-travel moot.

You could, of course, settle for a similar child, but that's not what the average time traveller does.
