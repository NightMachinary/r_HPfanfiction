  actually, I always feel weird about time travelers getting together with their loved person

Oh boy, grooming is its own can of worms. Let's just say that it would be nearly impossible to not do it on an subconscious level while regularly interacting with them. The only way you can pull that off without being creepy would be to have the love interest older, but that also makes it weird since now they are the ones attracted to a child. And given the overall premise of the HP series, most time travel falls within the Hogwarts years, so adult travellers aren't really a good solution either.
