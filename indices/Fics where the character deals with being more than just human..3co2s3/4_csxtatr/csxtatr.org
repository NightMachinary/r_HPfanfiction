Yay! Another chance to recommend one of my favorite fics. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by the Mad Mad Reviewer has Harry growing more powerful, but with the side effect of him becoming part demon. Highly recommend this fic. It's not the primary point of the fic, but it does change him in interesting ways and is, I feel, very well written.
