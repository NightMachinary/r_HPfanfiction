I've read a snamione fic that did that (with a werewolf bite), but I really, really didn't like it. I admit, the concept sounds appealing, I just had a lot of issues with this particular story.

linkffn(love bites by takumaangel), in case you're interested anyway.

edit: Here botty botty botty, here bot!

edit2: just in case the bot decides to show up sometime, here's one I found just now, haven't read it yet, but seems relevant to your request: linkffn(on crimson wings)
