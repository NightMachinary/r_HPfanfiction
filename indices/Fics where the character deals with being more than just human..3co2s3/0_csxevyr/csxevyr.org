I know that whitetigerwolf has a challenge called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/topic/83467/48607037/1/Half-Breed-Challenge-Harry-Potter][The Half-Breed Challenge]], I'm not sure if it is quite what you're looking for but the basic gist of is that Harry Potter meets a part-human creature (like a centaur or a naga for example) and they become friends (possibly more). There are a few other requirements too.

Have a look around to see if there are any entries.
