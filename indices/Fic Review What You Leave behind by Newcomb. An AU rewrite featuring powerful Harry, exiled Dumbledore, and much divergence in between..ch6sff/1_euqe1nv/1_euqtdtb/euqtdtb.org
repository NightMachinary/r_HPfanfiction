  Personally I enjoy hyper-competent characters as I feel the pursuit of the inverse is ultimately realism for realism's own sake. Why should realism be what we strive for? Why place it on some pedestal were we value it above everything else.

This sums up how I feel perfectly. I love powerful!Harry fics (or anything character), but what I would say is that sometimes I don't need the build up to believe and enjoy. I've read so many /Harry gets X and becomes powerful/ I find it quite freshing when we dive into the end of his development and get on with the fic.
