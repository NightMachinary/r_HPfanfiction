I re-read WYLB today due to this review and there's a section where Cedric's character resonates so strongly with canon Ron that I was unhappy we never got to hear him say it.

To be specific, Cedric is talking to Cho about how he's succeeding at everything he ever wanted before he came to Hogwarts (Quidditch captain, popular, etc), but nonetheless getting thrown into the sidekick role just because Harry's problems are so much bigger than your normal school kid's issues. Ron has this same exact trajectory, except that he's sidekicked years before he gets what he wants (Prefect, Quidditch star, popular, etc). I just imagine canon Ron having this realization somewhere in the middle of 5th or 6th year and silently strangling that part of himself as he dives back into dealing with Harry's issues and it's so goddamn sad.
