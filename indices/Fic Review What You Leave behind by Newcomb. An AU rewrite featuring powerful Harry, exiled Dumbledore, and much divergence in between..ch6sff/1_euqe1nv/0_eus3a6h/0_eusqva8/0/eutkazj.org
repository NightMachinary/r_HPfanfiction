Perhaps making Ron a prefect was Minerva's way of getting back at Albus for interfering. Or she was hoping to use the Weasley family dynamic to her advantage.

I understand the choice to give Ronald something that Harry wanted on a metatextual level but you are right. It does seem odd that Dean was not the second choice.
