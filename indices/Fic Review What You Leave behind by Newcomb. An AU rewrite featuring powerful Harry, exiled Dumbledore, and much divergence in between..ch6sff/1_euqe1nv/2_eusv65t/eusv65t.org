Firstly, thank you for your comment. It gave me pause, and I've been trying to break down my opinions on powerful characters before I responded to you. Honestly the hardest part is keeping it concise, because there's probably an essay to be had on this.

Realism vs hyper-competency. I don't think one necessarily vetos the other, and you can have stories which heavily feature one or both of them. Lord of the Rings features many larger than life, hyper-competent characters, and it's a well-loved story. But you don't read Lord of the Rings for the characterisation - you read it for the plot, the epic battles, beautiful exposition, etc. It's a story about legendary people, not real ones.

The whole superhero genre these days I feel tries to strike a balance between the epic feeling of Lord of the Rings and the realism which makes the characters relatable (with varying levels of success).

Harry Potter canon leans more on the side of realism - we follow the story of an ordinary boy who becomes something extraordinary, but ultimately and always is still very human.

As readers, realism isn't something we're going to strive for, but if we're going to relate, then a certain level of realism has to be there or we won't live vicariously through those characters. That's why for writers, especially in the Harry Potter fandom, any story which wants to take an audience on a journey through Harry's eyes does need to strive for enough realism to hook its readers in. Harry doesn't always have to be the underdog, but he should still be human. I do actually like to see characters level up, increase their potential, become something great and stomp out the bad guys, I just want to be able to cheer for them whilst they do.

Your comments around Oliver Wood and Ron Weasley are spot on about this (and I would have loved to have seen better development of Ron's strategic skills in the books too). Fleur Delacour as well - she is the most beautiful girl in the Harry Potter series, and extremely competent with a want to boot - but she is disliked by many canon characters for her arrogance and disdain.

Something that made me really curious whilst I was reading this fic is - why does this trope always apply to Harry? Why not have epics like this written about Tom Riddle or Dumbledore or Grindelwald, who canonically already are these hyper-competent wizards who did go through a complicated reasoning of how to apply morality to society and had a huge influence in their day? I'm surprised there aren't more stories about Dumbledore going dark and taking over Europe with Grindelwald.
