Concise, reasoned reviews really help me think about my own work.

Personally I enjoy hyper-competent characters as I feel the pursuit of the inverse is ultimately realism for realism's own sake. Why should realism be what we strive for? Why place it on some pedestal were we value it above everything else.

Perhaps Oliver Wood provides a happy medium; a character who is very good/excellent/passionate about Quidditch and the tactics there in, but probably isn't a very good captain because he can't read the room like he can the field. The narrative places him where he is both competent and incompetent.

Another example is Book 1 Ron. Here we have a character who is clearly childish, in his naivety, his jealousies and his work ethic, yet at the same time proves to be knowledgeable about obscure historical facts, is the only one to keep his head during the devils snare and is willing to make the sacrifice play without any chosen-one shenanigans.

Sadly we loose this Ron all too soon. I think I need to try and work this same balance into my own work. Otherwise you end up with Movie Hermione-sue or Death Eater Ron.
