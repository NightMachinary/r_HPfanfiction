To be fair, the scene wasn't written in a way that excused the Ministry's actions, it just didn't pay due respect at the time to how horrifying it was. The author may well have intended to revisit what happened there. Since it wasn't a completed story, I'm not willing to level any accusations at the author for sweeping that sort of thing under the rug, so don't let it be a deciding factor for whether or not you read it.
