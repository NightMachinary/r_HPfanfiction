  To begin with Fleur on a broom felt very jarring and out of character to me, but there's no real canon reason for me to have assumed this

It probably comes from GoF, and how the other Triwizard contestants were all established on-screen to be good to excellent Quidditch players, before the Goblet picked their names. Harry, the youngest seeker in a century, Cedric who beat Harry in the Dementor match, and Krum who appeared in the World Cup final. And then Fleur... whose only talent we were told about was her veela magic in attracting guys and singing to a dragon.

In actuality, Fleur polyjuices as Harry in the Flight of the Seven Potters, which indicates that she's good on a broom. However, we never see this established /on-screen/ like Cedric or Viktor's flying skills are, and information we're told, rather than shown - or meant to infer - never makes as much of a lasting impact.

Overall, a thorough review. I like the way you pointed out the pros and cons of pro-active Harry, and hit on the exact issue I have with this type of characterization - pro-active, precocious child protagonists rarely feel like genuine children. And the appeal of the HP universe to me has always been one that grows and matures with the protagonists. There's not much room to grow when your MC starts out already grown.

If you're looking for fics to review, how do you feel like doing one of Starfox's fics? They're the most recc'd author in this sub, based on how often I see (the same couple of) people post them. I'd like to see what you make of them, since they're somewhat divisive, but generally agreed to be competently written.
