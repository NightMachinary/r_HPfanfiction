"Marriage Law Revolution" and "Divided and Entwined" are both complete and commonly recc'd in this sub.

People like this author's fics because it focuses on hypercompetent MCs, "logical" worldbuilding, action setpieces and cool duels, and righting the wrongs of canon, AKA "X-Treme karmic justice delivery", where good triumphs and villains get their punishment, extreme prejudice style. It appeals to many posters here who think hated the way Snape was treated like hero post-mortem, and the Malfoys scraped off with minimal punishment after the war.

However, these fics also have a prominent minority who don't like them because the "karmic corrections" ruin the magic of the original HP universe, by introducing elements of Mugglewankery and modern 21st Century sensibilities to a society where they don't necessarily make sense. If you've seen people pull out the Geneva Convention rulings on war crimes in debates in this sub, you'll know what I mean by that.

The author is also pretty liberal with their characterizations, resulting in Hermione being a same-y iteration of Super!Hermione in every fic they write. It makes Hermione more enjoyable to readers who hated her naggy pedantry in canon, but other readers hate it because Super!Hermione can do everything on her own, when the whole point of the books was the Trio working together to get stuff done.

TLDR - Loved by some, hated by others, with reasonable justifications on both sides.
