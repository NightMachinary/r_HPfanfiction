  I had a look through the list - quite a few look really interesting. Petunia Evans - Tomb Raider is a super original idea which I might do later.

  I ended up deciding to go with the Marriage Law Revolution, as a nice medium between popularity of the fic and overall length, since a quick glance at Divided and Entwined shows it to be a monster all on its own. I have to say I'm impressed at how prolific they are. One question though - does it require a background knowledge of marriage law fics? Because I haven't read any other fics featuring that.

  Thank you for the rec! That's on my reading list now.
