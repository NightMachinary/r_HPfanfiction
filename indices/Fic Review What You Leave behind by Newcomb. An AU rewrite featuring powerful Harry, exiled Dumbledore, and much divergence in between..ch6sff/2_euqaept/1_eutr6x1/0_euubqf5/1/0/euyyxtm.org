  does it require a background knowledge of marriage law fics?
#+end_quote

You just need to know the basic tropes of marriage law fics. IE, after the war, the population of wizards is running low, so the Ministry sets up a breeding program to match couples together based on how likely they are to produce viable magical offspring. Most fics are based some version of this, sometimes with a MegaDragonPox disease to lower the population further, sometimes with a harem aspect so Harry can legally have 5 young and fertile wives.

The story does explain what's going on with the premise, but it takes on the subtext of being a conscious satire of fandom tropes if you /do/ know the background. However, fandom knowledge isn't necessary to read and understand the fic.
