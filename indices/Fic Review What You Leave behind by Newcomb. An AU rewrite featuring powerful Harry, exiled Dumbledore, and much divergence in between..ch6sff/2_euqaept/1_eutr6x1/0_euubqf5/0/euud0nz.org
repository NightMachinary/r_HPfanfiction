  righting the wrongs of canon, AKA "X-Treme karmic justice delivery",
#+end_quote

Kinda hard to do that in an AU. Which is actually one of my problems with these fics: they take place in an AU in which many elements of canon are distorted, exaggerated, etc but at the same time the meta narrative of the fics is one of "correcting" canon.

You can't have it both ways, however. If you've changed the world in which your characters operate, their actions can no longer function as commentary on canon.
