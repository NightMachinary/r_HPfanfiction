I wasn't going to get into that, because OP was only going to (possibly) read and review one SF5 fic, not the whole catalogue, and reading the catalogue is where things become apparent that all the fics take place in a very strange shared universe off-shoot AU of canon.

All I can say about the worldbuilding is that the author seems to have prioritized karma and catharsis over other story concerns, like consistency in their critique of canon. How much that matters to the reader's enjoyment is up to the individual reader, and I didn't want to bias the OP's potential rating if they decided to write a review of one of the fics. Inconsistency is not uncommon for the "Fix it Fic" genre, and people still enjoy them regardless - like HPMOR having a Rational!Harry, Smart!Hermione, and Smart!Draco, but McGonagall is left as her regular canon self so Harry can dunk on her.
