This was a great review! Really in-depth and thoughtful. :)

I actually just recently tried to read this fic! I loved the premise and found it exceptionally interesting but I couldn't make it past the kids meeting on the Hogwarts Express, the personalities felt too stilted and the way the children were speaking took me out of it too much. That's just me though, I work with children that age so when an author doesn't capture their voice very well or age appropriately for more experience, I struggle with it.
