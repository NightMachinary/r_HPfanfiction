Really enjoyed the review. One comment that I have is that while I agree with you about the kids not acting their age, I'm not sure if I would prefer if they actually were. I think I would miss the snappy dialogue and character interaction too much.

I would like to nominate linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ« by enembee) it starts as Harry Potter version of Hatchet before taking quite the turn halfway through. It's both compete and we'll written, I believe enembee was working on the sequel on the DLP WBA though I not sure if he still is.
