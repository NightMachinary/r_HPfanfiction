I am monitoring with great interest.

The only grimdark fic i know which is worth the read is Forever Knight and it was on portkey - dont know if its still alive.

For the endless amount of H/Hr fics, finding a Dark hermione fic or dark harry and hermione fic, is pretty much digging in mud for diamonds.

if anyone has a list - please post. Even if its 1-2 stories
