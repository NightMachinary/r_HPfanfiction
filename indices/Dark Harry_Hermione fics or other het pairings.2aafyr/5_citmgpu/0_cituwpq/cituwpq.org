Amen to that. I wouldn't mind any other dark Harry fics either. I just love the dark side haha. I read Curse of Fate, the Riddle Answered, Harry Potter and the Descent into darkness. They were all true dark Harry fics. If you haven't read them, they are recommended. If you have do you know any like them?
