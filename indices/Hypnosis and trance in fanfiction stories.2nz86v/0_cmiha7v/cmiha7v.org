[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem with Purity]] has a bit of this, as an aid to help people attain Animagus forms. It's a 62-chapter epic of over 600,000 words, so you may want to pick and choose chapters by title if you only want to read the parts about hypnosis/trances.
