Maybe you should do some introspective and realize that not everyone cares this much about how someone capitalizes their post.

60% of your comments are the equivalent of a review that's just a list of minor typos, except you somehow put an implicit sense of "do better next time, idiot" into the formulation of your comments. Looks like that writing ability is useful for more than stories extremely slowly!
