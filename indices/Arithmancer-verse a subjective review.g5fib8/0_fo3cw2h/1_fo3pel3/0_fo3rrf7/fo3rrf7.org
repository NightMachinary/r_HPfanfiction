However, this does not mean that you are entitled to dictate the way people respond to your writing. If you deliberately choose to communicate in an obtuse way, expect people to think you are obtuse. If you want people to engage with the content of your writing, my suggestion would be to communicate in a way that is friendly to your reader.
