Oh, I'm so very sorry, dear random person on Reddit. Were you offended by the lack of capital letters? Did the lowercase letters bother you? Did it hurt your feelings? Does it make you upset that complete strangers on the Internet choose to /(gasp)/ type in ways that you don't prefer to type in?

Well! Gosh, I'm sorry. I hope that going forward, I'll be able to meet the standards of complete strangers online who have nothing to say about the actual content I type out. My sincerest goddamn apologies!

Look, I like your writing, assuming you're the person who writes the Victoria Potter series. However, and here seems to be the source of your confusion, we are on Reddit right now! The social rules generally lean towards letting people use whatever vernacular and form of typing they want! Isn't that amazing?
