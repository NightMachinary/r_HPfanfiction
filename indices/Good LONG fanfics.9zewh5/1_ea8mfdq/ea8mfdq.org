You might like Kurinoone's /Dark Prince Trilogy./ It's certainly not the best HP story ever written, but I liked it, it's long, and it's completed. Link goes to first in the trilogy. linkffn(2913149).

I haven't actually read it, but I've seen the /Sacrifices/ series recommended regularly. I know it's another long series (though I'm not sure if it's complete) and it's a WBWL. Link goes to the first story. linkffn(2580283).
