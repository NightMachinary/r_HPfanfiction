I forget the title, but starfox wrote one about Fudge cooperating with Voldemort to oppress Muggleborns, instead of going to war, but Hermione sees it coming and the Muggleborns get organised. I think that one is over 600k, it's so long I didn't finish.

Incidentally, they're not nearly so long, but there are a bunch of HPMoR continuations (like Significant Digits) or AUs (like Following the Phoenix or Minds, Names, and Faces), since you liked that.

Edit: Oh, wait, someone mentioned it already, it was Divided and Entwined.
