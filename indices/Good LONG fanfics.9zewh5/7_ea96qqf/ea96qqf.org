Harry Potter and the Fifth Element is an incredible read up until the very last chapter or two [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2apwf6/harry_potter_and_the_fifth_element]]

Trouble in Paradise, and the sequel Paradise Lost were both really well done. But a bit tough to find now.

Barb's psychic serpent trilogy is 1 million plus and from what I've read, is one of the more popular stories ever. [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/]]
