I love linkffn(A Difference in the Family) it's like 700k and goes through all of Snape's life. The longest I've read has got to be linkao3(A Year Like None Other) in which Snape adopts Harry in OOTP, and later Draco. I think it's very OOC but also very well written. Its three parts and totals almost 1.5m words which is significantly longer than the actual HP series itself.

Someone else mentioned Dangerverse which is also very long but (imo) very weird, I read it when I was 14 and it finished when I was 20 so at that point I sunk too much of my adolescence not to see it through but I caution others that it's definitely not for everyone. Also well over a million words though so fits the bill.
