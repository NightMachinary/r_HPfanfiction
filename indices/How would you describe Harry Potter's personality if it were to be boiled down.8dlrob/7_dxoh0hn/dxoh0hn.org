His upbringing has very little effect on his canon personality. Anyone who went through the hell that is called Number Four Privet Drive would be seriously fucked up. He does not show the typical signs of someone suffering from childhood abuse or even the signs of a "functional" victim. Perhaps the biggest influence can be seen with Harry's opinion of Dumbledore. The man was an utterly incompetent leader, who basically lost the war and then proceeded to fuck things up again and again. Yet Harry (with the exception of OotP) thinks that the sun is shining out of Dumbledore's arse. He doesn't even question whether it would be possible to remove the Horcrux without taking a killing curse for the team. A Harry with a different upbringing (unless it's by hardcore Dumbledore supporters like the Weasleys) would not stand for that shit.
