What I mean is that the abuse Harry suffered only manifests itself in the blind trust towards Dumbledore (but not other figures of authority). While realistically, someone with Harry's potential but who lived at the Dursleys would probably make Voldemort look like a schoolyard bully or become a vigilante who would have killed both Malfoys by the end of PoA. Besides the Dumbledore thing, Harry does not seem overly affected by the Dursleys (maybe the tolerance for Mrs Weasley's behaviour, but that is debatable).
