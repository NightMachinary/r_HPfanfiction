Aren't you kinda contradict yourself here?

  His upbringing has very little effect on his canon personality.

  A Harry with a different upbringing (unless it's by hardcore Dumbledore supporters like the Weasleys) would not stand for that shit.
#+end_quote

And i think reason why Harry went along with all the shit that got piled up on him is precisely because he was raised in a horrible environment of â„–4 Privet Drive.\\
I mean, who in their right mind would be okay with his own fucking parents encouraging them to go and commit suicide on the words\memory of a man, who had proven time and time again(at least from Harry POV) that he can't be trusted? If that's not a sign of something deeply fucked up, then i don't know what is.

Or after hearing bullshit like that:

  Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. *You had suffered*. *I knew you would* when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. *I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years*.
#+end_quote

still be in any sort of cordial relationship with a person who knowingly left you, a child, an infant(!), to suffer. Like wtf? What normal, sane, well adjusted person does this?
