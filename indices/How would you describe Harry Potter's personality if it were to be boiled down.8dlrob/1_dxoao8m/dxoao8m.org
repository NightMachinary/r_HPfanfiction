Harry's scrappy in the 'fighting spirit' kind of way.

That is one of the most essential parts of the character and what a lot of fics diminish in some way. He's determined. He's a fighter. He's smart enough to know his odds but is going to push back anyway. He's got an attitude that could make you want to strangle him. That's the kind of thing that the Dursleys would want to stomp out of him but they never could. It's why the little voice in his head argues so ferociously against the Imperius. It's how he could stand up against Voldemort in the graveyard by deciding that he was going to die on his feet. It's why he just starts mouthing off to the death eaters to buy time in OoTP, It's how he could choose to come back to life in DH despite knowing he'd be returning to pain and fear. I think that's a natural part of Harry and the main part that changes is where he's directing this aggression and attitude.

One thing I'd suggest is not to confuse the ability to fight with having a fighting spirit. Harry could be incredibly OP and still be lackluster. Alternatively, he could be written incredibly smug and arrogant so that 'scrappy' just mutates into 'raging brat'. I guess it's a fine line no matter what.
