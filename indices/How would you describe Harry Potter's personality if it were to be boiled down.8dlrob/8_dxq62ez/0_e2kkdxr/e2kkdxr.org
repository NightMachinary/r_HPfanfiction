So much of what Harry deals with could have been dealt with easily if he didn't have an enormous ego. He wants to be the one to 'earn' he fame. People say that he blindly trusted Dumbledore; he really didn't. Harry only ever went to him when he snapped. That's not trust. Dumbledore gave Harry every opportunity to succeed and thrive if only he set his ego aside. How many more lessons in his 6th year would he have just attempted to actually get the memory. How much could he have done if he actually put forth the effort in any of his classes? Teachers love students who put forth the effort to master the material rather than regurgitate information *cough*Hermione*cough*. Honestly when I was reading canon and in OotP he started yelling at Dumbledore, I kinda hoped Dumbledore would have simply asked him why Harry had done nothing for himself. At every opportunity Harry took the easiest path, until Voldemort shows up and he gets Mithril grade plot armour.

To summarize Harry is:

Lazy

Self absored

Short sighted\\
Gifted in the Dark Arts

Very dependant on others to live day-to-day

Not a deep thinker

Playful

Easily manipulated

Negligent

In short, I wouldn't trust him to rescue a kitten wrapped in bubble wrap. Unless Hermione was there giving him step-by-step guidance.
