On the 'Normal' thing I have always viewed it as Harry always saw the Dursleys as the freaks in that house and thus his vision of normal is Arthur Weasley. A honest hardworking kind man who would give you the shirt off his back, that's what Harry sees as normal, and strives to be much like Arthur, at least in the ways that matter
