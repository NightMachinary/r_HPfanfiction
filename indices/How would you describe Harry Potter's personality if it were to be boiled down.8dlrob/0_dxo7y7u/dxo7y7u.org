The fundamental core of his personality is that he always tries to do the right thing. He just struggles sometimes to work out what that is. He's a bit stubborn and he used to be extremely curious in the first book but that faded a tad as he got older. He still liked to know what was going on, he just didn't ask as many questions.

Outside of trying to do the right thing he changes a lot. He grows up. We first see him at 11 unaware of his fame. A couple of months before he turns 18 he's a national hero twice over. A triwizard champion who has seen people he knows killed in front of him. If he didn't grow and change over time then it would be odd. He's learning and changing as a person, we all change, we're shaped by the world around us. Harry is shaped by the expectation of others. He pushes against it rather than accept it. This might be because he wanted to be 'normal' which might have something to do with the Dursley's or it might have more to do with him being a truly modest person. What I'm getting at thought here is that you'd expect Harry to be different given different circumstances but any and all changes need to be justified.

The way I'd recommend tweaking Harry to change a story is that you stick with the doing the right thing but you change how he interprets 'the right thing'. If he was raised by people who were more supportive of him but were more pro-authority then often doing the right thing would mean going to the teachers and leaving it be. Dumbledore's right not easy thing really resonated with Harry but it doesn't help with knowing what the right thing is.
