Too stubborn to die, too stupid* to live.

*by stupid i am talking more about being "raised" as a lamb to the slaughter and never actually having a chance, not actually being unintelligent. Although argument can be made that he is actually stupid for not getting his act together after book 4. But i was't raised by horrible people, then "saved" by other group of horrible people to fight other group of more horrible people, so i can't really judge him that much.
