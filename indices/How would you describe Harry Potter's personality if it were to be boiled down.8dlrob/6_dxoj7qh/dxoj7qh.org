Well, canon Harry has the following special qualities:

Harry could cast Imperius Curse and resist it, both on his first attempt.

He also managed to cast Sectumsempra on his first attempt and Cruciatus on his second.

I would say he had quite a bit of talent for dark arts.

--------------

His will power was immense, as he was often put in extremely adverse situations and managed to come out ahead. He was basically immune to the Imperius Curse. In the Graveyard, he would have beaten Voldemort if Voldemort hadn't broken up the wand core connection.

His intuition was very good. It was generally Harry who put pieces together and solved mysteries throughout their years at Hogwarts. He identified Malfoy, he correctly predicted a Horcrux at Hogwarts, he realized another in Gringotts, and he correctly solved the riddle of Hallows and Elder Wand.

He was a good leader, someone who inspired loyalty through his actions. Neville and Luna were both serious outsiders, but under his leadership, grew into powerful forces of their own and yet remained fanatically loyal to him. By the end of the Series, he had built up a tremendous following, especially among Hogwarts students.

Finally, he was a fun guy when not under too much stress. I imagine that after the War, he would become significantly more sociable.
