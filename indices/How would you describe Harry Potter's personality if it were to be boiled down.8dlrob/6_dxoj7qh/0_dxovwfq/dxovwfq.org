  His intuition was very good. It was generally Harry who put pieces together and solved mysteries throughout their years at Hogwarts. He identified Malfoy, he correctly predicted a Horcrux at Hogwarts, he realized another in Gringotts, and he correctly solved the riddle of Hallows and Elder Wand.

While not arguing this point, i'd like to say that i think it is mostly due to him being the protagonist of this story.\\
And stereotypes being stereotypes. Because if Hermione is the "smart one" and Ron is the "dumb one", then Harry should be somewhere in-between, hence him getting "intuition" perk, instead of actually being smart.

  He was a good leader, someone who inspired loyalty through his actions. Neville and Luna were both serious outsiders, but under his leadership, grew into powerful forces of their own and yet remained fanatically loyal to him. By the end of the Series, he had built up a tremendous following, especially among Hogwarts students.

Never saw it myself. At least not to this extend. He does have his moments of awesome in regards to inspiring loyalty, but IMO it looks mostly undeserved. But i blame it primarily on J.K.R. being shit writer, tbf, and not on Harry being shit leader.
