Yeah I know it's AU but it lies mostly on the HP canon until this part of the story (Slughorn party in HBP) and some things may be intended as AU but it's presented in a way that I can only see canon errors. The one that made me quit was the error with the Fidelius (and I know it's not the only one, I don't remember all the others and this was the one too many for me).

As recall they mention the same Fidelius charm as in canon. Fidelius which can protect a secret (in this case a house) and only the secret keeper can give the secret except if he dies in which case anyone having the secret becomes secret keeper. In the fic Harry even asks if it's the same one as in Grimmauld Place which Tonks confirms. Tonks apparates Harry to the house and giving him the secret by just bringing him there (on the doorstep as in DH so no problem). But we later learn that the secret keeper is her mother (which isn't dead).

It's too bad because the story had potential in my opinion but I'm too nitpicky on things like this to enjoy the story.
