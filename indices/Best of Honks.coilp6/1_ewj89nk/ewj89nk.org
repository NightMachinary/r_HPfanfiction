!linkffn(Harry Potter and the Children of Change)

An (unfortunately abandoned) fic in which a seventy year old Harry is thrown into an alternate universe. This is probably the only good young Tonks fic out there. The pairing is technically Harry/Hermione/Tonks

!linkao3(Harry Potter and the Metamorphmagus)

Post-canon EWE fic. Tonks was never interested in Remus and is assigned as Harry's partner in the auror department.

!linkffn(To Date a Metamorph)

A newer fanfiction where Tonks is only interested in dating people her parents don't approve of. Her parents are aware of this and trick her into pursuing Harry.

!linkffn(Dawn of Darkness)

A highly canon divergent fic where Harry and Tonks find themselves in the middle of a conspiracy after Slughorn is murdered after his Christmas party. The plot is really unique and it has a good sense of mystery to it.

!linkffn(Teddy's Excellent Adventure)

A shorter and more lighthearted fic where Teddy Lupin goes back in time and tries to set up his mother with Harry, the only person he ever knew as a father. The author has also written a few other short Harry/Tonks fics, like !linkffn(The Dark Lady Tonks)

!linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black)

This fic is also abandoned, but it's also one of the only fem!Harry/Tonks fics

!linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool)

This is the other fem!Harry/Tonks fic. Harry has nothing to live for, so he goes back in time and ends up in the body of a female version of himself. Antics ensue as Harry tries to leave the magical world for good after killing Voldemort, only to be roped into taking the position of transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts.

!linkffn(Harry Potter and the Metamorph)

Harry leaves the country after Sirius dies, and lays low in the U.S. until he's of age. He winds up reconnecting with Tonks after he realises that he has repressed metamorphic abilities and needs a tutor to teach him how they work.
