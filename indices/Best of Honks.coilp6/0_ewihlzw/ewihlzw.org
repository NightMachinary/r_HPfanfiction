Ive had an idea for one for a while that Im honestly surprised hasnt been done before; post hogwarts battle remus dies but Tonks lives and the harry/ginny ship never quite rematerializes, Harry ends up taking his responsibility as Teddy's godfather seriously and helps Tonks with raising him(alternatively timeskip of Harry spending a year or two on a walkabout after book 7). Ultimately Harry and Tonks end up bonding and theirs lots of fluffy goodness.
