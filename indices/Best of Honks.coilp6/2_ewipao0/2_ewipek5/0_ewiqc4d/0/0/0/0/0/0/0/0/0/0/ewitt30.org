Okay yeah, are you just being mean now? You don't have to mock my xD usage. I use them to indicate that I'm havin a good time. Sorry if they annoy you so much you have to mock me with it though. I never even USE "lol" or whatever...

Guess I'll disable inbox replies and cut this convo short, if you're just starting in on me now. No use in it. I THOUGHT we were having a genuinely nice conversation here. At least, I was trying to.
