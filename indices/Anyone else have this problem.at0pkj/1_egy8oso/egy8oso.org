I've found that a lot of writers have a 'Pile of unfinished story beginnings' type fic, where they just post ideas or partial chapters they've had but couldn't complete themselves for others to borrow. Most just sit there, but there's always a chance someone would be inspired to pick it up. And I've enjoyed reading through these sort of idea-collection fics too, you get a wide range of an author's thoughts.
