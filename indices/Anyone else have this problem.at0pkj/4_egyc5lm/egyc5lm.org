Like some of the other commenters have said, I have dozens of fics that are just a snippet of a larger story I want to write some day. I use Scriviner for writing and have four folders. Published, in progress, thoughts, and abandoned. The fics shift between the folders (particularly thoughts and in progress) frequently.

I find it helpful to write out the part of the story I'm most interested in at the moment, even if it's not the beginning, and then come back. When I start to get overwhelmed I draft out the dialogue and come back later and fill in the rest.
