I think we all write the things we want to read but can't find, and we all have more ideas than we know what to do with. Don't expect anyone else to write your story for you or even to think your idea is particularly interesting. Ideas are worth nothing, it's the execution that counts.

Writing is hard work. If you want to see the finished product you have to put the work in. And the more you do it the easier it gets.
