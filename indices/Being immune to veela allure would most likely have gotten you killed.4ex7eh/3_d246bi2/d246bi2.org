Evolution doesn't work that way; Veela probably didn't evolve; they'd make a lot more enemies that way; every violent encounter involving a Veela is a chance for a Veela to die; and there's nothing to indicate that someone is that much more likely to try to attack Veela simply by being immune to their aura.

Canon strongly implies that the aura only affects males and possibly only heterosexual males (with fanon being clearer on the point), so you're talking about a war to exterminate humanity. If you make it so the aura affects almost all humans, there's a problem identifying who's immune -- are Veela the rulers of society, combing through their thralls?

Fix all that and you have...well, at that point, they'd barely be recognisable as Veela, but at least there would be a sensible story.
