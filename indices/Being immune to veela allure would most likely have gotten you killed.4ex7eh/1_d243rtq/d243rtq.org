Maybe it'd be an issue if the 'allure' was their sole power. But they are shown to have magic and use wands (Fleur uses one) just as well as a regular, boring wizard. EDIT: plus there is the whole bird/harpie transformation with fireballs that isn't well explained but is canon nonetheless (I thought it was fanon until recently).

You described 'allure' as a trope, so I'm guessing you're aware that the fanfictions generally do not line up completely with canon the issue.

All that being said, a fic where Harry gets hunted down by Veela would be great (as long as they really do try to hunt him down, and don't become his harem when he flares his big manly aura).
