Oddly specific request but maybe the firebird's son trilogy by Darth Marrs? Not remotely smut but a powerful matriarchal society that has wizards as rare and valuable resources that witches at hogwarts try to "poach" (i.e. bond them through sexual acts). Like I said, not smut but definitely multi- and where wizards are the oppressed minority. Very AU and pretty cool world building.
