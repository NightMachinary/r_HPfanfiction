The way that I see it (and use in my fic and probably most future fics) is that the wizarding community has a great reason to fear muggleborns because of their families, rather than them being wizards. Every muggleborn, simply by virtue of existing, is a potentially enormous breach of the Statute of Secrecy. Given that wizards have spent a minimum of hundreds of years in the past being persecuted by fanatical and violent muggles, this would couch the 'muggleborn problem' as one that has a factual fear at its root.

Canon instead chooses to use some silly conspiracy theory about how muggleborns are stealing magic. Yawn.

Look at the worst prejudices in the world right now - all of them expound on an external threat from an 'other' (whether it is jewish people, people with different color skin, gypsies, people practicing different religions, etc.).
