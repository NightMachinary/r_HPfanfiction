I read a fic once that explained it as muggle born witches and wizards corrupting the ministry. The Ministry, as I recall, isn't really meant to govern so much as it's supposed to keep the existence of magic a secret. They have laws, but they're there to codify the statute of secrecy and every department is supposed to do this. The ministry has obliviators to erase the memories of Muggles who catch wind of magic. It has a department of magical sports to organize events where Muggles can't see them. A department for the regulation of magical creature to keep Muggles from finding out about mermaids and centaurs and stuff. And it has Aurors to catch people who violate the laws.

You get the gist.

It basically paints this picture of the magical world as a community of magic practitioners, all of whom are independent, because if you're magical, you're pretty much self sufficient. You can build a home, run a farm and enchant whatever tools you need with magic. All you need is the skill and knowledge to do it. The fact that not everyone can possibly learn everything there is to know about magic is probably the only thing that necessitates an economy.

But this isn't how things are in the muggle world. A ministry here is a government that tells people what to do. So imagine if you will, that you are a talented wizard, you come from a rich family, and have just finished your magical education. The rest of your life will be spent trying to advance your knowledge of magic, or pursuing some magical art. There's nothing to hold you back from just exploring the world. Except there's a muggleborn witch or wizard who doesn't understand this. They're convinced that a government should govern. When they see you practicing the dark arts, they don't see a wizard exercising their right to explore the many and varied facets of magic. They see a dark wizard that the government hasn't arrested because it's so incompetent. Nevermind that you wouldn't use your dark knowledge to hurt anyone. It's all magic in the end. Why is this spell good but that one isn't? And this muggleborn idiot, who doesn't understand your culture or traditions, who never grew up in your world gets to come in here and decide for you and your family and your friends how you get to use your magic? Not to mention they're the children of Muggles, the people who forced your brethren into hiding in the first place. They're the reason you need the ministry at all, and why you can't play a friendly quidditch match out in the open.

It kinda makes sense if you look at it in that light. It's a culture clash more than anything.
