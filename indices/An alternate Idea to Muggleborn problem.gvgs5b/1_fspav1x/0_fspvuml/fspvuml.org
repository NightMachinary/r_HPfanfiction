That's not really a complex issue, either. When two cultures clash, then it's either something stupid and unimportant, like what kind of food you like or how you dress, which is something only a racist scumbag would get up in arms about, or it's something important - like acceptance of LBGT people, women's rights, democracy, human rights etc. And it's really, really hard to create a culture clash over something important, like human rights, that results in the "different, but equally valid" reaction and not "this cannot stand!" from people who respect human rights. It's really hard to find arguments that aren't obviously stupid for why girls shouldn't be allowed to determine their own fate, why gay people shouldn't be allowed to live or everyone should worship the same god.

Not that every reader will understand that. I've had people defend an aristocracy in comments to one of my stories just because the Protagonist was an aristocrat defending the system.
