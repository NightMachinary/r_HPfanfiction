I once read a fic where ‘family magics' was a thing. The idea was that people pass their talents on to their children. Potter's are good at protection magic, Longbottom's do herbology, Black's do dark magic. Muggleborns are not weak, but are not able to have any natural talents for magic, and if they breed with Pure-Blood's their children would lose the family magic. So wizards choose people with similar Magic's to make talented children. All of the above is very problematic if you think about it. As is any fic that start with “okay how do we make eugenics sympathetic and true?” Besides it tends to lead to those political story's where people start throwing around things like “All Potter's through history have been carbon copies of James or Harry, All Longbottom's are just like Neville, etc. Leading to dark and light families, were you get registered as evil on the day that you are born. It denies the characters agency and individuality when you start to bring eugenics into the mix.
