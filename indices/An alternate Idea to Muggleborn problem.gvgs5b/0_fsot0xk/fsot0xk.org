Ignoring the use of "elixer" that is exactly what the Death Eaters are unjustly accusing the muggleborn of in Deathly Hallows. Stealing magic from Wizards and causing squibs.

The question must be asked of why you are trying to make the Death Eater cause more justifiable. If you want a fic where they are the good guys, you're already going full AU and blood purity might as well be discarded. If you are trying to suggest a theory or explanation to "justify" their canon actions you will come across as supporting their racism every time.

Even if the number of wizards in the world was a set value it wouldn't justify racism against those, who through uncontrollable circumstances of birth, were born with the gift that others were denied. It could explain some bitterness on the parts of squibs and families of squibs, but it wouldn't justify bigotry.

Nothing justifies bigotry.
