Racism and bigotry are founded in power, hate, oppression, and ignorance.

The bigotry of purebloods is already "justified" in that sense by canon. Incoming muggleborn with ideas about equality and society from the muggle world are a threat to the power held by the wealthy and established families. So the narrative of mudbloods is spun and the ignorant masses are fed the hatred, which latches on. The ignorant that gain power perpetuate the bigotry out of their hatred. The cycle builds over generations and oppression reigns.
