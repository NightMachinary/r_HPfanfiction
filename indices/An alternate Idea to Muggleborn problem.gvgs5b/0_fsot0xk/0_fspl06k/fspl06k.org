It's easier to write a decent story If you write humans realistically. And even racism has a reasons behind it and generally ones that are more than just blatant make believe.

Even racism or bigotry is supported by facts, statistics and scientific studies. But the reason why those "facts" don't matter is often obscure enough, that those hold up to basic scrutiny.

So, If OP simply wants to give blood purist more than two braincells, he would need a better argument.
