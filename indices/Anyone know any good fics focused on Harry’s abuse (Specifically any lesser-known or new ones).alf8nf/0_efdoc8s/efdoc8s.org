I'm writing No Longer Alone, which is centred around Harry becoming part of the Tonks family after being taken from the Dursleys after the Third Year.

There is no on-screen abuse but several discussions of canonical abuse (so no rape plots or marking with a fire iron). I'm trying to depict the whole thing as gradual change. Harry does not go around calling Andromeda "Mum" the day after being taken in by them or immediately thinks that his new family is the go-to option for everything after being forced to do things alone for 13 years.
