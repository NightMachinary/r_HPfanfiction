#+begin_quote
  Clark comes back a little bit wrong---or maybe more than a little bit. He poses a danger to anybody close to him, in more than one way. There's only one person he can think of who's learned enough about Kryptonian biology to help him and isn't currently in prison; and Wayne owes him, anyway. At least he won't have to feel guilty about lashing out anymore, if he's doing it at the guy who tried to kill him. Except "lashing out" doesn't really cover it, after a while---and maybe Wayne's in over his head just as far as Clark is.
