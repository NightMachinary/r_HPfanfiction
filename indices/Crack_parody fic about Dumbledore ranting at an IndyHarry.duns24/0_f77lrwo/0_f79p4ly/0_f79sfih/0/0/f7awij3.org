Yes, but that's exactly my point: we have to believe that it so, because we actually never see anybody being stopped (Voldemort or any other bad guy) from hurting Harry. One of the main principles of any writing is “Show, don't tell!”. Show me how strong those wards are, don't just talk about how Dumbledore is the most powerful wizard in the world, show me (which in the limited version happened at least once in The Battle of The Department of Mysteries), don't let other characters tell us who the main hero is, show me! etc.
