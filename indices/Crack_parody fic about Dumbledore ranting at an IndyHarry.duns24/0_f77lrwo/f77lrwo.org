Yeah, that's a pet peeve of mine ... we never see those famous [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/cyudl8/lf_fic_which_shows_those_blood_wards_in_action/][blood wards in action]] (hell, we don't see even Dumbledore much in action with one exception of the Battle of the Department of Mysteries). The only exception is the chapter of 2 of linkffn(The Warren by DarkKing666). And I write them in my (very very unfinished and raw draft; comments welcome) story about [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister.html][Ginny being somebody else]].
