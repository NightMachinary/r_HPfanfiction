If you are into HP romance stories, there is this cool site that is just getting up and going. [[http://hpromance.info/]] It doesn't have much of anything but the creator is basically trying to consolidate fanfictions already out there on various websites. For each pairing, there will be links to stories on a variety of different websites which should help a lot with finding good stories.

It is really in its beginning stages, but I know she is accepting moderators to be in charge of certain pairings. I know it doesn't really help you now, but hopefully in the future, when more stories are up, and more moderators are able to work on the website, it will be helpful :)
