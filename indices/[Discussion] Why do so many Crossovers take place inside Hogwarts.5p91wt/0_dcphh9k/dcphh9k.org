I really don't read crossovers that play in the HP world.

But I'd say its probably the same reason we see so much Super!Harrys. Its power-fantasies played out. The HP world is inferior in terms of power compared to a lot of worlds. While hundreds of HP wizards couldn't level Hogwarts, for example, a Fairytail wizard like Natsu would do so barely straining his muscles.

Except Child of the Storm I can't recall a good crossover fic that played in the HP world. But as I said, I prefer those not playing there in the first place.
