Fear of the unknown, lack of imagination, easiness of familiarity and playing in its own comfort zone. Much easier to nail an environment everyone is familiar with, so that needs very little description, than create something from scratch.

Most of the fics are just rehashing the canon, albeit with other characters mixed in, and even then the results don't change much. You can't expect those people to show a modicum of imagination and creativity and create a new settings for their story.
