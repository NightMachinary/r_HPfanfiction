Harry's a kid, he's supposed to be in school. My two current stories are crossovers. In one, harry's eleven and at school, learning to handle his family's ability, controlling the darkness. The other stort takes place in star trek 'verse, where he's preparing for a new galactic war.

Take a look at child of the storm. Harry's in schol but the story takes place all over the planet~~universe.
