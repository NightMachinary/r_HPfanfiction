It's stated in the stories that it only regenerates only once you show regret. My headcanon is actually that once you split the soul, you basically have some sort of wound, kind of like chopping up a limb or a chunk of yourself. That's why creating a horcrux is considered a painful process and, in my mind, it's a wound that unlike flesh never heals so you just live with the constant pain. That's what usually drives people insane and not necessarily some magical effects.
