I don't see souls as a piece of cake you just take chunks out of. I've always imaging that if you took a piece, then the rest of the soul would expand to fill it (like a gas). Nothing to say the soul doesn't regenerate over time either, though if you apply Dresden-esque logic, then it would probably be pretty slow for voldemort.
