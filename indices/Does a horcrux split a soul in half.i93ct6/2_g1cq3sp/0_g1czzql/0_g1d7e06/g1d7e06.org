I have a different interpretation, since I think that Dumbledore would have said something if he noticed how different Voldemort had become.

I interpreted it as his craziness being an inherent part of him. He spent years as a spirit and was unable to kill a child multiple times. For somebody as arrogant as him, that must have been a hard blow. Harry was that annoying kid that triggers the worst of his anger

Remember that Voldemort was always a showman. His convoluted plot in GoF is an example of that

Like you said, being intelligent and crazy are not mutually exclusive. I think that even without Horcruxes, Voldemort might have still been a bit of a Bond villain.

I really wish we could see more of Voldemort as the suave schemer than the crazy villain. It's my favorite trope in fanfiction honestly
