  Also remember that Dumbledore said his fragmented soul did not affect Voldemort's mind or magic in any way.

  “Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.” DH ch23

Being intelligent and crazy are not mutually exclusive. At the start, he was this suave teenager who could talk a ghost into giving up her most guarded secret and treasure (Diadem of Ravenclaw) or knowledge about horcruxes from a teacher. What faces Harry is this bipolar asylum escapee who constantly gets in his own way by acting like a Bond Villain.

When you get kissed by a dementor, you effectively become a vegetable. So it's natural that when you start shaving off hunks of your soul (so much that it becomes unstable to the point that fragments are made without your knowledge or consent) that it effects your mental /state/.

And canon reflects this as he has these periods where he is remarkably sane, and fully funtioning. And then Potter is mentioned or shows up and Voldemort is suddenly insane.
