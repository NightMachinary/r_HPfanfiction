There's no canon evidence. Slughorn uses the words: part, portion, pieces. Dumbledore did say “tear his soul in two” which is probably where the idea comes from

Also remember that Dumbledore said his fragmented soul did not affect Voldemort's mind or magic in any way. So his craziness is not because he split his soul
