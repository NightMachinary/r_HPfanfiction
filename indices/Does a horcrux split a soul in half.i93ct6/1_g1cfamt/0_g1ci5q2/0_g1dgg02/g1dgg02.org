I mean, it's all shrouded in ambiguity and metaphor when Riddle explains it, but he does at one point say that her writing in the diary consisted of her "literally pouring her soul" into him, and I see no reason not to take him at his word. It's not entirely clear there'd be a meaningful distinction between "soul" and "life-force" in the /Harry Potter/ universe, anyway --- Dementors are soul-eaters, but being around them has the sort of effects you might describe as draining your life-force. I think it's all rather potato-potahto.
