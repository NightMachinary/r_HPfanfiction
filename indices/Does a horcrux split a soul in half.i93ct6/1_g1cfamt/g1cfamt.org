You are hardly the first to make that calculation. As amusing as it is, though, it's probably not how it works. Remember Voldemort /started out/ with the intent of creating six Horcruxes, splitting his soul into seven parts, because he believed the number seven was magically stable. In that light, if you /must/ bring actual fractions into it, I'd reckon he carefully cut one-seventh of his soul at a time so things would be equally balanced. (Then, presumably, the Prime Voldemort post-1981 has somewhat /less/ than a seventh of a soul, because part of it was ripped from him and went into the Scar.)

All that being said, the more likely option is still that "splitting" the soul is a somewhat metaphorical phrase, and that souls aren't quite so physically-defined that you can "quantify" them with hard numbers. Perhaps, also, a soul is able to regenerate itself when split, starfish-like.

In any event, the Diary appears to gain physical reality by absorbing /Ginny/'s soul to complete its own existence, so I don't think the amount of soul he started out with really matters.
