I don't remember being specified in the books the quantity of soul that goes into the Horcrux. In my mind it was always the idea that murder makes it "brittle" and you can easily tear up a chunk of it to place it in a container. But I guess your assessment could coincide with what JK was thinking because it's heavily implied that Voldemort had kind of reached the limits of splitting his soul.
