Maybe I've just become hypersensitive from all the godawful bashing fics I've read, but I dropped it after the first paragraph mentions how he cant trust Ron after the GoF thing. I've never once seen a good fic that has bashing in it. If someone who has read it can tell me that theres literally no bashing whatsoever, I'll continue but the literal first paragraph sets off red flags for me.
