Please do! Be warned though, this is a lengthy trilogy clocking in at over 1 mil words. But its character development, worldbuilding and power scaling is a treat. Probably one of the stories with the most believable growth of power (unique as well). Second and third book delve into auror training and I love the system it sets up for it. Dating instead of having a OTP is a nice change (and well done too)
