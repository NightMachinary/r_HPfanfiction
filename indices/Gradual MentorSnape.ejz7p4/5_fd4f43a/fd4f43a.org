It's a Reptilla28 challenge time travel fic of directly after the war Harry/Hermione/Snape going back. Snape goes back further, so he has the whole "get along with the marauders" thing to deal with. And then when Harry/Hermione "wake up", they have past memories of Snape and memories of snape from the current timeline before they "woke up". It was pretty conflicting for a chapter. And I'm pretty sure it's brought up every once in a while.

When Snape first held toddler Hermione, the way it described the scene made it look like a cross between first time holding a child, deer in the headlights, and 'oh god, occlumency sheilds hide the sneer!'.
