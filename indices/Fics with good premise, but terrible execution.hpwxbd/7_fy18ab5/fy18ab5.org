Linkffn(when in doubt obliviate) the idea was interesting and the beginning was pure gold, but then I feel like it went to deep in crack even though it really didn't need to.

Linkffn(partially kissed hero) was also very interesting, but it ended up dissolving in a Bashing-for-no-good-reason feast that alternatively makes Dumbledore some omniscient and amoral threat with an endless political clout that would torture kill orphans and puppy's for absolutely no reason and then turns and makes him an absolute idiot who can't see his plans being thwarted from right behind his nose and wouldn't be able to find a way to escape from a potato sack even with a map, GPS, signs and literally screamed and detailed instructions. Besides it also falls under the same old â€˜power isn't able to overcome experience' fallacy, which never falls to piss me off.
