I don't know what genre it was marked as though, I think it is kind of supposed to be about disability, and his interaction with all the other disabled OC's. For me I thought it was executed quite well in terms of how they describe the blindness, they obviously put a lot of thought into how it would work in the wizarding world, and being blind myself I thought it was well executed. They're writing style definitely improved as well, at first it wasn't great, but it has definitely got better.
