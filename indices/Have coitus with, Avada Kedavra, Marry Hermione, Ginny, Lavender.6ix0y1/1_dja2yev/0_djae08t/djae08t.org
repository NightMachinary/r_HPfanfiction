That's what I'd go for too, I think. Of all the HP boys, Neville just seems like he'd make the best husband.

I wouldn't mind a fling with Ron, just casual no-emotional-strings-attached sex. I think he'd be fun. The only problem is that Hermione would probably kill the both of us... or at least set vicious magical birds on us.

Harry has survived two Killing Curses, so he'd survive a third one. I don't really want to kill anyone...and I couldn't even cast a Killing Curse anyway... wait, hang on. I'd challenge him to a round of Mortal Kombat, and then beat him (because no way he gets any video game practice!) and then I'd perform a Fatality move! Hah!
