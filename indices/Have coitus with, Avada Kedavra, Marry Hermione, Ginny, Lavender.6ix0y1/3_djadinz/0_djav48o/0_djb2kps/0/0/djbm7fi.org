You're right, that is funny.

Thing is, Hermione always struck me as ever so slightly prudish. Not that she hates sex or anything, but I can't see her as wanting anything to do with a foursome, much less a lesbian one. And trying to tell her that she'd be graded on her performance would no doubt sent her into an annoyed rant. :D

(I'm actually planning out a fanfic with heavy harem themes, where Hermione is one of the girls who refuses to have anything to do with it.)
