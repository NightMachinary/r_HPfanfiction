What about some all-terrible options?

The All-Terrible Witches: Alecto Carrow, Umbridge, Bellatrix (dried-up old book edition, not the movie version)

The All-Terrible Wizards: Peter Pettigrew, Severus Snape (who is decidedly /not/ Alan Rickman), Voldemort (*not* Tom Riddle, /Voldemort/)

And no, using the Killing Curse on yourself is not allowed.
