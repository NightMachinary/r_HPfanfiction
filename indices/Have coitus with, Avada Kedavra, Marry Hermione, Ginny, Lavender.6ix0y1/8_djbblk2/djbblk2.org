Well ... have coitus with Lavender (she seems the most “free-spirited” of them all), not kill Hermione (I wouldn't be able to cast the killing curse, but even with knowing that trying on Ginny would end badly), then not marry Ginny (because as progressive in certain areas they are, I highly doubt a girl--girl marriage is a thing for them).

I think I am seriously perverting the statistics there.
