Summary:

During a publicity stunt, Harry and five others are sent to another world where a well timed Stupefy made all the difference. As Harry looks for his peers and a way home, another Harry investigates the odd arrival of his doppelganger. (Canon, EWE, dimension travel, AU)

Quite similar to Stages of Hope, less dramatic, time travel happens after Harry's 8th year at Hogwarts
