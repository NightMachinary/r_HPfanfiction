Well, I've not read a fic with that, But Elan would be a good name for a Malfoy with their fandom French connections ( I've always seen the Malfoys as a Norman family rather than old-OLD English pure-blood like the Blacks)

Elan is roughly the French word for Rush, or Blitzkrieg. A mainly Military term, which makes for a good name for a powerful Wizard.

Well, as good as naming someone Dragon or after Greek gods and Roman Emperors.
