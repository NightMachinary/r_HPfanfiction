It started in a handful of popular fics, predominantly Harry/Hermione and is - as I recall - a reference to Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson.

As fandom is wont to do, other people started using it, osmosis happened until a decent proportion of fics were using them and more recently at least there's been pushback and people using other names.
