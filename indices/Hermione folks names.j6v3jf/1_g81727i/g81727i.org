I started using Dan and Emma when I started writing HP fics actually thinking that those were the canon names for the Grangers... A bad case of Fanon supplanting Canon, I guess.

Once I figured out that the mere Muggles didn't rate a name from JKR, I started giving the Grangers different names in every story.

I've got a crack fic in the planning stage where they get a different name every time they speak, just to see what kind of reaction I get.
