*Emma* Watson and *Daniel* Redcliffe. That's why the names are so common. What I don't really understand is why this subreddit loathes it so much. I haven't seen any fic that implies they are actually the irl actors, it's just a nice little easter egg. I always see them shown as dentists, occasionally also being well versed in law or having a military background if the plot demands it. Never once saw them shown as actors.
