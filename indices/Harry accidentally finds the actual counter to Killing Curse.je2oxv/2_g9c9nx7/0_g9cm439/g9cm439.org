Imagine Voldemort and his supporters all around. AKs are going everywhere then suddenly Dementors show up (because you know there working for him for some ungodly reason) you have the people who can do full patronus' casting them to keep them away while those who cant continue to fight Voldemort suddenly an AK gose state for someone when a patronus runs right in its path trying to get to a dementor it strikes the patronus in the side "killing" the patronus instead of the person it would have hit.
