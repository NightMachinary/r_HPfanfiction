It has to be a balance. If it's too easy an accident, people will question why it was never discovered before.

"Oh yeah, nobody would normally use a Patronus, and therefore it was never discovered."

Versus: "If all it took was AK flying around with Dementors, why wouldn't it have been discovered?"

If you chose the second option, versus having it come up in a dueling setting, then you will have a believability problem. The circumstances you are describing work against the concept of Patronus blocking an AK.

I think it would be easier to say, "This is the reason it never has been discovered, here are the circumstances surrounding how it was accidentally discovered by Harry." And then build the believability into the accident. Hence my comments. I understand exactly what you mean where it /would easily/ happen, I just don't know if that's a good choice.
