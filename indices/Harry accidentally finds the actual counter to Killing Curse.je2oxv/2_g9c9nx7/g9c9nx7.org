It could make sense that the intent of the Patronus would defend against an AK. But also you'd have to consider how someone would find out. Why would you duel with a Patronus? The difficulty of the intent makes it very unfeasible as a dueling spell, even as a distraction. So you need to come up with a way for casting the spell to make sense. Maybe Harry senses dread that he incorrectly identifies as dementors?

But even if it kind of makes sense, I wouldn't do it. If Harry finds an AK counter, it should feel earned imo.
