I don't know that story as well. I actually hated it and stopped reading, lol. Sounds like a good buildup, but what makes it true? What reason and means would Harry have to improve upon the spell? Is it just super Patronus? Am I going to think, "Everyone is just dumb, why didn't they discover the Dementor-killing AK blocking version of this spell?" Harry the genius 14 yo, making that sort of discovery would really have to be built to, right?

I'm just a weird guy in the minority probably, so grain of salt. I love super smart powerful Harry. I just don't like lifting Harry up at the expense of everyone else's intelligence.
