  but what makes it true?

Harry figures out that dementors are the personification if death (and he also realizes that at least godric figured this out as well) and that the ordinary lower level patronus works by making the caster distract themselves from their own mortality, he then casts it but with the thought that he rejects death as the natural order and one day people won't have to say goodbye anymore- nobody else figured it out yet because nobody else both realized what the dementors actually we're and also intended to defeat death itself

Also, had you stuck around you would have found a major theme to be harry really not being nearly as much smarter than everyone else as he thinks he is and that hubris often coming to bite him in the butt
