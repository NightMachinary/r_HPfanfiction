The Harry-learns-Patronum scene is chapters 43 thru 45. You could read those and see what you think. It is one of the more intense scenes in the book, and the individual chapters are linked from the website (hpmor dot com). Edit: [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/43][here's the chapter link]].

You can also try chapter 14 of the hpmor sequel (different author, completely different style) "Significant Digits":

Scroll down about halfway to skip the leadup. Search for where it says "Not one more minute!". This scene is where Hermione gets her own Patronus. She is summoned by a phoenix to fly to Azkaban and destroy all the Dementors there. Again a very intense scene stretching maybe a dozen pages. No idea if either scene will do anything for you, but they are close to the center of what HPMOR & its related fics aim for, so maybe they'll help you decide whether to pursue the book further.
