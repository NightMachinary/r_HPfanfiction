I think that if the Patronus really was a counter to the Killing Curse, someone would have figured it out by now. Your second idea, though...

/“Very good,” said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too. “And now you face me, like a man...straight-backed and proud, the way your father died...”/

Harry looked around the graveyard. The Death Eaters stood back, watching -- he knew they wouldn't interrupt unless Voldemort told them so, and the Dark wizard wanted to kill him himself. Cedric's unconscious body laid where Wormtail stood a minute ago, and the Triwizard Cup -- the Portkey that brought him there -- laid on the ground just a little further away.

/“And now -- we duel.”/

Now, Harry wasn't stupid. He understood perfectly well that in a straight-up duel with the most powerful Dark wizard alive, he wouldn't stand a chance. Fortunately, he had one last ace up his sleeve -- powerful, ancient magic, the one that Dumbledore said was beyond anything Hogwarts could teach...

The power the Dark Lord knew not.

“I never wanted this, you know.” Harry said suddenly, preparing to invoke the defensive spell. “I just wanted to be a Seeker.”

“What?” Voldemort looked surprised, even lowering his wand a little.

“Yes! A Seeker! Flying through the air on my Firebolt! The thrill! The excitement! The wind blowing through my hair!”

“What about our bloody duel?” Voldemort asked, obviously irritated, but Harry paid him no mind.

“With my best mates by my side, we'd sing, sing, sing!”

And he began the spell, the lyrics coming to him as he yelled the song at the top of his lungs.

*I'm the Boy-Who-Lived, and I'm okay!*

*I sleep all night and I fly all day!*

He moved as he sang, running towards Cedric and ignoring Voldemort's indignant yell. Harry didn't really have a plan, but his instincts pointed him towards the Portkey lying on the ground -- though, of course, he wasn't going to abandon his fellow student to the Death Eaters.

*I go to class, I eat my lunch,*

*I fly at the Quidditch pitch.*

*Sometimes I serve detentions,*

*Because Malfoy is a snitch!*

Voldemort was furious, sending one Killing Curse after another, but they seemed to have no effect on the Gryffindor. Harry grabbed Cedric's unconscious body, and then he made a run for the Cup before Voldemort would realize what he was doing.

*I'm the Boy-Who-Lived, and I'm okay!*

*I sleep all night and I fly all day!*

***

Harry felt himself slam flat into the ground; he was back to the edge of the maze, the Cup in one hand and Cedric's body held by the other. A crowd of people ran towards him, led by Dumbledore and other Hogwarts Professors.

Harry took in his surroundings, realizing that he was safe at last. But exhausted and scared as he was, he still finished the song -- right as the alarmed Professors reached him.

*I go to class, I wear high heels,*

*Suspenders and a drape,*

*I wish I'd been a girlie,*

*Just like Professor Snape!*
