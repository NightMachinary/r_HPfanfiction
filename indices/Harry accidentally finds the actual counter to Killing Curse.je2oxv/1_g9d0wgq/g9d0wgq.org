For the life of me I can't remember what the story was about, but one fic I read had voldemort rediscovering the killing curse in some dusty tome prior to the first war, but the reason why it wasn't being used is that it was /super/ easy to counter. But since it hadn't been used for so long the counter fell out of collective memory making it an utterly terrifying unstoppable curse.

The counter? Lumos. For some reason it just straight up nullified the killing curse.
