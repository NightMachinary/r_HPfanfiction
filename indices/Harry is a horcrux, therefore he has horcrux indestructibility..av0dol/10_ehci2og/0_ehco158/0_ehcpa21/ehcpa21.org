I'm pretty new to this sub, so I apologize if my response was against etiquette for a request.

I thought you raised an interesting concept, and it made me think more specifically about how the horcrux might have worked in canon. I was just trying to participate in the conversation. It certainly wasn't my intention to spoil the fun!

Edit: I'm usually on mobile so I hadn't read the sub rules until [[/u/TheVoteMote][u/TheVoteMote]] pointed out that I was misusing the request thread by responding to the prompt with discussion rather than recommendations. I will be deleting my original comment. Going forward, I'll be sure to look at the sub rules before jumping in to comment. I apologize for the mistake!
