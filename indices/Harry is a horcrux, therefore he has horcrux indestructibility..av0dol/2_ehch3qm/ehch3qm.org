linkffn(11042519) is one. I should point out that this is not a canonical representation of horcruxes. Horcrux items are as equally destructible as non-horcrux items--it is the enchantments placed on the horcruxes that make them so tough to destroy, and the reason why basilisk venom works so well is because its antidote is phoenix tears, which are extremely hard to obtain.
