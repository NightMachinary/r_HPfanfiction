There's a great newer fic(actively updating, about 1/3 of the way in!) called [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13047893/1/Beyond-the-Curtain][Beyond the Curtain]] that has this as a plot point. However, it's not something that just happens, Voldemort has to do extra work to give Harry the protection, which is the divergent point from cannon. It's also not fully explored yet, as the story is told from Neville's POV well after the events of cannon, but its still Harry's story. This might not be exactly what you're expecting, as the reader, like Neville, has very incomplete information, but the “Harry as a horcrux” angle is definitely going to be explored more as the story progresses into its second and third act.
