When does he say that it was made just for thy purpose. Also I know fanon has Malloy being in trouble for the diary being destroyed, is that canon? And I find it hard to believe it would be a weapon because A)it's a form of immortality for Tom and if caught would be evidence of how he's immortal and B) I would think it seemed like Voldemort was already winning and thus a weapon from inside hogwarts wouldn't be as much use.
