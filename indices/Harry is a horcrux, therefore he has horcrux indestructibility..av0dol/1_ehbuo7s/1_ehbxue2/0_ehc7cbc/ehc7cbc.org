The locket seemed like it was trying to do that, too.

Nobody was around any of the others long enough to find out. The diadem pretty much got fiendfired before anyone was around it for any length of time, the ring was megacursed and would have killed you long before any possession shenanigans, the cup was locked in a vault and the snake was, well, a snake. It was probably already being possessed by the horcrux.

So of the three that had the opportunity to do so (diary, locket, snake), 2 of them definitely had mental effects and one of them is unknown.

So I don't think possession into rebirth was unique to the diary.
