If it happened with the diary, that would just be precious. Imagine: angsty young Voldemort is stuck as an impotent muggle teenager when a muggle.

If Harry's scar... I wonder if he'd even be able to continue living without magic?

If a muggle using a horcrux makes a muggle version of Voldemort, think of the possibilities!

House Elf Voldemort? Veela? Phoenix?
