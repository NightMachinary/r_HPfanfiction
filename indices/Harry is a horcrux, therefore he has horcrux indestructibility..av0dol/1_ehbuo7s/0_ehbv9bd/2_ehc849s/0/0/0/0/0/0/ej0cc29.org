Dumbledore bashing is what I was referring to when I said it was dated. As for Slytherin, what in canon makes you think that they (and the students in general) aren't easily swayed sheep in canon?

BTW raise ANY character up to a realistic level of competency and they would probably curb stop everyone in canon. Voldie just has the distinction of being the least incompetent, despite checking almost every box in the “Saturday cartoon villain” category
