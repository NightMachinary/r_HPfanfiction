All of his fics have Dumbledore bashing? Even with the loosest interpretation that doesn't hold (You Are My Density has no antagonistic Dumbles at all, much less bashing), and as I already said Hogwarts students (and the Wizarding World at large) being sheep is CANON. And no you do not have to boost the villain of a CRACK fic, especially one where where he never actually encounters the hero after the opening.
