I agree with this comment, but a Gary Sue fic by definition gives him too much of a boost.

Souls Abound and almost all robst fics give Harry, Hermione, and sometimes Luna an absurd amount of boost to the point that none of the antagonists ever pose a real challenge. This is the part of [[/u/roryokane]]'s comment I was referring to anyway.

  the bashed characters are very OOC. Harry and Hermione accuse Dumbledore of various things, and every time Dumbledore is portrayed as being unable to give a single argument in his defense, even when there are obvious such arguments he could give.

  Also, suddenly every single Hogwarts student not in Slytherin believes Harry about everything and is willing to follow him in his political plays.
