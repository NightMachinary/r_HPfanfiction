That certainly is a relevant story, but after reading six chapters of it, I warn those who are considering following the link and reading it: it's not a well-written one.

The story is full of bashing, mainly of Dumbledore. That wouldn't be a problem, except that the bashed characters are very OOC. Harry and Hermione accuse Dumbledore of various things, and every time Dumbledore is portrayed as being unable to give a single argument in his defense, even when there are obvious such arguments he could give.

Also, suddenly every single Hogwarts student not in Slytherin believes Harry about everything and is willing to follow him in his political plays.

The result is that in /Souls Abound/, there is no challenge -- just Harry knocking down dummies in the shape of familiar characters, and everyone praising him for it.
