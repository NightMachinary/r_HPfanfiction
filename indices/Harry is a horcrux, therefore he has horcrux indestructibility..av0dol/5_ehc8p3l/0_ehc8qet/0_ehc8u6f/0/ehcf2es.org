Maybe you're looking for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]]?\\
Harry's not invincible in that one, but he has a kind of immortality from the horcrux.

And I know I saw one where Harry survives a car crash and the death of the Dursleys, and discovers that he's utterly invincible. He jumps off buildings and throws himself in the way of killing curses later, but I think it might be a one-shot in a collection.
