I would think the tears only heal not protect though. I believe that quote sounds like it's referring to guarding them carefully because they can be destroyed just not easily. I think that the basilisk venom works because it can destroy nearly anything including horcuxes. The person is told guard it carefully because just because something isn't easy to destroy doesn't mean it's indestructible. I would think by that logic at least the diadem wouldn't have been destroyed because surely Voldemort could have guarded something against ffiendfyelre if it was possible.
