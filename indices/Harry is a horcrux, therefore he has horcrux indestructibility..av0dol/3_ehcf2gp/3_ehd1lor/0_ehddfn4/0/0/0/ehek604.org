This is a really good breakdown, but I have to disagree with the last bit about the soul fragments from horcruxes moving on. To point out a quote you already used:

#+begin_quote
  “It should be, actually! But my point is that *whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched*,” said Hermione. “*But it's the other way round with a Horcrux.* The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. *It can't exist without it.*”
#+end_quote

This doesn't mean the piece of soul can't exist in a physical form, it means /it can't exist at all./ Otherwise it would be exactly the same as a human body. Destroying a horcrux destroys the piece of soul inside it. The mutilated baby-sized Voldemort at King's Cross is what's left of his original, formerly whole soul - it's why it's so small and disfigured. Voldemort himself was not a horcrux, he still had a portion of his own soul left to him (the portion that escaped Godric's Hollow and was reborn into its own body), and as such is the only one capable of moving on.

You can effectively repair a soul that's been mutilated like this, if the owner can manage to feel enough remorse and has a real desire to become whole again. But this process seems more to be like a lizard regrowing its tail - you can repair it, but you're not getting that original piece back. Harry makes a last ditch effort to get Voldemort to do this during their final confrontation, though he knows it's a lost cause, because:

#+begin_quote
  "I've seen what you'll be, otherwise."
#+end_quote

Confirming that the Voldemort he saw when he 'died' (and when Voldemort collapsed at the same moment) was the true form of his remaining self.
