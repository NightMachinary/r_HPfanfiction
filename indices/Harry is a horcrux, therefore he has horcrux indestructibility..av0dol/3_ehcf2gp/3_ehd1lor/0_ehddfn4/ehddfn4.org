No, it's an explicit quote from Deathly Hallows. Hermione reads from some book about horcruxes, and says that a significant part of the book is telling the horcrux-makers that they need to safeguard and protect the horcrux, because it's just a physical object and can be destroyed.

Basilisk venom doesn't have inate anti-horcrux properties, it's just a very powerful venom that is difficult to guard against. It worked on Voldemort's horcruxes, because he lacked the only counter-measure to the venom: pheonix tears. If he'd ever been in a room with Fawkes while carrying some onions, then he would've been able to venom-proof his horcruxes using the tears.
