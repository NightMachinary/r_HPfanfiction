Really? I always thought the horcruxes were hard to destroy and the protections were to stop people from escaping with them/survive to destroy them. My headcanon has always been that the soul is infinite and formless or something like that and is impossible to destroy and those properties transfer over to the object. The reason basilisk venom/fiendfyre destroys them is the magic tethering the soul to the object is being destroyed.
