Those are not the same, the Elder Wand wouldn't help him there. It's not spellwork vs spellwork.

Dumbledore drank poison of his own free will, and he voluntarily touched a cursed object.

I didn't say anything about the wand making him immune to harm. I would say that he should have been able to overcome those defenses by deactivating/breaking/whatever the spells, not that he's immune to them.
