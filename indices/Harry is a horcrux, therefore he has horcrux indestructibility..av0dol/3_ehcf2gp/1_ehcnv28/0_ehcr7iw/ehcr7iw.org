  Voldemort can't be better at placing defences than Elder Wand wielding Dumbledore is at removing them.

Can we take a minute to remember how Elder Wand weilding Dumbledore would have been defeated twice by Voldemort's protections? The ring dealt him a fatal injury, even though it was destroyed; and he likely would have let the Inferi kill him under the influence of the potion had it not been for his last ditch effort to save Harry from the same fate.
