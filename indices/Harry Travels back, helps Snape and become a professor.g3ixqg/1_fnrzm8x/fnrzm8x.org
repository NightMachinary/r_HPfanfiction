I think I know which one you are talking about and I am sure it is on AO3. If you look for Snarry fics on AO3, select only finished and sort by Kudos and it should be one of the fics on the first 5 pages.

IIRC Harry does not kill Tobias, but deck him one or piss him off. And Snape does the deed with Regulus Black before taking it up with Harry. And unless I am mixing stuff up, I think Harry tried to pass himself as a Potter cousin.
