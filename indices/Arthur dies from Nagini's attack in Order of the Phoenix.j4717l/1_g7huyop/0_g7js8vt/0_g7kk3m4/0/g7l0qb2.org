It wasn't as much that single instance as the signs of depression the man exhibited throughout the books. I am not saying he was a bad man but he did have chronic depression (Which is understandable with his condition).

I think he would end up in a funk which would be non-conductive to be being a father. He would inadvertently neglect Teddy because of the depressions. Not as much a fault of his own but the fact that he wouldn't have the mental clarity to take care of Teddy properly.

I could see him becoming a bigger part of Teddy's life when Teddy is older but I honestly believe Remus would at best become an estranged father while Harry would become the main father figure in Teddy's life. Especially if Tonks died during the battle.

Also I don't think Andromeda and Remus got along at all. Either Andromeda wouldn't be as hands on as the grandmother or she and Remus would fight at times. Teddy would pick up on this.

I agree he was the happiest when Teddy was born but that is not enough when you have to raise a child. Also Remus would financially have a hard time raising Teddy.

Harry would try to help with that but Remus is too proud of a person. He might change for the sake of Teddy but he might not. I don't know. Tonks was what made Remus better without her... I just don't see it.

Though I can agree that "horrible" might be too loaded.
