I disagree. When he arrived at Shell Cottage to announce Teddy's birth, he was literally the happiest we've ever seen him at any point in the series. True, we don't know how he would have handled being a father since he never actually got a chance to be one, but we have no reason to think he would have been a horrible dad.

And before you mention the fact that he ran out on Tonks, yes, I'm not ignoring that. But he was distraught and panicked because he thought he had doomed his son to live a cursed life, and let's be honest, who among us hasn't done something stupid and irresponsible in a moment of emotional distress? The important thing to remember is that after he got his head back on straight, he went back to his wife and didn't leave her side again.
