Remus would have been a HORRIBLE dad. Even if he pulled his shit together he would likely have ended giving up Teddy to Andromeda and/or Harry whenever one of his depressive periods happened. Not to mention every full moon.

He would be scared that being associated with Teddy would limit Teddy far more than it ever should.
