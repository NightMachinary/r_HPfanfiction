  Arcturus Black, Head of the Black Family, manages to free Sirius after only two years in prison. Free, though still believed to be a Death Eater by the public, Sirius raises Harry. As he deals with the aftermath of the war and Azkaban, Sirius begins re-evaluating his world view. He ran away from the pureblood world he was born into, believing it to be evil and wrong. But was it? Was Voldemort really fighting for pureblood supremacy? Or was he simply and evil mad man? Is Dumbledore truly good? Or a manipulative, power hungry man trying to shape the wizarding world to his desires? [AN: Has recently been adopted by MabonEleven, will continue starting November 2018]
