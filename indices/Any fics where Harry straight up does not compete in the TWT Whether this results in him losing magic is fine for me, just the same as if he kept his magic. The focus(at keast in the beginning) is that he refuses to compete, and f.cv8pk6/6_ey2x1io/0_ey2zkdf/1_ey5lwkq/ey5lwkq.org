I wanted to read a Danganronpa fic where someone was inserted into the body of Hifumi Yamada during the events of Trigger Happy Havoc, but was unable to find one. But to be fair, looking for self inserts of Danganronpa only found me less than a half dozen fics total...

(So maybe I'll write it ._.)
