The thread is not marked No Discussion, and my comment isn't negative commentary? Besides, I did have a suggestion, I just didn't link it because it was already linked in the thread...

OP didn't ask for Angsty/Indy Harry fics, if he did, I would have just ignored the thread instead of commenting. I think this is a fascinating notion to explore, particularly if authors find a way to work around the fact that Harry is a bit of a pushover and isn't one to just nope out by himself without support (such as the linked fics "Lawyers against the Cup" and "Banking on Her" do).
