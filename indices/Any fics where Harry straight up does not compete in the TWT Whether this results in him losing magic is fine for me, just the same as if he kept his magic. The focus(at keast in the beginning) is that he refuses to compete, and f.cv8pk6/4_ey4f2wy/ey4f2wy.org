I'll be honest, while I like this notion, I really don't like fics where Harry just nopes out of the Tournament. It isn't in his character, and 99.99% of those fics are Angsty/Indy Harry which turn out to be just crap. Five minutes later it'll be all "You have to call me Lord Harry" and "I removed all your blocks from my magic now I am uber powerful".

Now what would be nice is if Harry turns to a responsible adult in his life (Sirius) and they raise hell / keep Harry out of it. Even if Sirius can't get involved directly, guiding Harry to say, a lawyer or something.

Someone else linked Banking on Her, which is nice, but you know Hermione being the responsible one gets kinda old (and I like H/Hr fics). I recall it being good.

Edit: Banking on Her actually falls into "Harry acting way out of character", with Hermione simply following. The Lawyers Against the Cup has a much more Canon Harry, one of the best I've seen for this prompt.
