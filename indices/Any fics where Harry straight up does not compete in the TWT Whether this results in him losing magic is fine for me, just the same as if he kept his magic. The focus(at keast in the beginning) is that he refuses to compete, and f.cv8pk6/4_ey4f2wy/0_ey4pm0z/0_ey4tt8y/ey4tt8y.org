Eh, I doubt that last part, as Harry is set up as 'real life is shit, escape into the magical world'. If anything Harry always wants to pull more into the magical world than out of it.

However, I do agree that it would be within Harry's character to be stubborn and fight a magical contract. He is set up as a stubborn character with a strong sense of right and wrong. And he has no problem subverting authority.

However, Harry really isn't an initiator of such things. Likely due to his role as a reader avatar. He isn't the one starting house elf liberation efforts, doing independent study, starting prank wars, or deciding there is a 'good fight' to fight. Canon Harry always takes his cues from Dumbledore, Hermione, or Ron. He then runs with it and sees it to conclusion.

Thus why I said it would be interesting to have a responsible adult (Dumbledore, McGonagall, Sirius, Random Lawyer) break down the issue for him. And then I can easily see Harry stubbornly sticking to the path of resistance...
