What the fuck did I just read

That was NOT the most cliche harry potter fic ever, that title is still held by linkffn(king of magic)

BUT you do own the title for the biggest clusterfuck of a fic ever like holy shit

Btw that hotel thing was funny

I think you were the first person I ever saw that made Harry capable of controlling the universe.

I can see that it's wettien like tjis but it dosny mayter so whatever
