If you think you might enjoy it, there's linkffn(Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness) which is DH seen from Neville's point of view. Moreover, if you want to see Harry interacting with his children, the best you can go for IMO is linkffn(Grow Young with Me), be advised though that it isn't Epilogue-compliant, but the depiction of the characters is so good that I think it would be the best you could go for if you're beginning in fanfictions.
