I'm generally disappointed by the lack of high quality postwar fics, but there are still some I like:

*Grave Days*, linkffn(5486257), shows what happened immediately after the Battle of Hogwarts.

*Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126), is about Harry's family life amid a murder mystery.

*Children's Crusade*, linkffn(6989327), has a Hermione from another dimension summon the trio and Ginny to defeat Voldemort one more time. Epilogue compliant.

*We are the Golden Trio!*, linkffn(7405516), is a time travel story where the trio went into a different time line, fixed things up, and still went back to their original one. I think it should be canon compliant.
