linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) is technically canon-compatible (though it ignores the epilogue, thank god), and the writing style is extraordinarily mature and thorough. It's an absolute *treat* to read, even though it does involve a bizarre Hermione/Neville/Draco relationship triangle.
