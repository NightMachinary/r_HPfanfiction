Someone else has already suggested a couple by Northumbrian (Grave Days is very good! Strangers at Drakeshaugh is mostly an everyday slice of parent life, with a hint of background adventure). Here's the link to his page so you can take a look at the timeline in the bio if you want to read them in order: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]]

This one involves finding the remaining Death Eaters: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6342013/1/Hunters-and-Prey]] (fair warning, it jumps around chronologically chapter to chapter, and can be a bit confusing, but everything ties together nicely).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992917/1/Friends-and-Foes]] is incomplete but is adventure (and romance apparently? I don't remember that part) - searching for Colin's murderer.

Some of his MIT (Muggle Interface Team) stories are really good too, but those focus more on minor characters or OCs than Harry. If you're open to reading about stuff occurring during DH, he's written 'Fred and George's Busy Day' and 'Tales of the Battle' which I'd recommend as well (Tales involves multiple perspectives).
