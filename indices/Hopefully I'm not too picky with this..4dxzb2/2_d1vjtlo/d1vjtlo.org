[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3955920/HalfASlug][Halfaslug]] has a lot of small one shots (that is too say, small stories of only one chapter) set after the books. Most of them are really cool, there's not much addventure like you requested, since they're mostly Ron Hermione and Harry hanging out. I'd suggest yout ake a look at it anyway!

(PS [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4bvt2f/fanfiction_friday/d1dc2cu][This]] is my current list of recomended fanfics. Although not all of them fit your request, I'd recomend a look at it anyway, since we seem to have a lot of the same tastes!)
