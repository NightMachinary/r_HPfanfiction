I'm going to recommend all AU's, as those feature extensive world building by their very nature.

Prince of the Dark Kingdom

Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by the Santi

Black Luminary by YakAge

Firebird Trilogy by Darth Marrs

Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches by leadvone

Prince by SallyJAvery

Out of the Night by rainingink

The Mind Arts by Wu Gang isn't really an AU but builds it's own unique interpretation of magic.
