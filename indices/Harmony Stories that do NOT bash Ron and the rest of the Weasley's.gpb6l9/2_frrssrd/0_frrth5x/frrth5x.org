Very few writers are going to bash only the twins. Too many of them find the Twins' antics "funny" and "cool", and besides that, Harry needs to be best friends with the twins so that they can show how much better friends the twins are to Harry (compared to Ron) and leave opportunities for Weasley bashing.

I wish there was a fic where someone calls out the twins bs while leaving the rest of the family alone, but I also wish I had a million dollars.
