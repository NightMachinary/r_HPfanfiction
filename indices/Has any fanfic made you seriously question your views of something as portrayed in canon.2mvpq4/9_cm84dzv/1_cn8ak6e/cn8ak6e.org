Sirius was an asshole who never grew up, quite similar to Snape in that regard. He tried to kill a fellow student as a teenager by forcing his 'friend' who was, at the time, not in control of himself, to eat/maul/infect Snape. He handed off his godson and motorcycle to Hagrid to go hunt down Pettigrew when he knew he was the prime suspect in the death of his godson's parents.
