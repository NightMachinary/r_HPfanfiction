I see it as a misunderstanding more than anything.

There is a Minister for Magic for every country in the world, because every government needs to be monitored in order to maintain the Statute of Secrecy and ensure that despotic regimes aren't actually puppets of dark wizards.

Some of those Ministers are elected representatives responsible for their own shadow government, whilst others have an office run out of their home, their entire enforcement squad consisting of friends and relatives. The Minister for Liechtenstein, for example, is selected on the basis of which one finds the coin in the treacle at the Yule feast.
