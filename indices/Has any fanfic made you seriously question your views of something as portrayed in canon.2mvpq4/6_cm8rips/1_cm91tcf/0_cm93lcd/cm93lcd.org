Sure, every muggle nation with any significant wizard presence must be covered. But there's no reason for there to be a one-to-one correspondence. For instance, we might reasonably have a separate magical government for Wales and another for Cornwall, with the two of them working with the unified British and Scottish magical government to oversee muggle Great Britain. Alternatively, we might have a magical Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that oversees the muggle governments of Poland, Lithuania, and Bulgaria.

That situation would predict a "Bulgarian Minister for Magic" but not "a representative from the Bulgarian Ministry". The former would be a Commonwealth official in charge of obliviation and secrecy in the duchy of Bulgaria -- important to be sure, but not a head of government or even diplomatically relevant. The latter would indicate that wizarding Bulgaria were attempting to secede from the Commonwealth and the British Ministry was officially recognizing them as an independent nation.

Moreover, why must the names be the same? In an alternate history, Epirus rebelled against the Ottomans, seized some northern territories, then lost their Greek holdings to the resurgent Byzantium, and now the region corresponding to muggle Bulgaria is known as Βόρεια Ήπειρος -- North Epirus.

I totally understand why Rowling didn't write it that way -- she was writing for a young audience and didn't want to bog it down with complex historical politics that have little to no bearing on the plot. It offends my sensibilities, though.
