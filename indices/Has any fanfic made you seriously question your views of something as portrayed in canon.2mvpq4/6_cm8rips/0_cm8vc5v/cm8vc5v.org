This!

It would be much more logical that the magical nations, or at least the authority of certain ministries, would have similar borders as they were in 1689 when the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was decided.

Seeing that power is something nobody gives up voluntarily I don't see the wizards giving up territory/authority because the muggles gave them up.

[[http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/1700/1700.jpg][This is Europe at the time when the Statute was set in place]]. Wizard wars and muggle events that we know (or suspect) about having effect on the wizard society (like WW1 and 2) would alter these borders, of course. But smaller wars, alliances,... made in the muggle world wouldn't alter the wizard world. And wizard wars having the same territorial outcome is highly unlikely.

So where is the Ottoman Empire, where is Habsburg, where is the Church State,...? Clearly the books weren't targeted at people who cared about these things, but it bothers me now that I have an understanding of politics and the nature of wars.
