  This is Europe at the time when the Statute was set in place.

That map makes me cringe.

There was no nation called "Habsburg". There was Austria and there was Hungary, and they were in a personal union under the von Habsburg dynasty. The von Habsburgs were everywhere.

Poland and Lithuania were also in a personal union, typically called the Commonwealth. Saxony was an independent nation whose rulers were of the Wettin dynasty, a lesser branch of the family, while another branch of that family held the throne of the Commonwealth. Wettins currently rule Great Britain and Belgium.

I'm not sure where "Scotland-England-Netherlands" comes from. Scotland and England were not in a personal union until the mid 1700s (a personal union that persists to today). The Netherlands were invaded and temporarily controlled by Spain, but never by England.

Norway isn't labeled separately from Denmark -- moderately understandable since Norway's a lesser partner in a personal union at the time. But they label other personal unions.

Is this map an attempt to map out dynasties as of 1700? But then they shouldn't have labeled the Netherlands at all; they were a republic at the time. And then they would have called both the Commonwealth and Saxony "Wettin".

The Papal States, rather. This included a decent and varying chunk of Italy and a small inland piece of France surrounding the city of Avignon.
