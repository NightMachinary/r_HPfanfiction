I was reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5783428/1/The-End-and-the-Beginning][The End and the Beginning]] by MuggleDad and he had an intersting explanation about Dumbledore, he of course thinks the old man is really manipulative, but during one of the many conversations between characters is that too much blame is put at Dumbles feet. Like if I were to ask you who the president of the Senate was, and who was the president of Yale was, you probably would have no idea, on either accounts. But because of how small the wizarding community is, and his past actions he is given a great deal of importance, so his mistakes (and manipulations) are much more obvious.
