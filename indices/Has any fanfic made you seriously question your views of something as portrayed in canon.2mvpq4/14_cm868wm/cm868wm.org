The fact that every single wizard is completely stupid in canon?

Despite me knowing that Rowling utilized the books not as a "fantastical" story, but rather used the fantasy as an outlet to portray in different ways the characters and themes she wanted us to feel and understand, she under-played human intelligence by a lot.

The only true and smart plot during the whole harry potter books was the chamber of secrets, where voldemort was a second away from winning the war before ever even starting it.

Dumbledore, throughout the whole books, despite being shown in a wise and powerful persona, he commited so many stupid and common-sensical mistakes: -Letting Cornelius Fudge as minister of magic, when he as dumbledore had more political power than anyone else combined. He could have gotten Lucius "disappeared" if he so wanted to. I mean, being hogwarts headmaster, Grindelwalds vanquisher, supreme mugwump, and all those other titles had him the most powerful wizard in all of britain, and you are telling me he couldn't control the daily prophet? And sure, you could argue that he truly believed in good and wanted everyone to be redeemed (except vodlemort), but in the face of war, by that moment you honestly don't care about morality. And here we face another hypocresy from him letting a teenager who has no knowledge whatsoever of how the world works, who has been badly abused for pretty much his whole life be the leading figure against the most powerful dark wizard of all time? (more on that later) and he wouldn't kill all of the known deatheaters who escaped azkaban? He could fight voldemort to a standstill! Also, we don't really know what an unbreakable vow entails within magic except that if you break it you die, but wouldn't that be the OBVIOUS solution to never having a teacher abusing or hurting a student? (especially considering how J.K. Rowling pulled that vow out of her ass, with only one or two special conditions for it) And voldemort was completely useless! He already had the government in his pocket thanks to lucius, he had the whole country terrorized except for like 50 people versus his army of pretty much everyone else, and he had to go for dramatics, wanting to kill a stupid teenager boy, when he already had control of pretty much everywhere. Who cares about Harry Potter when you already have brittain? Sure, he is the country's "hope" and keeps the "resistance" going, but how long can a group of a few hundred undertrained children, and a handful of adults outlast thousands of dark creatures and death eaters? Dumbledore was already dead! and Voldemort fought the most powerful british wizards in a duel by himself and would have killed them if not for the deus ex machina appearence of Harry Potter, who clearly was more important that the other 4 scholars who were the best at their subjects.

And honestly, voldemort never even thought of transfiguring the fucking air into cyanide or something?ยก

I like the Harry Potter books for what they represent, which is a teenager angst story, about life, morality, choices, love, redemption, angst, angst, angst. Which is something that makes them unique.
