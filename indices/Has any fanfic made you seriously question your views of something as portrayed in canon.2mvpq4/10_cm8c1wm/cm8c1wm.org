Some crack fics/parodies inadvertently (or intentionally) pointed out issues in canon for me. I didn't really think about the plot holes associated with time turners until I read the ungodly amount of time-travel fic out there. Fanfic also gave me alternative interpretations of the prophecy, and think more about the prejudices in the wizarding world.

However, fanfiction also made me appreciate Rowling much more, with her ability to write morally ambiguous characters (Harry in DH, Snape, Dumbledore) in stark contrast to the black-and-white of most fanfic. In general, fanfic just makes me think more about canon and the HP universe.
