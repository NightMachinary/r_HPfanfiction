Book 8: Harry Potter and the Hedge Fund's Wrath

People didn't know, but the Weasley squib accountant didn't take kindly to his estrangement from the so-called enlightened wizarding world. By manipulating the difference in exchange rates between the wizarding and muggle worlds, he started a rapid leveraging strategy and bought real-estate at it's post war all time low.

As the Ministry of Magic rebuilds itself, everyone finds out that the hostile takeover of everything they loved has already happened, and if they don't support it their entire economy will collapse.

Guest appearances by the Ghost of Severus Snape who spends the entire time laughing his ass off at everyone's stupidity, Draco Malfoy who finds out that being rich by wizard standards is nothing to an ex-HSBC employee with an axe to grind, and Hermione Granger who can't help but think that for moments like these she really should have learned more math and less spells and ends up going to Oxford in a fit of studiousness.
