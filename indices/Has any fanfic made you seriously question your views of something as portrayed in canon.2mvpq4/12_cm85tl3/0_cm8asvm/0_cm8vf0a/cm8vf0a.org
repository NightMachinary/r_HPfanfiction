HAHAHAHA

Yeah, a book about it would be hell. And to be honest, it doesn't really matter and as a child/teen/young adult it didn't bother me, but nowadays I'm really irritated by the wizards naive and basic economy. Now that I have an understanding of how economies work.

And if you read stuff like Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality you'd be suprised how easy you could destroy the wizard economy. Doesn't even require a degree in economics, just some basic math.
