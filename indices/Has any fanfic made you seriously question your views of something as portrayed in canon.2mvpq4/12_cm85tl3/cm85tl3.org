I find the way in wich the magical and non-magical society interacts pretty stupid. Especially the indifference towards the muggles, shown by the wizards is just too much. I mean... somebody, /anybody/ would eventually get that the wizards economy is really stupid and could easily be manipulated. Some muggle whos married to a wizard had to say "You know honey, this things you make with your wand destroy every last bit of what we think we know about physics. Maybe we should investigate that?" Hermiones parents are doctors. These people are well educated and seeing all this just has to push them over the edge.

But JKR just doesn't seem to care about this little detail. I don't get it and find it really stupid nowadays.
