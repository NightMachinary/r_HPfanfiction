I'm going to be honest --- if I was one of seven children and I fell in love with a person whose history is filled with loved ones who were slaughtered, I'm going to not have any issues with that person picking the names so that they would have an opportunity to honor those people.

Actually, I would even look down on those people who would disagree.
