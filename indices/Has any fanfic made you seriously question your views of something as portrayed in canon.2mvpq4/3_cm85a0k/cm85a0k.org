Yes but ultimately (or the nail in the coffin) was Rowling herself when she posted this:

Albus Dumbledore's plans, however, ran deep. He happened to have known two of the wizards for whose life's work Gilderoy Lockhart had taken credit, and was one of the only people in the world who thought he knew what Lockhart was up to. Dumbledore was convinced that Lockhart needed only to be put back into an ordinary school setting to be revealed as a charlatan and a fraud. Professor McGonagall, who had never liked Lockhart, asked Dumbledore what he thought students would learn from such a vain, celebrity-hungry man. Dumbledore replied that â€˜there is plenty to be learned even from a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be'.

Before this I felt (and still do to an extent) that 'oh they're kids books' and while there are plot holes and issues you have to take in the spirit it was given.

In the light of the above however Dumbledore apparently thinks it's a good idea to hire a wizard who is known to be a skilled, and immoral, obliviator. I mean I know it's a kids book but ALL the girls fawned over him and there isn't any concern over taking advantage and obliviating? Besides that, and I know the position has been cursed for decades, hiring a known incompetent fraud for a whole year seems very stupid. Any lessons that can learned from a bad teacher/person can be learned inside a class or two or maybe a week; not a whole freaking year. "they had never had a practical DADA class before" (PoA) and other remarks sure seem like that plan is a black mark against Dumbledore.

So where I used think yes leaving a baby on the front porch at night is technically illegal and dumb but its a kids story book! yes those safety measures clearly weren't up to snuff but it makes it interesting for each of the kids, and ok you hired the dark lord (I hope and assume he didn't know but he knowingly hired Lockhart) and a death eater (granted it was a well pulled of switch that fooled him but safety measures! its a school! and you know BWL/LV thing?) and a nefariously skilled mind alterer (on purpose...) and a werewolf (favourite character but as we saw the 1% chance of danger isn't worth the risk - perhaps not surprising given the curse on the DADA position) and a whole host of other things that I use to roll my eyes at people who pointed this stuff out as it's 'just a story, a kids book, magic n stuff' now I just don't know.
