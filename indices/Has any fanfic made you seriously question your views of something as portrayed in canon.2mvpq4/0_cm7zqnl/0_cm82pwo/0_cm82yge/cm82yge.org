I think it'd be more like Churchill Stalin Potter... Hitler Stalin would be if he named the kid Tom|Gellert Severus Potter... tho there was that fic where Harry had gotten really drunk before naming his kid and the full name was Albus Severus Tom Vernon Potter...

This of course led to Harry raiding the Ministry Records Department to steal the birth certificate and replace it with a fake.
