Still doesn't change my point about her not being clumsy or else she'd never get high grades in potions, let alone last a week under Moody (he's not the type to cut anyone slack). My theory is that she plays up the "harmless Hufflepuff" thing in public, but once she gets to work she's a pro - both Snape and Moody would have appreciated that.
