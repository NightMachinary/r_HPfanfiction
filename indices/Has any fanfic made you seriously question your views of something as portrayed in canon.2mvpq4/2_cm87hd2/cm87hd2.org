The first fanfic I read was A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles.

Up to that point, I liked Harry Potter, but it wasn't even in my top 20 literary favorites. When reading that, my memory kicked in, and I started piecing together all kinds of things about the books. Luna's way of coping with an /eccentric/ father and a mother that died (in an accident... or did she kill herself?) in front of her was a combination of creating her own magical world where she could be powerfully optimistic about it all. Snape may have been a bastard, but he was a broken man, and probably had been a broken child before that. Sirius was mentally unstable post-Azkaban, and stuck to a childish world view to keep from falling apart in order to be there for Harry.

From there, it just snowballed. Questions popped up everywhere. Was Tonks really clumsy or did she just play it up? Because if she was really clumsy, how could she get an O in potions and then pass training under Moody? How much of Dumbledore's actions towards Snape were based on self-loathing?

I reread the books. All of a sudden, how much of Snape's wrath towards Neville was because of Neville's social awkwardness reminding him of himself? Harry was kind of a brat and never tried to be respectful to Snape even after learning from Quirrelmort that Snape had been protecting him... how much of the Snape/Harry animosity could have been avoided had Dumbledore not lied and said that Snape hated James because James saved his life? Did Dumbledore do that understanding that Harry would just see Snape as some form of weirdo rather than someone who worked to keep him safe?

All it took was one great fanfic, and my views of the Harry Potter series changed from "meh, it was rather good... but Harry is just a boring Ender" to "there is a helluvalot going on here".
