For a time, all the Harry/Hermione fics I was reading had bent my mind to vilify half the Weasleys, Dumbledore and Snape. It was most obvious when I went to read a Harry-Tonks fic and I was worried that Hermione would never be able to find love without Harry.

[TILT]

Harmonianism is a cult almost as insidious as ... well, some cults who are active enough to attack me if I named them. Think the Illuminati. If you doubt me, ask yourself why Hermione's parents are commonly named Dan and Emma in fanfiction, even in fics with canon pairings.
