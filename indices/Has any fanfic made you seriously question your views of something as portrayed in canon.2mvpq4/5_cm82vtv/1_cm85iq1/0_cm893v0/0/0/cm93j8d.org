Churchill Stalin? Really?

At least be consistent.

And if you think for a second there weren't people named after war heros or people viewed as largely responsible for ending wars, you've got some reading to do. And add on the fact that these were people Harry personally knew and respected, better than almost anyone else (in the sense that Harry knew them better than most), and it makes perfect sense for him to name his kid after them.

And it's not like Albus isn't going to go to school with a bunch of Harry's anyway.

No one's gonna give them shit for being named after war heros his parents personally knew. And the names aren't even weird in wizarding culture, so that's not an issue either.
