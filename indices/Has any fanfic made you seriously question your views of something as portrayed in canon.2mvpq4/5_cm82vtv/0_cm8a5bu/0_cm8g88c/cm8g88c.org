Granger's a pretty common surname in the UK, and there's literally no reason to think that Hermione is the only magical Granger. There are surely other Grangers that have passed through Hogwarts that aren't related to her. (In fact, I believe there was one Slughorn mentioned in /HBP/ that was a famous potionmaster; he asked Hermione if they were related.)

Besides, there's explicit evidence in the books that people don't recognize Muggle-borns by their surname alone. Blood supremacists have to /ask/ people about their parentage to find out. That's what Draco did. That's presumably what Voldemort's followers did in the early days.

The only thing your name gets you is recognition if it's /already/ famous for being linked to a powerful pureblood family (or you're a Weasley). Which is exactly how it works in the real world (e.g., Kennedy, Roosevelt, Windsor, etc.).
