I suppose you could conjecture with so many ADULTS killed in the past war - including killings-for-sport and attacks against halfbloods etc by the Death Eaters - that Hogwarts in Harry's year might be down a few teachers and thus have less teachers than usual; either teachers that have been killed or teachers that have retired and not had a replacement.

Also possibly classes are taught by older students or 'teaching assistants' who don't sit at the teachers' table. That would preserve Rowling's numbers and the canon table. Teaching assistants might even be day staff who'd Floo home for lunch, etc. - and Harry just doesn't mention them because he's not very social and doesn't ask other classes.
