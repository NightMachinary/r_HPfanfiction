  Rowling claimed there were closer to 1k students at Hogwarts.

I don't trust Rowling's numbers, but let's run with it. 40 students in the 1991 sorting, 1000 students total. Draco will primarily be dealing with students in the 1991 sorting, so he would have been drilled on those families. Even if 35 of them were pureblood, he could easily memorize that many families and another ten dozen.

Now let's look at class sizes. 160 students per year before 1991, and most classes are two houses. That's 80 students per class on average -- doable for lectures, but there's a lot of practical work involved. Snape must be relieved to deal with Harry's class; he's barely able to contain the disasters sometimes with only twenty students to worry about. Unless there are really an extra couple dozen instructors and each instructor follows a particular cohort, but now we're getting far into conjecture.
