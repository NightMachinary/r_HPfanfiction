Granger isn't a Muggle surname. It's just a surname.

Is Smith not a Muggle surname because there's a long line of wizarding Smiths?

And I always think it's weird that people think Ginny /wasn't/ totally on board with the names. Why wouldn't she be? She loves Harry and he lost so many people, many of whom she loved or respected in her own right.
