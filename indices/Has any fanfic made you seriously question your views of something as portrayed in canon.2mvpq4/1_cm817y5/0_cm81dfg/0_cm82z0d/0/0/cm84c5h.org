Name me an instance where somebody died because of Dumbledore's actions. Dumbledore believed strongly in the prophecy and therefore acted passively and steered Harry towards a path to defeat Voldemort. Nobody ever directly died because of his actions, maybe only because of his inactions and if we say that is a bad thing, then an overwhelming majority of the wizards should get the same treatment and distrust.

We can also consider another reason why he didn't fight very actively. He was scared of what he would do himself. He didn't trust himself with power after the whole Grindelwald/Ariana business.
