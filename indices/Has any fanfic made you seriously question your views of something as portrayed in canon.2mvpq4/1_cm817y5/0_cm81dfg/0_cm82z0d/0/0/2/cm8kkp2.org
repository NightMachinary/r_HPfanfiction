Sure maybe no one died. But there is gross negligence on his part. Like it was points out. He knew what Lockhart was about.

Also there's no way he didn't know what could turn people into stone. A magical land that has Vampires, Werewolves, and Giants can conceivably not have Madusa. But mixed with the fact that Real World Events happened, it's a basilisk or a medusa.
