I also would distrust Dumbledore, but I will admit at least in some cases I might be looking for things that aren't there simply because there is so much we /don't know/ about the canon universe. Really, this might be the biggest reason that Harry Potter is such a popular setting in fan fiction. Obviously the popularity of the story itself helps, but we essentially have an interesting world with tons of characters and most of it really isn't explored at all. I mean, I think the total information we get about Daphne Greengrass, for example, is that she's a girl in Harry's year, a Slytherin and has a younger sister named Astoria. That's it, but this dearth of information doesn't stop plenty of stories containing for featuring her. Frustrating for one interested in the world, but great for a writer who outside of the given info, has a free character to take in pretty much any direction they want.

To use an example Halloween 1981 and how exactly fidelus charms work. The question I come to is: why did the secret keeper have to be Sirius, Remus or Peter? Why not James or Lily, or in fact Dumbledore himself? At the point where Dumbledore is able to get Hagrid to Godric's Hollow faster than pretty much everyone, it's clear that he at the very least knows the secret (or monitors the location to the point he might as well) The only logical explanation I can come up with is that perhaps the magic would prevent the Secret Keeper from actually residing in the building except Dumbledore himself goes in and out of Grimmauld Place all the time for order meetings. I mean, one could say there might of been improvements to the charm in that time span, but at that point one could imply that /anything/ not specifically happened in order to prove their point. Kind of defeats the purpose of this. Also, one wonders about the protections around Neville Longbottom, penetrated a day later. Surely, as the other child of prophecy, he would be just as heavily protected and just as much a concern for the leader against Voldemort. Yet not only do the fall the next day, but we never hear how "X, the Longbottom secret keeper, betrayed them, just like Sirius betrayed the Potters". Anyway, the way I see it one can look at this one of two ways: 1. a tragic mistake by Dumbledore, with terrible consequences, but ultimately a mistake or 2. a deliberate sacrifice for the greater good, to let Voldemort mark one of the children as an equal. A sacrifice of two folks that, at the very least, nominally worked with/under Dumbledore since they are members of the Order of the Phoenix. Really one could say that about many of Dumbledore's actions but if they are all mistakes, he's not just too incompetent for any of his positions, he's too incompetent for daily function.

Not to be glib, but off the top of my head, there's: not only not checking on a kid, much less the savior of the world, for 10 years but once finding out about his home life, not only not helping fix any issues the boy develops (shit, as much as Harry sees Pomfrey, not one mention of malnutrition or fixing it?), but /sending him back without changes made to the situation/, bringing an item that's perfect Voldemort bait /to a school full of children/ (hell, Nicholas Flamel and his wife are two folks dead due to Dumbledore's action, the only reason they destroy it is that they are afraid Voldemort will get the bait Dumbledore set out), putting what amounts to a carnival ride of defenses in front of it that 11 year olds bypass (hey, lets put a defense that requires a potion to pass through, then give them the potion, and set of instructions to show which one it is!) much less a set of of defenses perfectly fitting one specific group of kids (even including Neville if he happened to come), when confronted with a troll that was found in the dungeon, sending Slytherins to the dungeons and Hufflepuffs to the basement (which presumably isn't far away), putting a dangerous artifact that would fit perfectly in ancient myth, which Dumbledore himself told Harry drove people insane where kids can accidentally drop in on it, and the unlikely, to me, possibility that the vaunted Hogwarts wards or whatever other magical security system Dumbledore has can't detect something as in-canon vile as the malevolent spirit of Voldemort himself or later a horcrux entering the building. And this is just first year.

There are other less terrible oddities like hiring Filch (though really him and Snape should not be around children, or at the very least Snape should teach nothing less than pre-mastery level classes) and having broom closets when Hogwarts employs house elves, his blatant manipulation of the points system, or the things that a Hogwarts education lacks, like a basic math class, a Health/Sex Ed. class, or any physical activity outside of Quidditch (which only a small group participates in and is still a sport would really only work the core and one's dominant arm) [I understand from a story perspective why Rowling might want to avoid say Sex Ed., but a health class that examines biological differences between magicals and non-magicals, or pure-blood/not pure-blood, I'd read that.]

Again, I might be looking for things that aren't there, but this speaks of someone who needs to be in permanent care, not the headmaster of a school, head of Wizengamont, leader of the magical UN (and presumably Britain's representative) and militia group leader into one. Which leads into all those manipulative Dumbledore fics, which gives reasons for is actions, just not light/good ones

/for what it's worth, I'm like ruljinn as far as views of canon being changed by fan fiction\\
//I suppose in answer to all of this that it's only a story, but at the point where we are discussing this on a subreddit dedicated to fiction people write about other fiction, over analyzing is kind of the thing to do
