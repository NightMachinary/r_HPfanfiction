Oh they would! But, that was true /BEFORE/ fan fiction. My mantra would be "trust nothing."

The question was about views that /changed/ after reading fan fics. I only mentioned Dumbledore by name because my distrust of him is /new/.

If I woke up in the Potterverse I'd put Moody to shame in the paranoia department until I settled in and was able to confirm details. About the only person I'd consider trusting in general is Harry... because let's face it, if he's evil then its already game over.
