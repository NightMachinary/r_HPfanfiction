  Name me an instance where somebody died because of Dumbledore's actions.
#+end_quote

Rowling was writing for children. You tend not to kill off characters in a children's story. That said, people did start dying before the end of the series. Since Dumbledore was the first, it's a lot harder to attribute subsequent deaths to him.

#+begin_quote
  Dumbledore believed strongly in the prophecy and therefore acted passively and steered Harry towards a path to defeat Voldemort.
#+end_quote

Dumbledore believed in an interpretation of the prophecy that contradicted the text of the prophecy. "Either must die at the hands of the other" -- one must kill the other, we're not saying which will happen; "neither can live while the other survives" -- that would indicate that Voldemort wouldn't be able to return to his body until Harry died, and that Voldemort's safety would be more secure once Harry was dead.

Dumbledore's version of the prophecy: Voldemort must kill Harry so Voldemort becomes mortal again, and then Harry will kill him. That corresponds with a prophecy that reads "Each must die at the hands of the other, for neither can perish while the other survives." But that would result in Voldemort not trying to kill Harry and instead trying to dose him with the Draught of the Living Death and secure him in some hidden location.

With the real prophecy, Dumbledore should have been protecting Harry by whatever means necessary. Have Alastor Moody train him in magic at some remote location. Maybe the middle of the Himalayas; maybe an underground or underwater lair accessible only by portkey or apparition. As long as Harry was alive, Voldemort couldn't be resurrected. In the meantime, he should be securing all the horcruxes and bringing them to Harry to destroy.

But Dumbledore was an extension of the author's will rather than a sensible character, so his blatant stupidity did not in fact doom everyone but instead made everything come up roses.

  We can also consider another reason why he didn't fight very actively. He was scared of what he would do himself. He didn't trust himself with power after the whole Grindelwald/Ariana business.

Which wasn't enough to stop him from capturing Grindelwald.
