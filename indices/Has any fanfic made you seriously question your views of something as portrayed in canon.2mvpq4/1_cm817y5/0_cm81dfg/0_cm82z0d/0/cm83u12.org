In the context of OP's question: aka changed viewpoints after having read fanfics (OP wanted specific fics but my brain is refusing to respond to requests for fic names atm)

--------------

After having just read the original series:

I wake up in the Potterverse... I'd have immediately booked it to Hogwarts and started rattling off anything and everything I could think of about what was coming to Dumbledore.

--------------

After having read way too many Manipulative!Dumbledore fics:

I'd be worried about waking up the next day obliviated of my future knowledge.

Ironically I'm self aware enough to recognize that I'd probably end up playing my cards very close to my chest, committing all the sins I'd accuse Dumbledore of committing regarding secrecy until I felt much more confident that I wasn't in a fanon universe.

--------------

Even in canon tho, in retrospect he had a variety of conflicts of interest between being headmaster and being the leader against Voldemort. Even still... my comment was meant to be less about blaming Dumbledore and more about not wanting to be one of the pieces sacrificed in the name of defeating Tom.
