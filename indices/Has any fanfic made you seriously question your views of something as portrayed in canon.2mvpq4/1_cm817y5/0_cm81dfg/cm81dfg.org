Yeah... if I ever woke up in the Potterverse... I would avoid Dumbledore like the plague. Merlin forbid I wake up in the body of someone important.

He may or may not be a good guy trying his best... but his actions and results make me +paranoid+ twitchy. I would not trust him to keep me or mine safe. Sure, his grand plan for stopping Voldemort worked... But the collateral damage was ... obscene.
