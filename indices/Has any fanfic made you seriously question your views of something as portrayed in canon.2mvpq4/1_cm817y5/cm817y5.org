Fanfiction was what made me really start looking deeper into Dumbledore's character and actions (or inaction). It gave a new perspective on canon, and though you have to keep fan works separate, simply looking at canon from a different angle or point of view gives a really different reality than what's painted in the books. I used to respect his character, now I hate his character. I can respect some of the beliefs and some of the actions credited to him, but not the character.
