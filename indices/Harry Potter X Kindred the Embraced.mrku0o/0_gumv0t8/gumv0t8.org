Sadly, I've never seen much in the way of vampire Harry story that didn't turn into either slash or harem porn.

We don't really know much about vampires in Harry Potter, so the author could make them anything they wanted. We see Sanguini once at Slughorn's party, but that's about it.

Taking ideas from VtM would be cool, though I wouldn't grab the WoD wholesale. I'd more steal the idea of clans of vampires tied by blood, myself.
