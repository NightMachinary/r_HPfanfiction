While I found the site usable for finding content, from an author's perspective it is like shoving bamboo under your fingernails to get any fics uploaded. Also, most of the new stories are ultra-dry, canon re-roofing gen fics or "extra scene from the movies" style romances.

I just gave up trying to use it after the third different procedural problem had a chapter once again rejected for upload, a process which must be done on a per-chapter basis by one of their human staff and can takes weeks. They seem to have the attitude that they are doing you a favor by hosting your fic, not the other way around, which is the actual situation as you are the person making content from which they make ad money.

I have a problem with their attitude, if that isn't clear.

Maybe one-shot authors can handle that, but it was too frustrating for me so I just kept using FFN and AO3 instead. The monstrous bureaucratic process might discourage some casual writers who don't enjoy that sort of thing, and I don't personally like the sorts of authors who seem to thrive in the environment, but maybe someone put something interesting up a while back and it is just buried in the bland muck.
