That's the thing. I couldn't have cared less about "playing in their sandbox." I just wanted to get the fic out there on multiple sites so I could get more feedback on my writing style from readers. Oddly enough, FFN is the /only/ site that has given me that. All the others, people simply read quietly and don't review.

It was when the admins started saying I needed full legal citations for use of the word "Terminator" in a chapter that I couldn't deal with their bullshit any further. So I didn't, because there are a /ton/ of other, better sites out there. Which is why their attitude amazes me. Their process sucked and there was no upside.
