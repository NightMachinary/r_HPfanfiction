Hey, to each their own. If you want to play in somebody else's sandbox, you have to follow their rules. Just my own opinion, but I don't mind wading through a few cookie cutter teen-angst-premarital-pregnancy-true-love-forever fics to avoid seeing the brain-scarring Snape-Harry slash fics on FF.net. As far as posting stories, I've posted 11 in the two years I've been part of the site, including a 41-chapter novel. If you take the time to read and understand the rules, it's not really so bad.
