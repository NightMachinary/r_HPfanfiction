Just curious, but does canon ever explain exactly how closely related they are? Fandom is full of "purebloods are all inbred!" comments, but I don't recall an example of extreme inbreeding. Genetically, your 5th cousin is not related enough to actually matter, and then it becomes more of a social issue. Do the books give any examples of first or second cousins marrying?
