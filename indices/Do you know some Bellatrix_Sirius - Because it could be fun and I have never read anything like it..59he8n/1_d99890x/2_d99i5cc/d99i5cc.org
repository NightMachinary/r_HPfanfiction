Sirius' parents were second cousins.

It's from the Black family tapestry that was drawn up by J.K. Rowling and auctioned off for charity in early 2006. This family tree only went back to Phineas Nigellus and his siblings, but I think a tapestry used in the OOTP movie dated back a couple more generations. If the website I'm looking at now is correct (I can't be bothered to dig OOTP out of my attic to double check), Kreacher mentioned in chapter 6 of OOTP that the tapestry had been in the family for seven centuries.

[[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/other-canon/bft/][Info]] on the tapestry that was auctioned off.

I believe that this [[http://img11.deviantart.net/7400/i/2013/078/8/b/the_noble_house_of_black_family_tree_by_melanie12271994-d5hgu9j.jpg][drawing]] has the names of the generations before Phineas Nigellus that were used in the movies, but it incorporates fanon into other parts of the family tree. The fanon being Charlus Potter and Dorea Black as Harry's grandparents and assuming (unless something was released that I missed) that Barty Crouch Sr. and Jr. are descendant from Charis Black and Caspar Crouch. I believe, but I'm not positive, that Callidora Black and Harfang Longbottom are Neville's ancestors, but according the the first tapestry they had a daughter as well as a son, this family tree doesn't include a daughter. Same issue with the Crouches, the first tapestry mentions 2 daughters.
