They're cousins over Walburga Black (nee Black), who married Orion Black and birthed Sirius and Regulus. Walburga was a sister to Cygnus Black, who married Druella Rosier and had the 3 Black sisters Bellatrix, Andromeda and Narcissa, as daughters.

Its especially weird as Orion Black is also second cousin to Cygnus Black and Walburga. And even though second cousins are technically legal in a lot of places, its not advisable to marry that close to family.
