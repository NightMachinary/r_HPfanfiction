I thought so. I remember Sirius showing Harry the tapestry and mentioning that all the pureblood families are vaguely related, and maybe a mention that Sirius and the Potters were distantly related by Harry's grandmother or something.

I suppose it's one of those instances where the fandom got hold of a trope and blew it out of proportion.
