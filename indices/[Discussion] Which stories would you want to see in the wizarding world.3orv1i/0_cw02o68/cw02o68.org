The little things would be cool! That does sound like a great opportunity to explore the small things that don't add up to a big story. A home-witch canning and gardening. Shopping in Honeydukes. Going for a yearly check up at the family Healer. Working in cauldron bottom quality control. Negotiating the possibilities of sanctioned flying carpets.
