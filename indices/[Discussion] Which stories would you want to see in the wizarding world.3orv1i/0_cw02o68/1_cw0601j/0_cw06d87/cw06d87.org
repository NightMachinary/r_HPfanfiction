Ooh, that's a good one!

Or applying for Schedule 3 potions ingredients. The office is always so busy and they only have one person working it. The wait is dreadful. Did you hear So-and-so got denied because their paperwork was filed wrong? I heard someone else was bribing the clerk with Honeydukes. And then they closed an hour early while I was still waiting! I should file a complaint. I still haven't gotten approval for pimlump pods for my Kneazle acne potion. It's not like /I'm/ going to dry them and sprinkle it into my afternoon tea; I've never been a fan of psychedelics. Kids these days. Blah blah blah.
