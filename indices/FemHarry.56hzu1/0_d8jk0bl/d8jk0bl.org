AU in which Harriet Potter is a half blood aspiring potioneer raised by her parents who wants to go to a pureblood-only Hogwarts at any cost. So she switches schools with her pureblood cousin Archie Black and takes on his identity. Fantastic worldbuilding and snarky characters with great plots. On fourth year by now. Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter)

Two oneshots covering 7 years at Hogwarts as experienced by a fem!Harry, the first oneshots a cisgender Harry and the second one a transgender Harry. The second one is better imho. Linkao3(the girl who lived by dirgewithoutmusic) and linkao3(the girl who lived (again) by dirgewithoutmusic)

Linkao3(charlotte the great and powerful by evandar) Oneshot covering 7 years of Hogwarts with a Slytherin fem!Harry.

Ongoing story about an immortal fem!Harry who was thrown back in time 5000 years after defeating Voldemort in seventh year and who lived through the millennia until the present day again. It starts after Voldemort was defeated so the entire story is totally original and there are plenty of flashbacks to what Jasmine (fem!Harry) has been up to throughout the centuries. Linkffn(A Long Journey Home by rakeesh)

Forty year old Iris Potter sends herself back in time after the world doesn't get better after Voldemort's defeat and decides to use the Black family to prevent the second wizarding war. Unfortunately she's hampered by being 5 years old. On hiatus since May. Linkffn(Potter vs paradox by belial666)

Those are the fem!Harry standouts imho.

There's also a fem!Harry/Regulus Black oneshot in which Harry rescues Regulus and they destroy Horcruxes together linkffn(flecks of rust by tsume yuki) and that author has a lot of romantic (but OOC imho) fem!Harry stories.
