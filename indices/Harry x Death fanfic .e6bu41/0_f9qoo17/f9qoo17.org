Immortal!Death!Harry gets summoned to an alternate world where his still-very-much-mortal self has yet to defeat Voldemort. They immediately develop a "relationship" based on the fact that Alive!Harry is the only one Death!Harry can actually touch without instantly killing them, and their relationship consists of - /gasp/ - hugs and hand-holding.
