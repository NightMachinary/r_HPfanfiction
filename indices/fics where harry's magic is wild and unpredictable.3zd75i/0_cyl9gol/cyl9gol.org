Well, I know there's a fic where Harry is an Elemental Mage; his magic literally has a mind of its own and is very possessive of him. Like, possessive to the point where it steals the air from Fleur's lungs when she flirts with him.

I'm not having any luck finding it though. As you might guess, it's a GoF fic. Pretty sure I read it on FFN...
