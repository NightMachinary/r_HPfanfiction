On the one hand, I kind of want to read more; but on the other hand, the value in this type of work is not the storyline but the concept and the style. Also, my mental image of Draco's attack: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTurxJVXdMc]] . (It probably sounded less funny and more poignant in the original Chinese.)

It inspired [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-potter-ideas-discussion-and-recs-thread-ten-a-surprise-you-be-sure-not-to-miss.636976/post-61510534][a plot bunny for me]], since the Standard Xianxia Protagonist that is Harry in this fic is uninteresting and unsympathetic, but a wannabe revolutionary would actually create meaningful conflict. No plans to write it, though.
