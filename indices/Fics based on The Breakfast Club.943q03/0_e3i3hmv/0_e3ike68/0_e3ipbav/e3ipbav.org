I mean I can't get the idea of Sirius as John(Judd Nelson) out of my head. Other than that, I don't have a great idea for the rest. Maybe one of the fandoms favorite Slytherin girls as Claire, pampered princess but with lots of pressure on them. Luna as Allison with the outcast vibe and maybe you could tie the creatures she talks about into habitual lying. Hermione as Brian with how she tends to freak out about getting a bad grade. Krum or Cedric as Andrew? Krums the only semi-major character in the books that's well and truly centered around Quidditch while Amos Diggery's "my son beat Harry Potter, that's something to tell the grandkids," has more of the parental theme from the movie. Other than Sirius as John, none of those other options feel completely right to me.
