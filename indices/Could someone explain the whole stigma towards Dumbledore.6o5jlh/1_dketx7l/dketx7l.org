Someone did it once, and then other people thought it was clever, and it caught on, and is now unfortunately a trope. Also bashing in general is a thing people like doing for some reason for characters they didn't like. I hate Dumbledore bashing, and bashing in general, I've almost never seen a fic where it adds anything. It almost always detracts and makes a fic worse.
