Well there were beatings (or at least: attempted beatings) and threats of violence (one scene in canon describes Petunia trying to hit Harry with a fucking frying pan!)!

I know that the fanon at large ignores this, but I simply can't

Also: Wasn't Dumbledore talking about knowing that he subjected Harry to "ten dark and difficult years"? (so he more or less admits that he knew but didn't fucking care, so he's an accomplice to child-abuse and should be tossed into Azkaban!)
