For me, it's that coming up with a justification for every decision he is seen to make in canon is very, very easy if you assume he's evil. You can also assume that he's stupid, senile, or good. For many of us, assuming that he is good /and/ wise tends to lead to having to scrape up some information from somewhere that didn't come up in canon, to justify several decisions made in the books.

Of course, many find the in-canon justifications to be ample in themselves, and find writing a good Dumbledore easy. For those of us who vehemently disagree with his in-canon reasoning, however, we are left with a range of responses, from adding in extra non-canon information that resolves the conflict with our own moralities, to deciding it was all a super-genius but utterly evil plan.

The whole 'we are betrayed because Dumbledore wasn't perfect and therefore we will exaggerate his evil' does /not/ cover all of us. Many of us we banging our heads on the desk long before the whole revelation of his past in the later books.

Examples of decisions that lead to conflict with reader morality:

Leaving Harry with the Dursleys for ten years, with a spy in place, and never acting to rein in the child abuse. What Harry went through /in canon/ is considered severe child abuse and/or neglect in many countries, very much so in the UK. The difference in clothing, treatment, accomodation between Harry and Dudley would raise questions in all reasonable adults here. In the UK specificially, keeping a child downstairs at all, let alone in a cupboard, is completely illegal. Was Dumbledore right? Misinformed? Neglectful? Utterly callous? All of these are possible interpretations of the situation /as presented/. There needs be no beating by adults nor prolonged starvation prior to Harry's first year at Hogwarts, for him to be a very severely abused and neglected child, by UK moral standards. 'Dumbledore is evil' needs no extra justification in a fanfiction. 'Dumbledore is good' may take some explaining.

Being the Chief Wizengamot and never bringing Sirius Black to legal trial. This can easily explained away by adding non-canon information. It can also be accepted that there's something we don't know. The in-canon explanation may be sufficient. Or we can come up with justifications that explain the circumstances without adding non-canon information, but don't fit Dumbledore being a good person.For example, it is plausible than an evil Dumbledore would have wanted Harry's godfather out of the way in order to keep Harry isolated. Back before the last two books came out, this very circumstance was avidly discussed. It doesn't need knowledge that Harry had to be willing to suicide himself, to wonder /why/ Dumbledore didn't step in to save Black by using his political power.

There are many, many other points in canon that lead to speculation of this sort, including Dumbledore's conduct as a headmaster in every book right from the first. And in all explorations, 'Dumbledore is evil' offers itself as a nice, tempting, easy write. Some of us find 'Dumbledore is good, but flawed' rather more difficult, right from the very first book. We don't feel betrayed; we've always disagreed with Harry's interpretation of Dumbledore as a good, wise man.
