I like the last sentence as it creates so many questions for us to ask. These points make sense and Harry's sentence is not only questionable but downright wretched.

So, to paraphrase, Dumbledore has made so many choices that show he's flawed and the readers don't like the fact that he's being shown as this heavenly angel coming from a rainbow being excreted by a Unicorn. They've drawn their own parallels, come to their own conclusions, and don't like Harry's portrayal of the man.

A completely 'good' or 'bad' representation of Dumbledore is the 'easy' way to approach the man when writing, but a flawed man is harder yet more realistic.

People tend to portray him as one or the other because of the fact that they simply look at evidence supporting their side but are unwilling to merge the evidence to create this man who is flawed.

Did I get it right? Also, the words in quotes or apostrophes are subjective.
