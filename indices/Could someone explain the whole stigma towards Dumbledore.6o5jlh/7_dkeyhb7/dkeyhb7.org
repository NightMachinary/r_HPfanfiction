Basically he's a person in a position of power - multiple ones, even - and yet he seems to be nigh completely ineffective. A school's first responsibility is the safety of its students. This was disregarded multiple times. A government's first responsibility is to the people. Dumbledore was seemingly ineffective in his capacity as Chief Warlock and Supreme Mugwump, both in keeping Death Eaters imprisoned and the otherwise terrible state of post-Voldemort Britain. Finally, a person's first responsibility is toward those in their care. While it was not completely unreasonable for Dumbledore to think that Harry would be treated well by and Aunt and Uncle /who were forced, without their consent,/ into raising him, it was disgustingly irresponsible to not do follow up visits to ensure that he was, in fact, being treated well. Thinking it would be enough to have Arabella Figg watching from afar is incredibly naive, because neighbors see exactly jack shit of what goes on inside a household. And let's not even get into his habit of holding his cards close to his chest all the time.

Basically, Dumbledore tried and failed to juggle a dozen balls, and they all came crashing down all at once. He overextended himself, tried to be the Duct Tape holding Wizarding Britain together and ended up just being Scotch* Tape that fell apart as soon as force was applied.

Hanlon's Razor states "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity", but people don't think stupidity is very compelling when it comes to plot.
