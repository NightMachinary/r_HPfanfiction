Oh I'm not saying he should automatically be forgiven. I just don't think he is evil. If you disagree with his actions, that's fine, but I just want those people to at least acknowledge that he had good intentions. It only bugs me when I see people going on about how Dumbledore is "pure evil" and that he orchestrated all these events in Harry's life because he wanted to see him suffer or some other BS like that. He may have orchestrated some of the bad things in Harry's life but it wasn't because he got his kicks from it, it was a tough decision he made because he thought it was the only way. Whether it's true or not that it was the only way is up for debate but that's not what I'm talking about.

I know some people like to write Evil!Dumbledore in fanficiton, and thats fine. Fanfiction is in it's essence an AU where you can do whatever you want. Even I, who is usually a fan of Dumbledore, have read and been amused by Evil!Dumbledore stories, but it's when some "fans" than insist that those kind of ridiculous interpretations are actually reflections of his canon personality, that's what annoys me.
