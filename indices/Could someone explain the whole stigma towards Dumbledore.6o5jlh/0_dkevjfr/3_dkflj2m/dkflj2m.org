  Dumbledore made a lot of mistakes in his life but he was not evil.

So all his mistakes and the decisions that compounded those mistakes should be forgiven because he cared for society and didn't mean it?

The whole problem with Dumbledore is comes down to a relative moral debate. "Do the ends justify the means and do these specific ends justify these means?" That's for the audience to decide for themselves.

Personally, I don't think Dumbledore is Evil, but neither would I listen to his plans after knowing what he did in canon. He's seen as infallible by the good characters and ends up sending them through the meat grinder.
