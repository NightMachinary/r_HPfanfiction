I understand that argument. It is a very questionable decision but I think was done by JK as a stylist choice. I think it was supposed to be a reflection of fairytails and other folklore where babies were delivered to the front step. Its like the whole myth about babies being delivered to the front door by storks. That's the impression I got out of it. In a way I think it was chosen to reaffirm the idea that his Aunt and Uncle didn't choose to take him in.

I'm not defending Dumbledore's action here either, but you have to think of this from a wizarding angle too. It may not be as big a deal to them in this situation. He could put protections around Harry so he'd be fine until his relatives found him. Charms to keep him warm, etc... Like I said I'm not defending what Dumbledore did, but I try to remember that the wizarding world is essentially a different culture with different morals and POV based on the ability to use magic.
