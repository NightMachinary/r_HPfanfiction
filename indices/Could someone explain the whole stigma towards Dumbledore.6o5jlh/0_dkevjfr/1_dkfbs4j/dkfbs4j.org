That may be true, but I promise, some of us have been questioning Dumbledore's goodness right from the moment that he decided to put a sleeping baby on a doorstep with a note, at the beginning of November, and just walk off and leave him there. Some of us have always thought that he should have stayed and done the handover in person, and that a /good/ person would not do as he did.

I don't argue that this is incompatible with his being a very good person with very severe flaws, but it is an in-canon action that needs no reinterpretation to make someone think that if he's evil, rather than merely utterly blind to basic humanity and child welfare, it might be an interesting direction to write in and, for some of us, rather easier than trying to justify his actions.
