I think it's a lot of fans thought of him as this paragon if goodness in the series, sort of like Harry did, and then when it turned out he wasn't perfect, they felt betrayed, like Harry did at first. The difference is these "fans" can't seem to get over it and started writing fanfiction where all they do is exaggerate his bad traits. These same people often can't seen to realize that things aren't just black and white and there shades of grey instead.

Dumbledore made a lot of mistakes in his life but he was not evil. He never set out wanting cause Harry or anyone for that matter, harm. He cared deeply for society as a whole. Yes he was manipulative. Yes he liked to keep secrets to himself. Yes he did cause Harry pain by mistakes he made but in the end he worked tirelessly to save society as a whole and even found a possible way for Harry to survive when all hope seemed lost.
