Can't let go? That guy stashes Harry away from his world (protection is a crappy reason, a fidelius (as long as there's no traitor and it's not like Dumbledore himself can't be Harry's secret-keeper!) is just as good as that blood-protection for most things and without any love lost between Petunia and Harry it's probably a wounder the blood protection even worked after all those years (magic in HP is based on INTENT after all and Petunia didn't intend to keep Harry save and Harry didn't really think much of her either, hell he didn't consider Number 4 his home either - no! Hogwarts was his home!)), keeps him ignorant and doesn't even check up on him (why wasn't child-services (wizard equivalent of course!) involved? Who gave that old geezer the right to just do this?)...so he kind of IS a manipulative old goat!

He might not be a dark lord (that's debatable, he is still kind of hung up on his "for the greater good" philosophy, even if he doesn't use Grindelwald's or Voldemort's methods to achieve his ends anymore after Ariana died in that three way duel!), but he's still a chess master who isn't above sacrificing his pieces (Harry for example...he never even tried to remove the horcrux, no he set Harry up (in a convoluted plan that could have backfired, which would have ended Harry's life for good!) to die and he wasn't that remorseful IMHO! It also looks like he never actively tried to kill Voldemort (sure it would have only lead to the guy returning as a spirit, but that would have delayed his plans for conquest enough so that they would have had time to deal with his soul-jars!))

Yes he did set out to cause Harry pain (dying isn't painless in most cases and Voldemort loves to torture his victims, so sending him to fight Voldemort he caused Harry pain!), he might not have enjoyed doing it, but he wasn't all torn up about it either!
