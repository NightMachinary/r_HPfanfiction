Thanks. It makes sense, what with the fact that in those stories it's always Black and White (photons, yes, I know, but who cares). White are people with Harry and Black are people against. I would venture out to say that these people lack a form of maturity, perception, common sense, or just an understanding of the world, but then I'd probably receive backlash for saying that.
