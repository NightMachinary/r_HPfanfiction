Teen rage in reaction to the already mentioned issues and the complete inability to write or perceive flawed characters. You see it with Dumbledore, you see it with Snape, you see it with Ron... or any character who doesn't make Harry their number one priority in life, who doesn't make decisions that Harry is immediately happy with and who may have a different opinion to Harry.
