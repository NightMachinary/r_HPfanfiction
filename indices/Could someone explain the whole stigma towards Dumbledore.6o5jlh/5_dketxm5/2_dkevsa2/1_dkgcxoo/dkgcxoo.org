Dumbledore ignores any laws he wants. James and Lily made it clear that Harry should go to Sirius, and if he couldn't take him Remus (and then Peter, but he was just as unable to take him as Sirius was). Remus never got the chance to take care of Harry. Dumbledore made the executive decision to send Harry to the Dursleys. On top of that, laws or not, abuse is abuse.

Also, even with the allowance I made in my original post about the time between infancy to 11, when Harry went off to Hogwarts, he still purposely had Mrs. Fig keeping an eye on him. She would tell him the absolute truth that the Dursleys mistreated him. But, ignoring that, once Harry became a student at Hogwarts, as a Headmaster, Dumbledore is responsible for him in a number of ways. There's no way that he didn't know about the abuse then and elected to continue sending him back to his abusive guardians.
