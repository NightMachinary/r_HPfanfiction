Yes Harry was supposed to go to Sirius in the event of his death but where was it ever stated that he as supposed to go to Remus and then Peter after. That was never stated in canon and is more of a common fanfiction trope than anything.

The Dursleys were paranoid about appearing normal to their neighbours. How would Ms Figg really know if he was abused or not. From what we can tell he was not regularly physically abused as to where it would leave visible marks.

Harry never spoke about his relatives to really anyone. How would Dumbledore know to want extent they went with him. He already knew they would be overly loving but without the blood wards Dumbledore thought Harry would most likely be murdered. I'm not saying Dumbledore made the right choice here but I don't think it's as black and white as it may seem.
