If you go simply by the books, nothing is stated at all except that Sirius is his godfather and that Harry inherited from him.\\
If you accept the films as canon, there are Dorea Black and Charlus Potter in the Black family tree, which make it tempting to cast those as James' parents.

If you accept Pottermore, his parents are stated to be Euphemia and Fleamont and Charlus Potter/Dorea Black are apparently not related to him at all.
