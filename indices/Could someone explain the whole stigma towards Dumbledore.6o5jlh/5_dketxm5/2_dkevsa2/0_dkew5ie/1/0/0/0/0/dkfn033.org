Oh, I thought you had some new canon information or something. The fact that Charlus Potter is just listed and linked to only one name makes it inconclusive. Hell even the wiki on him says: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Charlus_Potter][It is unlikely that Charlus comes from the same branch of Potters as Henry Potter -- Henry Potter's speaking out in the Wizengamot was why the family were cut off the Sacred Twenty-Eight as it was believed they were related to Muggles; if Charlus came from the same branch, he would be considered a blood traitor and Dorea would have been disowned.]] /shrug
