Sirius didn't get a trial...I think. So that was something that would've prevented any of his rights being taken from him. Especially because they wanted to do it quickly and illegally because corruption, so such an event would be dealt hastily I guess.

To be honest, if Dukbeldoe hadn't told Hagrid to take Harry away, then Sirius would probably be free. As for the abusive home thing, I personally like to say /no/ because a child is being traumatized for the entirety of his childhood, affecting his personality, ideals, etc. The effects were downplayed in a book intended for children, but still. It was a hard decision made with good intentions, but it's still deplorable. If Harry were to go to his next kin then he could be taken in by the Malfoys or the Tonks because I doubt a pureblood run government would want to send their children to the filthy Muggles.

It was his responsibility because he not only knew Harry was the key to killing the Dark Lord (yes, I'm showing my master respect), but he was responsible for Harry's upbringing with the Dursleys. What if the frying pan connected in book two? He'd be dead. The Ministey doesn't even /know/ about Harry and the Dursleys. If so, they'd have placed Aurors or government officials would be watching the house. When Harry comes to the Wizarding community, they are floored by his appearance.
