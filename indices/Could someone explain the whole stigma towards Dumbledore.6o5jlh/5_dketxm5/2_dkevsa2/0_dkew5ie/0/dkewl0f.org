We don't know this for sure, since we never got to see inside Dumbledore's head, but I think that part all goes back to the blood wards. He knew they would keep Harry safe from Death Eaters pretty much without fail.

I know he said that he knew Harry would have dark years at the Dursleys, and I always took that at as meaning that he knew they wouldn't have been the most loving of families but I don't think he knew they would be abusive. He did set Mrs Figg there to watch him but as we know the Dursleys were sure to give off a good front in front of the neighbours.
