I understand how people get upset about the abusive home thing, even I get upset about that, but aren't we being a bit hard on Dumbledore for this? We don't know all the laws if the magical world but did Dumbledore really have a choice in what he did? Sirius had been arrested and thus couldnt take Harry so wouldn't the law state he goes to his next if kin. Dumbledore can't just change that can he? Plus how was it any of his responsibility to check on him growing up? That should be the Ministry's job.

I don't know if any of this is true but it's where my theories tend to lead about the whole affair.
