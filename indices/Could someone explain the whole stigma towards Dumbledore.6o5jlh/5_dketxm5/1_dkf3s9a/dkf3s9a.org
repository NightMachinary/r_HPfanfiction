  There is never a good reason to leave a child in an abusive home. Ever.

Dumbledore states in OotP that he had good reason to believe that if Harry had been placed literally anywhere else, he would have been killed. We have no reason to doubt Dumbledore's explanation. He knows far more about the capabilities of magic and the realities of the political situation than we as readers with limited info ever can.

So do you maintain your position that a dead child is better than an abused one?
