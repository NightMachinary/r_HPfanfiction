Alright. Lets assume he would have died outside of the protection of the blood magic around the Dursleys (specifically Petunia, but it would be a interesting fic idea to include Dudley in that) and couldn't remain at Hogwarts over the summer under McGonagal or Hagrid's care, and that's why he send Harry back after years 1-4. After Sirius regains control over Grimmauld Place, a location completely under fidelius charm, there is no way people who want to kill him can get to him. Even after Sirius dies, there's no reason not to use that perfectly hidden location. But, nope, let's send him back to be abused for two more summers. That's okay.
