  Dumbledore states in OotP that he had good reason to believe that if Harry had been placed literally anywhere else, he would have been killed.

This could mean two things to me.

1. Dumbledore is in fact an evil son of a bitch.

2. Dumbledore is, in a subtle way, stating he isn't infallible, despite his statements during other scenes in the books/movies that are contradictory to such a statement.
