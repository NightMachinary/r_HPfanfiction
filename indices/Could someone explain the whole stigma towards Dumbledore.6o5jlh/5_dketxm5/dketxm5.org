I can't speak for the over exaggerations of evil, but in actual canon, he left Harry in an extremely abusive situation. Even if he didn't know anything about how he was treat from the moment he left Harry on the doorstep to when he came to Hogwarts at 11, there was no skirting around the fact after he came to Hogwarts and it became very apparent abuse happened.

There is never a good reason to leave a child in an abusive home. Ever. I wouldn't exactly call that evil, but it is not "mostly good". It's a horrible thing, justified with the "greater good" even if he never actually said the words.

If you want to ignore the abusive home thing, in canon, the reason he turned down the position of Minister of Magic is because he had a strong desire for power and he knew it wouldn't be positive. His willpower to stay away from real power also fails in canon when he put on the Gaunt Ring, putting his life in danger. While most of the time Evil!Dumbledore is usually written poorly, but I can see how a writer would try to focus on things like his lust for power and the failings in his willpower.
