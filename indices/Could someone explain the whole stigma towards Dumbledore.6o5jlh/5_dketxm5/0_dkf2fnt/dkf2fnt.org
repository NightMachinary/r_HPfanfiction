So, one major reason that this is the case is that the series suffers from a drastic genre shift after the third book.

The whole "left on a doorstep in November" and "baited challenges solved by three first years" things (amont others) are totally reasonable in the context of a fairy tale-esque story, which is what the first book aims for. However, it's when the tone shifts in the later book to more serious young adult fiction that those earlier actions end up at odds with the bigger emphasis on consistency and characterization.

Sure, at the end of the day, the Watsonian reasons don't matter, but I think it helps to realize why certain things are as they are.
