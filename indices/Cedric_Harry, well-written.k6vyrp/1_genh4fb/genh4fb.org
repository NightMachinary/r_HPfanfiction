Would you be interested in an ongoing fic? I'm currently subscribed to one called Stay Alive for now. It's very slow but also very well written. Basically without spoiling too much it's an au where Cedric doesn't die in the cemetery and it kind of follows the fifth book but with Cedric still there.
