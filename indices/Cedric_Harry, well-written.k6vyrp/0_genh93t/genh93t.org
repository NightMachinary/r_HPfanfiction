[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14016627]] - This one is freaking funny! It starts after the quidich match in 3rd year where Harry gets attacked by dementors.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22953583]] - This one is a bit different. Harry falls in the Veil at the Ministry during the fight in the fifth book, he goes to a different universe as that Harry's sister.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8517286]] - In this one Harry has a crush on Cedric, it's not finished yet, but the author said it was going to be pre-slash
