I was hesitating to read this fic because I thought Lockhart was still as blunderingly bumblingly braggadociously blindingly bad at stuff as in canon, which I thought would either make part of the story kind of hand-wavey or just be depressing in regards to how Harry was raised. But with this comment I think I'll just read it.
