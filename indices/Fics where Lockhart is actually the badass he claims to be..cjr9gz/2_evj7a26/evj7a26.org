Battles with Basilisks is pretty fun. It's a one-shot alternate ending to COS, starting when Harry and Ron go to Lockhart to get him to help rescue Ginny. I love how the author manages to turn Lockhart genuinely brave and competent, and STILL keeps him perfectly in character. Plus, Harry and Ron get added snark.
