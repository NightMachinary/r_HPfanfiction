Um, Harry gets adopted by Loki from Marvel, starts investigating magic and what it can do, decides eventually that wizards can't stay on earth because muggles/SHIELD are too dangerous, terraforms a planet with the help of every magical country.

Oh and environmental clean up

It's a really good series after the first 8 chapters
