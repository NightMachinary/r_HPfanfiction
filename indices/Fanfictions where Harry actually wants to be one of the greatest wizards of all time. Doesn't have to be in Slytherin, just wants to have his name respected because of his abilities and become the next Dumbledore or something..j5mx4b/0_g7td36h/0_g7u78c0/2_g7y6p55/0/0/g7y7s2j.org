I dunno, I feel like if you as an 11 year old new to the magical world were told "this kid is literally the chosen one and the entire fate of the world rests on his shoulders, also he will one day defeat the man who killed/tortured into insanity your parents, and if not for a quirk of fate his burden could have been yours" by the most respected and wise and morally upstanding wizard you've met yet (according to everyone around you at least), who is also your Headmaster, and then he said "hey, this heirloom you never knew existed, that you don't really have too much need for besides using it for fun might be the difference between the BWL dying or saving the world, can he borrow it for a little bit?" Then it isn't unreasonable you might say yes, if only out of social pressure/a desire to do the right thing. Especially if you're a heroic or self-sacrificing person yourself, which Harry may still be even without the BWL thing since he was already like that by the time he reached Hogwarts and learned about his BWL status.
