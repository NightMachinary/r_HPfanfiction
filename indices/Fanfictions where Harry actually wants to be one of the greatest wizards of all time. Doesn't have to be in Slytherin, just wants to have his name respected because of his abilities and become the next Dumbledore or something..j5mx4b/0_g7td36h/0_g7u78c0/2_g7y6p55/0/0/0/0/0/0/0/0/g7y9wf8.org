Perhaps, but I'm not sure you can blame the cloak for Harry's lack of motivation and general distraction - Ron, the various Voldemort plots, his fame and infamy at various points, and just the fact he never really developed any particular academic or career focus (likely because with the Dursleys, he never got praise or encouragement for good work so never bothered to do more than avoid getting in trouble) cover that, I think.
