Yeah, I can see that, but to an extent everything is kinda a crutch, in that if you remove anything that Harry uses or benefits from, he'd have to improve or develop to deal with the loss.

Remove the cloak, and Harry has to think or magic his way around situations where he previously relied on the cloak.

Remove Hermione, and Harry has to think or magic his way around situations where he previously relied on Hermione.

Overall, it's still better for him to have the crutch and succeed as a mediocre wizard, than not have it and be forced to work harder and risk failure more.

Better for us as readers, or better for the wizarding world long term, maybe not, but better for Harry.
