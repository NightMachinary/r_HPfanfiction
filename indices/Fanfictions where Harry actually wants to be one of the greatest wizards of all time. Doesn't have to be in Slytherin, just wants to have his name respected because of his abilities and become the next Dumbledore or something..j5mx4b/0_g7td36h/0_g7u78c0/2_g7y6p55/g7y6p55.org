The idea itself doesn't bother me, but it would need a proper explanation - namely a manipulative enough Dumbledore to prioritise Neville's need over Harry's inheritance, and an acknowledgement of that logic in story. Or potentially Dumbledore asking Harry's permission to retain the cloak and lend it to Neville beforehand - which I can see Harry accepting given that Neville is the BWL.
