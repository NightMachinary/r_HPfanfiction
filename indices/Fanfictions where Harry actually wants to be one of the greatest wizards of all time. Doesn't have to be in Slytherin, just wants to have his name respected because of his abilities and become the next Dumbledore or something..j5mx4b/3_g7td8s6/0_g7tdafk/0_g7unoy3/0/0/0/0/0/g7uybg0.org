ooooh, Yeah sorry to disappoint on that end but Harry is straight in this one. I started the fic as a little bit of wish fulfillment for some of the plot bunnies ive had floating around forever(My reference sheet is like 5 pages long of one lines of plot that are going to be added to the story eventually),though I know its a long task, but im planning on writing all 7 books, and well relationships change a lot over that. Maybe in another story he will be Bi, but not this one unfortunately
