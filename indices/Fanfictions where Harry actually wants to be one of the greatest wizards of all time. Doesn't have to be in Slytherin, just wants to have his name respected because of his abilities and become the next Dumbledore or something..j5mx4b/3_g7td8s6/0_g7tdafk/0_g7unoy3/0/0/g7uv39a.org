I'm not huge on romance, sex, and smut in my books. I'm asexual. But I always /always/ consider my characters' sexualities Mostly because I value diversity. Trans characters. Gender fluid characters. Gender flux characters. Asexual characters. Demisexual characters. Black characters. Biracial characters.\\
You name it, I've got it.\\
Romance isn't important, I can be bi but that doesn't mean I have to have a relationship. Though I really do crave cuddles...asexuality described in one sentence there. â€˜I really do crave cuddles'.
