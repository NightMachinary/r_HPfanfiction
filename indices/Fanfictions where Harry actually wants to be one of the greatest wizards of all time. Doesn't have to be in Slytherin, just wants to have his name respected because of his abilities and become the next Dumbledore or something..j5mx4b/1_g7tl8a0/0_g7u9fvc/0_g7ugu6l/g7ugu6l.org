Yeah. Mind Arts started out GREAT but it quickly seemed to go completely off the rails in terms of power levels and AU fuckery, I'm not surprised the author decided to start fresh, I can only imagine how demoralising it could be to suddenly look back several chapters and realise that something which just sounded awesome ended up backing you into a corner.
