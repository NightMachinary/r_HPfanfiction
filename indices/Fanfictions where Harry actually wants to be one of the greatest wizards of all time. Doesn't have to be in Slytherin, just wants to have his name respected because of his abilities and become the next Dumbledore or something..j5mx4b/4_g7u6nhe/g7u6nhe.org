I think Harry wanted to be "just Harry" because he's never had a chance to be just Harry. He was either "freak" or "Boy Who Lived" or "Chosen One". He never got to just live his life.

If he'd grow up a happy kid in a normal family with no special destiny, maybe he'd have been more ambitious. And even then, wanting to be an Auror isn't exactly aiming low in terms of career. They're supposed to be the elite of magical law enforcement, and IIRC a number of Aurors have gone on to be Minister.

That said, I think teaching DADA is probably the job he'd be best and happiest at in the long-run.
