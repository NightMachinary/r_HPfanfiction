The books are pretty consistent on them being considered elites (at least in theory- in practice probably some of them get their jobs through political or family connections). They have to have top marks, several years of training (McGonnagle details this to Harry in book five), and most of the ones we see are noted as fairly competent (Dawlish seems to be the exception, having "book smarts" but not actually being much good in a fight).

They do have a fairy wide range of responsibilities, though, likely due to the small size of the Wizarding World.
