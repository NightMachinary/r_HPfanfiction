I am afraid most of such fics would quickly devolve into powerwank fantasy. I was thinking about writing something like this. Eq Harry wants to be powerful to protect others./not feel powerless as in his childhood or something. Oh and most importantly such a fic would need to start in like 5th year because nobody can write young children good.
