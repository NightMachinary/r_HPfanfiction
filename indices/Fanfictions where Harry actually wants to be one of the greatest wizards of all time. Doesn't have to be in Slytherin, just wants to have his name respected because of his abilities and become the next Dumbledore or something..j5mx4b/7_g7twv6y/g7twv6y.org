(A Cadmean Victory) has that pretty much, starts at the beginning of 4th year, cliche and over used I know, but so far it is turning out to be very good and different to most other fanfics I've read that start in 4th year. Currently at chap 55 of 103 and only about half way through 5th year. (no idea how to link fanfics in comments)
