Eh, every story I've seen where the basilisk gets cut up and sold, Harry wasn't doing it alone, it was being organized through adults. Eg Nightmares of Futures Past, where Slughorn arranges it, or The Pureblood Pretense, where Professor Snape does (though Harry gets to control the proceeds in both stories).

Presumably both of those men are well familiar with the relevant regulations and licensing for rare parts.
