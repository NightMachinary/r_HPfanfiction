In all fairness, the story does make snape out to be a better person than canon would imply, so you might not find what you're looking for here OP. It is, however, a wonderfully written story and I wholly recommend it on that basis alone. Even knowing how the story inevitably ends, the final chapters hit me like a punch to the gut.
