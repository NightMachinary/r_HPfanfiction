linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles) is often recommended for this, it's a complete retelling of Snape's life from his perspective. I've only ever read it up to him starting at Hogwarts and enjoyed the writing but was just kind of put off by the overall length. I'd imagine it still makes sense even if you only read the last few chapters about the Deathly Hallows time period.
