That's a valid interpretation, but my interpretation (and I think it's Rowling's too, given how she speaks of the character in interviews, though, of course, Death of the Author and all that) has always been that Lily's death was a catalyst for his realizing quite how horrible the things he and the Death Eaters did really were.
