I disapprove of both pairings, but I'm of the school that believes that post-War Snape /was/ a significantly better person, and not just acting out of love for Lily alone. Oh, he could never shed his inner pettiness and other unpleasant characteristics --- but however flawed, I don't think it's inaccurate to say 1997 Snape was "kind of a good person".
