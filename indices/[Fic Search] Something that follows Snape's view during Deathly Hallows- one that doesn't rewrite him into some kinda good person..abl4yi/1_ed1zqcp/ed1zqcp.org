It diverges quite a bit by year 7, but if you're looking for that kind of Snape, you might find linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions) to be quite interesting. Harry has more interest in potions, and so he spends more time around Snape. This does not make either of them particularly happy (but it's very funny!).
