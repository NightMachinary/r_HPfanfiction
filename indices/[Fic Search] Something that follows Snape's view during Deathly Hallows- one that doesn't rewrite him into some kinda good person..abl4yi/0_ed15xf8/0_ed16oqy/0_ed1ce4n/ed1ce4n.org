You're not wrong in general, but luckily that wasn't the case for this story! [[http://mugglenetfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=93566&textsize=0&chapter=1][It was originally posted]] on mugglenetfanfiction.com and ended up being named Best General Fic by the site in 2017! Honestly, MNFF is probably the ideal site to read it on, because I noticed that when the author imported it into AO3, it led to occasional weird punctuation errors in the story.
