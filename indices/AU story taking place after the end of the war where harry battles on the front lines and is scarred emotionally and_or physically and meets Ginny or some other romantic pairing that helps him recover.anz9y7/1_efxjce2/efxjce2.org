Not exactly what you asked, because its fairly specific, but all of these have some form of PTSD or physical issue because of the war.

There's also Hope by Jeconais, but afaik, it isn't on FFN. You can google it though, its pretty easy to find it. Its post-war AU, with a bunch of people still alive, a good trio friendship and Harry/Gabrielle.
