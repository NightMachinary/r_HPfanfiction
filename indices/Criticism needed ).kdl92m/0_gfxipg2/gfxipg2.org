Three things I noticed from a brief skim:

1) Learn how to write speech (quotation marks) grammatically correctly. This happens to be a big pet peeve of mine, and often causes me to click out of a story if I see it done incorrectly throughout the fic.

One thing that seems to trip a lot of people up is using commas to offset speech when it takes place in the context of a larger sentence.

For example:

“I would like bacon and eggs for breakfast,” Sirius said.

-not-

“I would like bacon and eggs for breakfast” Sirius said.

There are not too many rules involving use of quotation marks in direct speech, and they are fairly simple to learn. Seriously, if you read a quick lesson on it, it should only take you about 15 minutes to read the basic rules, and those basic rules should cover about 99% of cases.

2) Watch your comma splicing. This is another big pet peeve of mine. Comma splicing happens when you try to join two independent clauses with only a comma. Everyone does it from time to time; however, I noticed a comma splice in your first sentence. (And I saw a couple of others in my brief skim.)

How can you tell if you have an independent clause? Read the clause. Could it be a sentence by itself? If so, it's an independent clause. It can't be separated from another independent clause by a comma. You can use a semi-colon, a conjunction (and, but, etc.), or you can split the clauses up into two separate sentences.

3) Watch the excessive description. I hasten to say that this is more of a stylistic critique, and not something “wrong” per se.

IMHO, description/details should be in service of providing relevant information about the characters or the plot, or for setting the scene and providing some atmosphere for the story (description as a method of eliciting emotion from the reader that helps the writer paint a picture.)

There should never be description for the sake of description. I think this stylistic flaw is the result of English teachers screeching: “Add more detail! Describe the scene!” This is good advice in a vacuum, as most beginning writers do tend to stick to a dry recitation of facts that have their stories sounding like a news report. But description needs to /add/ to the story and not just stand alongside it, if that makes any sense.

Here's a “good” example vs. a “bad” example (and forgive me for not being the best creative writer myself!):

“Andromeda could have been Bellatrix's twin in features. They shared the same curly black hair, the same dark eyes, and the same bone structure. And yet, people almost never confused the two. Where Bellatrix's life had sharpened already harsh features into the mein of a predator, Andromeda's face was creased with laugh and smile lines, badges of a life well-lived.”

“Andromeda Tonks had curly, shoulder-length black hair, which had a tendency to frizz in the humidity. Her eyes were so brown as to be almost black, and she had pale skin that tended to blush easily. She was not tall, nor was she short, but rather of average height.”

I would say that, in general, description should be more like the first example, in that the description exists to show us something about the /personality/ of our characters. It's description, but it's description with a purpose.

The second example is description for the sake of description. Not that this is /always/ wrong, but too much of it can feel immersion-breaking, IMHO. I want to care about your story, about your characters, what they're doing, who they are, etc. Description for those purposes is almost always a good thing. But a detailed description of, say, what the characters had for lunch, is unnecessary and even annoying when it isn't relevant to the plot or doesn't otherwise illuminate their characters.

Again, that's just a stylistic critique. There's not a matter of a “right” way and a “wrong” way. There have been writers that have been successful with extremely minimal description (Hemingway) or excessive description (Dickens) so there isn't a hard and fast rule. But, I would say that /in general/ if you keep most description more like our first example, and less like our second, your story will be more readable and immersive.

Best of luck to you.
