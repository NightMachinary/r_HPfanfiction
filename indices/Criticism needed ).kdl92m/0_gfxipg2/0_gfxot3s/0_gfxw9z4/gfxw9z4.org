No problem!

Writing is difficult, for sure, and it takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there and ask for help.

We all have things we struggle with. I never really struggled too much with grammar (I'm old enough that I went to school when grammar was a separate subject) but I struggled (and still do) at conveying the depth and motivations I want my character to have. But I know the more I wrote, the better I got at it.

And don't forget, the more you read (critically), the better you will get. When you read other fics, pay attention to what other authors do that you like and dislike and see if you can integrate that into your writing. We all learn from each other, and it's a constant process.
