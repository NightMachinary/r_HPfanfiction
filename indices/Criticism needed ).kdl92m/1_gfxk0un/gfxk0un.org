Look up rules of punctuation and dialogue usage. It's almost never correct through the four or so chapters I looked at. Most notably, dialogue starting mid rather large paragraphs that then continue on around the dialogue for an eternity.

Also read up on fragments and run-on sentences. Specifically comma splices. They make up the majority of the story.

And Passive Voice is not your friend.

There's a lot of frivolous text as well. It seems like you're trying to be overly poetic or romantic with the opening but it doesn't work because there is absolutely no flow. Which, is largely due to the sentence structure errors. But there's repeated concepts and language that make it excessive. The entire thing can be rewritten into one sentence and lose nothing.

There were multiple times where the scene setup was literally 'it was X, it was silent, and then NOISE!' always in three fragmented sentences.

There's a great deal of anachronism as well. The depiction of Grimmauld Place as....suburban...rings false given that your target audience knows its in a posh London locale. There's probably not a lawn, almost certainly not enough foliage for the ground to be littered with leaves, and its very unlikely people passed out in front of a neighboring house. The local constabulary would have almost certainly found them better accommodations for the evening.

That may seem nitpicky, but it makes the entire opening ring rather false.

You describe a path as 'lantern lit' to end one paragraph only to start the next by describing it as extremely dark.

And the sorting that we've seen has always been alphabetical. While I suppose it's possible that 'Snape' would be the last name called in a small class, Sirius should not be waiting an eternity to be sorted, and would certainly be sorted before Remus Lupin,

There's a lot I wouldn't have bothered including as well. Your audience is aware of Harry Potter, they don't need a run down of how houses and the point system works, nor do they need a mostly plagiarized Sorting Hat song. More of Sirius experiencing things rather than an adult just stating things would be better.

All-in-all it feels very minimalist at this point. There's not a lot of substance to the plot and the chapters are all very short and deal with, more or less, one brief scene. For example, there's almost no legitimate reason for the trip to the castle from the station and the sorting to be two separate entities.

It never answers the 'why' question. As in 'why am I reading this?' There doesn't feel like there is any overarching plot yet. What threads are teased are then not referenced for three for four chapters and a lot of the character interactions ring false. There's more time devoted in one chapter to an alarm clock than there is to anything resembling an overarching plot in that chapter. And while I certainly shouldn't be one to criticize slice-of-life with little plot, the blatant lack of proper grammar and structure makes it hard to enjoy.

So if you want feedback on improving your writing, learn and utilize proper rules of grammar.

More sanity feedback would be get rid of: "I try to update it weekly" because, well, the entire thing feels like you publish whatever you did and move on. Which contributes to the plot-less feel of it. Plan it and write it. If it takes a week it takes a week, if it takes six months it takes six months. Don't cave to an arbitrary deadline and put something up that feels incomplete. That will only frustrate you in the long run.
