  There has been much debate regarding whether or not Alexandria's genesis exists. It seems as though this condition is the result of an urban legend since no one with this disorder appears to exist today so far as the scientific community is aware.

Google Scholar has no hits, and what I can find says it was invented in fan fiction in 1998. So, no, there's no debate.

  I also believe the mutation might exist in the real world
#+end_quote

One mutation that:

- Stops ongoing growth of cartilaginous structures (ears and nose, primarily)
- Stops or significantly delays cancers
- Stops or significantly delays heart disease
- Changes hair color
- Changes eye color
- Prevents the growth of pubic hair
- Automatically adjusts metabolism based on food intake or current weight

Several of these are simple changes -- eye color, hair color, pubic hair. It'd not be terribly surprising to see any one of them. There is evidence that eye and hair color are linked -- albinism occurs in humans; and I have seen a leucistic African child whose parents had dark skin, brown eyes, and nearly black hair, but the child had blond hair and blue eyes and skin as light as a Caucasian (and genetic tests verified the child's parentage). But that's where the plausibility ends.

For any one mutation to prevent cancer, we would either have to have a dormant set of cancer prevention genes (and how would that come about in the first place?) or an active set of genes that primarily functions to make us susceptible to cancer (yeah right), or it would have to be dead easy to eliminate cancer (why hasn't it already evolved in at least one species?). Similarly for heart disease.

Instead of an automatically adjusting metabolism, you could have a mutation that makes it difficult for you to absorb fats or sugars. This means you would have to eat a lot more to survive, but at least you'd be less likely to be fat. And that option should be much easier to mutate to -- it's just very unlikely to survive.

I wouldn't rule it out entirely, but I'd almost place a higher probability on magic existing.

Pull the other one, it's got bells on.

  It's hard to keep this consistent when you're tipsy off cheap champagne and Redbull

That I'll believe.
