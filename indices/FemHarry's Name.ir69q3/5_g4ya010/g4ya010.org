Judging by the name Lily and James chose, they might prefer names that are classic, simple and traditionally British (correct me if I'm wrong, but it's a really popular name in the UK, isn't it?). So judging from that, names like Phoebe and Charlotte, Victoria or maybe even Claire and Gemma. I personally love Poppy because it balances a lot of the things that make Harry 'Harry' and it's also a flower name.

Petunia makes a direct comment on the name Harry: 'Nasty common name, if you ask me'. So, I like to pick a nasty common name circa 1980, and navigate from there. To me, Lily and James are also dreadfully common and boring names, they're not a Sirius or Remus or Severus. Also, Poppy Potter has an air of faint ridiculousness about it, which I love.
