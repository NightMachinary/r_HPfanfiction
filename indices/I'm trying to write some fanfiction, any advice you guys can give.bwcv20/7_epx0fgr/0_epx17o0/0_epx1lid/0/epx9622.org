We know by the same extended movie canon that Dippet was pushing 300 when he retired from the very job of Hogwarts Headmaster, though. He was going a bit senile by /then/, but a whole two centuries sooner would seem a bit early to be worrying about your Headmaster getting a little too creaky for the job.

Besides, it's not like being Headperson entails /that/ much responsibility, that we know of; it's the Deputy Headperson doing most of the work; the Headperson themselves basically just makes speeches and presides over staff meetings, of which one imagines there are very few, because you don't want to put Professor Snape, Professor Trelawney and Professor McGonagall in a room together for too long if you can at all avoid it.

So if there really were suspicions that Dumbledore was going senile, it would surely be one his most responsibility-laden jobs that he'd be kindly invited to drop, like, say, Chief Mugwump. Not the honorable but largely honorific Headpersonship of Hogwarts.
