True, but I'd argue that following a rule without trying to understand the reasoning behind it makes it just as likely that you misuse said rule. I'm not trying to be nit-picky, really, and you're advice is more than decent, but I've seen many fics that fail horribly simply because the author got lost in convoluted, extensive, and boring depictions that most likely had their roots in this innocent bit of advice.
