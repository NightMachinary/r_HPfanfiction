  While not strictly 'good' depending on your tastes

Tastes are a thing. However, consider that a lot fewer people were reading books back then, and those who did had higher standards (they tended to be more educated).

Aside from this, the books from those times which are still well known nowadays have been filtered.

Choosing one of these books, you're almost garanteed they are solidly written, and quite excellent from a technical point of view.

It doesn't mean newer books can't compare or do as good, but finding the good ones is more tricky.
