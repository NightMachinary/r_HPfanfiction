That's about my perspective. I'll admit, I'm mostly into scifi and fantasy, but even given that I can respect the sort of language they use in the Great Gatsby. Nobody is expecting fanfiction to be a significant contribution to the literary canon (though it can be on occasion) but I feel a lot of prospective writers are severely handicapped by having very little experience with what actual literature looks like. I think a significant number of writers of HP fanfiction may have only seen the movies. The argument about whether the books or movies was better is secondary to the fact that the general trend of only consuming media in the form of video limits your understanding of the language and its uses. I think a lot of common spelling and grammatical errors come about because people have only heard a certain word or phrase rather than seen it written down correctly. Reading Pride and Prejudice, to me, would be more of an exercise rather than entertainment, a deliberate exposure to styles of writing I'm unfamiliar with, the end goal being becoming a better writer for having seen how a master of the craft goes about it. The fact some of the language and character perspectives can be quite archaic is honestly a bit of a bonus, additional stretching of the muscles as it were.

For more modern books which qualify as being something like 'literature': Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlen The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan Sabriel by Garth Nix The Colour of Magic by Terry Pratchett The Atrocity Archives by Charles Stross American Gods by Neil Gaiman

Much like fanfiction, when there are a lot of things it can be hard to find the ones which are good.
