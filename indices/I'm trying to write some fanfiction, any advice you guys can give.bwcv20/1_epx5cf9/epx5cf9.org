First: Don't give up. Good writing is a skill like any other; you might be pleased with your first fic only to look back after a few months and cringe: persevere and try to improve as you go.

​

2: Try to set reasonable goals. Don't start out trying to write a +500k word epic. Getting creative with your vocabulary is good, but try not to use overly complex words too often. It is really easy to overuse commas and semicolons. Don't go overboard with scenery or character descriptions, set the stage and move along.

​

3: Think about what you are trying to accomplish with your story. Do you want to do a character study on how so-and-so reacts to some big event? Do you want a fix-it-fic where everything gets neatly tied in a bow? Do you want to have a fun OP romp with Harry getting some new power? Determine what your goal is and then try to accomplish that.

​

4: Think about where conflict is coming from in the story. Your characters should never be cruising through every obstacle: do they get in fights with each other? Is OP!Harry countered by an even more OP!Voldemort, or some other even greater threat? We need to feel the struggle, the overcoming, the difficulty the characters face in order to get invested in them.

​

5: Read more. Reread the original books, refresh yourself on how the characters talk to each other, how the setting is described, get ideas on how the world is put together. Read other fandoms; learning by example is a good bet and it can show you how to do writing things like describe characters or settings, how to write characters with conflicting opinions and desires, how to structure larger plots. Read things other fanfiction writers have done with a deliberate eye to what you feel works and doesn't work. Read other books (I would recommend, simply for flavor, *older* books. Pride and Prejudice, the Portrait of Dorian Gray, the War of the Worlds, the Great Gatsby, all that jazz. While not strictly 'good' depending on your tastes, they do offer useful perspectives for what 'real' writing looks like, and interesting grammar and vocabulary.)
