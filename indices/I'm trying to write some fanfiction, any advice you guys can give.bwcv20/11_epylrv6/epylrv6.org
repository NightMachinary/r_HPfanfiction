Make the story have consequences. If the major characters end up exactly where they began, or near enough too, and unharmed, your story likely has little to no character development, as next to nothing happened that could change your characters.

Character development is great when it's pulled off right. Don't be afraid to utilize it.

It's also a good way to avoid rehashing canon or writing stories with endings that might as well be the canon one (I.e. everyone lived happily ever after, the end).
