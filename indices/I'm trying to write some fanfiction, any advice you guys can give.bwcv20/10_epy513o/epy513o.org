-Finish writing a least 5-6 chapters (or half of it) before posting. That way you have backups and you can keep a schedule (if you desire).

-Write something everyday. Whether it's chapters, summaries, character traits, chapter outlines, whatever. Just write down something. It'll keep you motivated.

-Keep your characters consistent, whether you choose to stay IC or not. There's nothing worse than a consistently inconsistent character.

-Plot your story. It doesn't have to be rigid (in fact, it's best if it's not), but know where you want to go with it. Beginning, middle and end.

-Invest in a good beta who can tell you what you're going wrong and where you can do better. They will also help you keep your tenses correct, punctuation steady, words spelt correctly (spellcheck won't get everything), etc. They are also good feedback and fresh eyes always helps.
