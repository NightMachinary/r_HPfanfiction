Have consequences for actions that follow logically.

Dont do friendly goblins unless it is a front to take advantage of the characters and take them for all they are worth

Give the villians agency and intelligence. Your hero is only as great as the villians. The more competent they are, the more able your hero will have to be to beat them. Unless it is a comedy, there things change a bit Rorsachs Make A Wish is a good example for that.

Make the hero struggle for growth. That way when he shows up at the end with the game winning skills we can buy it, or have his amazing skills come at some kind of personal cost either in the moment, blood magic/body destroying at highest levels, or in the past, he jas given up something or is in some way injured to get superpowers.

Try to make others three dimensional. If the character is around a lot give them their own goals, hopes, fears, and values that are different from the heroes.

For example, Harry is a gun slinging desperado, having been trapped un an alternate dimension for ten years. Now returned he is with qualms about bushwacking and killing the villians. Moody is willing to work with him, but draws the line at killing unarmed opponents. Harry doesn't.
