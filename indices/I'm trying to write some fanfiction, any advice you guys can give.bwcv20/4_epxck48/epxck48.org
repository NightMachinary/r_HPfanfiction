Avoid analysis paralysis. I'm not saying start writing without knowing how your story ends, but don't spend all your time planning every little plot point. You'll get so caught up in planning that you'll never actually put prose on page.

Perhaps you could consider writing a two or three sentence summary of where you want the story to go: the initial change from canon, how this change challenges your protagonist, and how the protagonist resolves their challenges.

Beyond that...just start writing. You can always tweak later if necessary, but if you never actually start you're just out of luck

I would also urge you to start the story where it's exciting to start. If you're writing an AU, for example, but the bulk of the plot happens after Harry's 16th birthday, don't feel like you have to go through years 1-5 just to get all your world building in.

Start when the story actually starts and trickle in background info as needed
