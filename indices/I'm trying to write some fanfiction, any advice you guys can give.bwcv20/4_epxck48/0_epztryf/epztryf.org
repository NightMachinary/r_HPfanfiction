Can't support this bit of advice. The methodology of the author depends heavily on the person in question. Some have decent results letting the words flow and the story unfold, but you'll never really get any amount of depth or thematic discourse. Many stories without some kind of rough script tend to get lost somewhere along the way or forget about some of their earlier themes, and -- frankly -- you always kind of get that impression that the story is slipping away from the author. This is mostly a problem for longer fics, but even for a 15k one-shot, I'd probably write down at least 2-3 pages of notes before I start to write more than maybe a core scene that made me want to write that fic in the first place. You just don't get the sense of completeness with a story if you haven't thought about the ending before you start the very beginning.
