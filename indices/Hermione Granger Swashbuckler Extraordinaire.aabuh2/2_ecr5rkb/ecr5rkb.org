Am glad for you that you discovered Stewart Granger! If you haven't yet, you really ought to watch that version of /The Prisoner of Zenda/ in its entirety. Not only is the duel scene superb, but it's an engaging story, with terrific dialogue and great actors. Not only is Stewart Granger a good swashbuckler, but he can also be extremely funny.
