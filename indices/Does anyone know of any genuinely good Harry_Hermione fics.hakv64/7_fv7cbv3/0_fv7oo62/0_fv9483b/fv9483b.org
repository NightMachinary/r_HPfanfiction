No problem! I get that; I find a lot of love triangles very tacky and as if they're just there to create unnecessary drama. But I really feel like that isn't the case here. Oh and this was written pre-OotP so it ceases to be canon compliant after GoF (including no prophecy and no Horcruxes); I thought I'd just give you a heads up. It really is very well-written; the writer is now a published author who wrote The Mortal Instruments if you know that series, but I find Draco Trilogy better personally.
