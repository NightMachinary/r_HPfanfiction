[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lady-Thief][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], linkffn(12592097), fits your criteria nicely:

- No perfect Harry/Hermione, no Dumbledore and Ron bashing
- Their abilities grow stronger over many years. Harry is taught by both Dumbledore and Moody personally.
- Ron is Harry's great friend and partner, and later helps Harry in his relationship with Hermione. Ron is however not very close to Hermione due to circumstances.
