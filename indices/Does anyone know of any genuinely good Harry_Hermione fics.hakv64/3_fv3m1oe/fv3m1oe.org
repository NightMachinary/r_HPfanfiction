linkffn(11764303) is 13k words (a shorter story), but other than that...

linkffn(6243892) is light on capital-R romance, but otherwise might be to your liking. 36k words (still a /bit/ on the short side).

linkffn(2527087) is also pretty light on romance.

linkffn(7062528) might work for you?

linkffn(10914042) probably doesn't portray a Dumbledore to your liking, but at least it takes an interesting and different approach, rather than the typical incompetent mustache-twirling.
