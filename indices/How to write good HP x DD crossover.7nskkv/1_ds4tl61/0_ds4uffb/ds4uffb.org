They do in Natural 20 tho :P (that is to say, dice rolls make a dramatic story, although they are mostly in the background and no one can make saving throws so theres much less of it)

Also I'd say that no one sane wouldn't like a well written story just because MC isn't HP. And I'm not a writer but I'd say no one should really care about the people who wouldn't read a story for a petty reason like that.
