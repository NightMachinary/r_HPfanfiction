I'd recommend starting by familiarizing yourself with D&D magic rules. In D&D, wizards, witches, and sorcerers are all separate classes and use magic slightly differently. There's also the mechanics of divine vs. arcane magic and prepared vs. spontaneous spellcasters. Which class your character is will majorly affect how they interact with the Harry Potter world. You might also want to consider which edition of D&D your crossover character comes from. 3.5, Pathfinder, and 5th editions are the most popular, I believe, but the spell system in 4th edition may be the closest to Harry Potter. Pathfinder rules are available for free online with no downloads [[http://www.d20pfsrd.com][here.]] Getting a feel for how other authors describe magic in a D&D setting would also be helpful, even though you want to bring a D&D character into the Harry Potter universe. The magic works fundamentally differently in D&D, and different classes acquire magic in different ways. Finally, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10938297][here]] is a link to my WIP campaign novelization-style fic which involves Harry Potter characters playing through the Temple of Elemental Evil campaign. It's not quite what you are thinking of writing, but it might help you get some ideas for how to describe D&D magic.
