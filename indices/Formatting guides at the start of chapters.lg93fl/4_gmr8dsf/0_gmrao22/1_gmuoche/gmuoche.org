I was always taught that if you are writing a character and they are thinking, that you write in italics with the little quotation marks. Though, I've also seen published authors just do the thoughts in italics without the quotations. It's confusing, lol... but I think I prefer the latter. It makes for a nicer format, but maybe I am doing it wrong, too.

I don't know, I read and get ideas of how to write and then I just insert a certain style into my fics.
