Yeah, I get wanting to ensure your readers aren't confused but it feels rude to me. I prefer to give them the benefit of the doubt.

One of my fics has Harry communicating telepathically but with his half of the conversation he's never sure when he's simply thinking and when he's broadcasting his thoughts so there's no clear distinction between them. I haven't gotten any complaints in spite of the fact it's inherently vague.
