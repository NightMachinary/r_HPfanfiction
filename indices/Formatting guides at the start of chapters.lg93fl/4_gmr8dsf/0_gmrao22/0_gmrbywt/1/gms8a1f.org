Mercedes Lackey doesn't have to put a style guide in her Valdemar books to explain the telepathy, nor does Tara Harper with the Wolfwalker series or Cat Scratch series. I think it's unnecessary and including it trains the readers to object to its absence on others' behalf, even when they understand just fine without it.
