You get people reviewing you about their confusion on context? Whether somebody was thinking or speaking, etc.? I've never had that happen. Or if they are confused maybe they haven't expressed their confusion yet.

I have heard a lot of complaints from writers publishing their work on harrypotterfanfiction, though. Sometimes even on Quotev (or whatever it is).
