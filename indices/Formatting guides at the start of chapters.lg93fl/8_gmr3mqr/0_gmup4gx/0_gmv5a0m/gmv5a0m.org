I haven't published much myself, but what I do is put one chapter purely dedicated to what I do with text, not at the start of normal chapters.

Edit: forgot to explain relevance. Everything I've published has that. I would rather have that glossy thing, then have to explain to people who will undoubtedly miss the cues.
