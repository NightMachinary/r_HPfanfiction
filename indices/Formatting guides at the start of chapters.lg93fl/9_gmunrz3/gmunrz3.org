When I was very, very young and new to the Harry Potter fandom, I did this with my stories as I saw other writers doing it. Luckily, I learned not to do this and became a much better writer because of it. The sad thing is that the people that were with me in the beginning and giving me great writing advice have either moved onto other fandoms or are gone from fanfiction entirely. I owe a lot to these people for giving me criticism. Whenever I see other writers doing the same things that I did as a beginner writer, I leave them the same advice. You'd be surprised how receptive young writers are... and many of them are very young. Under the age of 16 in most cases.
