I think it also makes sense if you're going to consistently use them in a way - like "/Thinking/" and '/Remembering/' are not universal rules, and if you're always going to use that to distinguish between them it's probably smart to communicate that.

Personally I'd probably push that down to the bottom of the chapter, with chapter 1 having an initial note that it'll be there - since that seems like a cleaner way to do it.
