Tbf, if you don't write those things, people will ask. No matter how well you think you've inferred them, it's the internet. You have to hope for Einstein and prepare for Cletus. Posting them in advance will usually cut down on a bunch of those kinds of 'clarification-asking' messages/comments/reviews.

This is a world where people actively ignore author's notes and I've seen more than a few reviews asking questions that were actively dealt with in said author's notes.
