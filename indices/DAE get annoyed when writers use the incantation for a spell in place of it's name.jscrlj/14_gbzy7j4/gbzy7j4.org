On one hand, I feel that it's the same way I, as a mathematician, might refer to some theorem variously by what it does, it's standard name, by some particular bit of it that comes to mind...

On the other hand, there are pretty good reasons for /not/ casually referring to spells by their incantations:

1. For at least some spells, even improper or lacking intent + incantation + magic yields an effect. Calling a spell by its name while holding your wand is begging for an unfortunate accident. Wand safety parallels gun safety, especially for dangerous spells.
2. For spells with extremely dangerous effects, like the Killing Curse, saying its incantation is tantamount to, say, loudly cocking a gun, or even firing a round (or perhaps a blank) into the air - at best, it can easily startle others or call undue attention to oneself, and at worst, it can cause a cascade of unfortunate events.

Like, if you're going to /say/ a particularly dangerous spell incantation (e.g. "I heard someone say "Avada K-" and then they were cut off"), it would make sense to carefully raise your hands in front of yourself and show that you are not casting before saying the words.
