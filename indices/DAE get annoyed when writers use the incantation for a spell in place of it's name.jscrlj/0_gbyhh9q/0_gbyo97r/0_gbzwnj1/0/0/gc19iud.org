"YEET" Voldemort shouted, while throwing the Avtomat Kalashnikov at Harry.

Harry was too slow to dodge, so it struck him on the forehead.

A little known fact, even amongst wizarding kind, is that the occult arm of the Nazi Reich had repeatedly used dark wizards on loan from Grindelwald to destroy Russian supplies. Cosmoline was the Russian answer- it is toxic to most magic, but dark magic especially. It also happened to be an excellent anti-rusting agent, so that was the muggle cover.

There was enough cosmoline on the rifle that when it struck Harry's forehead some got into his bloodstream. His horcrux burst, and the magical backlash made Voldemort and all his horcruxes explode.
