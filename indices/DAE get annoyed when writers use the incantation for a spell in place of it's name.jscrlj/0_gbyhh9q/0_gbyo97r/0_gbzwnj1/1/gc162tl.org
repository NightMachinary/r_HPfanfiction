I think I read a one-shot like that once. The Always Sunny cast being the staff of the American Magical School and arriving for the Tournament. :D

But yeah, it's not something that annoys me personally (though I do think over-use of the Rowling-specific made-up words sounds silly), but this fandom has gotten quite... strict with its preferences over the years. Understandable, given how many fics there are to read and pick through - you have to be picky, or you'd never get anything else done.
