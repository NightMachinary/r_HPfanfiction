I generally agree, but it also makes for an interesting POV indicator. I'd imagine muggleborns (or those raised by muggles) may be more likely to call a spell by the incantation since that's what they've learned it as (like in Philosopher's Stone, Flitwick probably only mentioned 'the Levitation Charm' once or twice at the start of the lesson but had the students repeating 'Wingardium Leviosa' the rest of the time), while those raised in the wizarding world may have heard the spells called by their titles growing up (possibly plus a dash of 'proper pureblooded vocalization' in some cases) and so are more likely to refer to them by those titles.
