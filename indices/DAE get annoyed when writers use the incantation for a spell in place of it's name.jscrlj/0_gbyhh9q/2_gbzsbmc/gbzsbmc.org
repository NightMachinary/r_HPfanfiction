Avada Kedavra is a special case, because its name is just 'the Killing Curse.' If you are describing someone murdering someone else with, for example, a Reductor Curse, you could call that 'the killing curse,' because it's the curse that killed them.

In other words, imagine a courtroom, with one lawyer asking the defendant "Did you mean to hit the victim when you cast the killing curse?" and the defendant responds "I never cast the Killing Curse." It's just confusing.
