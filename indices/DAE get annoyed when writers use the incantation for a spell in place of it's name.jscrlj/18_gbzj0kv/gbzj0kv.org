I'm not entirely sure if I just imagined this, but the incantation v name differences roughly correspond with the grammatical form of the latin-ish being used as the incantation. The big caveat here is that I don't know Latin beyond Catholicism and famous mottos, and I haven't thought about it much until now so possibly that I've assumed this system in my head and just not noticed things that don't fit it.

Anyway, my answer is that I don't get annoyed, I just assume they aren't good at languages and didn't notice any patterns. It does influence my expectations of writing quality.
