Characters in canon did do it

Hermione did refer to the Summoning Charm as "accio":

*“I just did a Summoning Charm. You know --- Accio. And --- they zoomed out of Dumbledore 's study window right into the girls' dormitory.”*

Barty Crouch Jr did it multiple times:

*“Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it --- you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it."*

and

*“Now ... those three curses --- Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus --- are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That's what you're up against. That's what I've got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills ... copy this down. ...”*

Ron also said it multiple times:

*“Some lesson, though, eh?” said Ron to Harry as they set off for the Great Hall. “Fred and George were right, weren't they? He really knows his stuff, Moody, doesn't he? When he did Avada Kedavra, the way that spider just died, just snuffed it right --- ”*

and

*“But there can't be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse, can there?” said Ron. “What's worse than death?”*

Even Harry did it:

*“Like what kind of weapon?” said Harry. “Something worse than the Avada Kedavra --- ?”*
