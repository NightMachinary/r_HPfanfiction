I get annoyed if it happens /all the time/, but canon's not exactly innocent of referring to spells by their incantation a few times (notably with the Killing Curse - both Sirius and Harry refer to it as "the Avada Kedavra" on separate occasions.

I do think in most narrative cases, using the name of the spell rather than its incantation flows better - ie "Ron caught the troll's club with a well-timed Levitation Charm" rather than "Ron caught the troll's club with a well-timed Wingardium Leviosa".
