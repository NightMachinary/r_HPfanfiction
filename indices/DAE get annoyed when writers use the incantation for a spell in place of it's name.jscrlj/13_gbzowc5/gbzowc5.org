The Imperius and The Cruciatus, as well as the Summoning Charm, are also used as verbs. So it is valid to say that Lucius was "Imperio'd" to accept the Dark Mark, that Ron "Crucio'd" Hermione, and that Harry "Accio'd" his broom. May not be spelt correctly, but you get the gist.

Still, I can understand where you're coming from. In some cases, it could be understandable to say the specific spell. You could "summon" something by levitating it or you can Accio it.
