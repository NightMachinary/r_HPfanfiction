I feel like this is totally nitpicky. I mean, I totally get your point if someone was saying "he was under the imperio" because that just sounds all kind of wrong. But "Harry used accio to fetch his glasses" makes perfect sense and is much less clunky and unnecessarily verbose than "Harry used the summoning charm to fetch his glasses".

I could be remembering this entirely wrong, but I feel like, at some point, when explaining the scene in the bathroom in HBP Harry says "he tried to crucio me!". If not, I know several characters definitely use the phrase "avada kedavra" or even "/the/ avada kedavra" in this way.
