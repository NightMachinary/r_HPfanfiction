I tend to understand when someone just says "he summoned his glasses" instead of he used the summoning charm or he accioed his glasses. Again with stupify, I prefer "throwing stunners" and "Harry stunned such and such" instead of "he stupified him". That being said, in some cases it doesn't work such as court cases: did you fire the killing curse (The curse that killed the victim, not Avada Kedavra), and the suspect says no (he fired a explosion hex, confringo). I would say for most parts, say the name of the spell, not the incantation, but in a few rare cases it's ok to do otherwise.
