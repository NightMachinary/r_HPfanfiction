It's the opposite for me. I imagine that people have come up with quite a few spells for the same result.

Take Snapes "Sectumsempra". It cuts stuff but Snape is hardly the first (and not the last) to come up with a cutting spell/curse, so calling it */the/* cutting curse is wrong in my opinion. It's the Sectumsempra.
