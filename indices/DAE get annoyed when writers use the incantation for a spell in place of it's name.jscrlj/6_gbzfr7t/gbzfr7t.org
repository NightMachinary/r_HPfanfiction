I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think it's a battle you're ever going to win. Maybe you should write a fic where a professor harps on all the students for using the incantations instead of the names and taking points off all their essays. (I'm actually serious, it probably wouldn't be the main plot point but I could see it being interwoven throughout quite nicely.)
