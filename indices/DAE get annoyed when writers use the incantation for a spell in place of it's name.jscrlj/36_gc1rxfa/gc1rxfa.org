If it's like: "Accio broom!" Harry called, while hiding behind the biggest rock he could find, hoping the dragon wouldn't toast him

To me, it's completely fine, BUT if it's like:

Harry used accio to get his broom while hiding (...)

It doesn't sound good to me. I find it annoying that people aren't able to describe actions during their narrations. You could very well write something along the lines of:

"Harry called for his broom with the summoning charm" or "Harry summoned his broom", etc.
