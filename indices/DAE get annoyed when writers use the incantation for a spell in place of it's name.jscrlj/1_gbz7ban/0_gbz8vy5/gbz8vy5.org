Also imagine if you were holding your wand while talking about spells, and accidentally cast a spell because you referred to it by its incantation? Probably unlikely to happen for spells that require particular emotions to work, but I can easily see some student accidentally summoning another students textbook because they called the summoning charm "the accio"

EDIT: Fixed some grammatical problems
