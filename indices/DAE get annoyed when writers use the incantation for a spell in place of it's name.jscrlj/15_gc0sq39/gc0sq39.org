I don't have a problem with this and for a RL reason: we speak interchangably about firearms and the ammo calibers they fire in the same way. 'Habla Smith and Wesson-?' 'I hit him with some double-ought and he dropped on the spot.' 'The opposition engaged us with AK's, but we had Ma Deuce and she wasn't trying to hear that!'

To me, it's very easy to remember that all of the kids at Hogwarts comes there with a multi-purpose tool - and one of those purposes is to act as a self-defense instrument that can also be used for lethal tactical applications. (In other words, to quote the main character of another IP - "It's also a gun!" ðŸ™‚) Remember, that's the reason why the Killing Curse is so feared - 'Harry Potter' is a British work, the main villainous character was first active during the main time of The Troubles, and the AK is essentially the same as a handgun... by those standards, something to be feared above all else because it only has one purpose - premeditated murder. (By that same definition, the other Unforgivables also constitute major crimes if not crimes against the Crown: the Cruciatus is torture, and the Imperius is felony sexual assault PLUS any crime the victim committed while under control.)

Back on track - we also have to remember that there's the proper way of describing something versus the term used by the people who use it in every day, real-world situations. Again, consider the military and their equipment for example, such as aircraft. The A-10 is officially known as the 'Thunderbolt', but people more commonly call it the 'Warthog' or just 'Hog'. Along those lines, F-16s are officially known as 'Fighting Falcons' or 'Falcons', but pilots and so forth call them 'Vipers'. (Check out their story. 'Battlestar Galactica' fans will be happy.)

So anyway, the fact that they use the spell name interchangeably with the incantation in dialogue both as a noun or as verbs doesn't bother me. It's actually a bit more believable and grounds the characters more into a sense of realism, IMHO - just as long as it doesn't call attention to itself by writers trying to make characters sound cool. Then, it's annoying as hell. I've seen a few fanfics that went that way, as well.
