Canon does have characters referring to spells by their incantations, but I feel that for dangerous spells, even though you couldn't cast them just by randomly saying the incantation, people would still shy away from it. Also, in a society that so greatly feared Voldemort and refused to say his name, I feel like they might refuse to say the incantation if not because the spells are dangerous then because of the association with Voldemort.
