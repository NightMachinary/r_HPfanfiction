There's Snapped, a fic where Harry decides to go full snark during the Dueling Club. It has some extremely good recurring gags, such as my favourite:

"“Ding,” Harry said. Dumbledore fell silent and frowned at him. “That's my bullshit detector,” Harry explained, and McGonagall gasped. "

Fair warning, there are some cliches like Manipulative!Dumbledore and Weasley bashing, but if you can stand those it's short and quite fun.
