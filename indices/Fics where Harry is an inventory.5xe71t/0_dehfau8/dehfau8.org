Inventor*, not inventory. The latter doesn't make sense.

Most are rune-enchanting nonsense (no, I'm not getting into that argument). But here are two off the top of my head: linkffn(Bungle In the Jungle) and linkffn(RuneMaster by Tigerman)

It's also a large part of one of my favorite two fics: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone).
