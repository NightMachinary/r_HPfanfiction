Hrm. Elemental theme? You already have: Fire/X/water/Earth/Aether (especially if the maze has some ethereal/trippy gimmick, like being a maze of 3-dimensional paths through a 4-dimensional shape).

So something Air-based, but not brooms.

Maybe try to make them survive in a vacuum? They have to make a rat survive for as long as possible. (And bubblehead charms can be handwaved to not work by claiming they filter oxygen out of the air/water rather than conjure it, if you want).
