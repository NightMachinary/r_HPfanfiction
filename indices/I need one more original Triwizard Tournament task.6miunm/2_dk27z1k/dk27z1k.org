hmm, maybe do something so it comes as a surprise to the contestants? like tell them its a week later then it actually is, and then kidnap/drug them the night of the task, and force them to compete, where half the task is figuring out that the task has already started? (IDK like in inception, they have to figure out they are dreaming and what they see isn't real)
