You certainly want linkffn(Princess of the Blacks by Silently Watches) and its sequels, in which considerable Dark and Black Magic is performed. Although be warned, there are very few characters portrayed therein who aren't morally disgusting human beings, and the protagonist's background as a former child prostitute, while not centre-stage, isn't flinched from either.

Silently Watches has built a world that, frankly, needs the Most Holy Inquisition of the Imperium of Man to come along and declare Exterminatus on the whole fucking boiling of it. It's a brilliant story, though, and recently completed.
