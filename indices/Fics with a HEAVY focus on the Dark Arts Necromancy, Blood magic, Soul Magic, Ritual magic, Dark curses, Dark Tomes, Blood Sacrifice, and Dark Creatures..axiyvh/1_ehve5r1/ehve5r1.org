Linkffn(A Second Chance at Life by Miranda Flairgold)

Miranda Flairgold builds a completely new world outside of England in this, but it has all the elements your looking for and is definitely worth a read I'd say! It covers the defeat of Voldemort in the second part and goes into a third incomplete part.
