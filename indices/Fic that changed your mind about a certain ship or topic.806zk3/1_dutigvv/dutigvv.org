Actually it was one of my first stories I ever read for FanFiction. It's called Games are Afoot by grumpy grizzly. It was a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger story in which I completely missed the pairing noted. Before then, I never much was interested in Charlie but like Daphne Greengrass, he's a blank canvas one can work with. Of course, many portray him as some sort of sex god, a la Christian Grey, which is unfortunate but Games are Afoot does not which is why I like it so much. The story definitely opened my eyes to the Charlie/Hermione pairing in which one could make the case that they're rather compatible. It's actually my second favorite pairing to read now. However, the ship isn't terribly popular so the stories with them are far too few for my liking.
