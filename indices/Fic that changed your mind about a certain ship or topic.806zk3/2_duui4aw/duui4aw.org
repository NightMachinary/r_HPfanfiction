For me it is linkffn(2473502) Oathbreaker. It has everything I typically avoid (Slash for the main character, some weird parings, some weird creature stuff). But damn, this story still rocks. It is one of the few where 'Dark Magic' actually seems dark and disgusting but still somewhat attractive. It is about a dying culture which is somehow on the one hand rotten and on the other hand very loyal.

It actually manages to build a living and breathing world, if you get what I mean?
