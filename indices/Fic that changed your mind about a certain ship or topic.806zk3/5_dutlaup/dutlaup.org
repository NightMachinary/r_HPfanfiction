I never liked Dramione, I know it's a popular ship but I hated it with all my heart because of the way Draco treated Hermione at Hogwarts, then someday I was bored and decided to read a fanfic called A Wonderful Caricature of Intimacy linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3878384/1/A-Wonderful-Caricature-of-Intimacy]]) and started to love the ship.
