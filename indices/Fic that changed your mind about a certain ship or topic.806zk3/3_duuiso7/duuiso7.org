I can't point to a single fic, but I used to like Dramione fics. I got kinda lucky I think and only read decent ones early on (which I still enjoy, like Charicature of Intimacy mentioned by [[/u/LHPF]] ), but after a while I read more and more of the shitty ones (idiotic and submissive Hermoine with no self respect; leather-pants Draco who just wants to be loved and is simply acting out and pulling pigtails).

I just stopped reading the pairing because it's too much shit to wade through.
