Is there anything you remember about it? Plot details, word count range, rating (even knowing if had was explicit/mature or teen/general, it's possible to mark multiple ratings at once in your search), any specific words or phrases in the summary, other pairings, most featured character, tags in the summary? Ao3 is actually really good at finding fics you've forgotton the title for, because of all the different filters, the tag system, and the very useful search bar. I've had an account there at least 4 years, I might be able to track it down. I would love to help, it's really satisfying to finally find a fic someone is looking for.
