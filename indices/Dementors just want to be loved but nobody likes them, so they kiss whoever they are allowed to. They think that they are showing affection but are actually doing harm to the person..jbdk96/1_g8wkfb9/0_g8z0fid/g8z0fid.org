Yeah cool right? I mean I really love the word 'perspective' 😁. Dementors feeling sad and trying to kiss (show affection in their own way) will make them sexual harassers but when someone's dogs or cats peek on them while bathing, no one cares😅. Dementors are not humans, just because they resemble one a little doesn't mean they are though.

I know I'm simplifying my words a lot here but truly it's all about perspective. Pets often kiss their owners, slobber them with their saliva sometimes. Of course the feeling is mutual but when they come sleep on your chest while you are asleep, it's not called groping 🤔. In fact, it's encouraged.

The common point in pets and Dementors that I can see is that they are showing their affection here and none of it is making them sexually aroused. It's like some people shake hands on greeting, some kiss but both in sense of greeting and nothing sexually offensive. Do I make any sense? 😁
