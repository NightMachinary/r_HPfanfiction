In mpreg stories (or omega verse) there are usually like 3 sexes I guess??? Like, there's alphas, who impregnate people; betas, who can impregnate and get pregnant; and omegas, who can get pregnant. Anyone, male or female, can be any of these 3. It's not just in hp fan fiction, it's all over the place, though some hp fics do use potion methods instead of going the omega verse route. Does this make sense?? Idk, I'm not an expert in this, since I personally don't really like it, but hey, different strokes for different folks right?
