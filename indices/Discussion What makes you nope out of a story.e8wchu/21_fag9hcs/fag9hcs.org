Slavery apologism - doubly so if the author knowingly or unknowingly copies the same drivel scumbags in the 19th century used to defend slavery.

Ron and Hermione bashing. The trio's friendship is the greatest draw for me in canon.

Death Eater apologism.

"Pureblood Fuck Yeah" stories.

Dumbledore bashing.

Canon Rehash.

Sexism.
