Over powered Gringotts. Why can goblins put seven drops of blood on a piece of parchment and tell you every little thing about you. Name, Parents, Titles, Assets, Magical abilities, Animagus forms, Magic effecting you(compelling charms, blocks, love potions, loyalty potions, hate potions.) It's a cop out to give everybody everything and it takes away the discovery in the story. It would be so much better if the characters don't learn they each have three animagus forms until they spend months practicing. If you wanna get Harry off the potions then send him away for the summer with Sirius sonhe can't be fed them and watch as he slowly doubts his relationships with people. Removing a block on his magic, have him struggle on something he really shouldn't and the block be discovered or better yet put him in a dangerous position and forcefully destroy it. Have him slowly search through his history amd meet people with information or find ancient lost artifacts to make him the heir to a hundred houses. Finds the sword and becomes the heir of Gryffindor, gathers the hallows and becomes heir Peverell. Sirius' will shows he is heir Black, his great grandfathers portrait teaches him all about his family history and what it means to be a Potter.

An stupid Gringotts means all the characters are just given everything and all struggles are removed because HaRrY iSnT HaViNg HiS mAGiC bLoCKeD. Now he can do everything.

Immediately quit the story when Grimgotts makes a list of his entire life.
