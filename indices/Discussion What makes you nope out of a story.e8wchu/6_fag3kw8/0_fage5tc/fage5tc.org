Yes! I immediately nope when I see a huge list of stuff because obviously old people who know obscure magic didn't know about Gringotts having this power to reveal all binding and stuff. Or the Only Harry is nice to Goblins so Goblins help him in revenge spree with him just splashing so much money.

My God. When people know they dont have an Heir or will die single, people tend to give inheritance to friends, or sell of stuff even try to spend all of the money and not, on off chance I have distant relations I will keep money in bank in perpetuity. Heck, if people tend to do that. You'd think someone got blood thingy earlier and used the account.
