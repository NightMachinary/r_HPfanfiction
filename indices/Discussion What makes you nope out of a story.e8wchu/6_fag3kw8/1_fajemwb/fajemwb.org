I was reading the From The Dungeon series and I feel this post in my bones.

I started reading it because I love fics that make Harry navigate weird pureblood customs/laws, but the goblins are so ridiculously overpowered in this one. Basically every plot point that could be developed in an interesting way is solved in two paragraphs and waved away goblin magic. It's so frustrating.
