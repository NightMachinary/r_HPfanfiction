"Everyone uses twinspeak wrong," Said the twin that may have been George.

"They do," agreed Possibly-Fred. "We don't finish each other's sentences."

"We're just really in sync." George replied.

Fred nodded. "We're good at guessing what the other is thinking."

"And can quickly add onto it with a new idea."

"Right you are, Fred," Fred - or was it George? - said. "But alternating words -"

"-interjecting phrases-"

"-and assembling a coherent sentence together-"

"-is not something we can actually do," one of the twins said. At this point, you're really not sure which one is which.

"Except that. We practiced that. We get this sort of question a lot," the other twin contradicted.

"True."
