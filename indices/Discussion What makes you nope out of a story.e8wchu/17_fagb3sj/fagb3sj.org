- Parents' will that is 20 pages long and defeats the entire plot of Book 3, exposes Dumbledore as an evil or incompetent person, apologizes to Snape to get rid of the Antagonistic BS Snape put Harry through. I dropped Harry Potter's Discovery at chapter 3 or 4. The grammar I could put up with, but the whole Will thing just got under my skin.
- Poor Bashing. If you're going to bash a character, at least make it believable. Pick a direction and stay with it.
- Dumbledore setting. Greater Good Dumbledore is only believable for me if he is senile or crazy. Evil Dumbledore is entertaining in its own way, but his reasoning for being that way has to be shown. Canon Dumbledore is boring to me unless you add some flavoring to it. Dumbledore didn't know about the Dursely abuse? Snape was drugging him or Figg. Canon Dumbledore is boring as hell and makes him looks incompetent or downright not caring of the crap he piled up on Harry. Don't even get me started with Book 6/7 and the 2.7 thousand chances evil people get, but Harry is going Dark if he doesn't eat his vegetables.
- Harems. Harems by themselves are a no go. But if you have a reliable mechanic allowing it (Multiple Lordships/Consort agreements because of Nobility stuff), then I can get past it. As long as the Nobility system holds more water than the Canon HP books, I'll read it.
- Having a bajillion animagus forms.
