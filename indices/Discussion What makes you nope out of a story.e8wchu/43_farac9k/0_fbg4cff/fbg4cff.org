  Anything and everything that tries to turn Draco in a sympathetic character.

I think that's doable, I read one fic that did it really well, it's just that too often turning Draco into a sympathetic character = Draco in leather trousers, have him be some kind of creature, make Harry his mate/Hermione crap.

The fic that did it really well, think it was a one or twoshot, long forgot it's name, where Draco had a squib sister who was sent into the muggle world by his mother to save her from LM, Harry meets her and gets her pregnant while he's at the Dursleys for a summer, and Draco helps Harry raise his nephew (not slash). Obviously its totally OOC, but it has to be to make Draco not a scumbag, but its credible OOC because his upbringing is totally changed by the knowledge of a sister in the muggle world.
