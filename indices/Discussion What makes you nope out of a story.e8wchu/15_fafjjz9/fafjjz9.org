To piggy back in what everybody else is saying: walls of text and tons of typos. Misspelling, but also, consistent confusion of homonyms or mixing metaphors. People running rampant with the thesaurus and using words where they don't actually know the primary meaning or correct usage.

I know a lot of authors are non-native English speakers, but MS Word spell check and grammar check are your friends. With apps like Grammarly, there's really no excuse anymore.
