A wall of text like serious you couldn't have space everything out a bit into manageable 1to4 sentence paragraphs?

This is me being finicky but if the title and summary don't have a single capitalize letter it just elludes to the fact that your story will irk me with horribly terrible grammar and spelling problems

Harems, like max I will go is a threesome and only if it's written well anymore than that is just the fact that you need to tell everyone that your MC has a big dick then it gets repetitive with the story only going along as the MC acquires more people into the harem

If the tags can't fit on my screen you have a problem I understand putting the relationships and stuff but honestly if there aren't super relevant to the story you can leave it out and same with people who tag literal sentences just why?

Stories where everyone is bashed like I'm good if you need to bash a few people for plot sake but if you bash over half the character then the story gets boring and repetitive
