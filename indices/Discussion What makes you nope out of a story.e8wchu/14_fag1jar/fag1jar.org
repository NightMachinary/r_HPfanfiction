When the author has overused the thesaurus. Badly. Eyes are eyes, not orbs or optics (yes, I read an otherwise good story that as far as I can tell, used find and replace to all instances of "eyes" with "optics"). People breathe, they don't respirate, or respire.

This often goes hand-in-hand with making sentences extra long and convoluted for some reason. Not every utrerance and term that you set down on the page is required to be an ostentatious lexeme. It is often tiresome and befuddling for many a reader who would be otherwise sympathetic to your tale.

Also, homonyms. One or two slips are fine (like "pour over a book" instead of "pore over"), if it continuously mixes up past/passed, or peak/peek (pique gets a pass, it's trickier) or something like that shows up frequently, my brain gets twitchy.
