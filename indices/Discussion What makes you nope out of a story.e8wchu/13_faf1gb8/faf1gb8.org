Anyone below fourth year flirting. I like political Slytherins in a fic but they don't have the hormones in first, second or possibly third year to want to bang that hot seventh year girl. Luna is one of my favorite characters but I hate how she's often introduced in political fics to be harem girl #3 who just happens to know exactly what to do to Harry. Luna is blunt, not hyper sexual. Any dirty line from Luna in an otherwise clean fic gets a close from me.
