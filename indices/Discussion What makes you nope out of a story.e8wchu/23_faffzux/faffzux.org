I just noped out of two stories that I saw rec'd on this site today.

1) linkffn(13191902) A fic called: Crushing News. I was really wanting a short best friends turn to lovers fic, with all sorts of tension, but had to Nope this one due to the writing style. Grammar and punctuation were all good. Words were used correctly. But it was written like a Downtown Abby episode, and I just couldn't take it. Harry called himself a "flagrant recidivist" at one point (he's a teenager in the nineties). Other people might like this sort of thing though?

And at least there was dialogue unlike this second Noper:

2) linkffn(13318951) This one is called the Archeologist, by Racke. The idea was so unique and I really wanted to like it. But it's just not really a story, and once I realized it, I had to Nope it. It's the very epitome of "Telling" not "Showing". I wasn't drawn in at all. I don't think there was a single instant of dialogue. The author clearly has a lot of potential (clear by the fact that they wrote so many words, put together a unique plot, and once again the grammar and spelling were great).

But here is my question: Do you normally review fics that you've Noped? I try to review anything that gets me past the first chapter. These two didn't, but the authors have potential. I want to encourage the authors, but it can be difficult to offer constructive criticism (especially on the second one, where I wanted to write something like: "This is a lovely idea, but you didn't write a story, you wrote an outline for a story. Please try again because I would love to actually read this story.") because I think it can easily be construed as flames--or hurt someone's feelings--or worst of all, make them want to stop writing altogether.
