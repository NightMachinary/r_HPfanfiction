I've come across a few fics whose authors were so lazy, half the story was a literal word for word rewrite of the books. Like they only bothered to write a few 'filler' scenes in most chapters. It was as annoying as it was insulting.

Mostly my gripes are when the characters, canon or oc, are so cookie-cutter basic and asinine that it's as though written by a twelve year old. This sadly seems to happen more then it should. I get that its fanfiction and fun and all, but it makes seeking out quality fics a chore sometimes.
