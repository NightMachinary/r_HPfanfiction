- Harems
- when the story is just a porn
- Lady Daphne Potter (there are some stories which manage to make Lords and Ladies bearable, and everybody loves The Importance of Intent, but the combination of the lordship and Daphne is 100% death of the story)
- super!Harry (or anybody else)
- god!Harry or direct relationship with $DEITY or some other super!person (my uncle Lord Drakula who actually rules everything)
- conspiracy theory (Voldemort and everybody are just playthings in the hands of Foo)
- slash and femslash (nothing against homosexuals in The Real Life, but it seems to me 99,9% of all slash stories are written by straight guys who want to exercise their CENSORED on it)
- many (not all) fem!Harry stories ... see point above (but yes, there are exceptions, some fem!Harry stories are decently written)
- underage sex, just say no (why, oh, why The Bonds of Blood turned into something so bloody awful after so nice start?)
- too long copies of books/films without their own creativity
- good Death Eaters, Drarry, Dramione, not mentioning any pairing with Tom Riddle or Bellatrix
