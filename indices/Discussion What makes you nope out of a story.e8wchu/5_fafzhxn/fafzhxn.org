Poor spelling and grammar.

Stupid nicknames: Moldyshorts, Mione, Prongslet/Cub, etc.

Using "Auroras" instead of "Aurors" (they are dark wizard catchers, /not/ disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by solar winds!)

Making up weird words like mapoppy. Especially with little to no explanation. Or a stupid explanation, with all due offence.

The standard pack of mpreg, a/b/o, death eater romances, and underage.
