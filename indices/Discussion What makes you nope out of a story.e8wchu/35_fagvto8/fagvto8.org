What makes me nope out usually is just bad writing - if it's too poor quality, it's hard to stomach, particularly when it adds in bashing or other over the top elements.

Other things that can make me drop is when I can't see a change as reasonable - for instance, Harry changing overnight after a supposedly canon first three books. It takes a bit more build up to flip someone's personality and relationships from canon.

Oh, and sometimes there are really creepy single lines or laughable passages that can make me drop some. For instance, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/d9a5w3/whats_a_line_in_a_fanfiction_that_made_you_nope/][another thread]]
