Well for me i nope out almost immediately if there is weasley bashing.

Dumbledore bashing is close second.

I hate stories where Harry and or Hermione(Ron is not in the list because he rarely has this trope written about him. The only one i read was where fate intervined and made Hermione and Harry get together for a small amount of time so that he would get hurt andleave to train for the power. It was a fun read as you could see the characters really hating themselves for cheating on Ron, and how the story actually resolves.) become God level powerful for no reason at all. I mean come on who likes to read a story where the main protagonist doesnt face any challenge or growth at all?

Lordship fics are also a no for me because of these reasons. Suddenly Harry is Lord Potter and Black and owns half the magical community.

Dramione - Most of these fics have Weasley bashing in order for the 2 of them to get together. I mean seriously everything Draco did is ok as he didnt identify them once, and everything Ron did is bad because he left the group because he was under the influence of the horcrux. Nope cant agree to that.

Harmione - I just dont like this pairing. Somwhow it never feels right. Though it might be my bias based on their characters.

Good Death Eaters - Just No.

Good Voldemort and evil Order - No. Just NO.
