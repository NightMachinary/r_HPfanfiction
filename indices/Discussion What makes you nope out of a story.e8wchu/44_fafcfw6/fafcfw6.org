2 annoying things for me are, 1, when everyone is obsessed with Harry and basically worship him, like omg you're the best quidditch player ever and the strongest wizard ever and you have the biggest dick ever, like take it easy, I get it Harry is incredible, the endless rambling just makes me want to stop reading.

2, when authors write stupid meta shit, like Harry's thinking and he's like wow wouldn't it be crazy if they wrote a book about this and how would anyone believe all the amazing things I've done? And they keep beating that point dead summarizing books and past/future events
