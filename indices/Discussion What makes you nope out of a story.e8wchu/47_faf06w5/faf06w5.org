-when they make Hernione a main character or just make her seem like a mary sue. She's not my favorite but seriously I'm tired of seeing her portrayed as being so perfect. I blame the movies for that one

- plots like soul mates/ marriage law/ getting married to stop the war/ I'm kinda iffy on time travel because they're usually alike

- Harry with a different name and/or living with the Malfoys

- OCs

- certain pairings like Ginny/Harry
