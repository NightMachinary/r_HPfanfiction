This kind of question gets asked a lot here. I dont read canon rehashes, fics containing perfect characters without flaws, and the oversexualization of children under 15. Harem, MPreg and ABO are reasons for immediate disqualification. Since I am not a native speaker orthographic mistakes dont bother me that much.
