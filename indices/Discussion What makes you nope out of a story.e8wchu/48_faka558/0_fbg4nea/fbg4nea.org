I think the Snape one can be done, only if you fundamentally change the timeline, I don't buy into the 'Snape adopts Harry' trope, or the Snape/whoever pairings, if you go back and change his actions against Lily at Hogwarts, then it's doable because that moment of trauma determines how he acts going forward imho
