First person perspective. Keep trying to get over it but just can't.

Any time that Snape is made out to be a misunderstood angel. He's a bullying ass with severe issues, and people make him out to be this paragon of good. Oh and anything that pairs Snape with anyone as the main plot point - cause it's usually Harry or Hermione.

Goblins can solve all your problems as long as you say “please/may you skull fuck your enemies while making a shit ton of gold” or some similar garbage.

This is one that sometimes I can get past if the fic is short and the premise is good - all the characters talk the same way. They all have the same cadence to their lines, to the point where if the name isn't mentioned it's hard to tell who's talking.

MPREG, extreme bashing, g8er gud Dumbledore, pairing people with Death Eaters
