Bad writing, of course.

Lord and Lady whoever, especially if their last name is something really very non-noble like Potter or Smith. I'm sorry, I just can't see it.

Any fic where little 11 year old Slytherins act like 37 year old politicians instead of 11 year olds. I don't care how ambitious they are, they're still little kids.

This one is rather niche - any fic where Hermione and Draco accidentally bond over their mutual fondness for Jane Austen. I'm sorry, I just don't see it. I don't see Draco being a secret fan of Muggle fiction, and honestly? I don't think Hermione reads that much fiction either, even if she could somehow find the time in between redoing her homework, knitting SPEW hats, studying, cramming, haring off on adventures with the boys, nagging at the boys to study, reading ahead in the curriculum, and worrying about her test results. If she DOES have any extra time in the day for reading she probably spends it on catching up on useful subjects Hogwarts doesn't seem to teach, like advanced mathematics. If Hermione read fiction she probably would've caught on to Beedle the Bard a bit faster, because she would've read that instead of Hogwarts, a History for the zillionth time. I know /we/ all like fiction, and everybody loves the obvious connection between Dramione and Pride and Prejudice, but it just doesn't work.

Any fic where Snape is paired with one of his students. He is literally old enough to be all of their fathers. And he's their teacher for 7 years. I don't care if they are all consenting adults, I don't like it.

People calling Hermione 'Mione. I don't nope out just for that, but it makes me very wary.

MPreg. If you don't have a uterus or ovaries, no amount of buttsex can make you pregnant. (It's okay if they DO have the requisite parts.)

Soulmates, magical cores, the vast majority of crossovers.

Any story where it turns out that there's no objection to Hermione dating the bigoted pureblood of her choice because actually their parents are very nice and anyway she was always secretly a pureblood.
