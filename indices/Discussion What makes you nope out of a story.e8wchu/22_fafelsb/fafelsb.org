Contrived angst, like splitting permanently or temporarily up the main couple for stupid reasons, most instances of rape of a main character that should have been avoided easily, betrayal from the main love interest that feels like a plot device to make the main character miserable for little effort, stuff like that.

Most of that stuff makes me burn inside, if there is no guarantee of a fix to the situation or an improvement soon by means of an author's note or a chapter comment, I tend to quit the fic for a while or forever to “cool off.” I have issues with emotions such as intense jealousy or fury and find reading things that evoke them in me to be hazardous to my health and well-being.
