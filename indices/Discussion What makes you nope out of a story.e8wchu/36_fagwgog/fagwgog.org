I was at the 4th book when I started finding these things that are driving me nuts and I decided to go on until the end (I'm almost done though! Thank goodness!).

Delores Umbridge (in this one), or any other misspellings (even if it's just names) would nope me out of a fic.

The author constantly contradicts themselves!!!!! Latest example: "We put him in a magical coma for healing, we will wake him tomorrow". Next chapter!!!!: After 3 days, he still didn't wake up from his coma.

So, generally;

bad English: bad spelling, grammar, punctuation, whatever or at least English at a lower level than mine (what I don't know is a mistake can't bother me XD). It works also for other languages, but there just aren't enough fics for me to read in my mother's language - so English it is...

Consistency: keep your plot in check, don't let it contradict itself, don't change the history mid-story. I'm binge-reading. I'll know.

Bad English - I'll be gone in a chapter at most. Many inconsistentancies - I won't bother finishing it.
