English isn't my first language so usually I'm pretty lenient on spelling. One thing that does bother me is long paragraphs. You know, when the author just forgets to start a new paragraph and creates a wall of text. It makes reading more difficult because the lines sometimes start blurring.

Story- wise: Pairing the good guys with Death Eater scum makes me nope out pretty quickly. Draco and Snape are somewhat redeemable, I suppose. With *lots* of work. And this work needs to be done by the author, mind you, to convince their readers. Far too many stories just have canon Draco and Snape without even an attempt at redeeming them. But Bellatrix and Voldemort in any sort of romantical or sexual situation? No thanks.

Romance and/ or sex can be pretty boring when the story is centered around them. There is plenty of smut and cheesy romance novels out there. I read Harry Potter for the cool, out of this world stuff like magic, battles, flying, magical creatures, etc. Romance and sex can be boring compared to that since most people can and do experience them in their day to day lives. And the worst thing someone can do is write about boring day to day stuff. I want the interesting stuff that I can't experience- space flight, combat, aliens, wizards, lasers, wands, etc. Compared to that romance is just- meh.

Oh, evil Harry is a big no-no for me as well. Dark is okay if it's done well and he still fights Death Eaters and Voldemort.

I'm also not a huge fan of stories about the kids from the epilogue. Partly because I don't want to acknowledge the epilogue, but mostly because I can't be arsed to remember all their stupid names. I probably would remember them if they were somewhat original but all the kids are named after already existing characters and it can get confusing real quick.
