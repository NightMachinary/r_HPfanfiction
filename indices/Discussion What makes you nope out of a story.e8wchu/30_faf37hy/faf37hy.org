Harems. Female leads (most of the time anyway) Smut, weird tags (and too many) Unlogical explanations for a main characteristic of the story (marriage laws.. Such as Harry has to marry Snape or Draco, Alpha/Beta/Omega stories..) Stories where there are literally no straight people left in this godforsaken world (like I dont have anything against LGBTQ but some things just go too far imo)
