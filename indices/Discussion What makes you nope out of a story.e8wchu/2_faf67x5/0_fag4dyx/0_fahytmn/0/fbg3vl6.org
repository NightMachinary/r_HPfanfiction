I think the Hadrian/ Lordships thing is generally a sign of a fic from a certain era. Would not nope out just because of it, but I'm very careful with fics from before mid 2007, the publication of the last book in Canon. They tend to include a lot of heavy revenge on Snape by Harry etc.

They became very popular around 2005ish from what I've seen, until about 2013.

My problem with them is they are mostly edgelord fics written by teenagers, so the standard of writing is shit. There are some decent Lord fics around, but mostly the ones where they don't make Harry a Lord himself, for example Delenda Est by Lord Silvere is a good fic in my opinion, because it takes a lot of the tropes from that era and inverts them, so it has time travel, but it focuses on Bellatrix Black, not Tom Riddle or the Marauders, it has Lordships, but Harry is just a normal teacher at Hogwarts with no title . The sequel to it is just powerwanking crap though.
