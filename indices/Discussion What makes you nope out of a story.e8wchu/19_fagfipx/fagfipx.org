Harry becomes everything a pureblood is I.e. Super hidden pedigree(Tom riddle is related to slytherin), Throw money around make problems go away (Lucius Malfoy), im Lord such-and-such therefore respect me (any rich pureblood), Power is everything and I know obscure magic, im curb stomping everyone(Tom riddle), becomes extremely prejudiced about something.

Gringott and Goblins solve all his problems by thowing money or being nice to them(I mean sure Brits arent Canadians but I swear they are the most polite if not sarcasticly so that ive met)

Harry gets new powers with no particular purpose just to add on the fact he gets special powers.

Harems because he can and the girls end up as minions to do his bidding, with no characterization or anything just Harry is so Awesome so we decided to share and help whatever plan he has making little comment to show we are part of the planning.

No self consistency.

The story heading to one direction and goes elsewhere. (looking at you partial kissed heroes, I like the fae and stuff so I pushed through but you just have to time travel to 'save Harrys parents' and mess around.)

More importantly Wife Husbandry or raising someone who end ups with them because they are not blood related so its fine to raise or help raise someone to be the ideal lover. (this killed a lot of time travel Harry, Harry raises TMR or Harry is raised by someone for me)
