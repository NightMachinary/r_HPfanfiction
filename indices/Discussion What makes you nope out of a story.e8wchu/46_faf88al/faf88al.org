Things that are extremely unrealistic are the biggest reason I stop a fic. Now before someone says it's a world about wizards that's not realistic, I mean unrealistic in the world that they exist.

I was reading a fic the other day where 10yr old Harry was more independent than a 20yr old. I just wish the author had said I'm aging up my characters rather than have 10yr olds acting like their full-grown adults. To me that's unrealistic it ruins the story for me because it doesn't fit the situation presented. I'm sure it was a good fic, and I'm sure plenty of people liked it, but things like that ruin it for me. Other small things that break the rules of magic, "The Weasleys just magic'd themselves some galleons and weren't poor anymore." also are a nope for me.

I'm fine with character bashings(I'm all in on the bash train), I'm fine with harems, I'm fine with blood adoption and soul contracts, lordships, etc. as long as it logically fits the narrative presented and is cohesive.

Also certain pairings, Harry/Ginny and Draco/Hermione are stories I'll never even begin to read.
