Ron bashing - he's everyman. We'd all be as human in his place.

Anyone non-Slytherin and Draco. He's an ineffectual, cowardly, bigot. I can't see anyone on the anti-Voldemort side giving him the time of day. There's no sign he's learned anything by the end of the series. I've never seen anyone write a convincing redemption arc.

Anyone with anyone old enough to be their parent. At least not until the youngest party is at least 30.

Pureblood culture - there's no sign of it in canon and outside of canon all you get is a lot of weird etiquette, the sort that's famous the world over as a method of keeping out the plebs while not actually providing any positive benefit. Besides, everybody who writes it just copies off everyone else - Heir Longbottom anyone? Weird how pureblood culture never seems to include pureblood Mozart or Shakespeare.

Weird sex - A/B/O, Littles, pedophile relationships, soul marks, harems.

Anyone and Snape - he's spent over a decade obsessing over a dead woman. There isn't room for a real relationship, espectially not with a boy litterally young enough to be his son.
