I can see how that could be thought of that way... but the way I remember it is: the flair is from YOUR perspective. That is, are you REQUESTING something? Or are you RECOMMENDING something?

â€‹

*Request* - Asking the community to give you stories that meet your requested criteria

*Recommendation* - Is when you just finished some totally awesome story and you want to recommend it to everyone else to read.

*What's That Fic* - Is when you can't remember the name a story, but you think you can remember a couple details or maybe a whole scene from it and you want to see if anyone else can recognize it and help you out.
