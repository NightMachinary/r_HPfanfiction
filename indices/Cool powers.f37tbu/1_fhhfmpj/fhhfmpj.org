It's in an AU where Voldemort wins the first war and Harry's parents are still alive. It's pretty dark but Harry is still a good character. He catches the attention of Voldemort and he becomes a sort of mentor to Harry/ friend. Harry ends up having a unique ability that helps him win the tri tournament. It's incomplete but still updates, irregularly.
