I'd really like to see a story take place in the wilderness, like a survival situation. Maybe [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA/featured][Primitive Technologies]] but in younger magical form. There was one that was a WIP and I thought it was really good but the author stopped writing and took it down. Besides that one, and ignoring the fictional Forbidden Forest, as far as the UK goes it's very hard to find a proper wilderness. It's just too small of a place. The story I mentioned above had to manufacture a location. Sure the scenery in DH during their walkabout was very well photographed but even those locations are fairly close to civilization. I'd like to see a massive coniferous forest with actual threats like fast moving streams, wolves, bears, and winter.

Other than that, though its been done before, magical settlements in the oldest human regions such as the fertile regions near the Tiger, Euphrates, Nile, Yellow, and Indus rivers. The history of those regions could be created and explored and be very interesting if done right.

Unfortunately, just being in those areas does not create interesting conflict, and at the same time, creating such conflict through external forces inherently takes away from the experience of the setting.
