The Bermuda Triangle would be interesting given the infamy of the place: anything that goes in never comes out, at least that how muggles see it. Maybe the Bermuda Triangle could be the location where Dementors originated from and why nothing has ever came out of Bermuda Triangle. What if muggles aboard the ships/planes that go though the Bermuda Triangle get their souls ripped out, then the Dementors simply vanish the entire boat/plane along with all the soulless bodies.

The Muggle World only thinks of the Bermuda Triangle as a place which is known for its reputation of things and people never leaving when they go in. In reality, the wizards know the truth that the Bermuda Triangle is the breeding ground of Dementors. It helps that the Bermuda Triangle is called the Bermuda *Triangle*, as in trinity, or three. Given how three and seven (mainly the latter) are the main numbers of magical significance in the series.

Just think of other places with mythical or historic significance that could be connected to magic. Bermuda Triangle is already explained. Area 51 is associated with government secrecy/conspiracy so maybe a magical place is hidden there. Stonehenge is self-explanatory given what the place is. The Nazi death camps could work if its written during the Grindelwald war as a muggle side-plot for the main thing that is Dumbledore vs Grindelwald. The Amazon Rainforest would be a great setting given how big it is and how many magical creatures it could hold... maybe Voldemort could have went to South America to learn about certain aspects of magic he couldn't elsewhere, since didn't Dumbledore say Voldemort travelled the world to learn many things. Maybe he learnt about the Regeneration Potion and the dark ritual (bone of the father, flesh of servant, and blood of an enemy) from GoF on one of his journeys across the world.

Antarctica as a whole peaks my curiosity given how, IIRC, it hasn't been really brought up in canon or on Pottermore. I wonder what magical secrets could be hidden there.
