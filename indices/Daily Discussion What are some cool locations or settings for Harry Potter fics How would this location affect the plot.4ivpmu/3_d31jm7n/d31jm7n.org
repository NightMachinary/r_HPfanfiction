I personally would love to read one where Harry grows up in the alps. Just because I grew up there. If we'd go that way, Harry's difference could start with the fact that he speaks German first and foremost. He would expect to go to Durmstrang. He would know about Nurmengard instead of Azkaban...... a thousand things.

How would it affect the plot? Well... Any plot that would be set in Austria, Germany or Switzerland would be affected by the location, now wouldn't it?
