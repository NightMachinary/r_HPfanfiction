This is ridiculous and probably also garbage since I'm not funny or a good writer but I wanted to write it so whatever. It's also not really related to this but inspired by the idea of an unorthodox setting.

--------------

COLD OPEN - a dark bank vault, shadows in every corner. Loud banging sounds come from the ceiling, and a loud drunken man slurs insults to no one.

The grate in the ceiling swings open, and STERLING ARCHER, master spy, swings down like a spider with his NIGHT VISION GOGGLES and a BOTTLE OF CHEAP RUM. The lights flicker on, and Archer SCREAMS LIKE A BABY, tearing the goggles from his face. His comlink drops from his ear to the ground, and LANA KANE is heard laughing. The world fades from oversaturation into normalcy, revealing a RICHLY-STOCKED VAULT, with GOLD and JEWELS littering the floor and SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES set in the walls.

The KING COBRA in the corner swings around to hiss at the intrusion. The OTTER pauses in its industrious loading of the TERRIER'S POUCHES with huge gemstones, hands frozen in midair like a deer in headlights.

--------------

Cut to LANA KANE in her RIDICULOUS SPY VAN. Krieger's WEIRD GIRLFRIEND watches the monitors and giggles while LANA KANE goes back to ignoring the comlink to continue arguing into her phone.

LANA KANE: "Abbiejean is /three/, she couldn't possibly have - No, Mr. Whitehall, I don't think there's a pattern here! AJ is not some kind of international secret agent or something that could orchestrate-"

The COMLINK lights up.

STERLING ARCHER: "Uhh... Hello there! Don't mind me."

--------------

STERLING ARCHER turns his back on the animals and begins rifling through the SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES. He pulls out a key and starts trying to match it with random locks. Behind his back, the COBRA shakes its head in a confused way, then hisses at ARCHER.

ARCHER: "Okay, so, just so you know, that'd be a lot scarier if you had your eyes open. It doesn't matter anyways, you three can have all this if you..."

ARCHER trails off.

ARCHER: "What do animals even do with precious gemstones? Are you animal... hippies or something? Returning nature to the earth?" ARCHER chuckles, unaware his joke WAS NOT FUNNY.

The comlink on the floor crackles to life as LANA shouts into the phone. "Toddlers can't make things fly! Fucking public schools!"

ARCHER: "And by the way, Chewbacca, your little bandolier is /adorable/."
