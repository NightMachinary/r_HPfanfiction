If you do decide to go ahead and write this, I'd suggest finding somebody who knows a bit about genealogy to work on numbers. When Sumer existed, the world population was almost certainly under 100 million. I dunno exactly what you'd end up with, but I'm certain the wizarding population in the modern day would have to be larger than we see if your scenario occurred.

It also doesn't explain everywhere else. By that time, humans had long since spread throughout the Earth. Whatever Ubara did, he certainly didn't need to do it to each individual village and town and wandering tribe, otherwise every non-western civilization would have had fully magical populations.

Also, if any sufficiently intelligent creature can perform magic, why not animals? There are lots of ways to measure intelligence, and some animals will surprise you. Dogs are incredibly socially capable, crows are creative problem solvers, whales communicate with complex vocalizations, and so on. How intelligent, and in what way, does something actually have to be in order to use magic? This isn't relevant to the overall concept, but if you are going to try to justify magic, you'll want to rethink exactly what you're going for.

I think the premise is good. That is, muggles are the result of ancient magic, and what the consequences would be of removing that magic. A lot of authors have experimented with it, myself included, but I've never actually seen it fleshed out. If muggles are the result of suppressed magic, then that suppression originally occurring in the ancient world is the most logical time, otherwise you run head-on into conflicts with recorded history. Still, if you run with this, you'll want to work on the details.
