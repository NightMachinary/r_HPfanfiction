  It also doesn't explain everywhere else. By that time, humans had long since spread throughout the Earth. Whatever Ubara did, he certainly didn't need to do it to each individual village and town and wandering tribe, otherwise every non-western civilization would have had fully magical populations.

I had the same thought. Maybe instead of him cursing his enemies, he found a way to curse /everyone/ but spare those who were loyal/useful to him (his servants, armies, etc) and all wizards and witches are descended from them.

To answer the OP, fuck no would I help that guy. Humanity would last a year, tops.

A deviation to the story could be that someone finds a way to lift the curse from /individual/ muggles, not all of them. Maybe a muggleborn who is sick of being treated badly, makes himself some magical muggles to overrun the purebloods.
