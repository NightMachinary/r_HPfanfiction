There's a few things he could do to limit the size of the Wizarding population.

1. There's a very small amount of people who weren't cursed. Possibly only the person who made the curse.

2. Tweaking how common squibs are. If a wizard marries a muggle, then the genetics will be more like muggles, and more likely to be hit by the curse. Once people forget about the curse, this would be much more likely to happen, as they'll forget why they're intermarrying.
