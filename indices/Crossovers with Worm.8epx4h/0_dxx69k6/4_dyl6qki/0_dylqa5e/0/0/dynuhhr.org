Eh, I don't truly classify the Firebird trilogy as a harem trilogy, mostly (entirely) because it is about inverting the fanfiction view of harems as great things.

I honestly think he's done with the harem thing. Might still be down with writing new polyamorous relationships because of The Stars Alone, but since that was a sequel to an older fic of his, I'm not confident in that.
