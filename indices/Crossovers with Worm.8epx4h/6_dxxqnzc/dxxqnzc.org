In [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/yer-a-witch-taylor-worm-hp.340965/][/Yer a Witch Taylor/, by Kevin Vacit]], Taylor triggers with a power of a Potterverse witch. Unfortunately, there is no Hogwarts for her to attend, so she has to figure it out herself. Probably abandoned, but what's written is very amusing.

I've also been thinking that the following could be a coherent prophecy, issued in the 1930s:

#+begin_quote
  Three legions come, seeking eternity, two to pass, one to stay: one a bride who slept through her wedding night, one a man seeking godhood, and one a god become man. Two shall gift power to those least fit to wield it, one to those most fit to take it. Two shall mark their bodies, one their mind. One shall take for themself, one shall give of themself, and one shall be sacrificed for the good of man. Three legions come, seeking eternity.
#+end_quote

Voldemort is a "legion" due to his split soul, who abandons his humanity, seeking to transcend it by living forever (on Earth); empowers Death Eaters, marking their bodies with the Dark Mark; all to take power for himself. Zion is a "legion" of semiautonomous shards, just passing through to gather information; a god (for all practical purposes) appearing as man, who empowers the least sane people through trigger events by distributing pieces of himself; and who alters the minds of parahumans to seek conflict. Eden is like Zion, but failed to initiate the cycle ("slept through her wedding night"); empowers Cauldron by being killed for the sake of humanity, shards distributed to empower heroes (mostly); with those heroes often left with physical deformities.

More generally, am I the only one who thinks that Taylor Hebert is a smart-girl sidekick archetype like Hermione and Sakura (from /Naruto/), but forced by circumstances to be the protagonist of her own story?
