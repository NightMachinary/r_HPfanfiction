A great idea, but would be a huge undertaking for any fanfiction writer due to the nature of having to kill in the HP universe and having sufficient knowledge of dark souls lore (which is very broad and is nowhere near encapsulated in your brief description). The alternative would of course be to send Harry to the dark souls verse, but would perhaps lose it's HP flair upon doing so...

*tl;dr*

It's damned hard to write good crossovers, even more so a Dark Souls one.
