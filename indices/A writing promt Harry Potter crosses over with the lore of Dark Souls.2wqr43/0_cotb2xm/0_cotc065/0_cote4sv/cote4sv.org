Upon rereading your description of Dark Souls, I think you've brilliantly summarized the basics of Dark Souls progression, which may lead to others writing a "gaming/rpg-progression" based fic as opposed to a fic that captures the bleak, yet driven atmosphere that Dark Souls has. I think your "quick basics" could note that the vague-backstory to the dark souls protagonist, and the relatively rogue-like feeling to exploration in dark souls (on your first or second runs) are intentional, and that you could make direct references to various points in the game that would make it clear why a Dark Souls crossover would be so appealing.

Otherwise, a great idea that would require quite a bit of research and effort in its undertaking. Apologies for my long-winded explanations... :/

*tl;dr again*

I write incredibly long replies and your description is only missing direct references interspersed with some insight into Dark Soul's unique atmosphere.
