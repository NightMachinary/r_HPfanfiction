#+begin_quote
  For the first time in seven years, Cedric Diggory won't be on the start-of-term Express to Hogwarts. Instead, his friends return to school for their final and most stressful year, still trying to adjust to the loss of their best mate amidst rapidly-escalating tensions in the classrooms and the corridors. Together, they must negotiate Quidditch, life, love, and learning, all while the Ministry of Magic is more intent on disrupting their education than dealing with the looming threat of the most feared dark wizard of the age - and that's without the small matter of the end-of-year exams that will affect the rest of their lives.A story about keeping on, about keeping it together. A story about keeping up.
