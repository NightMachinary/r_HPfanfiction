Three recommendations all of then nextGen (somehow, those stories have tendency to be less crazy):

1. It is on Wattpad, but I really like exactly for being normal [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/12122491-dursley%27s-daughter-a-harry-potter-next-generation][Dursley's Daughter by writerer]] and its sequel (unfortunately unfinished) [[https://www.wattpad.com/story/51279347-dursley%27s-dilemma-sequel-to-dursley%27s-daughter][Dursley's Dilemma]]. The non-fanfiction story which came to me most (aside from some TV series like Joan of Arcadia) was Kipling's “Stalky & Co.”, just the stories from the everyday life of students at Hogwarts. I like it very much.

2. linkao3(373224) there is a bit of drama and the great adventure in the end, but most of the story is just the student story life.

3. Whole series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]. I am in the middle of the fourth rereading it, so I am temporarily very biased (aren't you also often persuaded that the thing you just finished is the best story ever written?), but I think it is one of these three best nextGen stories. And certainly the best Dudley-has-magical-daughter story, but that's misleading because aside from being such it is so much more.
