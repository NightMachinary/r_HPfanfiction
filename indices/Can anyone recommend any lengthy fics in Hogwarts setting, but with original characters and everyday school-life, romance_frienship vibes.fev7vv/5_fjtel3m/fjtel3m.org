Here's an easy way to find some, especially if you enjoy fanfics of another fandom as well- search on AO3 in the HP category and then select "only crossovers." For example, I also like Teen Wolf fanfic (even though I watched the show only once) and love reading those characters in an HP setting. However, I've also read crossover fics of fandoms I barely know anything about but still immensely enjoyed it.
