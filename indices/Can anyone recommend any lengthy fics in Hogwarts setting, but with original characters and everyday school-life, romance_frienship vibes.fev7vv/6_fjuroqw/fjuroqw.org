Try Etc Etc -- and Life Goes On, linkffn(7217938). Romance/humour, pretty long at just above 100k, next-gen with Albus & OCs and such.

Also try Haggis from Algernon, linkffn(3687255). It's Marauder's Era and written as a bunch of humorous diary entries from the perspectives of Lily & James. Has a lot of that school-life vibe.
