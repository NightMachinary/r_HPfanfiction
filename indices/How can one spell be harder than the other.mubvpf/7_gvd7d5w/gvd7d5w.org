How is playing football/soccer "harder" than playing a violin? Anybody can learn to cook dinner, but not everybody has the creativity to be a chef.

People have different natural talents. You can improve on a natural talent (high or low) with practice, but there's a limit to how much improvement you can achieve. Somebody with a low talent but lots of practice can still lose to a talented amateur.

In your example, however, a shield spell is more difficult because it takes SUSTAINED effort. It's not a cast-once-and-it's-set: you have to hold the spell the entire time you want to be shielded.
