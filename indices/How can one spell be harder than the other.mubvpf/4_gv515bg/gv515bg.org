I always assumed mages harnessed the energies of the world around them to do magic. In my mind, a difference in power refers to the amount of energy a person can draw within themselves, as well as the ability to convert that energy into something you control, in order to use it productively.

Some magic requires more power, which is why some people struggle. Their lack in power might be counteracted by the application of what power they do have, however.
