Well from what I gathered in the books, magic is kind of about concentration and intent, so it depends on how much you concentrate and want it ? Thats seems to be the case with accidental magic in children and the crucio.

Apparently some spells need more magic than other spells, or i like to think that they need you to be more in control of your magic. Hence why first years are taught simple spells, and the patronus i.e is more for the newt level. It doesn't mean one can't cast it (harry did) but you need to put more effort ? It seems like it was easier to cast by the D.A members in 5th year.

  I mean, what does talent in transfiguration, or charms even entail?

Maybe it means someone is more confortable doing that kind of magic. The books made it sound like transfiguration was kind if difficult ? So i guess it's just like in normal life when some prefer maths over history or something like that. The more you like something, the easier it comes to you because you enjoy doing it and put more effort in it.

I don't know if there is such thing as "amount of magic" in a person. Some witches and wizard are more powerful than others we can't deny it. ( take Dumbledore and Voldemort as an exemple) but was it because of their magic or did it come with hard work ? No idea.
