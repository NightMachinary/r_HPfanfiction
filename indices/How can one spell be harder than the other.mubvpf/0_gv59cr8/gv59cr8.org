Okay, so I hand you a 1x2, a hand saw, and some wood glue. Make me a picture frame. Barring actual physical infirmity, everyone can do it. It'll look like crap, but you can do it. Hand those same tools to someone whose been practicing their woodworking for 20 years and they'll make you a better frame faster than anyone else can.

I did quite well in math courses in high school and college. Give me a integral problem right now, and I have serious doubts I'd be able to do anything with it. I wouldn't even know where to start. Give me a integral problem and a high school calculus textbook and I could probably work it out eventually. But give that exact same problem to high school me? No sweat.

Why should magic be any different? Why can't most cast a decent shield charm? The real question is why would they be able to! And if they don't need to cast the spell, why would they have practiced diligently?
