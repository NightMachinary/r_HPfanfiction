Well maybe they can't keep track of all the different wand motions for a wide range of spells?

For the Patronus it is explained that you need to focus on a happy memory which becomes increasingly difficult when Dementors are sucking the happiness from you so that requires a lot of willpower. The Unforgivables also require you to "mean them" and I think that implies you've actually got to want someone to die and not because of a moment of anger but because you really want them dead... which most normal people don't wish upon others. The summoning spell requires you to have a vivid image in your head of the target and someone not paying attention to details or with a wandering mind may not be able to properly cast it. The shield charm weirdly enough does not appear to be part of the curriculum as this is one of the self-taught spells by Harry in preparation for the Third Task. He later teaches it to the DA and Snape, who asks them to use it in his class, is surprised that so many people know how to cast it. So with it I think it's a matter of people not learning it in school and since they mostly experienced peaceful times until Voldemort's wars (prior to which he cursed the DADA position) it's probably that they never bothered much with knowing it.
