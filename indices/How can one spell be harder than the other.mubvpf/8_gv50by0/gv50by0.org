I'd like an explanation too!

Cannon really doesn't go in any depth about it but there are some hints that it may simply be a psychological thing so in my Headcanon it all depends in brain power.

That's the reason Hermione is such a powerful witch, because she can comprehend the theory better than others and therefore is easier for her to cast, this also applies to Harry in a slightly different manner. Being able to comprehend a spell allows Hermione the necessary confidence and emotional stability to cast it, on the contrary Harry doesn't really need to understand it he simply believes it will happen. This works on and off for Harry in classes but makes him a good wizard in battle where he has no time to doubt himself.

Continuing with my Headcanon I believe spells can be more or less complex in theory depending on things like Gamp's Laws and whatever magical theory there are teaching in those classes and how they were created.

So technically transfiguration of a match into a needle would be psychologically less difficult to imagine than the transfiguration of a rabbit into a house for example. They require the same amount of magic but different levels of conviction and/or discipline. Hermione is able to accomplish this by the understanding of transfigurations laws, wand movements and incantations and how they interact. Harry would be able to accomplish this by try and error and a superficial understanding.

Of course my Headcanon is rather vague and may not make sense depending on what are you applying it for...
