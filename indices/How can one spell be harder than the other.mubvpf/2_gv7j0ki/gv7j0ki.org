Your question is the same as to why some torture a piano simply looking at it, and some are Lang-Lang. I actually don't know if there is a satisfying answer in science on "what is talent". In everyday use, though, it simply means you have an "intuitive grasp", things "make sense to you" when looking at it once, it "comes easy to you" etc.

I see no issue extending this to the use of magic. Some people struggle to produce much of anything. For others, it's all there at their fingertips. And all this is of course excluding theory, which is perhaps the most directly comparable situation, to any IRL theory, Maths, Physics, ... Such theory is abstract, explaining connections and deeper issues. Some grasp this at once or even develop their own ideas. Others are happy if they can follow along recipes to use, and simply are unable to comprehend the theory.
