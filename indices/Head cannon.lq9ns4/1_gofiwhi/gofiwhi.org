First of all: it's canon, not cannon. Cannon with two n's is an older type of artillery.

With that out of the way, I'm currently partial to the notion that Hogwarts wasn't founded to be a school, or at least not in the style as seen in the books, because that kind of formalized education didn't come about until about 5 or 6 centuries after the castle's construction. Instead, Hogwarts Castle and the village of Hogsmeade were envisioned as a sanctuary for wizards and witches to live in, safely hidden away from the non-magical inhabitants of the British Isles in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands. That they'd also be able to nurture and guide future generations of Magicals in one centralized location was part of their decision to create it, but not the entirety.

This also ties into another piece of headcanon that I like, that wizards and witches had already been distancing themselves, to greater or lesser degrees, from their non-magical counterparts for centuries before the Statute came into being, with the Statute itself being little more than the finalization of the separation of the two societies.
