During the Christmas holidays of /Order of the Phoenix,/ the Lovegoods realized that something very bad had happened to Arthur when they stopped by the Burrow to give the Weasleys a present.

The Lovegoods spent the remainder of the holiday maintaining the Burrow's upkeep and assorted chores, while the Weasleys were at Grimauld Place.
