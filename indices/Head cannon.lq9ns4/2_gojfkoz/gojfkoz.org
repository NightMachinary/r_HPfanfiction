Dementors used to be solitary predators that lived in dark woods, preying on individuals that strayed from the path. They feed on despair, not hope, which is poisonous to them. Dementors would disable victims by sapping their will to live and slowly ridding them of poisonous happiness and hope. They would feed on the victims despair for days, until they reached the brink of death, at which the dementor would feast on their soul.

As civilization expanded and the dark forests of Britain shrunk, Dementor hunting tactics changed, and they would occasionally break into homes where humans lay dying, surrounded by the despair of their loved ones which choked out the hope that would have kept them at bay. They would take the soul of the dying one, whose body would fail soon afterwards. This is the reason for the similarities between the appearance of Dementors and the traditional personification of death.

As towns and villages grew and the dark places receded further, Dementors grew desperate and began banding together, using their combined energy to overwhelm the hope of humanity and storm villages, consuming the souls of all inside.

To stop the rampages it took both the creation of Azkaban as the carrot, and the patronus charm as the stick to create the uneasy alliance that protected the general populace from the dementors.
