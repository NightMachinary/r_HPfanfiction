Werewolves exist because of an ancient ritual to become an animagus. In the ritual, the wizard petitions the spirit animal to bond and use it's form. In this case, Wolf found the wizard lacking and refused. The wizard tried to force the issue and Wolf cursed his bloodline (curse spreads by spilling blood) with a twisted perversion of the wolf form.
