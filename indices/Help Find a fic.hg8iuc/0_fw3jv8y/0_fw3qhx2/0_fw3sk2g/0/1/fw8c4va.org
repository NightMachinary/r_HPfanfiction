I think I remember that fic also, but not what it's called.

As I recall, Harry discovered Slytherin's ghost while looking for something in Slytherin's study in the Chamber of Secrets. It turns out that Slytherin, as well as the other founders, are bound to the castle in a state half-way between life and death. Slytherin tricks Harry into completing a task for him that proves himself worthy of being Slytherin's chosen champion (or something like that).

The potion is something that Slytherin said would help Harry against Voldemort (maybe something to do with the horcruxes or mind magic? I forget what it was exactly.) Slytherin was helping Harry brew it, but then he claimed that he had to leave suddenly midway through the brewing. Thus, Harry had to run and somehow convince Snape to help, otherwise the potion would have a dangerous meltdown when it reached the next brewing stage. Later it turned out that Slytherin had set up the situation so that Harry would be forced into an alliance with Snape.
