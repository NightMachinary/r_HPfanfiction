It's an AU Dumbledore cos the fanfic is about how Harry travels to an alternative universe after Voldemort's been defeated. But I do like how Dumbledore's been characterized here and rhe relationship he shares with Harry. He's sneaky sure but he's not cartoon villain evil. Even Harry's original Dumbledore just has the things that happened in the books (well except for book 7).
