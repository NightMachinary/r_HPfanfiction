"Good Albus Dumbledore characterization" is my personal holy grail of fanfic, so I have accumulated... a lot. Broken into three loose categories:

Fics that focus on Harry & Dumbledore:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22190359][worth a thousand words]] linkao3(22190359) - oneshot (highly recommend the author's other HP stuff, too)
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13553343][Albus Dumbledore and the Boy Who Lived]] linkao3(13553343) - WIP
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5641464/1/Forgive-an-Old-Man][Forgive an Old Man]] linkffn(5641464) - oneshot
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8788265/1/Tis-the-Season][Tis the Season]] linkffn(8788265) - oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24458131][Fashion Advice and Butterbeer]] linkao3(24458131) - oneshot
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13308375/1/The-Petrov-Gambit][The Petrov Gambit]] linkffn(13308375) - oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14392005][pity the living]] - oneshot (I wrote this one, please forgive the self-promotion)

Dumbledore character studies, or thereabouts:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27507055][I Open at the Close [Dumbledore Oneshot]]] linkao3(27507055) - oneshot
- [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mpDBEsC3QscSlHi_YsIvQbLwZyad1231/view][ON THE VARIOUS METHODS OF MAGICAL TRANSLOCATION: A REVIEW]] - oneshot, written in the style of an academic paper, with Dumbledore as the author. Surprisingly readable, and Dumbledore's character shines through clearly.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17933951][The Duke of Hogsmeade]] linkao3(17933951) - complete
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10799454][Dulce et decorum est]] linkao3(10799454) - oneshot
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/278272][Wonderful Tragic Mysterious]] linkao3(278272) - oneshot

/Fantastic Beasts/ stuff:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16586783][dear forgiveness, i saved a plate for you]] linkao3(16586783) - oneshot, Dumbledore/Grindelwald
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18723142][Requiem For Love]] linkao3(18723142) - oneshot, Dumbledore/Grindelwald
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8629234][nobody else but me]] linkao3(17500265) - oneshot, Dumbledore/Grindelwald
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10994679][The Hog's Head Salon]] linkao3(10994679) - oneshot, past Dumbledore/Grindelwald
