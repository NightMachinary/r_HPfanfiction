  In the Department of Mysteries, Sirius Black lives, Lucius Malfoy dies, and everything changes. Draco, punished for his father's failure, is transformed by Fenrir Greyback into a werewolf, but Narcissa, rather than taking this as a lesson in obedience, abandons Voldemort's cause and turns to her sister Andromeda for help. As Draco struggles to adjust to his new life as a werewolf and a turncoat, he realizes that his only allies may be none other than his old professor, Remus Lupin, and (even worse) Harry Potter. Meanwhile, Sirius's near-death experience in the Department of Mysteries has brought with it side effects: the voices of the dead are calling to him from the other side, and they want something from him that he can't give.
