"So, in summary, Cedric Diggory was murdered right in front of me, Voldemort has returned, and the Ministry is denying everything, thus letting the aforementioned Voldemort build up again." Harry groaned.\\
"Essentially correct." Dumbledore confirmed.\\
"The Dursleys are no longer an option, as Voldemort's taking of my blood means that my mother's protection is potentially null. Not guaranteed null, but considering the nature of the risk it's simply too dangerous to test." Harry continued, his head face down on the desk.\\
"That is a valid concern." Dumbledore agreed.\\
"You are either a horrible manipulator who can't wait to see me die so you can claim the Potter vaults and/or the glory for beating Voldemort, or you're capital-G Good but inextricably wrapped up in enough bureaucratic red tape to resemble an egyptian mummy on fire." Harry grumbled.\\
"My lawyer recommends I remain silent on this matter." Dumbledore commented.

Harry sighed dramatically, before he held out his hand, palm-up. Sitting on top of it was an old wind-up key, just like one that you'd use to wind up an old toy.\\
"What's this?" the aged, manipulative, bureaucratically-mummified headmaster asked curiously.\\
Harry grumbled through the desk again, "Long version, a prototype 'Superspeed Spinner' that hastens perception and cognitive ability whilst diffusing various forms of kinetic resistance. Short version, slapstick comedy. Turn it."\\
Dumbledore shrugged and gave the key on Harry's hand a turn; at once, Harry stood up and began to sprint in place, as though he were blazing down a racetrack on foot, though he remained quite stationary.\\
Another turn; Harry's feet started to move faster. Another turn, Harry now looked as if he were doing a Sonic the Hedgehog impression.\\
Another turn-and suddenly Harry vanished with a howling gust of wind.

*Back in Dumbledore's office...*

Albus Dumbledore looked down at the handwritten note that had appeared on his desk.\\
/Dear Esteemed Headmaster/Manipulative Old Bastard (Sorry, I didn't bother to check which one you are in this plot),/\\
/There is no particularly articulate way to put this, sir/you wanker, so to be brief, I am getting out of here. No matter what crazy superpowers I have in this story (and yes, I'm fully aware that a device granting temporary superspeed would be of great use), I have no wish to try my luck against a homicidal dark lord, his entire army, an obstinate racist Ministry who I just KNOW will send Dementors to try and silence me, and whatever greedy schemes you're up to (if you are not a Manipulative Old Bastard, please disregard the previous with my apologies)./\\
/I feel I should elucidate, so to do so; when I write 'I am getting out of here', I do not just mean Hogwarts, nor do I mean merely leaving Britain. I mean 'I am getting out of here' as in the here and now, I am getting the heck out of this time period, stop the world, I want to get off. Having stolen a time turner from the Department of Mysteries, by the time you will have read up to this point I will have acquired a stockpile of food, camping gear, entertainment, and troubleshooting guides, and sent myself back in time approximately 5,000 years to live out my life on the most secluded island I could find in the Pacific./\\
/See ya!/\\

<Who is strange white creature? He look a bit like us.> One of the native hunter-gatherers asked.\\
Their chieftain shrugged, <He say he shaman from far, far future. Here to avoid fight with very big evil spirit. He bring much food and treat sickness in his magic big tent, so I not complain.>
