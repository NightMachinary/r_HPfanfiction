...Hey, something I have to ask about A Bad Week at the Wizengamot...if by magical contract the Ministry is dissolved, wouldn't that critically endanger the Statute of Secrecy? All it takes is one escaped dragon (ala Ilfracombe Incident) or one Death Eater attack caught on film and oh-dear.

I suppose said dissolution of the Ministry only lasts for all of one or two days in that fic, but in kb0's Marriage Law fic down below, that's an exodus with more longer lasting effects...the premise that a government failure/population exodus leads to nobody being able to respond to Statute breaches could be interesting to explore...
