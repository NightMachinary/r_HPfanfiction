I think it would work well if the hive mind turned out to be their natural state. If you free a house-elf, that's fine, because they still have their lifetime of cultural and psychological conditioning. But, if, say, Dobby and Winky reproduced, their offspring wouldn't, and would begin to revert. After a few generations, you'll get your hive-mind, seeking +cleanse+ clean the world.

I guess what I am saying is that Bellatrix's knife-throwing skills saved the world.

If I were to write a fic, I'd probably frame it as a horror story in which Hermione encounters a colony of free house-elves, who are friendly and helpful but also very insistent that she not disturb the order they have imposed on their part of reality---which is ever expending.
