I wrote up the set-up for a potential "Snape as a girl" AU some time ago... well, the prompt here was "Snape was a girl and James's childhood friend instead of Lily's," but I still kind of liked the resuit. I named the female Snape "Sevanna," by the way,,,,

Copy/pasting:

--------------

I thought about it. Let's take two things as read:

1: Severus Snape is a woman in this AU --- let's call her "Sevanna."

2: Sevanna Snape was a childhood friend of James, not Lily.

Okay. At once that means that Sevanna's childhood is very different. If she and James are friends before Hogwarts, she can't grow up in the Muggle world because James is pure-blood; she has to grow up in the wizarding world. And this probably means she grows up without an abusive father. Okay, fathers can be abusive in the wizarding world too, but canon Snape's father was a Muggle and abusive towards his wife and son. I don't believe a Muggle who lived in the wizarding would would ever be allowed to take it that far, so the easiest solution then is that Tobias Snape died and Eileen decided to move back to wizarding society, ending up living close to the Potter family.

So, Sevanna Snape would grow up different. Not the bitter, abused child with a temperamental father and a weak mother, an outsider in the Muggle world, but raised by a single mother in a wizarding world. Perhaps she would be neglected by the stressed Eileen... but in that case, I think Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, loving and indulgent parents as they were to James, would pretty much take her under their wing, and become like a spare set of parents for the girl.

In that case, it would be a much different, much happier, more loved and certainly less bitter Sevanna Snape who first started Hogwarts along with James. Given James's prejudices against Slytherin (which he would express when they first met Sirius Black), Sevanna would absolutely refuse to be placed in Slytherin. The Sorting Hat might try to put her there, but she would beg: "Not Slytherin! Not Slytherin! James would hate me!" And so I think she would end up --- not in Gryffindor with her beloved James, but in Ravenclaw.

Because if a Snape isn't a Slytherin, (s)he is a Ravenclaw.

Would a Ravenclaw Sevanna Snape still end up with a bad crowd and become a Death Eater? Hard to say, but I think the Potters would have influenced her enough that she didn't. She might get a little jealous when James started hanging out so much with his three new friends, Sirius, Remus and Peter... maybe she'd even get curious where they sneaked off to every month too... but the Snape/Marauders feud would not exist. Instead, there might end up to be a feud between Sevanna and Lily. I think James would, like in canon, be interested in Lily pretty early, and that would REALLY awaken Sevanna's jealousy. It wouldn't help that she and Lily had a lot of things in common: Both really talented witches, both favoured by Slughorn, both great with potions... and as time went on, both would be really interested in James. I could see a bitter rivalry growing between them, one that would get worse when James finally chose Lily.

What would Sevanna do then? Several possibilities. She might desperately try to throw herself at James. She might try to get Lily in trouble. She might just break all ties with them both and go off alone, heartbroken and embittered.

But. One thing strikes me. I still don't think she would join the Death Eaters. And so, there is nobody to overhear the prophecy told to Dumbledore, at least no-one that will tell it to Voldemort. Since the prophecy actually hinges on Voldemort knowing the first two lines... in this universe Trelawney does not make the prophecy. And so she isn't hired as Divination teacher, the subject is discontinued at Hogwarts, and Voldemort does not fall.

Voldemort never targets Lily and James, Sirius is never sent to Azkaban. Peter might still join the Death Eaters and act as a spy, but he doesn't get to frame Sirius for being the spy because he never gets such a perfect opportunity as the swapped Secret-Keepers. Instead he loses his nerve, fakes his death and high-tails it out of the country without anyone ever discovering his status as a double agent.

When Fleamont and Euphemia die shortly before Harry is born, Sevanna (who viewed them as a second pair of parents) makes up with James. She still does not get along with Lily, but has made her peace with the Potter family.

And so, Harry grows up with both his parents, but in a much darker wizarding world, knowing Sevanna Snape as "Dad's lady friend that Mum doesn't like." Voldemort still reigns, several people who lived in canon are killed in this universe. Hogwarts, still the only really safe place, becomes a bit of a refugee for Muggle-borns.

And the plot becomes another one entirely!

I haven't actually introduced her yet, or even really mentioned her, but Snape IS female in my current fanfic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12861492]["Holly Potter and the Witching World."]] Of course, in that AU, almost all the characters are female, with a few exceptions, and the plot is VERY different.
