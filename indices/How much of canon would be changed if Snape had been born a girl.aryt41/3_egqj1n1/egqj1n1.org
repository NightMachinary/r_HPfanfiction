Well... the cop-out answer is "not very if she's a lesbian", and that she would be a lesbian would be more or less inevitable, because not much of Snape's core remains if (s)he is not allowed to be madly in love with Lily Evans. And once you've granted that, you can just allow the whole canon plot to roll out with a few minimal pronoun switches. Sure, Snape's chemistry with certain secondary characters might be somewhat different (I imagine Bellatrix, in this scheme, would be even more antagonistic to Snape for being in good standing with the Dark Lord, because she would perceive this female Snape as even more of a romantic rival). But the basics could remain.

Naturally, if I had to write a story with this as a jumping-off point, I could perform all sorts of wizardry. For example, maybe female-Snape, what with maternal instincts and all that feels it is her duty to care for Lily's orphan, whatever Dumbledore says, and you end up with an unlikely take on Severitus. Or to go back further, maybe Petunia isn't quite so antagonistic to Severa as she was to Severus, and as a result Severa's accidental magic does /not/ nearly injure Petunia, and thus by induction you end up with a Petunia Dursley who doesn't hate magic with quite the same passion as her canonical counterpart. If it amuses you, and you wanted some shipping angst, maybe throw a wrench in the love triangle by having one of the Marauders develop a crush on Severa to mirror James's on Lily.

But none of that, I think, follows /necessarily/ from the premise, which, as I said, doesn't need to change very much at all.
