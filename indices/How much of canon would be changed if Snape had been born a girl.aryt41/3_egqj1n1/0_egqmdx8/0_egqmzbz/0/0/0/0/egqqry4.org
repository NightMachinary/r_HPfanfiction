  It's Orion and Walburga's house, she is from a different branch of the Blacks.

Perhaps I got mixed up with fanon, but I was under the impression that it was the general-purpose Black family home, which belonged to Orion and Walburga in Sirius's youth because they were the heads of the family, but also housed (or could house if need be) all the other members of the family.

It would have been entirely plausible for Rodolphus to move in with the Blacks rather than the other way around, is my main point, and it doesn't appear that that's what was done.
