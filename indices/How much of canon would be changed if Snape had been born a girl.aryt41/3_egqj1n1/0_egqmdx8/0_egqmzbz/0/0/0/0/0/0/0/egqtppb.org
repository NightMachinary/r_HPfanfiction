But is he the heir to the Black fortune or a heir to his parents' Black fortune? I always thought it's the latter. Sirius inherited only what Orion and Walburga had, and Cygnus and Druella's portion of estate went to their daughters (well, to Narcissa and Bellatrix, anyway). And if what you suggest about no sexism in the Wizarding world is true, than fandom ideas about male heirs cannot be canon.
