I don't suggest they are. Perhaps on balance your interpretation is right. But mine, that the Black fortune was never split, but rather passed down from eldest child to eldest child, also fits the evidence without requiring there to be sexism in the WW. Either Walburga and Orion was the heir to the Black fortune in the previous generation; therefore the fortune then goes to /their/ first child (whether that's a son or not).
