  that women still change their name when they marry,

Calling that evidence of any active sexism is stretching it, honestly. Besides, are we sure wizards never change their name to match their wife's? I'd say it depends on whether they're moving into the family or not, so to speak.

With her moving into the Burrow and all, Molly for all intents and purposes became a Weasley (she even had the red hair all along), so she took the name. Bellatrix presumably moved in with the Lestranges, since Grimmauld Place is derelict and long-abandoned.

And I can't think of any other examples. There /are/ a fair number of hyphenated names (Dagworth-Granger, Granger-Weasley, for example), too.

In fact, if we're bringing in /Pottermore/ stuff, McGonagall was married, yet she kept her name, so there's some evidence that it /is/ done.

  and it's called the "wizarding world" not the "witching world".
#+end_quote

"Wizarding" is the adjectival form of "wizardkind", and not really gendered per se, any more then "mankind" is. Sure, the fact that it was structured around the male rather than female form is evidence of the sexism of the society in which the English language developed, but I don't think that can be blamed on the modern Wizarding World with any fairness.

Also, I'll oppose that the most common name for practicing magic isn't "wizardry" but rather "witchcraft".
