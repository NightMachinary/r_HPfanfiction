  Yet "protect our sister's virtue" is canon and there seems to be some sexism in regards to the promiscuity of boys and girls, at least in the undertones.

Ginny (assuming you're talking about her) is both the youngest Weasley and the only sibling of her gender, making the protective attitude less definitively rooted in gender roles. Also, the Weasleys are stated to reject many aspects of magical culture (this is presented as a positive, but isn't necessarily entirely so) and are fairly regressive in many ways.

I agree Rowling implies quite a bit of sexism with her writing, but I personally feel it usually comes across as her own feelings bleeding through rather than a trait inherent to the world. I don't think it's a stretch to write a magical world with greatly diminished gended roles.

Gender segregation definitely makes this all moot in regards to the OP's question, though.
