  I think you're injecting Muggle gender politics into the Wizarding World (...) is that the Wizarding World is devoid of sexism and homophobia

It isn't even about sexism. Hogwarts segregates by gender. You spend a lot more time with the same sex, from dorms to friend circles. Therefore FemSnape would be bullied by girls more than by boys simply because she is way more exposed to and interacting with other girls.

  In a world where females don't have an inborn statistical disadvantage in a fight compared to males, there is unlikely to be a "hitting girls is wrong" taboo in place which would prevent the Marauders from picking on a female Snape.

Yet "protect our sister's virtue" is canon and there seems to be some sexism in regards to the promiscuity of boys and girls, at least in the undertones.
