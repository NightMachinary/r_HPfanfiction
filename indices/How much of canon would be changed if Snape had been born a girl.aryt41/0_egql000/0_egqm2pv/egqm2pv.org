  I'd say very much. I don't think Marauders would be very likely to bully her so much or even at all because power dynamics between boys and boys/girl is very different and James wouldn't see Snape as a competitor.

I think you're injecting Muggle gender politics into the Wizarding World. You can, of course, disagree as to the extent of it, but a perfectly valid interpretation of canon, and the most common one in the fandom, is that the Wizarding World is devoid of sexism and homophobia --- though it does have them, its prejudices are all its own (blood-purism, wizard supremacy). In a world where females /don't have/ an inborn statistical disadvantage in a fight compared to males, there is unlikely to be a "hitting girls is wrong" taboo in place which would prevent the Marauders from picking on a female Snape.

As for James seeing Severa as a competitor... that depends on whether you make Severa a lesbian, of course (I would say you should; Snape becomes nigh-unrecognizable if (s)he isn't in love with Lily). But if she /is/ romantically interested in Lily, and assuming by fiat either that Lily is bisexual, or James thinks she /might/ be, then the love rivalry can easily proceed forwards with no significant changes.

Similarly, it's not that Snape wouldn't get bullied by the other Slytherins at the start for being poor and Muggle-raised. But I don't think the bullying would be significantly worse for a girl than a boy.
