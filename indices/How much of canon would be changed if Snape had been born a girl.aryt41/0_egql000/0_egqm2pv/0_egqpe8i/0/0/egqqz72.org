Yes, it's true. I was mostly arguing that Severa is much less likely to become a Death Eater than Severus because she would be facing bullying from different people. She still could hate James's guts, I suppose. Or her story could go in a different direction completely, which I would prefer to see in a fic with fem!Snape.
