I don't think Snape necessarily needs to have burning hatred of anything Potter and be madly in love with Lily Evans to still be in character, just like you can write write Harry in a different house who has different friends than Ron and Hermione, and he still can be recognisably Harry. Fem!Snape would still be bad-tempered, insecure, talented, clever, spiteful, proud, obsessive (not necessarily over Lily), hold grudges forever (not necessarily on Marauders), be interested in Potions and Dark Arts, etc.

And I do think that out of all the HP characters, genderbender would affect Snape's life the most. I don't like reading fem!Harry fics precisely because I don't really believe canon would change in any significant way if Harry were a girl, but Snape is completely different story.

Edit: way too much typos.
