  Or her story could go in a different direction completely, which I would prefer to see in a fic with fem!Snape.

The problem is that if you take away "burning hatred of anything Potter", "way too into Dark Magic" and "madly in love with Lily Evans", there's not much /left/ of the core of the canonical Snape. Under those circumstances it would take a truly excellent writer not to make Severa into an OC who happens to be born in Snape's place, instead of an actual fem!Snape.
