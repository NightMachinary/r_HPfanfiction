Even if there's no sexism, girls and boys' hierarchies and bullying are still very different (vertical vs. cliques). Why would James/Sirius feel the need to pick on Severa (much)? Even if she were a lesbian, it wouldn't become an issue until years later, and James would likely consider Severa simply Lily's plain friend, a charity case.

I really do think a girl would be bullied much worse than a boy because of her looks and clothes, and we see enough catty behaviour in the books to prove that witches aren't above it any more than Muggles.

I also think Snape doesn't need to be a lesbian for there to be a deep connection between her and Lily. Friendship can be just as meaningful, just look at Sirius and James. There's not enough female friendships in HP anyway. She can even have unrequited love for James in this scenario
