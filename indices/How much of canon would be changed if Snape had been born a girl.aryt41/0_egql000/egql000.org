I'd say very much. I don't think Marauders would be very likely to bully her so much or even at all because power dynamics between boys and boys/girl is very different and James wouldn't see Snape as a competitor. On the other hand, she would be bullied by other girls because of her looks and poor clothes, and those girls would more likely than not be her fellow pureblood Slytherins.

So I think that fem!Snape is unlikely to become a Death Eater even if she still had a falling out Lily. And even if somebody else ratted the prophecy to Voldemort and the Potters were still killed, she definitely wouldn't become a teacher.
