100% do not agree with this list. I'd put them like this:

1. Half blood prince
2. Deathly hallows part 2
3. Philosophers stone
4. Order of the Phoenix
5. Goblet of fire
6. Chamber of secrets
7. Deathly hallows part 1
8. Prisoner of Azkaban

This list is based off of loving the books and thinking none of the movies are great representations of the books. I wish Harry Potter came along 15 years later so it would of had a good chance of being made into a 5 or 6 season tv show instead of movies. I don't feel like the movies do the books justice and I feel like the order I place the movies are from best to worst interpretations from book to movie.

The Prisoner of Azkaban movie leaves so much out and just changes things to the point where if you had not of read the book I imagine some things just wouldn't make much sense.
