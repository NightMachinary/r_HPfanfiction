The fact that he put the Deathly Hallows part 1 so high up ruins any credibility he had. That movie felt as if they had to stretch 1.5 movies into 2 movies. And saying He says the Philosophers Stone is the worst because it feels like a children's movie? That's what it is. It's a movie meant for children.

IMO this is how they rank (just the movies, not taking any book comparisons into account)

1. Chamber of Secrets
2. Deathly Hallows 1 6.Philosopher's Stone 5.Order of the Phoenix 4.Deathly Hallows 2 3.Goblet of Fire 2.Prisoner of Azkaban 1.Half Blood Prince
