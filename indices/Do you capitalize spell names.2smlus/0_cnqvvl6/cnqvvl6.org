Well, it's all about the /specificity./ A "stunning spell" /without/ capitalization could just as easily refer to *a* spell that puts you to sleep or *a* spell that temporarily dazes you or *a* spell that makes you gaze uncontrollably at your own navel--but, if you say "Stunning Spell" /with/ capitalization, there's absolutely /zero/ chance of mistaking that you mean *the* spell with the incantation /Stupefy./
