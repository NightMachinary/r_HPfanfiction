I typically capitalize the word if I mean the specific spell (e.g. "Voldemort used the Killing Curse").

But if it's the name of the spell and the incantation, I go with book rules and write the thing in italics (e.g. "/Wingardium Leviosa/!" said Harry).

But if I'm not specific, or it's just in passing, I won't do anything (e.g. Harry sent a stunning spell in that direction).
