I think the point is to show how different Harry's world is. How different he is from other people is actually a big part of the plotline and is very important for the ending the author came up with. And alot of what he can do comes from him being blind and being able to see in an alternative way. It's not just something the author put in for fun and then forgot about. It's always there, and it's very integrated within the story. Even the author's narration is different because of it.

It's a good fic. If you're ever going to try a fic about blind Harry make it this one.
