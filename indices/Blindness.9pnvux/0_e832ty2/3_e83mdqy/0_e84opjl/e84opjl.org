  The story butterfly effects pretty far from canon pretty early because of the changes, but not in a way that bothered me.

That's the best part of the fic... I mean that it immediately drops the bomb of Harry not even attending Hogwarts. Most authors who attempt fics like this don't have any vision and go through all the stations of canon, except Harry is blind now, so he can't play Quidditch without a cane.
