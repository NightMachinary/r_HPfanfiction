Oddly enough, that was the reason I DIDN'T read Blindness for a long time, despite it being recommended. I never felt up to reading a story with that disability at the center of the story and was pleasantly surprised to find it didn't dominate the story, just provided a catalyst for the AU changes. The story butterfly effects pretty far from canon pretty early because of the changes, but not in a way that bothered me.

Hopefully if anyone else was on the fence for this reason, they'll give it a shot, I highly recommend it
