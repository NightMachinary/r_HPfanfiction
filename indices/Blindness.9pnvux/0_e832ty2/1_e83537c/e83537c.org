That's fair. I think the idea was that him being blind allowed him to see in a different way, which comes in to play really interestingly (not just the usual way).

The writing is really good - much better than 99% of fan fiction. The author doesnt a good job of crafting a story. Put it this way - this is one of the few fan fics that could've existed on its one, without the overall structure of Harry Potter.
