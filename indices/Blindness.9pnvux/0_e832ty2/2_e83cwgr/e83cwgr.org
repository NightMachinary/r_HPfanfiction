Same, I couldn't really get into it. Completely a personal preference thing - Blindness is super fucking well written and really descriptive. However, I found it too well written and slightly too AU for my taste. I enjoy fanfiction that reads like fanfiction, Blindness reads like a full blown fantasy novel. There's not even that much world building but it's too much for me. While I like a story with a different take on things, the whole staff thing got blown out of proportion, and I realize the general public of the Wizarding World would probably react like that, but it felt really overblown to me. Completely a personal opinion, it's a really great story but I can't really stomach it.
