That's one of the things that's annoying in the HP world--magic basically has no limits. So many things can be circumvented by magic--illness, lack of money, and to a certain extent lack of food.

You're right--there's nothing stopping a witch or wizard from controlling someone. Think of David Tennant's character in the first season of Jessica Jones and how horrifying that was. That's basically what any witch or wizard can do as a baseline ability.

It doesn't matter how hard any of these are--all it takes is some practice and you can have a complete psychopath on the way to ruining lives. Muggles do it all the time with simple social engineering. An amoral wizard would be a frightening thing to behold.
