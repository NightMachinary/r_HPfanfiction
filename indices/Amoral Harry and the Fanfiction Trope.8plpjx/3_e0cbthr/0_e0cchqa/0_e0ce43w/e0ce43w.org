That I don't know as I don't really search out that kind of thing. And you're right, VD should have had the world at his feet in like 2 seconds. But, kid's book and good triumphs over evil and all that.

Think about the recently-caught Golden State Killer. He's as amoral and psychopathic as they come--can you imagine if he were a wizard? Raping, Obliviating, commanding people to kill each other for sport. Authorities show up, Obliviate, command them to shoot each other with their guns. And there's no limit to it. Yes, you have to /want/ to control someone, but that's easy enough for most people. Sure, the spell might be difficult to work, but you start small with commanding dogs to run out into the street in front of a car and then before you know it, you're commanding people to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge because you had a bad day.

It's just that thin veneer of social, polite behavior that keeps us in check. Remove a limit or two and watch that disintegrate.
