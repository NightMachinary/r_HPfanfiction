  There's still the ambiguity of what "needing a powerful bit of magic" means, too. In my opinion that's a combination of a person's force of will and certainty of mind. Just my take on it.

That's really where the matter lies, yes, and there's no clear-cut canon answer. In my opinion, spellcasting is a bit more complex than that, which would explain quite what they /do/ in the classes. The basics are, of course, /intent + incantation/wand movement + control of one's magical energy/, but I like to think that more complex spells are, well, more complex. That is to say, for instance, that their casting may be split up in parts; you'd need to be pushing your magic in subtly different ways, and thinking slightly different thoughts, on each syllable and for each twirl of your wand, to cast something such as /Avada Kedavra/.
