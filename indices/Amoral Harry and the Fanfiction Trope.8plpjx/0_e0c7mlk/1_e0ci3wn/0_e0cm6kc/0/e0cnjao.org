  Killing Curse is a complex enough, powerful enough spell that even with the intent, the Fourth-Years wouldn't stand a chance at successfully casting it

I'm pretty sure he just said "You could all point your wands at me and say the words and I wouldn't so much as get a nosebleed."

Kids just don't have the emotional depth and maturity for the kind of hatred that cold-blooded murder requires. The Unforgivables are such because you have to mean them with all of your heart and mind. There are no half-measures with those three spells. If you use the Imperius on someone, no one can say that you had any other intention than to control that person utterly. That's why they are Unforgivable offenses.

Other than that they are literally point-and-speak spells, not complicated at all.

EDIT: Reading the passage, it says "Avada Kedavra's a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it - You could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed. But that doesn't matter. I'm not here to teach you how to do it."

You /could/ argue that there's more to the spell knowledgewise when he says "I'm not here to teach you how to do it." but I think he just means teaching how to get the proper intent. There's still the ambiguity of what "needing a powerful bit of magic" means, too. In my opinion that's a combination of a person's force of will and certainty of mind. Just my take on it.
