Crouch Jr. (who ought to know) says that the Killing Curse is a complex enough, powerful enough spell that even with the intent, the Fourth-Years wouldn't stand a /chance/ at successfully casting it. It's not much of a stretch to assume this is true of the two other Unforgivables.

As for Memory-Charms, they're easy to cast as such, but easy to /botch/. No one cares if the Muggle forgets a whole day rather than just the five minutes where he spotted a broom, because bleh, it's a Muggle and I wanna go home; but inconspicuously Obliviating a wizard of Harry Potter's standing would be much trickier work.
