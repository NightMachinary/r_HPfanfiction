Do we know how hard it is? We aren't ever truly given a difficulty level for these spells. Furthermore it shouldn't be too far fetched for Harry to use these. He has proven his mastery of difficult/upper level spells (Patronus in 3rd year, *Sectumsempra*). Is it so far fetched he would be able to use the Imperius? After all the stuff Harry goes through/has gone through if any student would be able to use the "Unforgivables" it would be him.

When it comes to the memory charm I feel like that has to be rather easy. Obliviation is something that occurs on a daily basis to enforce the Statute, it is far from some obscure arcane magic.
