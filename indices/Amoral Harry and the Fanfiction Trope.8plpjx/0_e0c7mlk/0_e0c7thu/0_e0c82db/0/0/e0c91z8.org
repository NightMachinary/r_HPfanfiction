I'm not making stuff up about Lockhart, this is all straight off /Pottermore/. We're told Lockhart /could/ have been a brilliant student but wanted everything handed to him on a plate; in the end he only ever made the effort to learn /one/ spell for real and faked or flunked /everything else/ at Hogwarts.

Don't know where you're getting "intent and power" from. It's definitely not canon. For one thing, power isn't an inherent capacity of a wizard in canon; a wizard's spells' power is a function of how well they cast it.
