As I said, there is such a thing as the power with which a spell is cast, and, by extension, the power of a given witch or wizard (which is the general standard of power their spells hold to); but it's not an inborn capacity of a wizard or witch, irrelevant to the rest of their skill. Your spell's power is a /function/ of your casting and strength of intent. You can't have someone who's rubbish at intent and casting but still has Dumbledore-levels of power.
