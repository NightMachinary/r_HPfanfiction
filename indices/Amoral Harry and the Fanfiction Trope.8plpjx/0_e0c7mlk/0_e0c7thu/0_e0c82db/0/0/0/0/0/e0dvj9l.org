It may not be entirely inborn, but if wands have power as we are told, then there's another source of the overall strength of spells otherwise specific wands couldn't make one's magic stronger than others (ignoring wand ownership). I'm not discounting the other stuff. It's clear those with high intelligence and knowledge of magic are a step or ten above the rest in terms of their ability to cast magic. But there does seem to be a kind of power which is inherent to the wizard.
