  It's definitely not canon. For one thing, power isn't an inherent capacity of a wizard in canon; a wizard's spells' power is a function of how well they cast it.

Eh, Crouch Jr. and Dumbledore referred to it as such. Power obviously isn't all there is to spellcasting, but it's there. Heck, wands have power too. Even ignoring the Elder Wamd, James's wand was said to have "a bit more power".
