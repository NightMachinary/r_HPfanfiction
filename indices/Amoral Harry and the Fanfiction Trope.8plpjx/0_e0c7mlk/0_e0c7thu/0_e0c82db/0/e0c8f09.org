Lockhart DID get into Ravenclaw i suppose, but they can't be too difficult for a man that couldn't even use 2nd year Charms like Immobulus (Laziness has a Limit. See: Ron. Ron is intelligent but Lazy AF, but even got a Patronus)

Intent and power are the main components of a spell. If you want to Control them Hard enough, and try and cast Imperio, with practice (on Pets/Spiders/etc) you'd get it down fairly quickly.
