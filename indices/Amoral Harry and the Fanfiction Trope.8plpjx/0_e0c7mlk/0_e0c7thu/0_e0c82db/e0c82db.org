It's explicitly stated that Lockhart wasn't an idiot, he was /lazy/. He perfected his skill at Memory Charms and never bothered to learn anything else. As for Crabbe, he could /not/ use Fiendfyre. He could begin the spell, but was unable to control the fire, which is the most important part of it; and he was burnt alive for his trouble.

And the intent is not all you need for the Imperius; like the Killing Curse is stated to be, it's presumably a complex spell besides.
