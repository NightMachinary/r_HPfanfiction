Firstly:

Not everybody can cast those spells! You need more than average magical power and willpower to pull off the imperius (and even then some people will resist the imperius! Harry is just the one most people think off, but I bet it wouldn't work on say Moody, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape (he is good at the mental arts and I bet that helps) etc.) and Obliviating people is hard (do too much and you get Lockhart and a "nice" stint in Azkaban with a "great view" and do too little and people will remember (or at least know that something is off and might seek help!))

Also: It's not just a matter of morals! If you get caught with an unforgiveable? Yeah, Azkaban time (this time without ever being released!) again!

Secondly: You can't control multiple people easily (chances are that a blackmailer will share some of what he/she is doing with friends - partially as a backup against being obliviated!) and you might not even know who also knows of the blackmail material (or information, it might not be something writen down after all!)
