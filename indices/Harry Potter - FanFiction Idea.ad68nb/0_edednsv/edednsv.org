First of all, this is a setting, not a story.

For any good story plot and setting have to work hand-in-hand - even if that sometimes means that the plot has to move out of the way (1984, ...).

However, if you just build a world without any ideas for stories in it, it'll often fall rather flat.

Anyways, to the actual content: I'm not sure I really love it. It is super hard to write a young genius, and even harder to write one below the age of 10. Heck, I've been friends with a few "child geniuses" when I was younger, but none came close to what you want, and that makes it super hard to pull off.

It also takes away all the magic out of magic, but that is just a personal dislike of mine.

"Runic electricity" seems like something you should start with: Just make a wheel spin, and attach two magnets - profit!

In the end, if I can make a suggestion: It would make a lot of sense to write this as a self-insert instead. Having an adult in a child's body makes things more believable and gives you lot of material to work with.

And no matter if it's an SI or not, the typical audiences for this specific power-wank (which it is, and that is completely fine!) would probably be over at the Space Battles and Sufficient Velocity forums, so if you go there, you'll definitely find people that will like it. In those forums plot also usually comes kind of second, so that might fit with your vision.
