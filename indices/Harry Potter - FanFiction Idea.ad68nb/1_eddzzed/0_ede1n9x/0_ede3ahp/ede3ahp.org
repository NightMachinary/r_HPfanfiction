At some point, AUs stop feeling like Harry Potter anymore and the only shared part are the names (not even the personalities).

  In the wrong hands it can be very powerful tool.

But why would you give that to Voldemort? He has the murder and fascist takeover parts down without it, so why give him another ability if canon is already enough.
