An alternative universe where Harry is born on the 31st of July 2008. (i think you missed that bit)

U seemed so pissed off for some reason, I dont know what the issue is. This is AU FF, and just an idea. If everything is like cannon then i might as well copy and paste JK's work. So just chill.

Rest is Just perspective really, no right or wrong. People can bend however they like. Like i said this is just and idea and i don't plan to write a FF. I am not anti James its just how the story flows. Hence its AU.

" I think you seriously underestimate how long progress takes. " LOL you take a FF book way too seriously. And I do know how long things take to invent / make and how much effort is required.

I believe metamorphmagus is an over powered ability to have, It was used brilliantly in prince of slytherin. In the wrong hands it can be very powerful tool.
