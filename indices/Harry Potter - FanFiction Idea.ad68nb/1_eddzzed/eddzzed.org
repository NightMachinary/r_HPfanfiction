The Internet was not even a thing in the 70s/early 80s, at least not in the shape we know it.

And the ages seem off. It would be believable if Hermione came up with something like that after decades of research and trial&error, but not Harry at age 9.

Also, why would you need "dark arts weapons" when a regular sniper does the trick just fine. You don't need to work around shields and such if the other side doesn't even know you are there.

  Also, his a metamorphmagus.

A completely unnecessary gimmick for him to have, like Harry's magical animagus form in most stories. It adds nothing to the story but bragging rights.

So if you are going with book canon Snape and an exaggerated James, why doesn't Snape has his dark arts obsession and is perfectly fine with Death Eaters as friends? You seem very pro-Snape and anti-James for no apparent reason, as Snape's reasons to be on Harry's side are rather useless for the plot. And you are completely oblivious to the actual canon situation where both sides were little shits. But no, let's whitewash Snape instead.

  Like Dumbledore he is aware of the muggle technical advancement and will take full advantage of it.

I think you seriously underestimate how long progress takes. If Harry invents the McGuffin, it would take years until others capitalise on that. Just look at the development of the steam engine or how long it took for things like LEDs to make it from the drawing board into mass production.
