spoiler obviously

this is explained in chapter 6 what went wrong and in chapter 7 how he intends to correct it.

Harry resurrected Dumbledore but he screwed up and it took nearly all that was good from his soul and left him with mostly evil. He's almost entirely evil in the story but that is tempered by his life experience.

Harry is trying to fix himself to get back what he lost. He has since refined his knowledge of the magic he used to resurrected Dumbledore and is teaching that to Hermione so she can fix him. With the process refined Hermione will make a full recovery and Harry will be back to mostly normal as well.

The whole story is Evil Harry's plan to heal himself back to Regular Harry.
