*In chronological order, rather than the order presented in the fic:*

(Spoilers, of course)

Before Harry graduates Hogwarts he goes traveling with Dumbledore, devoting all of his waking moments to intensive training that should make him powerful enough to defeat Voldemort.

When the war kicks into full swing, Harry and Dumbledore both return to lead the forces of good against the Death Eaters. There is a climactic battle at Hogwarts during which Dumbledore is killed by Voldemort.

Distraught, Harry enacts a ritual involving soul magic that is supposed to return Dumbledore to life. Unfortunately, the ritual has disastrous results. Afterward, Harry is somehow broken. (The nature of this break is the mystery at the heart of the story.) Harry ends up committing monstrous acts against his friends before he is captured and locked away by the Ministry.

While he sits in prison, Harry invents a unique runic language which everyone assumes is a cypher. Hermione is brought in as a consultant to figure it out. Harry uses her visit as an opportunity to escape and abducts her.

Harry gives Hermione a pensieve full of his own memories to make her understand what led him to this point. He then coerces her into learning his runic language so that she can aid him in a ritual that is supposed to undo the abomination created by his attempt to resurrect Dumbledore. The learning process takes months, during which Harry gives Hermione cryptic hints about the truth of his condition, what happened to Dumbledore, and what exactly the new ritual is meant to accomplish.

Eventually Hermione is ready enough, and Harry enacts the new ritual, using his runic language in an array inscribed on the floor. Hermione feels inside herself that something has gone very wrong, but the ritual must have succeeded because 'Dumbledore' shows up. He attempts to keep Harry subdued and examines the magic in the runes to figure out what failsafe Harry has worked into the magic. Meanwhile, he tries to persuade Hermione to let him kill Harry. His attempts are unsuccessful. Harry wakes up, they fight, and 'Dumbledore' finds peace in death. Then the failsafe kicks in, ensuring that Harry doesn't survive to continue on in his twisted broken state. Fawkes arrives to spirit Hermione to safety.

The end.
