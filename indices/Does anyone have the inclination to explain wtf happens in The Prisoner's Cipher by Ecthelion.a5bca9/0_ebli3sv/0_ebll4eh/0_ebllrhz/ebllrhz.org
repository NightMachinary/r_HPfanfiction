Hermione ruminates on that and gets hints from Harry. Basically it's a personal runic language that describes Harry's own essence with symbology related to events that have emotional significance for him: his scar, learning magic, flying, phoenixes, snakes, etc.

I particularly love the moment when Hermione first starts to decipher the runes:

  All of this explained why the experts couldn't figure it out. She was truly the only one besides Harry that had a chance to interpret this language. The reason why the symbols changed also made sense now. It was because his own interpretations changed. A bird's essence is not going to change but a person's... well, change was inevitable.

  The decoding of this language was going to be nigh impossible but she now understood how to do so.

  Her eyes immediately locked on the top rune in the circle -- one of the seven large ones placed. It stood out somehow from the rest and depicted two feathers seemingly floating in the air. Almost transparent, a serpent wound itself silently around the feathers.

  She could do this.

  The rune had to be something deeply ingrained within Harry's past, perspectives, or beliefs. Her mind immediately flew to Buckbeak. Clearly this bird had had a large effect on Harry and was important on his mind. Hermione tried not to remember the closeness they had shared on that adventure's trials and tribulations. Did the rune represent loyalty? Flight?

  Fifteen minutes later Hermione realized that it was not Buckbeak.

  Inspiration struck her soon after - Flitwick's class. There were slight movement lines in the feathers showed feathers falling.

  Flitwick's instructing voice came to her mind as if yesterday, "Good good class! Now levitating isn't just the rise, but the fall as well! Practice levitating the feathers down, in a slow gradual descent... a gradual descent."

  Harry and her had gotten the descent part immediately and she had caught him smiling in appreciation. Harry had remarked in his third year, in a rare moment of verbal reflection, of his fond memory of that particular day.

  Two of Flitwick's words hit her with deep gravity, the "gradual descent."

  Hermione's eyes flicked to the lightning bolt in the middle.

  Oh.

  The Gradual Descent.

  What Harry had been drawing was indeed a title page, and the packet of papers underneath it was a book. But not just any book, if the lightning bolt had anything to say about it.

  It was an Autobiography... of Harry.

  The Gradual Descent.

  Hermione was breathing very rapidly, tears of emotion falling ever so softly.

  Oh Harry... What happened?
