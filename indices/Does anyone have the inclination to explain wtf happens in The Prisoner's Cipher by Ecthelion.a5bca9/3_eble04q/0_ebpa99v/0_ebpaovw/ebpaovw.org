I feel I have to backpedal a bit, but I'll get to the point later. Just to be clear: It's very well written and has some interesting ideas.

I just cannot stand "red herring" mysteries like this. I've only read it once so correct me when I misremember... the fic does this whole song and dance about "Oh, could Harry really do this? Maybe he was framed? Imperiused? Is something else intriguing going on here?", but then the big reveal comes: "Oh, he's just insane."

Okay.

It felt so anticlimactic to me. "What?! That's it?!". Yeah I get it, there's this whole mumbo jumbo about soul magic and how he got insane, but the point of the matter is he's just insane and a public menace now. I just don't know what I'm supposed to get out of a nihilistic conclusion like this. A story like this just leaves me with nothing to take away from it. "Well I guess it sucks for you if something backfires and you go insane?" It doesn't work as a tragedy for me because I don't see the ultimate fatal flaw that caused this. Just shit luck.
