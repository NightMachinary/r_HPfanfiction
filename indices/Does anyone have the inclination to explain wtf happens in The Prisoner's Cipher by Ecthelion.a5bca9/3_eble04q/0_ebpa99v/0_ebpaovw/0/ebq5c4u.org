  It doesn't work as a tragedy for me because I don't see the ultimate fatal flaw that caused this. Just shit luck.

I suppose I like this fic because I enjoy stories about psychological horror, where a person can't trust their own mind, or they feel themselves changing in ways beyond their control; tragedies that go further than the simple Jekyll & Hyde idea. Stories which explore that spectrum tend to pique my interest.
