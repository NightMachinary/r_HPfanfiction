It goes author by author, for me, it gives a flat bonus to offensive spells, perhaps the more deadly the bigger the bonus.

While also allowing spells that shouldn't be possible to work. Or boosting normal spells to a certain extent(less than offensive ones).

Like repairing a wand, or casting a powerful confundus.

I toy with the idea in my stories that the Elder Wand is a weapon, and prefers to be a weapon, meaning it can perform non-offensive spells perfectly and even boost some of them.

But offensive spells are where it makes them considerably more powerful.

I also like the idea it affects the user, increasing the bloodlust, and trying to make them choose conflict rather than diplomacy.

I also don't think it should make one invincible, just have then cast more powerful spells, they can still be outsmarted or outmaneuvered.
