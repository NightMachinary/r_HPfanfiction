Given that Dumbledore beat Grindelwald while Grindelwald had the wand, and given that Dumbledore was only "a shade more skillful", I think the natural conclusion is that the benefit which the Elder wand provides becomes less relevant the more powerful you are.

Like, the Elder wand functions by making sure your spells are always as powerful as they can be. But if you're Dumbledore, your spells were already as powerful as they could be. You were already butting your head against the ceiling of what a given spell can do, so the Elder wand adds little.

Whereas in the hands of a lesser wizard, it's a complete game changer.
