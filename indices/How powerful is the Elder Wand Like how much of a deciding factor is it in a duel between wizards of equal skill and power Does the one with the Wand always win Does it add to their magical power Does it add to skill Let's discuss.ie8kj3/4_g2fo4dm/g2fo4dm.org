The Elder Wand changes hands by it's wielder being defeated, so no. The one with the wand does not always win.

I see it as a booster, maybe in D&D terms spells act as +2 levels higher or something like that. Noticeable, but not an 'I Win' button if some 6th year gets lucky and disarms it's owner. Let's get real, if Voldemort knew that had happened, Narcissa would be scraping Draco off the walls. Elder Wand or no.

I saw one fic (I think it was Stepping Back) where the Elder Wand was straight up a 'weapon' and boosted combat spells, but was kinda lackluster as a 'tool', Harry continues to use his holly wand for general use.

I also kinda like the idea that ancient, powerful magical artifacts begin to develop a bit of a personality. Maybe the Sword of Gryffindor wasn't enchanted to appear to courageous students in need, maybe it decided to do that all on it's own. Perhaps the Goblet saw right through Crouch's cunfundus charm, but figured Harry was Champion material anyway so it just went with it. Maybe after Harry snaps the Elder Wand it just starts popping up, whole, whenever Harry needs a wand. Think, Mercy Thompson's Walking Stick.
