Canon is not very clear about the effects of the Elder Wand. According to the legend, it is supposed to make a wizard stronger (since the 1st brother boasted that he killed his enemy thanks to the wand), but we don't know "how" the wand make a wizard stronger or by "how much". All we know is that thanks to the wand, Harry managed to repair his Holly wand with a simple Reparo Charm, even though Ollivander himself had said that nothing more could be done to repair it.

Also, despite Grinderwald possessing the Elder Wand, he was defeated by Albus Dumbledore during a duel in 1945, which made Dumbledore the new master of the wand. So at the very least, we know that the wand does not assure victory but only raise your chances.
