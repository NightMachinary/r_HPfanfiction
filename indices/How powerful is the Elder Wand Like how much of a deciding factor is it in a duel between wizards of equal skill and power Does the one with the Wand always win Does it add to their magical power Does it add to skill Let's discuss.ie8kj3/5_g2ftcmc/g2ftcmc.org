I think that it basically makes it to where magic is the literal best you could ever do and removes some of the arbitraritenesss of magic, like you on liquid luck levels of performance and no BS needing the right amount of concentration/power/intent. This however does nothing to make tactics/spell-usage good so in the hands of transfiguration users a master would see no real benefit unless they were inebriated or otherwise debilitated. It removes the magical power level of someone being a factor which we see be relevant in cases of spell connection, which uses that and intent/concentration as the deciding factors. Outside of that I don't think it would really be a huge benefit still considering how often some of those duels can get the ability to basically make it to where someone has to fight you a specific way or they lose is something nice but it doesn't make the user suddenly able to go toe to toe with Voldemort or something. Its a boost in ability I guess but only if the user applies it correctly, its a real benefit in that it makes life simpler for its user but with that comes a temptation which has gotten quite a number of its wielders killed over the years.

I think that its a really useful tool but someone on Dumbledore's level really doesn't see any difference between it and their first wand. Someone who was on their xth wand at his level might love how great it is as there is supposed to be no match quite like their first I believe. A neat thing about my interpretation is that if you were to have a squib kill someone who was the master of the wand, then they could preform magic as it doesn't take amount into consideration.
