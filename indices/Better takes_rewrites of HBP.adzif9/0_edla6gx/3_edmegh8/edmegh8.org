Yeah, I gave up partway through fifth year because hardly anything was new. If you're a big Harmony fan, I guess it's a reasonable canon replacement. Myself, I don't mind Harmony if it's done well, but I have no great attachment to it either. So, I didn't continue.

Edit: I gave it another go, but gave up again after it started indignantly bashing canon for having Harry/Ginny.
