Well... in my opinion, the best Dark!Harry fanfiction is definitely [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6163339/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Descent-into-Darkness][Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey][Athey]]. It has 268k words and is complete. It has a [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6367096/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Breeding-Darkness][sequel]] too, although that is abandoned (but still has over 200k words and was adopted by someone else).

As long as you can live with the fact that the story contains some HP/TR Slash (although that's not the main focus) I'd highly recommend it.
