I've been suggesting it a lot lately, but, holy cow I just read both books and I was lazy, had no school or a lot of work, and I just realised the magnitute of how much I read... So you'll be in for the long haul with this one.... [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset Over Britain]] Its the first in a series of 2 about Lord Harry Potter-Black. But so much more. Like wow, each chapter is about 30-35 pages... and about 29 chapters each. So have fun! (Ron and Dumbledore bashing, but pretty well done and it is not what the authors usually do, it was a creative exercise of theirs)
