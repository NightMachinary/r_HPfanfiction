linkffn(A second chance at life by miranda flairgold)

I always hesitate to recommend this one as an HP fic.. because really, its a complete original story with amazing everything in it... where the main character happens to also sometimes go by the name Harry Potter... But demons are a real danger in this one, especially in its sequel.

You will eventually get used to reading in 2nd person... the demon stuff is much later on after a great journey through cursebreaking with Bill Weasley.
