  What happens when you anger a God? What happens when something once pure, turns wicked and angry? What is left of someone who has been alone so long? How do you ask forgiveness for being so wrong? How do you apologize, for breaking someone's heart? This is the story of Slytherin House's Angel of Carnage. FemHarry/Naruto Yuri, wrong GWL, God-like, lots of bashing, lot's of gore.

  Tied to a tombstone, being tortured by Voldemort. Harry wanted it to end. His mind, his soul cried for someone, anyone to help him. He hadn't expected for someone to actually answer. Now he will learn the truth about the Potter bloodline and prepare himself for the war that is at their doorstep. However, unlike what he had thought, he won't be facing what is coming on his own.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Harry and Tracey find themselves in a different world, where they encounter powerful sorcerers, great warriors and hordes of undead. It is the world where a danger can await you everywhere, where the great demons roam free. Eventually HP/TD. M for blood and violence.

  Remus Lupin vaguely knew what to expect when a being that called itself a god appeared before him. An offer for a paying job wasn't on that list. It wasn't like he was employed at the moment, and the job had good benefits. Too bad he had no idea what he was getting himself into. Pseudo-Lovecraftian AU, with Powerful!Remus. Mild Dumbledore bashing in early chapters.

  When Hermione looked through the attic of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, she did expect to find dark magic, forbidden rituals and terrible spells. But the darkness rarely tells its secrets, and so Hermione is caught in a whirlwind of black magics, with a demon inside her head and a Mistress hailing from the House of Black.

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.
