[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]] would be my recommendation in all that. Its a good, complete fic, which actually has a little horror rather then just gore. Supernatural crossovers have a lot of demon deals, but they tend to be fluffy rather then horror. Example: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10916724/1/A-Deal-Made-in-Good-Faith][A Deal Made in Good Faith]], is despite it's 'horror' genre tag, more a mary-sue everyone loves her fic. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6180986/1/Creep][Creep]] is really just an excuse of rough slash sex. For non-supernatural crossovers, I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] but I have had it recommended to me before. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11309606/1/Broken-Angel][Broken Angel]] might fit (if you count the 9 tails as a demon), but again, it really isn't horror. There is some gore. If you count Hellsing as a demon, there is a number of fics there too. Cthulhu Mythos may also have some fics.
