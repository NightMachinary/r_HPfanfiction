What were you thinking than. I have seen plenty of stories where they try they to make “darker” death eaters and it always comes across as forced, because Nazi Germany was fucked up, and that's what they're painfully clear reference to. So if you had to go about making them “darker” however you define that. How would you do so? And do you think you would have to sacrifice the political ideology that underpins the Death Eaters actions?
