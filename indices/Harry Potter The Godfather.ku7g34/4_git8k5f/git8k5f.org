It'd take a bit of a reworking of the central conflict of the setting.

In /The Godfather/ most of the violence is "just business"---pursuit of money and security. On the other hand, in canon both OotP and the DEs are driven by /ideology/. Take that away, and what distinguishes OotP from the DEs except for having different dons and preferred colour scheme?
