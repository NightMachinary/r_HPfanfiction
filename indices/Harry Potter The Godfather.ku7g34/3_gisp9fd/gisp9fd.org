Thomas Riddle, the son of Voldemort, was on a date with his girlfriend, Isabelle Parkinson.

"Yeah, I know Lucius Malfoy pretty well. My father helped him a lot, years ago. One time, he and Narcissa Black wanted to marry each other, but her father didn't want that. So my father went with Fenrir Greyback and told her father that either his mauled body or his signature would be on the marriage contract. That's a true story. But I'm not planning to join him in the family business. I'm not like my father."
