Are you by any chance on the reddit app on your phone? I have to open the links actually in my browser (I'm on an iphone, so safari) before the actual thing to download shows up. Not sure why reddit's app browser doesn't work but...

If not, maybe giving some more context (what browser, if its the linkffn bot or a different one or all of them, etc) might help someone find the answer for you!
