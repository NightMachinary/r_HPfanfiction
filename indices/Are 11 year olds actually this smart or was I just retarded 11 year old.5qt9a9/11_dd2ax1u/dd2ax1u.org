Some 11-year-olds could speak in such a way for whatever reason, but that is not common; most just don't behave like this. More notably, even smarter and more intelligent kids generally don't behave that way, especially since kids tend to often be to some degree naive and it's that naivete that makes it impossible for them to be “political players” of the kind they'd need to be to behave that way.

Some kids might, if they've been taught to always do it or, in some cases, taught and then had it beaten into them. But applying /that/ to 90% of characters in a fanfic (do remember the words “beaten into them”) is not something I feel we should be doing.
