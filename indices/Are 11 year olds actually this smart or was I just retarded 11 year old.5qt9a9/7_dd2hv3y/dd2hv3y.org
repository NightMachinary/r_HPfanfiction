Sometimes I think I became dumber with time. I kept a diary in my 11s and 12s and, while sounding like a chuunibyouing kid with an overblown confidence I wrote pages upon pages of philosophical rants... Like, until I was 14 I wasn't actually sure people existed and weren't just a figment of my imagination, and while I believe this was another phase of my being an egocentric I actually explained why I thought that! Or when I was 13 I was certain that the world was created either by the thought of someone or five minutes before whit the exact atomic composition to give everyone a human appearance with more or less memories of the same events
