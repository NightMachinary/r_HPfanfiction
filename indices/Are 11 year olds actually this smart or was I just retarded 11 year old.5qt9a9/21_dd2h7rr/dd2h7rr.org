I think it's a limitation of the written word rather than an inaccuracy, particularly for authors who have more stilted prose. In real life, subtext is a lot easier to pick up on but at the same time more instinctive and difficult to explain-so whilst a ten year old certainly might read that much into an exchange, it would be more of an impression than a certainty. So for example, Rigel's enunciation and general demeanour might help to convey the general idea 'I do like communicating with you early in the morning' even if at no point does anything as formal and exaggerated as the italicised text in the sample text pass through the minds of either child.
