I think they are capable, they are just expected to remain children until they turn 26 so the develop slower. All it takes is extreme trauma, or very attentive and nurturing parents to make a kid act much more mature.

I don't disagree that most parents are not involved enough to treat 11 year olds like little adults and force them to act mature. I also do not want a bunch of heavily traumatized kids who were forced to grow up too quickly.
