Oh, well, you're probably right. I have some things that I wrote when I was 11 or 12 that read very much like this because I was into a lot of old-fashioned writers like Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte at the time. But I also wasn't allowed to watch much television and we didn't have smartphones or today's type of internet in the 90's either, so that probably contributed.
