And that's the thing everything hinges on right there. /You/ were influenced by authors who were not only very skilled with word but also of a linguistic style that fostered verbosity and a more mature use of language. The average child through, you are lucky of the read /Goosebumps/, if at all. And that certainly reflects in their linguistic capabilities just as it did in yours.

And for the general Hogwarts attendees, we cannot use the outliers like you but must look at the averages. And they, unfortunately, barely rise above outright idiocy linguistically.
