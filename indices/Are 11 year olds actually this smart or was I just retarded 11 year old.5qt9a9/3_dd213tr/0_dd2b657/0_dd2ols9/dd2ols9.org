Speaking and acting mature does not mean you cannot also be naive. Just because they act and sound 25 instead of 11 doesn't mean they know it all, just that they comport themselves well with what experience and knowledge they do have.

I think that is the important thing. Make them sound older sure, but make sure they make mistakes and learn from them like all children do.
