While I do agree with the statement in the first sentence of your reply, it most cases it would be precisely this naivete that would make it so unlikely for children to sound the way they way certain writers make them speak. Because this isn't a “mature” style of talking, oh no no no; it's basically a discussion's equivalent of a political game.

That's the crux of the issue here. Maturity does not automatically equal being able to talk that way. No, /that/ is a particular skill that anyone who is naive is quite unlikely to be able to learn until they lose a lot of that naivete.

I could (if you weren't across the internet, that is) point you to a kid who happened to be /very/ mature, to the point that many people took her to be a few years older than she was and just petite even during her early teenage years. She never really spoke like that, and when she tried the result was more funny than anything (if you felt like laughing at someone else, that is), or maybe awkward; even when she did have smart-sounding she wanted to show others she knew, she was more like Remus with her speech, only with more pauses and less woe about being a werewolf. I do realise it is only an example of one so it's not much, but the point is, if we want to defend the decision to make the characters talk like that then we must stop pretending that it's really maturity that is behind such a way of speaking.
