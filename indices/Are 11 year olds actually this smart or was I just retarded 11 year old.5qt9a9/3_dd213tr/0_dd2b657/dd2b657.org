  However, what you need to always keep in mind: Adults often tend not to give 11-year-olds enough credit.

In a way, yes. However, in this particular case I think it's not an issue with not giving kids enough credit but rather with the fact that speaking like that is a skill of a certain kind and not everyone had it even amongst adults so those authors who make every kid speak that way because of what really is no reason are just being stupid instead. Heck, I will note that even the kids that are smarter than you'd think, even those who happen to be smarter than you (whoever you are and however smart you are, that applies to everyone reading this), can be and often enough are fairly naive and it is this naivete that makes it so unlikely for them to speak in such a way, at least not even close to as commonly as some authors write it happening.
