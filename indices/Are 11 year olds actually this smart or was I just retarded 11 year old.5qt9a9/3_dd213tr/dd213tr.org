It's half-half. You don't write speech like in real life, as in writing conversations get to the point faster, discussions are shorter, problems are solved more quickly.

The level of speech you write is usually a bit higher, otherwise it would be pretty boring. However, what you need to always keep in mind: Adults often tend not to give 11-year-olds enough credit.

When I was 11 I had read all 6 parts of Harry Potter that were out until then, and I'd say I had a pretty good understanding of what happened in each of them. Sure, no complex literary works by any standards, but certainly no dumb books. I could read messages between the lines (comparison Werewolf / AIDS came to my mind), I could discover things not outright said (I had written down the theory that RAB is Regulus before DH came out) and generally keep all the information of the books in my mind. I also remember clearly that subtext existed in my school, even if I wasn't particularly good at it.

While pureblood-pretense is certainly over the top with it, you generally want to write smart- and clearly-speaking 11-year-olds, especially if the characters are important.
