My youngest brother is 11. He's considered pretty smart for his age. And he absolutely doesn't talk like that, lol. I won't claim to know what goes on in his head (though I will say that I frequently wonder if he thinks at all), but that conversation with my brother would have gone something like this:

Evan: Hi! Why'd you leave before I got up?

Me: I'm a morning person, and you're not.

Evan: Oh. Ok. Why are you a morning person?

Me: It's quiet, peaceful. Gives me time to think.

Evan: Oh... Ok. I'd rather sleep.

This is the same kid that "forgets" to say hello when he answers the phone (I'm pretty sure he only does it to me), uses the phrases "Oh, ok" and "I dunno" to excess, and is more likely to give you a shit-eating grin than an answer...
