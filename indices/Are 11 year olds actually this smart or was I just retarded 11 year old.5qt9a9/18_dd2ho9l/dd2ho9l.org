When I was in secondary school, my classmates were among the most eloquent people I would ever come across - to date (I'm 25). It was a state comprehensive - Jesuit-run, but still a comprehensive.

In stark contrast, many of the interactions that I had with public school kids (Eton boys included) were remarkably casual, even when they were talking amongst themselves. And at cadet camp, at that!

There's a balance to be struck, of course. Most children, issue of the nobility or not, would care far less about geopolitics and macroeconomics in comparison to the average adult. However, restricting their speech to baby-talking Quidditch is not only unappealing, but wildly unrealistic. Kids are sharp, devious and vulgar when they want to be, and naivete doesn't preclude them from that.
