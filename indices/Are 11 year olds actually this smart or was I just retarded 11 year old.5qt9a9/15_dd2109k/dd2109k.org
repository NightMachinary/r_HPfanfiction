Well. The point when its the pureblood kids or Hermione is that they all might have been raised to be geniuses by their parents, culturally. Just like kids irl that you see in 'smartest kids in the country' documentaries. For the purebloods, magic might also help to boost the intelligence.

One unfortunate thing about canon when you think about it is how few muggle or muggleborn kids and characters we ever actually see. As such the only reasonable estimates of a 'normal' child - not a genius - from our world that canon gives us to any level is Dudley, Colin Creevey and Dennis Creevey. And Harry himself, but ofc that's complicated by both his abusive background and the Horcrux.
