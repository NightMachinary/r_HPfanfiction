I've forgotten a lot of things from when I was 12 and before, like I don't have much memories of it. I might remember like little moments, and I remember how to do the stuff I was taught in school then, but I don't remember how I acted and so on.\\
11 year olds could talk like that if they were raised like that. Of course it would be boring to write 11 year olds realistically, also not even canon writes 11 year olds realistically. 11 year olds would not be willing to go near a giant dog just because they believed that their teacher was trying to steal a stone of eternal life. (Sure Harry MIGHT do it, because he has no sense of self preservation, but I highly doubt the others would)
