Yes, and also no.

11 year Olds can talk and think like tyat, especially if they were trained to do so from a young age. If you get punished for being vulgar, you learn how to be vulgar without getting caught, which is learning to talk the right way. On the same level, it is unlikely that they speak that way all the time, especially amongst close friends. Draco probably talks similiar to that in oublic, but in front of Crabbe and hoyle he's going to be blunt and make poop jokes because they are funny to him. He just won't make them where he has been taught it is innapropriate. I.e. where he can get caught.

Also remember that 11 year Olds see thenselves as people to be taken seriously, even if adults don't. Whether or not she is reading the subtext correctly or not is a valid question, but she is definately going to read subtext, and make it I can't count the number of time ls I've talked with elementary schoolers and gotten that look that says I'm super dumb for not understanding what they meant when it is "so obvious" because I don't understand their subtext.
