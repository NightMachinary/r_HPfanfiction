Teaching 16 and 17 year olds, I have to say that most of them wouldn't have that level of conversation. But on the other hand, they're not from aristocratic families, either, so you never know.

I admit it's bugged me, too. I've been reading the Accidental Animagus recently, which is really well written... but all the 11- and 12- year old characters are far much less childish, self-absorbed and inexperienced than they were in the books. The writing is good enough that I can forgive it, but it still sticks out at times.
