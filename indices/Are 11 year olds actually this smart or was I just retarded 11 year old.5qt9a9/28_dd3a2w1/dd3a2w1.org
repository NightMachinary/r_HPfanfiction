No, it's just poorly as fuck written. i have a rule. 11year olds speak predominantly in single or two syllable words unless they're insanely common words. As they grow older and these longer words are used around them more often, then new longer words come in. It's only college educations or a fantastic reading program that have people shift from words like sleepy to fatigued or from hate to aversion

And even when writing hemione, i wouldn't have her say "he's indefatigable!" She would say something like "he's tireless!" Because she knows her audience is other kids who won't know what that means.
