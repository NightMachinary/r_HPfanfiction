It's worth pointing out that not talking in baby talk has not been shown to actually produce kids with better verbal capabilities.

It's a widespread myth with little scientific basis that avoiding baby talk makes kids smarter or produces better verbal abilities.

Most likely your daughter would've spoken well regardless of whether you used baby talk or not.
