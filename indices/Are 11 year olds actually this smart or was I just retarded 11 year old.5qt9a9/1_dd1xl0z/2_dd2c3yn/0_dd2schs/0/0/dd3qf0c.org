Do you mean when babies are learning their first language?

Most of the (linguistic) books I've read about that seem to agree that there are many cases of kids with strong verbal abilities that were raised with baby talk, and there are also many cases of the opposite. There are even cultures where they don't even talk to babies when they're young (for cultural/religious reasons) and kids end up still speaking fluently. Parent input to children (when acquiring language) is /vastly/ overrated by most people.

Nothing conclusive has yet to be shown (if someone has evidence against this or that there's now a consensus plz lmk because I'm interested).

EDIT: In regards to reading to children producing strong verbal abilities (which is proven to happen), I'd argue it's more a factor of (1) Parents spending time with kids in general, forming a closer bond and (2) showing kids that reading can be done for pleasure. The actual reading itself probably isn't what matters, just the fact that it's a critical bonding moment.
