Yup, my daughter talked like an adult at 11 simply because I didn't really use dumbed-down baby talk after perhaps age 2 or so.

Kids aren't idiots. I always felt that it is somewhat insulting to talk to them as if they lack the capacity to understand. If you use a word or phrase they aren't familiar with, let them tell you so, and then explain to them.
