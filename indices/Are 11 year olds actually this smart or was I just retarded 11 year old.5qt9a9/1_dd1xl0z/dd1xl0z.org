11 year olds can be brought up (trained) to speak this way, just by being purposefully exposed to adult conversations in a (micro-) culture where education and critical thinking is valued. You raise your children (train them) to read a lot, be attentive to adult conversations (and discuss the conversations afterwards), and seek out a dictionary when they hear a word they don't know. Some of the phrases or manners of speaking above might just be copied from adults --- they may sound "intelligent", but they were just the proper manner of speaking for educated households in the 18th/19th centuries.
