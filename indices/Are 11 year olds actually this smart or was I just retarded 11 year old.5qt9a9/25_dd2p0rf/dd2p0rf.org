I am no genius but I clearly remember things from when I was 3-4 years old and onward. I was rather self involved, I only knew the things that were going on around me. That does not mean that I could not have understood a greater extent of things if I had been exposed to it.

I have been at least partially sexually active since I was about 5, and so were most of the other kids at my pre-school center. Playing doctor and truth or dare. None of us were from abusive homes or were exposed to perverts etc, we were just curious kids. So sexuality in 11 year olds doesn't phase me either.

Given a chance, and treated/expected to act like a little adult I have zero qualms with someone acting like these kids or canon Hermione. Most children are not expected to act like this however, and so are self involved as you stated.

I think most adults forget what it is like to be a kid and so they see children as dumber than they are. The truth is the littlest little kids can be conniving, covetous, intelligent, saints or assholes. They will rise to the level you set for them. Common parenting however doesn't acknowledge this, instead they want "kids to be kids" for as long as possible. They put off adulthood until well into the 20's so kids stay self involved and unaware of the world around them until it hits them in the face.

So Ron is probably the most typical 11 year old depicted in the series, but with so much shit going on it is not surprising that others are acting much more maturely than he. Even Harry is much more mature, he just acts like he isn't for the sake of fitting in.
