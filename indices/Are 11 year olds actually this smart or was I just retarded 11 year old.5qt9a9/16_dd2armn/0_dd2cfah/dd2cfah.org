I disagree completely. Children learn speech patterns from the adults around them. The only reason kids /don't/ speak this way is because adults have an annoying habit of talking to them like they're morons. Slowing down speech and insisting on using cutesy words all the time.

I didn't "rigorously train" my daughter, but she always spoke like an adult. Simply because she learned to speak from me and I talked to her like a person, not a "little kid." Sometimes I had to stop and explain what a word or phrase meant, and I bit back a lot of prophanity, but those are the only changes I make when I'm talking to a 6-year-old vs. a 60-year-old.
