ED: I've decided to just keep posting ideas here for now. It's actually kind of fun.

- Snakes on an Oil Rig; Pansy sparks off the Ministry Liberation Battle after the Slytherin contingent flooed out of Hogwarts just before the Main Battle. As a result, they get exiled-to an oil rig off the coast of Madagascar. Fast forward seven years and they are in charge of the only fully magical source of oil in the world. Cue shenanigans, adventures, evil Dark Wizard drama queens and a whole shit load of magical innovation courtesy of Gregory Goyle, inventor extraordinaire. I am actually working on this one.

- Aurors at large: The Golden Trio & friends have figured out how to climb the ranks of the Ministry without having to go through the whole 'do the same job for ten years before maybe being considered for a pay rise' bullshit. Good for them. It involves becoming Aurors-at-large, International Law Enforcement personnel troubleshooting magical problems in places where magical communities are either under severe pressure or non-existent. Forms the basis of quite a few crossovers.

- Starship Wizards; all the muggleborn and muggle-raised are abducted on january the first, 1990.Drafted by the Holy Empire of Belka to fight on the front lines of their planned pan-galactic invasion, the only way back they have requires them to win the war. In true Potter style, It Gets Worse. Nanoha Cross.

- The Dragon Queen of Narnia; Arturia Potter's cupboard ejects her into Narnia in the Narnian Year 600. The Unnamed Continent is in turmoil as the fall of the Calormen 300 years earlier plunged everything into chaos. The kings of Narnia are powerless. Warbands, Mercenaries and Bandits carve up the landscape. The Pevensies are four hundred years away. And Arturia Potter, all of five years of age, pulls a sword out of a stone. This is not going to end well.

- The first Blood War: as the only magical European nation unsullied by large-scale conflict for more than 200 years, magical Britain in 1971 was the richest and most influential of all magical nations. By 1981, it would be little more than a small gathering of enclaves scattered amongst the ruins & mass graves of what had been a great nation not so long ago. This is the history of how a civil war burned one of the most prosperous countries of its time to the ground. This is the first blood war.

- Fate/Zero Warning: Seven Masters, Seven Servants and thirteen of those most affected by their conflict are reborn in a world where Gaia has no sway over magic, the age of Gods may or may not have ended and magi are... nice? 26 characters from Fate/Zero are reborn and go to Hogwarts. That's 26 reasons why the Magical World should be very, very afraid.

- Voldemort truly died that night. The horcruxes, however, didn't follow him. As a result, small areas of the UK are transformed into Zones that only the insane, the desperate and the magical dare to venture into. On October 31st 2001, a massive magical storm causes anomalies to appear outside of their Zones-with disastrous consequences for everyone. With magic running wild and the bodycount skyrocketing, the remnants of the Order of the Phoenix desperately try to rescue what little of the magical world is left all while solving the puzzle of what, exactly, they should do. A Harry Potter/STALKER crossover.

- Being the Master of Death is suffering. Just ask Rose Weasley, bastard daughter of Harry Potter, about it.

- Outbreak: The Werewolf Curse goes airborne.

- There's a perfectly rational explanation for this: Muggle scientists discover magic, which the magical world discovers far too late. Awkward coverups, government ineptitude and eye-rolling muggleborns soon follow.

- Contingency planning for brainiacs: Hermione was fired from her Ministry position. Harry and Ron were indefinitely assigned to guarding the Department of Mystery's trash chute. This turned out to be a bad, bad move on the Ministry's behalf.

- The Bash Fic: In which Ron's in it for the money, Dumbledore's in it for the greater good, Molly's in it to clear an old debt and the Order of the Phoenix are in it to win it. With everyone and their grandparents jostling to take advantage of a stubbornly oblivious Boy Hero, there's bound to be friction down the line. A fic in which you get to see everything from the perspective of the 'bad guy'-whoever that may be.

- Reptilia's (slightly modified) challenge: He never did believe in second chances. He got one anyway. Of course, nothing goes smoothly for a re-incarnated boy hero sent back to off a Dark Lord properly this time. But this time around Tom Riddle had a few things going for him.

- Just taking a very long break: Harry Potter, fed up with the constant problems thrown his way, decides to take an extended vacation abroad. His chosen HQ? Brockton Bay. An HP/Worm crossover.

- Dangerously genre savvy: In which the Slytherins are very well aware of just how much magic loves a story and do their level best to stay out of it. Unfortunately for them, Draco's an attention-seeking idiot and Harry's a dangerously suicidal one. When the boy hero's polyjuice wears off, Slytherin House has a choice to make: embrace the role of Background Evil Mooks and die horribly or become Unexpected Allies of Partial Darkness and face a 50/50 chance of dying horrifically. Warning: reading TV tropes may be required to get the most out of this idea.

- The All Hitwizard party: Harry's first assignment as an Auror sounds like it's right up his alley-a bunch of Dark Wizards who are hell-bent on slaughtering 40-year-old muggle virgins in order to summon Voldemort's shade and get his magical knowledge for themselves. As 40-year-old muggle virgins don't exactly grow on trees, he has some time to investigate and get ready for the confrontation. That's the good news. The bad news? Robards saddled him with a team of hitwizards to 'help out'. Follow Sarge, Doc, Nubby, Cutter, Heavy, Aimy, Tink, Twitch, Crisp and friends as they desperately try to stay alive in the face of an average day in Harry Potter's life. A Harry Potter/[[http://www.theallguardsmenparty.com/index.html][The All Guardsmen Party]] crossover.

- The Way of The Wands: The magical world died and nobody noticed. Witches and Wizards born with the ability to command magic are numerous yet isolated and ignorant of one another. Magic that was once shackled now runs free. The last barriers erected by the last wand-wielders have fallen. And now, for nine months every year, people ranging from the age of eleven upwards are dropped into a world where the only immutable law is Magic Is Everything and find out that, to end this cycle, they need to learn the greatest secret of a dead world-wandcraft-or die trying. Inspired by [[http://www.yurishwedoff.gallery/2016/5/14/rhg1zc1r8l06envasa2ct1fvbb6ziq][this gallery]].

  - Thoughts for the idea above: Template is essentially Urbanised dystopia surrounded by bleak countryside whose borders are ringed by dead volcanoes. The only magical inhabitants apart from the wizards & witches are magical beasts found in the HP series. Plot points would be development of wandless magic as a set of casts take on epic quests in order to discover the means to end their problem. Wandless magic has harsh conditions set upon it akin to the magics found in the Dresden 'verse; To seek to kill with magic, change another's form, toy with other's minds, steal others' memories, enthrall others, raise the dead, seek to attain knowledge from beyond the boundaries of the Universe and manipulate the flow of time is to invite ruin and death upon yourself & others. Whether this should feature canon characters, OCs, crossover characters or otherwise is completely up to the author. The main thrust for the initial chapters (hell, even the first story set there, tbh) is the environment-the mix of urban and fantastical, the familiar with the terrifying, Alice in Wonderland on heroin cut with a dash of technology and so on.

This is not a post-apocalyptic setting-the urban areas are largely /intact/ and most of those wizards and/or witches living there keep it that way.

In essence, the cityscape would be the initial important thrust-doorways that lead to familiar yet empty landscapes-London, New York, Moscow, Capetown, La Paz, you name it- that only start decaying when more than a set number of people arrive there. Phones, computers and other tech work somehow, but there is no processed organic material other than the characters to be found. They'll have to hunt the magical creatures that roam these cityscapes for food whilst trying to escape to the areas beyond.

There are hints left behind by others that have come before-caches of handwritten notes, crudely manufactured books, word documents and so on that tell of the powers they learned and the quests they went on in search of Wandlore-as well as scattered books left behind by the dead magical world itself-potions and alchemy, astrology and arithmancy, Runes and treatises on the Dark Arts- that help them learn how to use their magic wandlessly.

This world is wildly dangerous as things have a tendency to manifest at the worst possible time-a nuclear pile reactor, ancient satellites, weapons, technology and clothing from the dawn to the end of humanity come into existence there. Couple that with the magical artefacts that have been known to randomly appear & disappear at will and you get an added level of danger in this area.

Also, Hogwarts exists, though it appears to be scattered across this world.

Anyway, new idea, what do you think?
