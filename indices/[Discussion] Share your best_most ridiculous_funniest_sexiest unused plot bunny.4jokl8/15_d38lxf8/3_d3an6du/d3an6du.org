  The Dragon Queen of Narnia; Arturia Potter's cupboard ejects her into Narnia in the Narnian Year 600. The Unnamed Continent is in turmoil as the fall of the Calormen 300 years earlier plunged everything into chaos. The kings of Narnia are powerless. Warbands, Mercenaries and Bandits carve up the landscape. The Pevensies are four hundred years away. And Arturia Potter, all of five years of age, pulls a sword out of a stone. This is not going to end well.

The fate stay night go to Hogwarts thing sounds like it would make for an excellent shortstory
