Well the Arturia Potter idea is also a bit of a shadow F/SN and F/Z crossover. Though she isn't /the/ Arturia Pendragon of the series (for one thing, her father's not Uther and Camelot's supposedly on Earth rather than Lion!Jesus's private Disneyland), she proves herself equal to her forebearer's legend (though whether the two are related or not is ultimately up to the author-plausible circumstance says yes, 'let's-make-shit-interesting' wants no, but maybe if you sneak a peek at it from outside the 12 known dimensions-kinda) and just as eager to correct the absolute disaster she thought her reign ended up being.

Take note that, in my mind, she's actually a bit of a villain here if only because she prioritises her kingdom's safety over Aslan's fuckery. He's trying to use her to re-establish law & order across the continent and she's basically saying 'no, fuck that, one kingdom is enough trouble as it is', so he's pushing the other kingdoms to provoke her. This, predictably, ends about as badly as you think it does.

Also, Caliburn is the Sword of Kings and Excalibur is the Sword of Promised Victory. Caliburn was reforged by the fae before being stuck in a rock and dumped in Narnia and Excalibur is on loan from the Lady of The Lake and made by the fae too. Notice how both deal with human concepts and neither are handed down by Angels unto mortal men? Yeah, that plays a part there...

Shit, plot bunnies man, whaddya do when they get your brain?
