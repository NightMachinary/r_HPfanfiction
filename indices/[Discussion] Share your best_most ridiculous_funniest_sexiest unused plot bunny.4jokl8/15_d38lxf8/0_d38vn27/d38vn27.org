  Voldemort truly died that night. The horcruxes, however, didn't follow him. As a result, small areas of the UK are transformed into Zones that only the insane, the desperate and the magical dare to venture into. On October 31st 2001, a massive magical storm causes anomalies to appear outside of their Zones-with disastrous consequences for everyone. With magic running wild and the bodycount skyrocketing, the remnants of the Order of the Phoenix desperately try to rescue what little of the magical world is left all while solving the puzzle of what, exactly, they should do. A Harry Potter/STALKER crossover.

  Being the Master of Death is suffering. Just ask Rose Weasley, bastard daughter of Harry Potter, about it.

If someone would get this done without bash... ah, naive dreams.
