I have 40+ short ideas for stories I will probably never get to written down, so here are the more absurd of the bunch in the hopes that someone likes that and takes them somewhere.

1. Someone starts publishing a not quite accurate version of Harry's story, and then wants to make a movie, so Harry takes on the fake name of Daniel Radcliffe and gets his own role in the movie while slowly trying to get the full truth into the script. ((Like changing 'Barry into Harry or something I guess)) Optional - Fem!Harry who is pretending to be a guy so she can get the part.

2. Phoenix tears being poisonous if wanted, Fawkes starts killing off Dumbledore and others and no one suspects.

3. Dumbledore basically sacrifices Harry in a ritual to bring back his sister, but instead bring Harry back in her body. Evil!Dumbles, as would be expected.

I have more obviously, but the rest are either standard plots with a tiny twist, or not a Harry Potter Fic.
