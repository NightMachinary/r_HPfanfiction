Im my head it starts with some Gryffindors parent getting cancer and Neville being the caring soul he is decides to grow one of Uncle Algies 'special' plants that helped Algie through his own cancer. Seamus and Dean realise what he's growing and ask him for some and in his attempt to make friends gives them some. Neville eventually becomes the unwitting drug kingpin of Hogwarts. I thought some stuff about the legality of cannabis in the wizarding world would come into play eventually as well.
