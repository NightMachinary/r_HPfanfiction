In my head I have the ressurection scene in mind and Voldemort being like "You know what, Harry? Go! Take the cup and go! I'll deal later with you. In about three to four months. Because that is when Wormtail here is going to be allowed to die."

And then Harry lies in bed, not with nightmares of a horrifying Voldemort, but with rather embarassing dreams about the naked woman that came out of the cauldron.

Ooooooh... I want this so bad.
