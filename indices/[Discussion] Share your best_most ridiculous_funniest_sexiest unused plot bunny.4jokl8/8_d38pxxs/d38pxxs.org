I'm too lazy or preoccupied to write these, feel free to adopt.

- Just after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry discovers that his entire life had been a "Truman Show" type reality show (possibly only he and Voldemort weren't in on the secret, or the entire wizarding world was just a simulated reality). He is brought in to a live interview in the show's studios, which I intended to use to mock some stupid fanon/fandom notions in the form of audience questions and Harry's answers.

- Mad scientist Hagrid making horrible animal experiments to produce new species of monsters, in an au where he's allowed to do magic. Nobody tries to stop or arrest him because they're too afraid of the monsters he keeps as pets.
