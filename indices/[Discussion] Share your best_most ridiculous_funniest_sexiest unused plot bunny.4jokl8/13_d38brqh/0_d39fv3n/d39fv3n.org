Well the attitude would definitely be weird here. Consider Ron's eating habits and Hermione's reaction to them.

With Hermione:

"Ron! Stop shoveling that food! I spent an hour getting it ready, so the least you can do is enjoy eating it!"

"Bff I eeem!"

"Aaargh! And finish eating before answering! Honestly, grow up Ron!"

With Fem!Harry:

"So you like my food, I take it?"

"Mmmhmm!"

"Do you want some more?"

"Mmmhmm!"

"Take it slower and it'll last longer."

"Mmmm?"

"Yes Ron, definitely."

Harry was always better at Ron-speak than Hermione. I can see that translating fairly well into a relationship.

Also, fem!Harry would probably have different standards than most about what constitutes a compliment given her track record, which is something Ron appreciates.

"Oi Harriet!"

"Yeah Ron?"

"Did you do something with your dress today?"

"No. Why?"

"Because your breasts keep distracting me."

"RON! THAT'S... Wait, that's actually very nice of you. Thank you."

"No problem. See you at work then?"

"I-yeah... see ya. "
