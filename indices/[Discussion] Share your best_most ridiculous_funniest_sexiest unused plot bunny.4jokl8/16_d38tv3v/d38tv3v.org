Things I'm not likely to get to in the next decade:

1 .Harry Potter and the Solari Inquisition - Harry and co. get cornered in the Time room in the Department of Mysteries, and an accident with the time turners sends them forty years back in time. They manage to escape the country without arousing suspicion, and meet up in France to discuss their next move. Eventually they agree to split up and find ways to prepare for Voldemort on their own, meeting each other every ten years to stay in contact. Each go their separate ways, except for Ron and Ginny who stick together. Thirty-nine years later, they meet up a final time. All of them have their own lives, and none of them can stand the sight of each other.

Neville is a magical chemist addicted to his own product. Hermione is married and is the head researcher of the Library of Alexandria. Ron and Ginny apprenticed under a Succubus and Incubus respectively. Luna became a puppeteer, controlling shrunken dolls into which she stuffed the souls of serial killers. And last but not least, Harry is an experienced Dark wizard who got his face stolen - [[https://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkwqmhNQuN1qcknx9o1_500.jpg][Literally.]] He hides his blank face behind a smiling golden theater mask.

2 . Gloria Potter, The Light Bringer - runic artificer fic. Gloria gets it in her head that the Power He Knows Not is a runic weapon. Fortunately, she took Ancient Runes. Unfortunately, her attempts keep blowing up in her face. While studying with Hermione, she stumbles across the [[https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8&q=fibonacci%20sequence&oq=fibonacci%20sequence&aqs=chrome.0.0l6.3131j0j7][Fibonacci Sequence]] and applies it to her own work in the form of a javelin, and succeeds. When Voldemort attacks the castle and demands Gloria surrender herself, Gloria stands on the parapet and hurls her weapon at Voldemort. The javelin strikes with such force that it lights up the country side like an atomic bomb and creates a crater the size of the quidditch pitch. Gloria gains the title Light-Bringer and everyone is reminded why the magical world stopped using those kinds of weapons in the first place.

3 .The Pureblood Plague - Voldemort died and nothing changed. Harry decides that's not enough. Though he is a Transfiguration prodigy taught by McGonagall and Dumbledore, he knows that it's not sutble enough. So he trains to be a healer under Poppy Pomfrey, but specializes in magical diseases. Finding one that is deadly but not contagious, he transfigures a mosquito out of metal and has it feed from diseased blood, then sends it after his target. Soon, former Death Eaters begin dropping dead like flies, and eventually the remaining group catches on. When they corner Harry in a house, Harry reveals his latest project in the form of a large, buzzing incubation nest the size of an entire doorway. Organic transfiguration of inanimate matter, he says proudly, then splits open the egg. Thousands of locusts, all made of metal with diamond tipped mandibles, pour out of the egg and descend upon the Death Eaters, stripping flesh from bone and then gnawing bone into dust.*

*I have no idea if locusts can actually do that. Let's just say magic and call it a day.
