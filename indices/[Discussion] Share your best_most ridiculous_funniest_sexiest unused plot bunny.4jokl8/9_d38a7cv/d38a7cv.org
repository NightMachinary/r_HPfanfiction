Some plot bunnies of this evening:

- *Harry Potter: Master Herbologist.* Allying with the good Neville Longbottom, Harry works to weaponize some magical plants and uproot the battle to bring it straight to Voldemort. The power the Dark Lord knows not is most certainly a rhododendron bush.

- *Harry Potter & The Hogwarts Toilet Seat* Due to a traumatic event in his childhood, Harry becomes accustomed to exploring the sewers around Privet Drive, and upon arriving at school pursues his natural inclinations to enjoy the pipework. The power the Dark Lord knows not? Indoor plumbing.

- *The Road To That Gold Place* Post-DH. Harry and Ron get together and seek out the mythical, magical city of El Dorado!

- *Harry, Hermione & The Hieroglyphs* Post-DH. Having enjoyed a marathon of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones together, Harry and Hermione have found their true callings in life - they're going to become pseudo-archaeologists and go searching for buried treasure, and you can bet they're going to look sexy while doing it!

- *Harry Potter On Stage* Harry leaves the wizarding world to pursue his /real/ dream of becoming a Broadway choreographer.

- *Master Of The Catacombs* Drunkenly lost in the catacombs of Paris after a particularly wild party, Harry stumbles over a secret, underground society of hyperintelligent gnomes, and he becomes their saviour.
