  Harry, Hermione & The Hieroglyphs Post-DH. Having enjoyed a marathon of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones together, Harry and Hermione have found their true callings in life - they're going to become pseudo-archaeologists and go searching for buried treasure, and you can bet they're going to look sexy while doing it!
