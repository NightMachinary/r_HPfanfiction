I would read the shit out of that. Also, Manny is in fact Wormtail and Fran is a Bellatrix Lestrange who switched out with her body double and is desperately trying to figure out how the muggle world works so that she can convert Voldemort's stash of gold into British Pounds without being arrested for it.

Cue a very confused wizarding world.
