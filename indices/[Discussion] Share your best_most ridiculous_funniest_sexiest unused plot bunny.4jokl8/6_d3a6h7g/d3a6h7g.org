A favorite premise for an "evil Dumbledore" story that I've never gotten around to writing:

As an infant, while on a routine checkup at St. Mungos, Harry accidentally ingests Unicorn blood. Because the curse cannot afflict an innocent, it manifests instead as a bad-luck curse that surrounds him, affecting those who come near. This is the Power He Knows Not.

Later, after his parents would perish despite hiding under a Fidelius charm (a seemingly "perfect defense"), Voldemort would attack him and suffer a one-in-a-million reflection of the Killing Curse. Sirius would pick up the infant to hand him to Hagrid and hours later be framed for a murder he didn't commit. Hagrid... well, his Giant blood made him immune to the curse. (He's the only person Harry can safely be with for any extended period of time.)

Dumbledore (the mustache-twirling kind) actually recognizes the curse for what it was. In a stroke of brilliance, he has Hagrid leave Harry with the Dursleys intentionally because they were the "worst sort of Muggle."

The Dursleys aren't dumb. They realize quickly that they need to isolate Harry, locking him away from them in his cupboard to avoid contact.

As he grows up, everyone Harry befriends suffers a horrible fate (though as time goes on, rarely fatal), but he never really catches on as to why.

His adventures at Hogwarts would revolve around Dumbledore manipulating Harry's curse, trying (and failing, more often than not) to get his adversaries to suffer the effects of his curse.

Tone-wise, I'd aim for light comedy, much like BajaB's Lazy Harry series. Of course, one would be obligated to try for the most ridiculous events, ones that backfire on Dumbledore (the bad guy in this--perhaps with a Voldemort who is terrified of Harry and just wants to be left alone).

Part of the reason I never wrote this up was because I discovered later on that one of the main characters (Luna) of the /Alex Verus/ series by Benedict Jacka has a very similar curse. It sort of took the wind out of my sails.

Maybe someday...
