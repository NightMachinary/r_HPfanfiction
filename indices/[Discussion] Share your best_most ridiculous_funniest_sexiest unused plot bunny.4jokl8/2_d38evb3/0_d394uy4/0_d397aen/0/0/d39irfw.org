There definitely is a quidditch analogue to LFC in this fic, but it's Montrose, not Chudley. In fact, most of Harry's playing career with Montrose is interesting: he won the European Championship in 2005 with them, lost it in 2007, and ended up staying at the club captain even when they nearly went into administration in 2010. Sound like someone familiar?

Furthermore, Harry's relationship with Oliver Wood, who is the Puddlemere manager in the fic, is analagous to the real-life relationship between Kenny Dalglish and Alex Ferguson. So, there's a lot of stuff an LFC supporter might be able to recognise if I ever get around to writing the damned thing.
