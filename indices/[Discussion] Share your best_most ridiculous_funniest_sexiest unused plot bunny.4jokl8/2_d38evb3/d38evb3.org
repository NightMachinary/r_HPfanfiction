I have a few plot bunnies:

1.) *Coded Times* : [Adventure/Mystery] 1984. Action movies, football hooliganism, electronic music, and the Cold War. When a routine anti-Dark Magic operation deep in the heart of the Soviet Union goes awry, James Potter makes a chilling discovery: a high-ranking member of the British Ministry has turned traitor. With enemies on all sides, Potter is tasked with the mission of finding the mole within the Wizengamot and silencing him before he leaks something far more important than just an intelligence op to enemies of the realm.

Essentially, it's a James-centric half detective noir/half spy thriller fic that follows the premise that Voldemort only killed Lily when he attacked Godric's Hollow.

2.) *Ronald Weasley and the Velvet Divorce*: [Adventure/Humour] Ronald Weasley didn't do marriage well, and handled divorce even more poorly. On a trip around the Mediterranean to clear his head, Ron stumbles onto an escapade that may set his life back on track: a story of loss, dissatisfaction, middle age existential ennui, adventure, and accepting yourself for terrible, horrible human being you really are. Rated 'M' for frequent references to masturbation.

3.) *The Ballad of Arlfield*: [Comedy/Mystery] "Some people believe Quidditch is a matter of life and death, I am very disappointed with that attitude. I can assure you it's much, much more important than that." - Bill Shankly, probably.

Three years after taking over as Chudley Cannons manager, Harry Potter has reversed their fortune nearly completely, having brought the Cannons high up enough in the league to contend for the League Cup and now reaching the European Cup final in what looks to be an all-England final against Puddlemere United. Even though they're led by the oldest goalkeeper in the league in Ronald Weasley, and Potter's hotshot godson Teddy Lupin as Seeker, they can't compete with Puddlemere on paper, which features some of the best players money can buy. The fic chronicles the three weeks leading up to the Final, and the morning after. Add in a kidnapping subplot, and Harry dealing with numerous, dimwitted, and frankly malicious side characters, and we've got my shoddy attempt at turning HP into a Coen Brothers movie. And I do have to stress that while it technically is a quidditch fic, it's more of a love letter to football than anything else, given the amount of parallelism between the fic and real-life events in football.
