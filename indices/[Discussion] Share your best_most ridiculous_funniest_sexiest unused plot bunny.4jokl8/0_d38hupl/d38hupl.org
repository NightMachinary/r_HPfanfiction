-Harry Potter and the Unstumpable Trump; A young Harry winds up going to Grunnings with his Uncle Vernon, where he meets Donald Trump. The Donald, out of the goodness of his heart, teaches Harry the importance of business. Basically it's a small crack fic of Harry acting like Trump and changing canon.

-Ron Weasley and the Power He Knows Not; Ron goes nineteen years back in time to first year, in order to protect Harry and save the Wizarding World. Ron is a real bro in this, even charming the Goblet in putting him in as a fifth champion so he can help out Harry. The power the Dark Lord knows not? Harry Potter having a time traveling friend.

-Ron Weasley and the unexpected journey: basically a crack version of the second one. Ron comes back...in his 30 something year old body, but still pretends to be an eleven year old. Voldemort is the only one who notices that he's not a kid.

Harry: "Professor Dumbledore, sir, Voldemort said some things about Ron...about how he's not really a kid."

Dumbledore: "Voldemort would do anything to turn you against your friends, Harry. When I look at Ron, I see a young happy lad, beginning to grow into a fine young man."

Ron: /Smokes a cigarette, drinks beer from a bag, and is eyeing up the seventh year girls/

Dumbledore: "A fine young man indeed."
