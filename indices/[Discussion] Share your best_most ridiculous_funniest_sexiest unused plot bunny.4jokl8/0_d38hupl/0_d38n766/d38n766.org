  Ron Weasley and the unexpected journey: basically a crack version of the second one. Ron comes back...in his 30 something year old body, but still pretends to be an eleven year old. Voldemort is the only one who notices that he's not a kid. Harry: "Professor Dumbledore, sir, Voldemort said some things about Ron...about how he's not really a kid." Dumbledore: "Voldemort would do anything to turn you against your friends, Harry. When I look at Ron, I see a young happy lad, beginning to grow into a fine young man." Ron: Smokes a cigarette, drinks beer from a bag, and is eyeing up the seventh year girls Dumbledore: "A fine young man indeed."
