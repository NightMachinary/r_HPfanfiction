- Sparked by Rowlings "History of the Potters", I imagined Charlus' and Doreas side of the Potter family. Torn between pureblood idealism, traditions, love and his own ambition, James' cousin, Aurelius leaves the country after his seventh year never to be seen again. Not until a desperate Minerva McGonagall sets out to look for the last remaining adult Potter of the world to take care of his cousins child. Follow Aurelius, the world traveler, as he struggles to raise Harry, close old scars and tear open new ones.

I always wanted to write this one, but I haven't yet gotten the right feel for it.

- Heroes are not born, they are made. Or in Poppy Potters case, forged. Raised by Minerva McGonagall and Albus Dumbledore, Poppy Potter has soon found her passions in two things, the Arcane and the forge. It is her dream to become a Grand Artificer, a master of magical engineering and Art. One evening, after her fifth year, Poppy stands at her forge, working on her greatest project yet, when Fate struck. The fires of the forge burn her, melt her skin from her bones. But she doesn't die. Instead, she is reborn, her bones hard as iron, her skin tough as titanium and her eyes glowing with the power of a vulcan. She rises, an avatar of Hephaistos.

This one is more the "I really want to do something with gods..." thing lying around.

- We write the year 581 BC. A war rages among the celts of the british isles, with one man terrorizing the whole of the countries with his fierce warriors and ruthless druids. The name of the warlord is Voldemort, elder of the druids and traitor to nature. But one night, on the day when the ghosts come haunting, he was defeated - by a mere babe, no less. Fourteen years later, the babe Haralrd Jymson, child of a viking seidr and and saxon Hexe, is sent away to learn from the Southeners beyond the great mountains to become the greatest wizard the Isles have ever seen. Together with his mentor, the fierce shieldmaiden Moireach (Minerva McGonagall) of the picts and his friends, the loyal and brave Ronat of the Celts as well as the orphaned Hermenas, born of etruskian adventurers, he sets out on his greatest adventure along the Amber Road.

This one is on my to-do list. I'm not sure when its going to happen, but it is going to happen.

- Harry Potter and the War against Chaos. Bernadette, the Grim Reaper, is always on the lookout for new members of her Vigil. When Harry jumps in the way of an Avada Kedavra, a month after the final battle, to save a child he had never met before, she makes him a proposal. Harry becomes part of the Vigil and is on his way to become the greatest Guardian of the Veil, known to all who have reason to fear hims as "The Archmage". A Harry Potter x [[http://nebezial.deviantart.com/art/death-vigil-pages1to6-424856555][Death Vigil]] crossover.

I love Death Vigil. I want to make a crossover with it.

- Harry decides one day to see where some of the weirder paths on the Marauders Map lead. Deep within the school, he finds relics of oldest times, speaking of ages long forgotten as well as something he remembers quite dearly. The Veil. But after closer inspection he sees that this one doesn't whisper. Instead, he hears cheering, laughing and the occasional crackle and explosion of fireworks. But the Veil is dangerous, not because of where it leads, but because it lures you in. Not able to withstand, Harry enters the Veil, only to find himself appearing at the edge of a gigantic arena where ten participants, humans, monsters, beings - forces of nature, all of them - battle each other. The name of the arena is Summoners Rift, and Harry is about to be drafted.

HP x League of Legends crossover. This one is also on my plate, for the sole reason that there is not one good League crossover out there.
