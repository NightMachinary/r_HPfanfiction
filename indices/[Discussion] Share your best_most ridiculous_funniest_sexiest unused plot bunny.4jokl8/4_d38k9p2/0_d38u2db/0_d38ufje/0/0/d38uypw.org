Thats what I wanted to know.

I personally love the new way Riot is trying to give their characters a bit of backstory. The Opening of the Tomb of Shurima is certainly one of the more interesting things. With Harry as Xerath, it would mean that Nasus was his warden for a few thousand years and Renekton the poor soul that had to endure Harry's torture (if we want to stay on the lore). Voldemort as Azir, and Sivir as the last of his bloodline could make an interesting antagonist pair. Cassiopeia could be a decent sidekick to Xerath / Harry in her wish for vengeance for her curse.

But thats all just brainstorming :D
