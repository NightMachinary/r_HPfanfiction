Heck yes, League of Legends crossover. I have one planned myself.

Xerath!Harry. Voldemort won, and Harry is cornered in a cave that contains an exposed magical leyline. With no way out, he does a very Harry kind of thing and grabs the leyline. The cave is sealed in a burst of magic. With his victory complete, Voldemort builds his fortress on top of the entrance, and carves a warning into the wall above the cave entrance. "Beware the wrath of wizards," it reads. On the other side of the world, Luna Lovegood weeps. Millennium later, after a world changing magical cataclysm caused by Voldemort before he died, the building now known as the Institute of War is found and inhabited. Deep beneath the Institute, the message, almost perfectly preserved, is found. The last word, however, was near illegible. Scholars were only able recover three letters, making the message read "Beware the wrath of --zar--". The cave beneath it was excavated, and a perfectly smooth boulder, practically thrumming with magical power, was set on display in the main hall, where it soon gained the name of "Zar's Wrath", and later shortened to "Xerath". Much like the Hall of Judgement, the Xerath Stone became a rite of passage for those who champion a cause and seek the aid of Zar's Wrath. One day, Diana Lovegood, Scorn of the Moon, and last of House Lovegood, stood before the stone, and Harry Potter woke up.
