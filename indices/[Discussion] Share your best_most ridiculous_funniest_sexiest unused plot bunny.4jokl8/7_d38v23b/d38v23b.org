Akira (movie version) reimagined with Harry Potter, where Tetsuo is embodied by Luna Lovegood. The original Akira-esque powerhouse would be Ariana Dumbledore.

In the late 1800's, the Department of Mysteries was researching 'magic is intent', and trying to liberate the mind from all constraints on reality-bending. Their experiments resulted in Ariana Dumbledore erasing Atlantis from history. Soon after, they shut down the project. Decades later, their top researchers Xeno and Miranda Lovegood rediscovered the Ariana materials and worked on their own 'liberated mind' in secret. What they created was a monster, capable of warping reality by the worst imaginings of the id whenever the constraints were broken. This is Luna. Miranda died putting the breakers on her mind in place, but every once in a while Luna's cage is broken, and something horrible is let loose.

For instance, the Weasleys used to have ten kids.

Albus and Flitwick are aware. Trelawney can sense it but is incapable of predicting around Luna's actions- she fears the little girl for that. Xeno just tries to distract Luna with safe, fanciful notions and conspiracy-politics; her reality-bending doesn't change individuals, usually. She can convert a mob of muggles into a zombie apocalypse, but her urges aren't fine-tuned enough to warp a government. The runic puzzles in the Quibbler are meant to train her mind to reinforce the cage. Others just find them challenging and occasionally inspirational.

It's when Harry makes the run at the Ministry to 'save Sirius' that Luna is pushed beyond her controls. When she finds Harry being possessed by Voldemort in the Atrium, things... happen. The rising Dark Lord loses some of his significance. Even if he can rebuild another body, he's really considering holding off for a bit. Maybe possess Nagini for a nice long holiday in Rwanda.

Harry is the Kaneda in this- the friend just trying to help, that may eventually have to put Luna down.
