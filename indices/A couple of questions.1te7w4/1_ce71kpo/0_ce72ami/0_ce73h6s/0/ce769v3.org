  Weasley-bashing is easy because all the Weasleys, apart from Bill, Charlie, and the Twins, have major flaws right there in Canon to build upon. Ron is stupid, Molly is controlling, Ginny is slutty, Arthur is a pushover, Percy is a narcissist...

You're projecting fanon onto several of the characters.

Bill and Charlie don't have enough screen time to evince their flaws.

Ron is far from stupid. He plays a mean game of chess, passes all his Hogwarts classes without effort, and is quick on his feet. Canon also indicates that Hermione was able to teach him to play FÃ¼r Elise on the piano in just a few days. (I don't know about you, but as a pianist I can say it took me years of practice to get to where I could play that.) More accurate would be to say he's undisciplined.

Canon Ginny is /not/ slutty. She is shown to have dated three guys in three years, attending a single date (the Yule Ball) with a fourth. This is hardly evidence of the sort of legendary promiscuity that the fanon attaches to her.

Arthur may be a gentle soul who is deferential to his wife, but he is no pushover. He stands up for what he believes in throughout the series. He joined the Order, fought in the Battle of the Seven Potters and the Battle of Hogwarts. He personally informed Harry of Sirius being after him. He got into a fistfight in public with Lucius Malfoy defending his family's honor. And he stayed in the Ministry in book 7 and publicly stood up for and advocated for Muggleborn. The guy had a core of strength to him and was sorted into Gryffindor for a reason.

I agree that Molly is controlling and Percy is overly self-absorbed. Yet both acquitted themselves in the Battle of Hogwarts. While they deserve some of their fanon caricatures, they were not without merit.
