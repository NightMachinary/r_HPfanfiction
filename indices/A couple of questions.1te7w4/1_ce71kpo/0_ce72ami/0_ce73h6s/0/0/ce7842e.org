Canon!Ginny is not a slut, but a Mary-Sue. She acquired a personality transplant in OotP and that, coupled with Rowling's godawful portrayal of romance between teenagers, makes her understandably unpopular.

I mean, really, it would be one thing if JKR had shown us some proper character growth, but this was the girl who was so insignificant that she had to accept Neville Longbottom's invitation to the Yule Ball because no one else would invite her, who seemed to have no actual friends and had to sit with Neville alone in a train compartment, and could barely talk to Harry without blushing and all of a sudden, she's this awesome Quidditch star, who's so popular that even Slytherin boys want her, who can cast a Hex that's so overpowered that it makes an elitist pureblood professor take note of her.

Is it surprising that anyone would find Ginny obnoxious?

Someone also pointed out that, in all of Ginny's interactions with Harry, she seems to be vastly more interested in the Boy-Who-lived than Harry Potter himself. If you were to replace all of her post-CoS interactions with Harry with Neville as the Boy-Who-Lived, there really wouldn't be very much difference.
