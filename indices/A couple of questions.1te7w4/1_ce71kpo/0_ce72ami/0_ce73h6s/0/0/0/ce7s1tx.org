Well this is an interesting take on the subject. In my opion Ginny is perfect for Harry. She has a similiar sense of humor and can make him laugh with out much effort, Harry obviously needs some laughter after the life he has lived. She shares the same interests as him. She isn't quick to tears, Harry has shown after his relationship with Cho that he isn't comfortable with crying. She is pretty much the only one who can also stand up to his fierce temper. She also understands him, she was able to make the hard descion to let Harry leave her for her own safety, which fundamentaly goes against her personality, this was only possible because of how much she loved and understood him. Finally she gave him a normal life, she gave him his greatest dream and the hope of a continuation of that life after his quest was finished.

Now that stuff about her being a Mary-Sue and her getting a personality transplant. Post-CoS we didn't really get any interaction with Ginny, we also later learn that she took advice from Hermione and started dating other boys in order to stop being so shy around Harry, that leads me to the assumption that she avoided interaction with Harry as much as possible till OotP when she felt comfortable around him. If she avoided interaction with Harry then that means that we never really get to see her true self, however we often heard from her brothers about her fierce temper and power of will we even get evidence of it when she stands up to Draco the first time she meets him. So her personality didn't really transform and she didn't magically become comfortable around Harry after one summer, because in the few interactions we had with her we saw evidence that she gradualy became more comfortable around him.

The thing about her magic power isn't really that surprising seeing as she is a seventh child and the person who broke the Weasley curse.

If we replaced Neville with Harry as the Boy-Who-Lived, they would still be entirely different characters. Neville might be more assertive but he wouldn't become Harry just because he was the Boy-Who-Lived so all those interactions would be different.
