While she may be the perfect girl for cannon Harry (which I don't personally agree with but can understand the opinion), I think most fanfics change the character of Harry dramatically.

I personally can't stand Harry/Ginny pairings, not really sure why that is. I think it is just that I have read too many ginny bashing fics. At this point I have read more fanfic stories than the original books, and thus my perceptions of the characters have moved beyond how they are presented in the books. In part it is a self-perpetuating cycle, as the more I read fics that bash ginny the more I dislike her, and the more I don't enjoy fics that place ginny as a pivotal positive character.
