  passes all his Hogwarts classes without effort
#+end_quote

Well, "passes" isn't exactly honours, especially for the weakest electives. He also /failed/ his Divination and History of Magic O.W.L.s, so that isn't even true. And he /always/ whines about anything class related. I think that is very poor support for the idea he's some supermind.

  Canon also indicates that Hermione was able to teach him to play FÃ¼r Elise on the piano in just a few days.
#+end_quote

Not that hard for the first dozen measures, which is really more likely. Pros don't "learn" pieces that fast, but any kid who's been forced into lessons before could get the easy beginning movements of that selection. Playing the piano isn't rocket science.

  Canon Ginny is not slutty. She is shown to have dated three guys in three years, attending a single date (the Yule Ball) with a fourth.
#+end_quote

Which is close to infinity more dating than any main characters until book six. Going to the ball isn't the same as dating steady, especially for our main three. Ginny also has a really bad canon case of PDA, which is usually a "sign" or code in certain types of YA literature in the United States for a shameful young woman. Which is messed up, but that's why it is popular fanon.

The thing is, the books don't exactly disprove the idea, either. And in many, many cases, people with that sort of, shall we say /breadth of experience/ would, in fact, be called sluts by their peers. So having a 14 year old call Ginny one in a fanfic isn't absurd. Having her sleeping around, however, is clearly silly. Though I don't know how anyone of either gender could have gone all Seventh (her Sixth) year hanging around AdorableHunk!Matthew Lewis in the /Come/ and /Go/ room (cough) and not tried /something/...

  Arthur may be a gentle soul who is deferential to his wife, but he is no pushover.
#+end_quote

The biggest moments for him are bumbling around Muggle stuff, sorta losing a fistfight, and almost getting ganked by a snake, then ending up in a hospital bed for everyone to crowd around being sad. Nothing against him, but not super strong warrior moments either. I think, given Percy's complaints about him, it is understandable.

And Sorting is not admissible evidence, otherwise it would be used in court trials. Also, see Wormtail.

  I agree that Molly is controlling and Percy is overly self-absorbed. Yet both acquitted themselves in the Battle of Hogwarts. While they deserve some of their fanon caricatures, they were not without merit.
#+end_quote

Using the final battle in the worst book in the series to redeem people doesn't really work for me. It smacks of trying to cram in characterization in a very weak and manipulative way.

It also seems like you're simply defending the characters you like more, like Ginny and Ron, and ignoring the bad things that are sometimes the most clearly expressed attributes of characters in the books.

If a fifth of the time you hear about Ginny in the later books is about who she's kissing, that colors things. If Ron is always groaning about classes and ducking the harder electives, while also a total sports head, then yeah. People will draw conclusions.

When people write fanfiction, they often draw out things that were lesser attributes and expand on them. I think that explains the "why" of those fanon tropes. That does /not/ excuse blind, stupid, ranging bashing, but it does go towards explaining it.
