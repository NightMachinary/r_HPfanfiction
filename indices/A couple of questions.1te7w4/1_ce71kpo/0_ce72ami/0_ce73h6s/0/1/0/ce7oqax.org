I didn't claim Ron was a supermind; I said he wasn't stupid any more than Ginny was the Gryffindor bike. They have flaws (part of writing well is to give one's characters flaws and let them be human), but the fanon extremes to which they are drawn are pretty unsubstantiated in canon, "YA code" or not.

In bashing fics these characters are made more abhorrent than Malfoy or Snape, which I find just silly.
