  1. Why is Nightmares of Futures Past the most favorited fic on fanfiction.net? I find it boring and revatively uneventful, even though it features themes I usually love such as time travel, powerful Harry and Harry/Ginny.
#+end_quote

I only made it halfway through myself... I think it was extremely popular while being written, and a lot of the favorites came from that time period. Rather like a TV show, fics can be great in episodes and kind of crappy all together at once.

  1. What's up with the Draco love? He was douche with no redeming qualities in the books.
#+end_quote

Tom Felton (actor in the movies) was sexy. Also, the "good girls like bad guys" thing. I don't read Draco fics.

  1. Why do people hate on Ginny? In my opinion she is the perfect girl for Harry.
#+end_quote

Weasley-bashing is popular in general. The idea with Ginny is supposed to be that she was a Harry Potter fangirl slut, and this undeserving of the "real Harry".

  1. Who is Daphne Greengrass? I found alot of Harry/Daphne fics, was there ever even any interaction with her in the novels?
#+end_quote

Nope not really. She's a Slytherin in Harry's year; her little sister Astoria marries Draco in canon. This is the female version of the Draco phenomenon in some fics, in others she's the misunderstood daughter of an upright Pureblood family who's actually OK with Muggleborns and hates the Dark Lord. IDK.

  1. Why do people bash? Sure I understand disliking a character, but taking a characters flaws and magnifying them just takes away from the story.
#+end_quote

I agree. Except manipulative!Dumbledore, I love that shit!!

Harry Potter and the Seventh Horcrux is an alternative Deathly Hallows and my favorite H/G. H/Hr is my favorite though, so... That's all I have. I recommend using the filters when you search (don't check "pairing", that's a new feature and older fics don't have it enabled). My basic search is 100k+ words, Complete, English, any rating, WITHOUT Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape
