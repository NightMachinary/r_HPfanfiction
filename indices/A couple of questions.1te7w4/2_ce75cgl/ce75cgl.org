- 1. Why is Nightmares of Futures Past the most favorited fic on fanfiction.net? I find it boring and revatively uneventful, even though it features themes I usually love such as time travel, powerful Harry and Harry/Ginny.

First off, it's not the most favorited fic. That honor belongs to the equally polarizing Methods of Rationality of LessWrong.

NoFP was, for its time, a remarkable story that established or popularized many of the fanfiction tropes that make it seem tired today--battle weary Harry, magical cores, the time-travel fix-fic, etc. It hasn't aged well, partly because Matthew hasn't had much time for writing. (He wrote NoFP and his Naruto story during a longish stint of unemployment.)

- 2. What's up with the Draco love? He was douche with no redeming qualities in the books.

Much of the Draco love comes from people finding his film character physically attractive. This is also the origin of a lot of the Snape love (though he's one of the more interesting characters in canon, which also contributes).

- 3. Why do people hate on Ginny? In my opinion she is the perfect girl for Harry.

Much of the Ginny hate had a crescendo after the disappointing sixth book, where, after a long wait, we suddenly we got "monster in the chest" instead of a realistic romance. And then we got the epilogue in book 7, which also turned people off. Compounding this is that much of fanfiction at the time went way overboard with the "Ginny Sue" character archtype, i.e., Ginny as "Mary Sue" so utterly perfect and beautiful and talented. (SSHENRY's stories come to mind as among the most egregious.) This turned a lot of people off the pairing and for a long time, Ginny-hate was strong on sites like DarkLordPotter and Portkey.

- 4. Who is Daphne Greengrass? I found alot of Harry/Daphne fics, was there ever even any interaction with her in the novels?

Essentially none. She and Tracy Davis are "generic Slytherin female" types with whom Harry and company had little interaction. Jeconais established her "ice queen" stereotype and the trope took off. Incidentally, before Daphne was a thing, the "generic Slytherin" role was played most by Blaise Zabini, before it was established in canon that Blaise was male.

- 5. Why do people bash? Sure I understand disliking a character, but taking a characters flaws and magnifying them just takes away from the story.

Lazy writing, for the most part. Painting the Weasleys as gold-digging scum enabled by an evil, manipulative Dumbledore was a fad for awhile and it still has an audience from what I can tell.

As for quality Harry/Ginny pieces, I'd recommend Jeconais's This Means War (found on fanficauthors.net), anything by Deadwoodpecker (particularly [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose]]), Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]] (listed as Harry and Hermione, but they aren't romantically paired), [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991][Joe6991]]'s Hero trilogy, sib-ff's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1709027/1/The-Awakening-Power][The Awakening Power]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/457505/Melindaleo][Melindaleo]]'s collected work, and that of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]].
