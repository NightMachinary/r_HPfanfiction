As someone who reads a fair amount of fics featuring Draco, it's far more interesting to start with canon Draco as a base to build from. Gerenoir was totally right in calling him a cardboard cutout. Even so, there were moments in canon that definitely showed him as more than an irredeemable Death Eater in training. He refused to identify Harry when they were caught. He was unable to go through with killing Dumbledore.

He was also just a kid throughout most of the books, a kid raised by Lucius Malfoy. I like post-Hogwarts and AU fics, so it leaves a lot of room for character development.
