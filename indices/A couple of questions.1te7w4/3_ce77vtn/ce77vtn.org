Draco's character has a very interesting premise. Raised by a ruthless politician to exacting standards, well-connected, capable of providing an alternate perspective on the wizarding war and a representative of pureblood culture.

It's a pity that Canon!Draco was such a cardboard cut-out in the books. You could probably have swapped his name out for Cormac McLaggen or Zacharias Smith or literally any other obnoxious character in the books and it would have made no difference as long as they could sneer and mock Ron for being poor. Canon!Draco was a mockery of a character who was utterly devoid of personality and existed only to make Harry miserable, which is such a complete /waste/. I do agree that he gets whitewashed far too often, but to leave him as he was portrayed in the books is way too unsatisfying.
