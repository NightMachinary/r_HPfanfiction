I never read it myself, but I believe it looks to be a case of [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny]["Seinfeld is unfunny"]].

It's impossible to understand why a work from 2005 (before all the books even came out) was considered groundbreaking at the time. What you need to realize is that all the things that are boring/tame/predictable/cliche/... NOW, weren't back in the day. Back then they were actually new and original.

Just like how Lord of the Rings wasn't a cookie-cutter fantasy when it came out. Tolkien actually invented the idea of bow-wielding elves and dwarves with big beards and axes, but nowadays the very idea seems boring and cliche.

To answer your other questions:

  What's up with the Draco love? He was douche with no redeeming qualities in the books.

I honestly don't know why people try to redeem that scumbag. I don't get Snape either for that matter.

  Why do people hate on Ginny? In my opinion she is the perfect girl for Harry.
#+end_quote

This has two reasons:

A) Ginny was introduced to us as a fangirl who liked "the-boy-who-lived" and is therefore not suitable to be with "the real Harry".

B) Because Hermione exists, and her marriage with Ron instead of Harry is an even bigger mystery. Most fics that hate on Ginny only do so when Hermione ends up with Harry.

  Who is Daphne Greengrass?
#+end_quote

She is a Slytherin girl from Harry's year.

Since she appears in the books, she is canon and thus free to use.

Since she has no lines of herself, she is a blank slate to fill in however the writer wants to.

Unlike other characters like Millicent Bullstrode, she was never explicitly described as bigoted or ugly. thus you are free to turn her into "Hogwarts' most beautiful girl" and many fics do just that.

Thus she is the perfect OC-stand in: She can fill in any role at all your story needs without really introducing non-canon characters to Hogwarts

  Why do people bash? Sure I understand disliking a character, but taking a characters flaws and magnifying them just takes away from the story.
#+end_quote

Because fanfiction, by definition, is written by fans and not by professional writers. Many fans write with their feelings and not with their brain. If they don't like a character they feel the need to bash him/her, even if it makes no sense at all for the plot.
