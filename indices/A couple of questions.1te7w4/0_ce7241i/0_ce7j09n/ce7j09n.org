    What's up with the Draco love? He was douche with no redeeming qualities in the books.

  I honestly don't know why people try to redeem that scumbag. I don't get Snape either for that matter.

Both characters got /rediculously/ attractive actors in the movies. This also partly answers why people love Hermione/anyone. The actors Tom Felton, Alan Rickman, and Emma Watson were (or turned into) simply beautiful people who oozed charisma on the screen.

Don't get me wrong, Daniel Radcliffe is now widely considered to be a hunk, but it doesn't really come together unless he takes his shirt (or more...) off. But he can't hold a candle to the presence of those other three in the movies.

Most human beings want beautiful people to be good because they are beautiful. And because they are beautiful, they have to be secretly good. Even if they are very, very bad people (Draco and Snape).

A lesser form is also that, though Hermione was annoying in a way most immature little boys consider like nails on a chalkboard for pretty much of the time in the books (though she was usually right from a mature viewpoint), lots of people still ship her with Harry *strongly*, usually for no good reason. Nag, nag, homework is fun, not everyone you dislike is evil, lol sports, universal rights, nag. Maybe not the most attractive attributes for a young woman, especially for two of the school's dumb jocks (which Harry and Ron /clearly/ were).

But the actress Emma Watson grew into a near-supermodel by the last two movies. So obviously the character Hermione isn't really /that/ annoying after all, and the hero should get the "best" girl in the story, thus Harry/Hermione. So while Bonnie Wright turned out cute enough, she's no Emma Watson, that's for sure. And she's /also/ a jock, while Hermione is a nerd. Guess who nerds ship with Harry?

Beauty is goodness, hero gets the "good" geeky girl, movie feels trump book realities. At least, that's one way to look at it. Does that make sense?
