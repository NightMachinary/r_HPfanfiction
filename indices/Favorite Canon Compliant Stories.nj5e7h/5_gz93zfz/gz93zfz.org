linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4495536/1/Chapter-37]]) is a nice addition to Deathly Hallows. But the one that really changed his I viewed canon is linkffn(The Snape Chronicles). Very long, not very happy, but insightful.

Edit: Bot picked up the wrong one, I've added a link now. The one it linked is good, though!
