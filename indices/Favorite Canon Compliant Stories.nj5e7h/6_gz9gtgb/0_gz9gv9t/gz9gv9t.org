  "If you wanna be a hero that badly, there's a quick way to do it. Believe that you'll be born with a quirk in your next life and take a swan dive off the roof!”When Katsuki's comment comes at just the wrong time, Izuku takes his advice. But it is not the end. Alternatively:In another world where Izuku is attacked by the sludge villain on the way to school instead of after it, his dreams get crushed too soon. With nothing to save him and Katsuki's words ringing in his ears, Izuku decides to end it all by jumping off his school's roof. As his body cracks on the ground, Izuku does not pass on to the next world. Instead, he is left as a ghost among many others. When the slime villain escapes from jail and attacks the person Izuku can't help but care for, he learns that there may be more to his afterlife than he thought.And maybe he can be a hero after all.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1171672][*/Professor C. Binns: A Personal History/*]] by [[https://www.archiveofourown.org/users/PurpleFluffyCat/pseuds/PurpleFluffyCat][/PurpleFluffyCat/]]

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  Remus lets out the breath he's holding. He's been holding his breath for a very long time, twelve years maybe. Something is aligning itself with horrible, brutal clarity in his mind.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.
