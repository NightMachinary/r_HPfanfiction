I think it depends on the nature of the criticism. If it's just "please make this Harry/Hermione instead of Harry/Ginny" - the expression of a purely subjective preference - then yeah I think that's a pretty stupid review.

However, I don't think "I did that deliberately" is a universal defence from all literary criticism. Indeed, I think the most meaningful and substantive literary criticism does not relate to the /execution/ of an idea, but rather concerns the author's choices as to content. An author's /vision/ for their story is the most fertile ground for critical discussion.

Let's use the example of A Cadmean Victory - a convenient example, because the author would occasionally respond to reviews and would frequently miss this point. Whenever someone criticised the content decisions he made, his response was always to point to some part of his story where that story element was "explained".

That response fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the criticism.

The criticism was: "why would the author /choose/ to make that part of the story in the first place?". The criticism was not: "that doesn't make sense within the story world".

With respect to the latter, /any/ author can justify something within their world, because they have complete ability to arbitrarily determine characters' beliefs, knowledge, personalities, plus how magic works, etc. An in-universe explanation can /always/ be conjured up. But that doesn't make it good writing, because good writing is about a lot more than having in-universe explanations for things.

For example, right at the beginning of the story, Harry immediately gets a significant upgrade from his canon intelligence, bookishness, and magical skill. Yes, of course you can justify it in-universe by saying he was like that all along and this is an AU (as the author did). But that doesn't explain the out-of-universe question: "why you would /choose/ to /declare/ your character as more skilled than canon rather than show them /developing/ into someone who has more skill?".

Developing a character's traits in the story is simply better writing than declaring them to the reader ex cathedra. That way, the reader sees where those character traits have come from and thereby understands the character on a deeper level. Where those traits are going to resolve conflict, such as ability with magic, then showing their development also helps them feel earned and thus the resolution of the conflict more satisfying.

"I intended my characterisation to be shallow" is not a defence to having shallow characters.

One more example: let's examine the author's decision to make Hermione much less intelligent, reasonable, loyal and kind than in canon, completely reneging on her friendship with Harry because he is doing better than her in classes.

Sure, you can justify that in-universe with sufficient events and AU changes to her character. But again the question is: why would you want to? Why would you want to turn a reasonable, relatively 3D character into an antagonism machine that doesn't act like a human?

Again, having characters who act like real people is simply superior writing to having characters who act as plot devices. "I intended for her to be an antagonist" is not a defence to the fact that your character acts in ways the reader does not find believable.
