Well there is a big difference between

1. I have been enjoying your story and I really hope it will include the xyz story line/trope.

2. I like your story but was surprised to see you using/not using the xyz story line/trope. Now besides the obvious that you wanted to explore using/not using that story line are you willing to provide more information for why you chose that path?

And

1. Hey i see you have a simple pairing but you really need to make this a Harem story and you need to make them all animagi and have them fool around in their animal forms. And you need to make your main character be super powered where he can do anything with just a look.

The first comment is just a basic request from the reader as to what he would like to see in the story. The second comment is actually a request for a discussion (if the author is willing) to understand why the author decided to write a particular story line.

The 3rd comment is really just a reader saying I don't like your story and you need to change it to make me happy.

Now the first two comments shouldn't be a problem for most authors (well unless in the discussion the commenter rips the choices the author makes). The last comment should be ignored (unless the commenter is somehow paying for the story which really isn't what fanfiction is about).

The problem is that too often the third type of commenter is the most vocal and can often be the reason why an author stops writing. I think a fact gets overlooked that most authors are writing for their own enjoyment and hoping that others also like their story. Being "harped" on is the quickest way for an author's "muse" to take a vacation.

It's the silent majority who reads and enjoys the stories that suffer (almost as much as the authors) when a talented budding writer gets chased away by the trolls and stops writing.

The authors should know we appreciate their efforts even if we don't always like/agree with the story line.
