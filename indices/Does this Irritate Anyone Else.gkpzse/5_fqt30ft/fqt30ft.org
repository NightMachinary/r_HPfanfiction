Oh heck yeah! If someone wants a specific story, they need to write it themselves. Nobody has the right to demand that an author write-to-order unless they are paying them to do so.

I was in the Buffy fanfic back in the days of yore, and there was one guy who became infamous for demanding that authors either write stories, or change stories that were in progress, so they to matched his kinks. There was even a LiveJournal created so people could share tales of his outrageous demands.
