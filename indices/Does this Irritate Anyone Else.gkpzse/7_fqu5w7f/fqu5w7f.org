I recently got my own version of this, I was less annoyed because it felt like a right of passage - I expect the novalty will wear off very quickly. I've seen some war zone comment section on other fics I've read, and I hope I don't ever experience that.

It think boils down to the reader and their ability to critique. Often times, the bad critique is an inability of the reader to express themselves.

For example, "you should have done this instead" really means "I disagree with the actions of character X, because it doesn't align with their motivations and personality."

There are exceptions, some people have your story already written in their mind, and their get annoyed when you veer away from that. In that case, they should open up Microsoft Word and get cracking, because they'll never be happy.
