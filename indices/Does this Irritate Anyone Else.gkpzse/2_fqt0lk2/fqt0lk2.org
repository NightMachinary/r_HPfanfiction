There's something to be said of asking an author why they pick up or abandon story elements. I read a Harriet potter story by kerjack for a while until about third year where a werewolf character is introduced who is some "Lycan" strong man alpha old cultured individual.

When I asked what the deal with lupin would be if lycanthropy is literally not a problem at all, he said he didn't like how lycanthropy was a metaphor for aids and therefore wasn't going to include it.

And I expressed incredulity that lupins entire story arc was omitted because he wanted cool werewolf old guy as a barely present throway character while Remus was just not mentioned.

Was I not supposed to even ask in your view?

Because an author's internal logic for choices can be just as revealing as the choices themselves. Like how that answer showed I really didn't need to read the rest of that story.
