There's a difference between asking and telling. I'm more talking about the reviews that demand an author change an aspect of the story for their own viewing pleasure that the author wrote with intentionality. I have no issue with questions, especially because they can reflect issues with a story without sounding demanding. And I totally agree. If an author doesn't answer to your satisfaction and the story doesn't get better, drop the story.
