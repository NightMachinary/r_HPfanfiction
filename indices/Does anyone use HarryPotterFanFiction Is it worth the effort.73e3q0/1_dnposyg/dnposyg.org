HPFF isn't technically dead, but it is practically dead. It was the first site I ever read fanfiction on, but it became clear pretty quickly how much better FFN is. They kind of killed themselves, since they never really tried to stay "up to date" (whatever that means with something like this. Their filter system was atrocious, as there were only a handful of options, and anything that was deemed too implausible or too far away from canon was not something you can search by... and that's half the reason the site got into the distressed shape it did. Not to mention I think the actual creator of the site went AWOL, so very little could be done to actually correct these things? (I might be miss-remembering this). Lastly, pretty much any story that is actually worth a damn was crossposted to FFN, so there was no real reason to actually use HPFF unless you really liked custom story banners.
