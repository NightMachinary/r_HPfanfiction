I posted nearly half a million words worth of stories there before a big kerfuffle with the site owner a year or two ago. The rules are very heavy-handed. My understanding - for what it's worth - is that the site had a lot of younger members back in the day, so the content rules were heavily skewed towards pre-teen and teen readers. As far as the rules on copyright, the site owner took the approach of "it isn't worth it to me to deal with any copyright issues, ever" and the rules reflect that.

A sizeable chunk of what used to be the HPFF community is at HPFanFicTalk.com now. A lot of time was devoted to modernizing the rules, although I don't know all the particulars on copyright.
