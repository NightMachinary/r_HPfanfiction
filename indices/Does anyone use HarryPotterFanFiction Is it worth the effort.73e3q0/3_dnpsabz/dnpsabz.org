I used it for a while, but I thought the rules were arbitrary and badly thought through. I did like the fact that there was a vetting process which helped to weed out the worst of the worst. I liked that you could use a banner on your story cover page - though a lot of them started to look the same. There was a really good, active forum with loads of challenges but when that was taken down after a big row, I stopped bothering with it and later removed my stories from the site. Some of the disgruntled members started a new site but it's not very attractive or user friendly and I don't know how successful it is.
