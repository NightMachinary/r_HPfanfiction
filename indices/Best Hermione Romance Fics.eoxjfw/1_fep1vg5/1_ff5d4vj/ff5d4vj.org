  They all thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters used politics to accomplish what Voldemort never could. And with the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, there's only one solution: to go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power, and fix what broke the first time around. Time Travel AU. Nominated for Best James Potter and Best Peter Pettigrew in the 2018 Marauder Medals!

  Hermione has harbored a crush on Fred Weasley for years. But that's all it is! A silly, little crush that's lingered from her Hogwarts' years. That's all it is...until one of her best friends, Ginny Weasley, is thrown into a life changing predicament. As she rallies with the rest of the family to help Ginny, Hermione regularly finds herself in Fred's charming company. Perhaps her crush isn't so simple after all? But does Fred feel the same? Even if he does, can he put aside past hurt and open himself up to Hermione? Will their meddling friends help, or hurt, their chances? Disclaimer- Harry Potter Publishing Rights Â© J.K.R.

  Draco meant to send her to the future, to a world ruled by Lord Voldemort. He really ought to read directions before he goes messing with other people's things. Hermione finds herself stuck in the past (The 70s!), pretending to be something she's not (Average!) and fighting with everything she has to keep from changing the future.
