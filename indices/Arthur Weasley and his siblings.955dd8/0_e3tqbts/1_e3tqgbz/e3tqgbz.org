  What if Septimus had been motivated to save the name and status of the Weasley family on the first of September 1932?   "Alright, then. Sort me in whatever House you think is best." The Sorting Hat didn't need long to think. "SLYTHERIN!" The Great Hall was stunned into silence, only a clinking of coins being heard as Alrod handed Peter his money. The Weasleys were a Gryffindor house, everyone knew that. They'd been Gryffindor since even before Gryffindor existed. Anyone who was interested in wizarding history, anyone who put importance in purity and blood-lines, any Slytherin knew that. And yet Septimus Weasley had been sorted in Slytherin, Gryffindor's perpetual arch-nemesis.
