There are two types:

- the meeting happens during the book timeframe (excluding The Epilog), e.g. linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs), chapters 6 and following

- the meeting is in the post-War period, basically “meet my parents/parent-like-relatives”, e.g. linkao3(Friends and Foes by Northumbrian) (where I believe the first four chapters describing this meeting should be split into a separate story, unless that story arc will be drastically important in the latter parts of still unfinished, and probably never finished, story), or linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent by Petrificus Somewhatus) (yes, it is Haphne, not Hinny, but the difference in this scene is rather small).
