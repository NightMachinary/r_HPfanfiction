If this were a story about an eighteen year old having war flashbacks and generally recovering from the life he had lead up till that point while suddenly dealing with those children (of all kinds of ages, with their own thoughts and feelings) I really would like to read it.

When it is yet another one of those "Harry Potter suddenly acquires 3 cute well behaved issue-free babies and look at him being a super daddy feeding and burping them and can you see how I know everything about babies, YOUKNOWIWILLBEAGREATMOMINTENYEARSWHENIAMTWENTYFIVE" fics I'd probably regret wasting my time on them.
