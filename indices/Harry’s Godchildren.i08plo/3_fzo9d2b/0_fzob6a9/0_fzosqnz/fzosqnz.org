"I don't understand, Kingsley, how could I have been named Godfather without even knowing?" Harry ran a hand through his hair in aggravation. The week since the battle had been hard enough. He'd barely confronted the fact that he was Teddy's godfather, but this...

"I'm sorry Harry, the document has your signature on it." Sure enough, on Kingsley's desk was a contract that had what was ostensibly Harry's signature. Of course, it looked nothing like his signature.

"But I didn't sign it!"

"Yeah... the parchment seems to have a confundus charm on it. Legally, this contract is illegitimate, but magically its still binding. If you don't take the kid in, you'll lose your magic."

The only acknowledgment Harry gave to Kingsley was a hollow thousand yard stare, as the implications settled in. Anyone could bind him to any agreement they wanted, it was a /nightmare/.

"Harry?"

"I'm fucked."
