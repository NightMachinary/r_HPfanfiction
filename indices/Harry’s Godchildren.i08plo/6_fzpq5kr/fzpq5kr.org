I don't particularly enjoy the whole false magical contract thing, for me lots of parents left in their will that harry be the one to take care of their children after the war. Harry manages to send the majority of the kids to some other relatives (still constantly checking on them, reminiscent of his own childhood) but there are some poor kids that have nowhere to go and faced with the prospect of sending them to an orphanage, Harry decided to take them in.
