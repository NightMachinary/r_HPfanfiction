Legit anything by Tsume_Yuki on ao3 is fabulous. She does lots of marvel and asoiaf crossovers. Her fics aren't very long, but theyre very introspective and well written. She usually does trope stories like time travel or soulmate marks, but she does some of the best characterization work I've seen in fanfics. She also usually does femHarry. My favorite completed one is probably linkao3(Crest by Tsume_Yuki) which is hp/asoiaf and I'm loving her hp/black panther crossover series which starts with linkao3(like the rain chooses the grass by Tsume_Yuki) Honestly shes one of my favorites all around
