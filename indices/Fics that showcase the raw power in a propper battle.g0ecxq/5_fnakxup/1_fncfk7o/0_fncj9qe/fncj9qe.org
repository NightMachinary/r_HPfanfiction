Half the time i see numbers or dates in a fic I just believe that the authors are just honoring canon especially since JKR herself has stated how horrible she is with numbers. And her calendars rarely correspond with the real world (would be really curious to know whether any editor ever caught it and mentioned it to her or why they left those discrepancies in)

One way to reconcile the delta (even though there is nothing explicitly in the fic to support it) is to assume that the steady rate held until he was 15-20% away from being filled. Then the rate slowed down. Otherwise he should have been at 960+ versus the 736 the author stopped him at. All we know was the one comparison prior to the goblet that said harry was near 180 possibly low 200's where harry states that would mean his core 41 reading should have been 1/5 (20%) of his core and the amount he could see his core was filled was nowhere near 1/5 full.

In that case we could assume his 41 was 1/20 (5%) of his core which would at least get us in the ballpark.

(Added after initial comment) Of course if I would run the numbers myself it seems the author decided that 41 was closer to 1/18 (5.5%) of Harry's core as that would be 738
