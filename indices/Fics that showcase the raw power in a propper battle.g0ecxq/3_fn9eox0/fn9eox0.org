While it doesn't have any big battles like the latter half of canon (yet,) there's a scene in the second part of [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] where a second year student with an unprecedented amount of raw magic power burns the entire acromantula colony in the forbidden forest with Bluebell Flames. You know, the fire that's /normally safe enough to hold in your hand./ Ended up being a full-on Aussie bushfire.

A lot of the fic focuses on the magically powerful students making sure they don't overpower their spells.
