I've read and enjoyed them! I also thought that Cormor√°n was adult Harry. I thought about that a lot and tried to see if I could place the other characters, but did not succeed. Robin could kind of be Ginny-they both have a sort of hero worship mixed with their own brand of badassery going on.

Did you watch the BBC interpretations of the books? Pretty spot on. They didn't skip many details and I enjoyed them quite a bit as well.
