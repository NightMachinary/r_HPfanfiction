I still haven't finished the 4th book, but I really enjoyed the first three. You can always rely on JKR to spin a great mystery, and as much as I love HP, she definitely grew as a writer since her early books. It's definitely true that she seems to be more interested in her adult books then extended HP universe such as Fantastic Beasts movies, but whatever brings her that paycheck.

It's always amusing to me how drastically different her general world outlook is in HP vs. non-HP books, the Strike series and especially Casual Vacancy, which I think is her best up to date. Where HP is full of hope, she seems to be very pessimistic and cynical about humanity in everything else. It's also funny to read opinions that JKR is only capable of writing PG-13 violence and fairytale abuse for that reason. Go read Career of Evil and then we'll talk.

I don't think, however, that Harry has much in common with Cormoran. If anything, he's more similar to Robin.
