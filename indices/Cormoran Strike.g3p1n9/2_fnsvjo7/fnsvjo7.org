I've read all of them and I definitely enjoy them. I don't know that I'd agree that Cormoran is a Harry analogue as he's way more of a hot mess than Harry ever was, but they do both have that drive to do what's right.

I haven't seen the TV show based on the series yet, but I'm for sure looking forward to the next book.
