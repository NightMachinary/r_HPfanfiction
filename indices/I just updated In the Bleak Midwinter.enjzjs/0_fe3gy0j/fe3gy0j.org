I love your story! I binged it in one day and it has some really well fleshed our characters. The Riddles aren't good people per se, but you grow to really like them. Tom is just so wonderful. He's so selfish and vain, but you can see he does have a heart somewhere- and he's so much a man of his time, so his dynamic with modern day progressive Hermione is funny.
