Posh places within Surrey associated with wealthier people include Reigate, Dorking, Chiddingfold, Mickleham, Westhumble, Oxted, etc.

However, your problem here is that the Dursleys are unlikely to like those places. They are full of liberal metropolitan elite types - Guardian-reading champagne socialists and Times-reading traditional liberals. In short, the type of people who would look down on the Daily Mail-reading Dursleys, and who in turn the Dursleys would look upon as namby-pamby, this-country-is-going-to-the-dogs, out-of-touch elites.

The Dursleys are "somewheres", not "anywheres", and therefore even if they become richer I doubt they would look to move to a place which is out of keeping with their values. I'd therefore recommend places that are not quite as "bucolic middle class" as the above list, but still considered above average in terms of wealth. Somewhere like Ashford (Surrey, not Kent) or Guildford.

As for trains, I suggest you just go to nationalrail.co.uk and check the routes from London to (say) St Andrews.
