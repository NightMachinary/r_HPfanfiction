Thanks mate!

The Dursleys moving was supposed to be a simplified version of this weird plot idea I have going on in my head, and not exactly what is actually happening. I don't quite get your “somewhere” vs “anywhere” distinction, if you don't mind could you elaborate a little on that?

Other than that the website will hopefully be useful. For some reason I honestly hadn't considered that the train lines would be mostly the same today as they were back then.

Cheers. :)
