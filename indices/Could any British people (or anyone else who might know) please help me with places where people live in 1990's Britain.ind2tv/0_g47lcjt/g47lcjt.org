Depends how rich, but you'd be good with most major cities; a lot will have areas within them that are considered lower/midlde/upper class, though personally I can't see the Dursleys moving very far north. We've a bit of a rivalry between southerners and northerners over here; Petunia hails from the Midlands but she and Vernon have got a certain snobbery that comes from the south, especially the south-east. If they're going to leave Surrey, I'd place them in Kent, Hampshire, or Sussex.

If you do want to go further, Oxford and Cambridge have a certain prestige, but I'd go for Oxford over Cambridge when it comes to poshness. East Anglia has a bit of a rep for being hick country; I certainly wouldn't put them in Norfolk, Suffolk, or Essex (not strictly part of EA, but does have a certain reputation; in the 80s and 90s especially the term 'Essex girl' was used for promiscuous, rowdy women). London is usually a safe option, but you'd have to look up the various areas; I'm not familiar with them myself.

For stops between London and Hogsmeade, look up routes for normal trains; most of the major stops these days will be the same as they were in the 90s. From King's Cross, you're looking at Cambridge -- Peterborough -- Sheffield -- Leeds and onwards (that's just a rough estimate though, I'm not very familiar with train routes).

As for resources, [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/places/]] is great.
