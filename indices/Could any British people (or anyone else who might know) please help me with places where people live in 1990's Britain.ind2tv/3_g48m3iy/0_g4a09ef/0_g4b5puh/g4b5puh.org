One thing I've noticed while looking trains up for my own writing is that the Hogwarts Express has to be roughly as fast as a modern express train. London Inverness (somewhererremote in Scotland would probably take longer) is 8 hours 39 minutes, which would mean an arrival at 19:39 if you depart at 11. Add an hour to get everyone to the castle and two hours for the sorting + feast and it's nearly 11 pm. And that's before unpacking and while potentially having classes at 9 (so wake up at 7) the next day.
