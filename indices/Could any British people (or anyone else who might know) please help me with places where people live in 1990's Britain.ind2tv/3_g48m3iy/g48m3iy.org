Regarding trains, if you want to go with established train routes, you can choose between East Coast and West Coast Main Line. The WCML covers more population I think (Birmingham, the Liverpool-Manchester area, better connections from Wales) and ends in Glasgow, the ECML is via York and Newcastle to Edinburgh and is the faster route. The WCML does not operate out of King's Cross though, but out of London Euston.

Train stations didn't change much between 1990 and now, at least on the major lines. Truth be told, you could use a map from the 1900s and, unless you go with very small stations and branch lines (which were closed in the 60s-80s), not much would have changed. If you want a realistic time table for a steam train, you can simply use time tables from the 1950s. LNER in particular for King's Cross - Scotland.
