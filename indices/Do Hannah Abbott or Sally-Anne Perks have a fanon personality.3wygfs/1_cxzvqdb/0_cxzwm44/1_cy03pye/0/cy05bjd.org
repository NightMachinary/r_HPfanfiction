I agree that 'battle god' is not an appropriate title for Neville. Frankly, none of the good guys deserve it. They took part in a few dozen small scale fights and got lucky a lot. The one closest to deserving the title, the battle scarred Mad Eye, bites it during a poorly thought out mission. They've got a ways to go to match the like of Pericles or Chesty Puller.
