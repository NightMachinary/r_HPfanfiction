Owing to the fact that Hannah takes over the Leaky Cauldron, is a Hufflepuff with rosy cheeks and somehow caught the attention of the living god Longbottom, we can assume she is an outgoing, happy and attractive witch of no small merit. Fanon extends this to include her as Susan's twin in the realm of unsubstantiated but bombastic boobs.

Fanon of Sally-Anne Perks is that she was in Hermione's dorm until she was forgotten. I've seen at least one version that had her as a devoutly religious muggleborn whose parents pulled her from Hogwarts somewhere between Hermione's encounter with the Troll and the return of Voldemort at the end of book four.
