'Bashing' usually means taking the worst parts of a character, magnifying them, and then adding several other bad qualities without any of the (canon) good ones. It's a trait you generally don't find in good stories, not just because bashing makes stories worse, but because usually only bad stories add bashing. So, in short, there probably aren't any good /anyone/-bashing stories.
