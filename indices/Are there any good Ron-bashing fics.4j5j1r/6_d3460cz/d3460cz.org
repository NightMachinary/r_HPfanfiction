I generally dislike bash fics, but there are always exceptions.

For example *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), is heavy on Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing, but it's one of my top ten.

I also like *Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), a fic that bashes almost everyone [[/spoiler][only Sirius, Snape, and Grindelwald were portrayed positively beside the protagonists]]
