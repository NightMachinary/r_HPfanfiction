If you're good with slash then I definitely recommend linkffn(Rebirth) don't judge until you read some, it's about Harry being Voldemort's lover reincarnated through necromancy and it is unbelievably sad however it is very good and one of the best for the pairing

Otherwise I just read linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) and it was a fantastic Harry centric fic
