  The story was rec'd in a Request post a couple days ago, which may have been where we both started reading it. :)

I rec'd it in a thread looking for time travel stories, so I wonder if it was my post? :D

I love this story too, by the way. Such an interesting approach to the source of magic and muggles studying it.

  I believe everything else has been filled in by the author.

I thought so too. Until the latest chapter(s), it reads like Harry was in original settings rather than Avatar world. But I'm glad the author took his/her time to deal with issues Harry faced on Earth.
