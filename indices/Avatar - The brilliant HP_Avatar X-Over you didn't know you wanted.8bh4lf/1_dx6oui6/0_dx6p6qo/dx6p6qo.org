The story was rec'd in a Request post a couple days ago, which may have been where we both started reading it. :)

I re-watched the movie after reading this fic. AFAIK, the only canonical things about Earth are that it's polluted to shit and companies have way more power than they should, and RDA is the company that people are working for on Pandora.

I believe everything else has been filled in by the author.
