I started reading this last night, what an odd coincidence. I'm really enjoying it so far, it's really well done and I can't wait to see how it develops, I just really hope it isn't a year before it updates again. It's hooked me.

I have no idea if this would match Avatar's version of Earth or if it's entirely made up by the author but either way I feel like it fits with what I know from the movie, plus the worldbuilding is so well done I'm not sure it matters.
