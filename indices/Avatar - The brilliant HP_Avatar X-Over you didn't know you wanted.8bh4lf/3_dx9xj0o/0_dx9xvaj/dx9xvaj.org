I wouldn't personally consider it slash. Harry doesn't particularly have any relationships throughout the story (it's classified as Gen). However, the story does show that he seems to be exclusively attracted to females.

There's a drug-induced kind of plot point which involves him being manipulated into sleeping with a man but it isn't explicit and isn't a terribly large portion of the story. He doesn't know he was manipulated, so there isn't particularly any angst about it, either.
