Yes. I like seeing reviews. Sure, most of them are utterly pointless, but it's still the gratification that someone is actually reading my stuff and willing to take the time to comment on it.

As with UndeadBBQ, there are very few I value from a critical standpoint, but the few that I get that are a couple paragraphs discussing the stories are one of the main things that motivates me to write more.
