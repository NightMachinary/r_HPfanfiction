On ff.net, no. They annoy me and make me not want to continue a story. On ao3, yes, so far.

On ff.net, they're called reviews. They should, well, review the story. Reviews on amazon or whatever are written for other potential readers and should give people a better idea of whether they want to spend their resources (time, in this case) on the story. Instead, they're primarily there for people to react to chapters for the author's benefit. I've seen plenty of spoilers in the review section, and I've seen people writing one-line comments to every chapter for fifteen chapters in a row. It's terrible and I would turn it off if possible.

On ao3, they're called comments. They're for discussing the story, presumably with people who have read it and with the author.
