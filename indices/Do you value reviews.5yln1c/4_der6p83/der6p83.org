I like reviews (either good or bad) that indicate the reader has actually READ the story, and the review is engaging in that. Those are the ones that I live for (and generally a decent portion of each chapter I release gets this kind of feedback). I also have no problem with answering reviews to my story that have questions, and highly enjoy engaging with readers this way.

The ones that drive me nuts, and I've been learning to ignore are those which are trying to hijack the story. The ones that want to see their specific plot take form, and kvetch over the fact that I'm not doing that. It's one thing if it's a viable criticism - it's another if you're insulting because your own personal plot line is not taking place. Write your own story at that point.
