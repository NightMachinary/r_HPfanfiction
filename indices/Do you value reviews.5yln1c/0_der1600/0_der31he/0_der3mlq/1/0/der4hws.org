I don't think you understand me.

A review isn't like, I don't know, a dumpling more in your soup or something. A review is a feedback to your story and it exists not in an isolated vacuum, but in the context of the site.

For example, I would put more value into a positive review on the DLP forums than on reviews on FFN, simply because the first one is harder to obtain by readers with a much higher and stricter expectation for quality.
