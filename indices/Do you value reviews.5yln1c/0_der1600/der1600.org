Value, as in, appreciate that someone read my story and left a comment behind - yes.

But I don't attribute much worth to the content of the reviews. As nice as reading them sometimes is, I feel their value greatly decreases when I see the same positive comments on some Lord Potter bash-fic-fest.

There are only a few I do read and take to heart, but those are mostly the ones over a few paragraphs that try to give feedback.
