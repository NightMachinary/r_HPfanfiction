Not an author, but...

On the whole, no. I'm interested in the number of reviews in general because it's an indicator that the story generated enough interest in the readers that they commented.

However, I'm not generally interested in the content of the comments themselves. Unless the user name is recognized, it doesn't matter. I don't know who the reviewer is. I don't know their taste and won't use it to make any decision about the story.

/Edit:/ If there's a chapter that I HATE and I stop reading the story, I'll read that chapter's reviews to see if it's just me.
