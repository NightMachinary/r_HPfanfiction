I'm currently escaping some review/reaction drama on another forum, so this question seems particularly apropos at the moment.

I definitely do appreciate reviews... to varying degrees. And I don't mean "I love positive reviews and hate critical reviews", although that'll be the first thing people will accuse you of if you complain.

People forget that reviews have good and bad quality, just like the stories. A review like "Lol, love this" is nice, sure. But one where the person says, "The motivations and reactions are very believable" is worth ten times that, because you know they thought about it.

Similarly with critical reviews. Someone posting "This sucks, I'm not reading any more" is actually quite hurtful, because not only are they outright saying they hate the story, they're doing it in a way that implies that they can't even be arsed to say why. It can be very demoralizing, and it can take a lot of the "minor positive" reviews to make up for these.

The guy who reviews with: "This doesn't work... <x> comes off ambiguous, and maybe you should think about <y>" is your best friend. She/He may not like your story, but they're not throwing /you/ out into the trash with it. It means a lot because even though they may not have gotten much out of it themselves, they still took the time to think and try to help you improve.

(Although you have to be careful to pick out the annoying people who are trying to get you to write the plotline that exists only in /their/ head for them. You know the type: "Well, obviously Harry would do /this/, and I don't know why you had Ron do that, when he should have...")
