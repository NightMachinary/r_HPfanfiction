I like any review. It means someone read what I wrote and was motivated to comment.

The only exception to the would be the sometimes-seen "this is shit" comment. I don't see any point in that. Say why it's shit, suggest improvements. If the entirety of your point is that you've read better stuff, then go and read it and don't denigrate an author trying to learn.

The other thing that annoys me is reviewers who clearly haven't read what you've written. One story I posted to FF net stated from the get-go that it was a copy of an abandoned story that I had zero interest continuing. First reviewer was looking forward to seeing where I took the story.

So really it's like anything else. Comment, but don't be a moron.
