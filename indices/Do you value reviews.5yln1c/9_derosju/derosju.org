I enjoy getting reviews, it tells me people are reading my story and care enough to leave feedback.

The only ones I value are ones that actually do review. That is, they give thoughtful critisms and praise about the story. Something along the lines of "character X is behaving in a very odd manner and seems OOC, is there a reason for this or are you just being goofy" or "I really like the detailed description of X it made me feel Y." Those are helpful "kill yourself you sick scum" or "update soon plz" are ok to receive but they don't help me at all.
