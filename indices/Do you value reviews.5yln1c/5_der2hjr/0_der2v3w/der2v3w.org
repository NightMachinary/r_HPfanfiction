I like that attitude. While I understand that authors of fanfiction don't get paid to do it, so no one should expect high-quality writing with lots of world-building and Character Development (although we didn't get it from the lady that did get paid to make the books too....), but the authors that only post fics to be 'yerked off' in a manner of speaking, are the worst. Whenever you leave a review that moderately critiques their idea of an "Ultimate Magical Core Prodigy Lesbian Hermione who fights for the rights of everything, including conjured animals (THEY HAVE RIGHTS TOO), and stops being Lesbian as soon as she sees Draco Malfoy" they will flame you, then proceed to block you while calling you many rude names that shouldn't be repeated.
