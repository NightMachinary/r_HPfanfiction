Never said it wasn't. But that's not the point of writing and posting it on the web, you do it to get better, to learn, to constantly evolve. If you release a shit-tier fic, like the one you just described, and expect everyone to praise you because you wrote a bad story, put menial effort into it, and just continued writing, you will never grow as a writer.
