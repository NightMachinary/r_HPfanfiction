Glad you like it.

Mmmm... I've gotten plenty of comments like this one and I'm never sure how to reply to them. I'm never sure what the reviewer is looking for --- assurances I will finish? A decision to change the story into something less complex? The former is pretty meaningless since if my word was enough they wouldn't be worried in the first place, and I have no intention of doing the later. All I can do is keep plugging away. One chapter at a time.
