If we're talking about value as in how seriously do we take critical reviews rather than the fuzzy feel-goodness of readers caring enough to write them... that depends. I often use reviews as a kind of general barometer. Individual critical reviews don't really carry much weight (unless they're by people who have a history of really great reviews, or are clearly and obviously extremely well thought out) but when dozens of people all say similar things, it's a sign I need to look more carefully.

One thing I've noticed is that critical reviews are extremely good at spotting when something is wrong, but are often rather bad at identifying what that something is, and even worse at suggesting appropriate corrective measures. That's fine. Improving the writing is my job after all, not theirs.

I love all my single line 'Omg I <3 this,' reviews :) I know it's not cool to, but I do.

Also, is it just my monkey pattern finding brain, or do REALLY critical reviews tend to be among the first ones that come in? I swear my emotions play a yoyo when I publish a new chapter, until the mass settles on a general consensus.
