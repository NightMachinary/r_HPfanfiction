  “It's not for long,” Hermione said. “By the time we get back to Hogwarts, the Unfettering Brew will be ready.”“Listen to you!” Ron said. “He's got to get through a month with the Dursleys and a month at Malfoy Manor. With Draco Malfoy.”“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said, because he hadn't just spent the last week contemplating just how much more horrible his summer holidays were about to be than they'd ever been before.

  Draco snorted. “I'm not reduced to penury. I want something considerably beyond money, and I rather think you're the only one can give it to me.” “You want the Invisibility Cloak,” Harry said, flatly. He'd half expected as much; it was the only thing he had that Draco could want---“Don't be stupid, Potter,” Draco said. “I want my reputation back.”

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
