White Squirrel tends to have a habit of taking Harry Potter fanfiction cliches and writing them as competently and fascinatingly as possible; this one has 'Grangers adopt Harry', 'Harry is a natural animagus', 'Harry learns wandless magic', 'Harry does politics', etc, and aside from some slight awkwardness in the beginning, does it REALLY, REALLY well.

On Harry's side, aside from Dumbledore there's Edward Grayson playing a major role, while on Voldemort's side, an Aztec priestess called La Pantera is helping him (and is dangerous enough to warrant ICW intervention).

They only really start to come in in the later parts of the fic, though, and in its sequel, Animagus At War. You'll also want to see The World of The Accidental Animagus, which does a bit of worldbuilding you might like.
