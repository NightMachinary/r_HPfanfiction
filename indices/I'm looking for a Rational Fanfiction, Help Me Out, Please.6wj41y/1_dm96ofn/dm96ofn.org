Not with Draco, no. Many fics give him a general competence and proactiveness upgrade, but they tend to be Dramione focused on the romance and little else. Perhaps linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) might count.

linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew) is what HPMOR /should have been/, in my opinion, but that one features Hermione as the protagonist. (Theo Nott and Tracy Davis may be considered intelligent villains in that one; Draco isn't really on the radar.)
