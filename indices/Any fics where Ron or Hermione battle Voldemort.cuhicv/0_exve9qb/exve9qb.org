Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has this massive battle in Diagon Alley with Voldemort, his Death Eaters and a bunch of kidnapped muggle children hostages on one side, and Sirius with the Order, the Twins, Ron with his gadgets from Dumbledore, Harry with the Elder Wand and Hermione with her guerilla army on the other. The Minister with her aurors arrives a bit late. It's a completely chaotic battle and one of my favorite scenes from all of fanfiction.
