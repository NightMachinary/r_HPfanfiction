The lack of any OCs -- I'm not saying I dislike canon characters at all, just that if you're writing about the HP universe, Harry must be meeting more people than just the ones introduced by JKR. Like auror!HP fics where all the other aurors happen to be from the same year as Harry. It's just not plausible -- wizards live a long time, there are wizards from other countries. I'll accept a reduced population because of all the recent wars, but no OCs at all is questionable.
