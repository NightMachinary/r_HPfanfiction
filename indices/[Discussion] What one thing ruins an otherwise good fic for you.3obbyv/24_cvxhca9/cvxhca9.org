Pairings that would never happen in canon, I don't care what kind of plot device you come up with. It seems like that is all ff.net is nowadays, pairing Harry or Hermione with Snape, Voldemort (wtf is that about), Draco or some other absolutely absurd person just so the more than likely teenage female author can get off on it. I just can't suspend my belief that much.
