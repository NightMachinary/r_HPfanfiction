It's similar enough to Alastair/Alistair, and the character is from one of the British Isles (England in the book-on-tape, Ireland in the movie), so I can understand the confusion. They just take it as a variant spelling - as I did for a long time - and regularise it. Except it's not.

On a somewhat unrelated note, I like the way Brendan Gleeson portrays Moody in the films, enough for me to read Moody as Irish.
