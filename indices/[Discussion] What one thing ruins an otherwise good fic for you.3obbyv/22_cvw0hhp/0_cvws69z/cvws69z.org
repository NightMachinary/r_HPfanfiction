I recently read a fic where in order to further insult Umbridge (because she apparently wasn't bad enough) she was revealed to be transsexual. The emphasis was placed on that Umbridge was really a man and she was referred to as 'he' after that. I also recall one of Robst's stories having the ultimate punishment for Ron by turning him into a transsexual girl at some point.

I don't see how authors can justify it to themselves to make the main antagonist, and only the main antagonist, part of a minority that's already often discriminated against, and then also make fun of that character for being part of that minority.

I'm planning to include a trans character in my story, and I'm making sure I've done a lot of research so that it won't be offensive.
