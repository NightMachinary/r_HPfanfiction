Instant romances when they're like 12 or 13 and are talking about true love and sex etc. Made worse when the female character at that age actively tries to or 'naturally' becomes either super-passive and helpless or worse, deliberately tries to be 'sexy' to get her guy. She is not a teenager, she is 12. She is not helpless, she /literally/ carries a weapon on her at all times. I get this worst about Hermione (a feminist know-it-all), Luna (a cloud cuckoolander) and Ginny (a very independent-minded person) because behaving in either of those ways, if not explained, is so out-of-character as well as being creepy and breaking immersion.

On the flipside, male characters of that age actively sexualising the girls. It might be realistic or true to life or whatever but it doesn't get the tone of Harry Potter and more often than not it comes off as sleazy and pervy.
