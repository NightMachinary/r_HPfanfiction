Do they (as in all of them)? - That's a stereotype (I myself never felt this way and some of my best friends over the years (damned, I sound old...) have been girls (even as a preteen and a teen)...never thought they are weird (i didn't understand them all the time, but that was ok because I don't understand my male friends all the time either!))
