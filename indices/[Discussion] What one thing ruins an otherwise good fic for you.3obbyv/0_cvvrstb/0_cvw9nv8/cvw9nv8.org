I have to yet to read a fic that properly captures just how kids and teenagers act.

- Girls and boys think each other a bit weird, even if they are friends. Even best friends. They could know each other since birth and still only accept each other 99% of the time.

- Teenagers don't know shit about sex or love. They define each other on scales of cuteness, handsomeness, or hotness. All my best friends have been female and one confided they actually made a list in year 7.

- *Above all else, even the most smooth 13 year old you would ever meet is awkward.* Puberty means you can get aroused by the thought of math homework because your crush sits next to you in math class.
