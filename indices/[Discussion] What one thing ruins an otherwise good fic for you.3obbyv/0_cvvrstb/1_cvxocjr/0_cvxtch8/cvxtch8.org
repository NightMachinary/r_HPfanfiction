I think it's just handled badly. So often its not the looking and fantasising you'd expect at that age, its detailed sexual fantasies of an intensely pornographic kind. I dunno. I think it just comes off as smarmy, given it usually comes as very objectification-y and/or as an expression of /true love/. Can't sexual thoughts and ideas and musings be just that, without having to feature extremes of sex or 'purity'?

Harry or Ron taking an interest in boobs would be realistic enough - although I don't know if they're /those/ kind of boys entirely, given the 80s British setting. Those same characters, aged 12 or 13, discussing between themselves all the kinky things they want to do to or with Hermione or Ginny - much less realistic. No kid is that confident, and especially not kids with Ron or Harry's backgrounds.
