I get what you're saying on the last point, but uh, most 11-13 year old boys are pretty pervy. I mean, not so much in the stereotypical heavy breathing porn addict way, but close enough.

Glossing over it for the sake of style I can understand, but if you're intending to write a fairly realistic coming off age story, including it would seem pretty important.

Honestly, the way Harry Potter handled sexuality was always a sticking point for me. Either write it correctly, or don't at all. There has never been a boy in the history of man so desexed as canon Harry.
