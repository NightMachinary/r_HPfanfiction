The Harry/harem stories always strike me as lazy writing. I figure the author doesn't have a set in stone, this is exactly who Harry should end up with OTP, so they experiment with different pairings. What's lazy is that they aren't willing to create different story lines or plots for each pairing. They only came up with one story idea but don't know who they want the main love interest to be, so they just throw em all in there. It turns into such a mess.
