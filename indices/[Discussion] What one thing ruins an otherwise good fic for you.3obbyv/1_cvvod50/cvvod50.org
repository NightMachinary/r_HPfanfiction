Well, of course bad spelling and grammar can ruin a story. That's a bit like saying salmonella can ruin a good chicken sandwich. But then, I'd argue, it wasn't a good sandwich in the first place.

What annoys me is when authors throw in too many tired old elements. Often I find stories which have within them the beginnings of something interesting but which then drown it out with tired old clich√©s like evil Dumbledore, evil Weasleys, evil Hermione, inheritances, ridiculous power bloat, and so the list goes one.

Personally I really hate it when an otherwise interesting Romance plot gets turned into a Gotta Catch Em All harem plot. I have seen so very many Harry/Multi stories that would be incalculably improved by simply choosing /one/ girl as the love interest rather than trying to spread the characterization out over three or four or more. There's never enough to go round and the story invariably ends up as yet another Harry/HotBlondeOne/HotSmartOne/HotSnarkyOne/HotFrenchOne mess.
