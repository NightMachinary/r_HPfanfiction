That's all good stuff but I will note that for many UK publishers the single quote is the standard way of writing dialogue, with the double quote as a secondary method.

I sadly do not have a UK-English version of any of the Harry Potter books to hand but I can say that Terry Pratchett, Douglas Adams and JRR Tolkien's UK published books all use single quotes for speech. Factoid of the day!
