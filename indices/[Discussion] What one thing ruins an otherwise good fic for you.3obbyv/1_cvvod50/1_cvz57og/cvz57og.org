I can live through bad spelling and grammar (if I have to) but hands down it's the terrible punctuation that slays me. I can understand if the author isn't that good at writing it, or simply doesn't understand it that well, but damnit that's why you hand it off to a beta who does! Either that or learn how to use it properly. People who don't know how to use commas simply drive me up the wall. Or the ones that use apostrophes in place of quotation marks. And don't even get me started on the people who use ellipses every single sentence!
