  Occlumency training that lasts more than 2 paragraphs.

Oh, I'm curious why that one. I'd think Occlumency training could be fascinating if the writer puts some thought into the process and doles out the theory and practice throughout the course of the fic.

  Wandless magic beyond what we see in canon.

I'm happy to allow leeway on this one, as long as it doesn't get ridiculous and isn't used as a sudden super power. JKR didn't have room or time to explore all the nooks and crannies and rules of magic, and I like it when fanfic incorporates those unfinished hints and glimpses in relevant ways. However, if you have Harry silently disarming an entire Death Eater battalion (especially if you haven't explained why there are suddenly battalions in the wizarding world) while wrapped in chains in Voldemort's dungeon, I agree you are Doing It Wrong.
