This is simply a claim. A personal opinion with no explanation. Tell us, /why/ would it ruin a fic? I'm not even necessarily disagreeing, since you seem to have some particular scenario in mind, but asserting it without backing up your claim isn't convincing. Other people can clearly imagine ways the premise could be used without undermining the story. Why do you think otherwise? Why is the concept of wandless magic such a stretch?
