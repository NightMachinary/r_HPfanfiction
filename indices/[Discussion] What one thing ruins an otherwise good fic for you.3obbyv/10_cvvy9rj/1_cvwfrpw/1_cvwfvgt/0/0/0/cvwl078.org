Oh, well, I wouldn't argue that you can take any idea and make a hash of it. Absolutely. But wandless magic /does/ exist in canon, and in the hands of a skilled author, it can be used to enhance a character or an understanding of magical differences. After all, accidental magic in children is common, and I could certainly believe that concentrated studies or training could allow for a certain degree of wandlessness - perhaps never as varied or reliable as magic focused through a wand - but a short-distance /Accio/ doesn't seem beyond the bounds of credibility, or a signature spell - I could see Harry learning how to cast /Expelliarmus/ without a wand but rarely attempting it because the expenditure of energy required wouldn't be worth it except in emergencies. That doesn't seem too far-fetched to me or too damaging to suspension of disbelief.

And as Karinta suggests, a witch or wizard who's made a lifelong study of the practice and has great command of their magic could conceivably do a great deal without relying on a wand - but the difference is, they've dedicated their lives to learning how to direct their magic from the source. That just doesn't sound like a story-ruining concept to me, but YMMV.
