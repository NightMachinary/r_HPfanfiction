It's easy to find people who hate /some/ change from canon. Here it's "wandless magic." Other popular candidates seem to have been the animagus skill, the power of horcruxes, the power of parseltongue, and so forth.

In all of those cases, people have expanded on them and created something ridiculous. In some cases, creating something something good might be more of a challenge than most, but I see no reason to think that any of them would be inherently awful if expanded on, at least a bit.

Though I think that trying to do all at once would almost certainly become absurd. :)

Regardless, my point is... this is fanfic, right? Sticking slavishly to canon would just... reproduce canon, wouldn't it? The point is to change /something/. Usually a few somethings, too.

It's possible to go too far. If you remove any of the central defining elements of a universe, you shouldn't pretend that you're still writing fics for that universe (magic for HP, superpowers for Marvel/DC, etc.). But outside of such extremes, I have trouble understanding complaints about how changing something from canon is automatically wrong or a bad idea. It might be challenging, but it's also what defines writing a fanfic.

If someone objects to changes to canon so much, go read canon. The books are pretty good, after all.
