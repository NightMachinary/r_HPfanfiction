Sudden usage of "Ice Queen". Sudden bashing. Random love potion plots. Random Inheritance. Lord Potter-Black. Random heir of Founders. Random Harems. Occlumency training that lasts more than 2 paragraphs. Wandless magic beyond what we see in canon. Golden super Patronus of love. Stupid animagus forms (phoenix, dragon, etc). Harry having a billion galleons for no reason. Prank wars.
