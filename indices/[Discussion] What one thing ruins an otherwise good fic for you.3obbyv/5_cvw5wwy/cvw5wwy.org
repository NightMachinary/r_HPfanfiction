The 'Harry grows a backbone' genre is all very well, but every now and then you get halfway through and realise how /unlikeable/ he is. Being sarcastic and unpleasant to, say, Snape or Dumbledore, with no negative consequences whatsoever. I understand the catharsis, but often the author brings their own emotions into it, and it just becomes a bitter, hate-filled rant.

It vaguely irritates me extended the other way, as well; when Harry (or a third party) looks at himself and realises that he slacks a lot and largely relies on other people. We /know/ that, and we don't need two pages going through it all in a case-by-case basis. If I wanted to read about the flaws in a specific character, I would get into an online argument. I'm here for the narrative.

So, yeah, not a fan of bashing.
