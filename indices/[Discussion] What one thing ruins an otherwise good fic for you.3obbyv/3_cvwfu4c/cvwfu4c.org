Super-traditionalist sexism in wizarding society. Yes, wizarding society is more traditionalist than Muggle society, but their traditions are /different/ than ours. In the nonmagical world, most sex discrimination can trace a common root to the fact that women are physically weaker than men. Considering that for most of human history your power was decided by your ability to commit violence to further your own goals(both on personal and national levels) that led to women being placed in a position of lesser power. However, sex does not affect one's proficiency at magic, so the history of sexual discrimination never developed in the magical world. A witch is every bit as deadly as a wizard, and in JKR's word for every male figure we have a female figure who is just as skilled. Merlin has Morgana. Godric and Salazar have Helga and Rowena. McGonagall is Deputy Headmistress, and is, if not /the/ most skilled magic-user in the country after Dumbledore and Voldemort, then is at least in the running for the position. Moody's personal apprentice was a woman. Bellatrix was Voldemort's right hand, even moreso than Lucius Malfoy. If not her husband's equal, then Lily Potter can be regarded as being /superior/ to James Potter, considering how widely her skills were praised. In the entirety of the series, there is not one gender-based discrimination shown, rather the discrimination we see is blood and occasionally wealth-based.
