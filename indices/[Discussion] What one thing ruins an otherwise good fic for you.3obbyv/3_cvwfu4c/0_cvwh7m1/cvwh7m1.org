Actually, there's quite a bit of discrimination shown in the series - but it's more subtle than the blood-based discrimination.

Quick quiz: how many women in the series have both children and a career?

Answer: Zero! Amelia Bones comes closest because she's raising her niece. But she's also not married and doesn't have any children of her own. Otherwise, women /either/ have a career /or/ they have a family (husband, kids). Very traditionalist.

It's true that Bellatrix is a strong witch, but she's also a psychopathic terrorist. Evil characters usually show the traits that you are discouraging others from having. They aren't role models.

The female characters that get the most attention also tend towards nurturing, supportive roles - teacher, nurse, etc. Male characters, in contrast, tend to be the adventurers and risk-takers. This even includes Hermione to a depressing extent.

The gender discrimination isn't as overt as the blood discrimination, but it does get expressed in the sorts of social norms and gender roles that help perpetuate gender discrimination in real life. I wouldn't be surprised if Rowling didn't even realize it when she was writing it. Her books are better than average, but it would be a huge mistake to pretend that there aren't serious structural flaws anyway.

It's not simply about personal power. It's about social and political power as well. It's about what sorts of social, political, and gendered roles characters are depicted as having. A female character with lots of magical power doesn't make up for having mostly male characters being given the most leadership roles, being risk-takers, going on the most adventures, being the only ones with both a career and a family, etc.
