1. I'm not sure Marietta's mother qualifies as a "character" if she's simply referenced in third person and never actually appears personally in the story. Her existence at least proves that women aren't prevented from having both a career and a family in this world, but their relative absence "on screen" is significant.

2. It is of course an open question as to whether the differences you describe are more cultural or biological. There are indisputible biological factors, like levels of testosterone, but in a truly equal society perhaps that would only influence the outliers, an in the middle the numers would be roughly similar? There is simply too much weight of past discrimination and assumptions bearing down on current social behavior to simply assume that what we see happening is free from any bias or influence.
