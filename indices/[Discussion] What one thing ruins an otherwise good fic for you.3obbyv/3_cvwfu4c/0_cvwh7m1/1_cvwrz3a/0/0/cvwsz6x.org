I'll concede the first point, it was merely a counter example that there was at least one character that fitted that.

As to the second though, I'd say the middle would show a difference in risk taking behavior among certain others even just on testosterone. [[http://www.healthline.com/health/low-testosterone/testosterone-levels-by-age][According to this data]] I just googled the testosterone levels of men are an order of magnitude higher than those of women. There are clearly measured effects of testosterone on behavior and this will have an effect on behavior even in a truly equal society.

What I meant with outliers was that you will have women with high testosterone and men with low testosterone that go against that stereotype, as well as people who take more or less risk for other reasons (for example psychological, being depressed can make one reckless too).
