Ah, but biology is not destiny. There can be no doubt that testosterone has an effect on behavior. At the same time, though, we can be equally certain that any given amount of testosterone doesn't automatically cause a person to engage in some behavior.

So there are other factors as well.

Now, the men who participate in a studies on the link between testosterone and behavior were raised in a culture that, to varying degrees, sent messages about boys being risk-takers and adventurers, about manliness being linked to aggression and suppressing emotions, etc.

So all we really know is that higher testosterone leads to more risk-taking behavior /in that context/. Maybe in a different context, men wouldn't be getting so many messages that induce them to act on something that a single hormone is subtly encouraging in the background. Maybe without those messages, the encouragement of testosterone wouldn't be as effective, leading at least to a lower difference between men and women. Maybe in a culture where girls are encouraged to be risk takers, much of that remaining difference would be eliminated from the other direction.

And there's something else, too. We /know/ that how a person is raised can have a significant influence on their later biology. An easy (and actually relevant for this subreddit) example is how abuse of a child can drastically alter their brain and brain chemistry for life. Is it possible that constant messages about risk taking, and then early acting on those messages by engaging in risk taking (or not, in the case of girls), could mold a child's biology to produce even just little more (or less) testosterone over the course of their life?

I could of course be wrong, but my larger point was also my first sentence in this message: biology is not destiny. We don't know nearly enough about how environment and biology interact to say with any certainty that in a different environment, we'd see the same sorts of differences in risk taking behavior between males and females. I'd be surprised if we didn't see any, but I also wouldn't be surprised if most of it were at the ends of the curves while in the middle the differences were a lot smaller - in part because boys aren't taught that they have to take risks to prove they're a man and in part because girls are taught that it's equally good for them to do such things as well.

But I think we do agree on what is actually the real issue here: books sending the message that boys are leaders, risk-takers, and adventurers while girls are carers, nurturers, readers, and homemakers are books that subtly perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination. Regardless of what differences might ultimately exist in an ideal society, we don't live in that society and should try to move beyond the messages such books communicate.
