In the end, you are your biology + the sum of your experiences. I'm not saying biology alone dictates your actions, but it does play a part. And when we're talking statistics, because in the end stereotypes are generally based on extrapolated patterns, the results of that influence will show.

When you have biological differences between two demographics, such as men and women, some of those differences will influence behavior in a statistically significant manner, whether directly (hormones) or indirectly (since historically women couldn't exactly run from a pregnancy and as such would be stuck with the consequences to a larger extent than men, they are culturally expected to be more discriminating when it comes to selecting sexual partners. Effective contraception and abortion have in the last 60 years made that cultural expectation more of an unpleasant relic than the stimulation of a useful behavioral pattern that it was).
