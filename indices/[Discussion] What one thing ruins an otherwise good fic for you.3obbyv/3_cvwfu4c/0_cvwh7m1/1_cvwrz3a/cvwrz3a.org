Marietta Edgecombe's mother has a carreer, seeing as it was through her job that she pushed her daughter to act against Harry/the DA.

Regarding female characters taking less risks overall, I think that's realistic, men do tend to be more reckless. That is however an average and you have outliers in both directions. And the book seems to have those too.

Other than that I mostly agree with your conclusions on the books, I have thought those things many times myself. Having at least one woman with a noticeable career /and/ children would have been nice.
