That's a fair argument, but the point still stands that the magical world is far more equal to than the Muggle world-not perfect, but there is certainly none of the Victorian-chauvinism or condescension that you often see in fics. Amelia Bones, as you mentioned, headed the DMLE in 1995. As of 2015, neither the FBI nor the Metropolitan Police have ever had female directors.

So yes, there is still an imbalance, but there is certainly more equality to be found among the spell-slingers than the normal world.
