Yet at the same time we've seen that the Head of house has rather a lot of power over his family members, as seen with the Black family. Also we see pretty much every married witch taking her Husband's last name. Although it wasn't like this yet in 1995 (it was a consequence of marriage equality coming to our laws in 2001), in my country when you marry either partner can use their own name, their partner's name, or a hyphenated combination of the two, and I often see people using this. Yet in the Harry Potter universe which is supposed to have more gender equality we don't see anything like that.

It seems more like a universe that was meant to be more equal, but the writer didn't notice a lot of things that aren't equal in our society, and left those in, a consequence of her own culture.

I also think that a lot of fanfics which magnify the gender inequality do this on purpose, and I don't /just/ mean regency-esque fics.
