The fact that a woman can rise to the head of such an organization means that there isn't a lot of legal discrimination. The fact that the only women who can rise to such positions are the ones without families suggests very strongly that there is discrimination.

What's more, the presence of a woman at the head of an organization doesn't mean as much as you seem to think it does. Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister, but that wasn't evidence that Great Britain was free from gender discrimination. Nor that it had even suddenly made great strides in that area, either.

It's not the accomplishments of selected individuals that we need to look at, but rather overall patterns - and looking at the former rather than the latter is a mistake that people make when trying to judge the strength of discrimination in the real world as well. Pointing to a single woman, a single Jew, a single black man, or anyone like that doesn't entitle us to say "Look, everything is so much better!", not when the overall patterns have remained the same.

There is also something even more important going on here. Bones' job doesn't send much of a positive message to female readers when her presence in the books is nearly non-existent. The consistent lack of female characters who have both families and careers does send a message - and it isn't a positive one.

Even Lucius, who doesn't have a job, a least has a "career" of sorts going out to bribe and influence politicians. He's moving in the political arena, doing and acting. That's something Narcissa should be capable of, but she doesn't.
