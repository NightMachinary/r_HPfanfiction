Very late to this, but there's a fic I read recently that, while I did enjoy alot, contained a ton of Molly saying "[character]-dear". There's literally a sentence where she goes "George-dear, Fred-dear, oh! and Harry-dear!" Now any fic where Molly attaches -dear to the end of a name makes me cringe hard.
