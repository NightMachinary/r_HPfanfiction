I've noticed that certain phrases stick out to me and I like or dislike them based on the story. I can't stand the phrase "shush you" because an author used it a million times in their fic and all their characters used it. There is nothing wrong with that phrase but the way the author used it ruined it for me. Due to another fic I think the phrase "sweet baby mauve" is the funniest damn thing I've ever read and I enjoy seeing it used in other fics.
