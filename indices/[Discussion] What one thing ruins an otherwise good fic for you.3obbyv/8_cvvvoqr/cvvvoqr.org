I've been immediately turned off a fic when they have Harry's animagus form (or worse, /second/ animagus form) be a Phoenix or other magical creature. Cue all the other characters exclaiming that it isn't possible! You can't have a magical animagus form! And look at all the powers you now have as a Phoenix!!
