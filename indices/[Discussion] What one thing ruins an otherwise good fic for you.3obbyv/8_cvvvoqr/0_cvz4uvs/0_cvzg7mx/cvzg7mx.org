That seemed more like playing with symbolism. Or Sirius playing with Wizarding superstition. In canon, Grims don't have magical powers or are even real creatures, according to Hermione. It was more like our muggle myth about black cats.

When Harry astoundingly has the form of a Phoenix (gasp! that's so original!) he often also in the fics can heal with tears, sing haunting melodies, apparate with flame, etc. It's freaking annoying is what it is. I've had a story be pretty great with interesting plot points and well dialogued characters immediately lose me when Harry has the magical and "surprising" form of a Phoenix.
