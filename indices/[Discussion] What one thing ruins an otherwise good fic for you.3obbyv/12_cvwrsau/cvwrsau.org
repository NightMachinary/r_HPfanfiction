Head-hopping and consistent grammar mistakes that alter the meaning of sentences. Also using wrong terms/names, like using 'occlumency' when talking about legilimency, the 'crucio-curse' (should be cruciatus or torture curse), 'Zambini' and most annoying: wrong last names (not for AU reasons). Like when someone has Bellatrix married to Voldemort, and she becomes 'Bellatrix Riddle-Lestrange', no, she was born a Black, she wouldn't be a Lestrange (Also, do you really think that any witch marrying Voldemort would hyphenate her name? I'm not sure that's a safe decision with that man). I've seen this with other characters too but repeatedly with Bella.

Ow and religion. I'm okay with paganism (it's amusing) but any major real religion being a part of the story just makes me want to stop reading. Christianity in particular. I'm okay with Christmas (although I don't celebrate it myself) because it's mostly a commercial thing anyway, but no elaborate descriptions of Hermione going to the mass (or even getting permission to do that every Sunday, leaving Hogwarts for it). If literally being a witch isn't enough to wake you up regarding your religious upbringing, I don't know what is.
