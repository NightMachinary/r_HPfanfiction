Spelling and Grammar is ok if it doesn't take over. know/now, there/their, ... makes me chuckle, really.

What I can't stand is the misspelling of in-universe words and names. My favourites are Lilly, occulamancy, Sirius Orian Black, McGonagl, Dumbledoor, Hermine, Wesley and so on and so forth.

The only thing that could actually provoke an angry review would be the renaming of Harry to Henry, Harold or whatever the author deemed a "real" name. Its Harry. Its an actual, valid name.
