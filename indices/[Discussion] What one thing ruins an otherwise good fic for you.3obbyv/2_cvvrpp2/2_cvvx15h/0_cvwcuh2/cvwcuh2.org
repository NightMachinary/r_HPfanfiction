Well, to be fair, Harry is a diminutive form of Henry.

It's just that some people can't take it when their favourite character has a name that's a straight-up diminutive instead of the one it got derived from. Which is silly because, in the end, it's still the same name---it's just for the official stuff that one is called and not the other---and nobody would begrudge a Harry who wanted to be called Henry just as nobody does it to Prince Henry who wants to be Prince Harry.

But then again, most people are too used to their own names to notice the above ... despite the fact that so many people already use nicknames pretty much interchangeably with names. Oh well.
