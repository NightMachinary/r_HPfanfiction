I don't mind it at all - I even love stories where it's done well - but it's a difficult narrative choice to pull off, and a lot of people don't stop to think about that when they sit down to write. For that reason alone, I really admire an author who can persuade me to accept the first person version of whichever character they're impersonating.

First-person manages to make bad writing seem even worse, though. And newbie writers typically end up projecting their own fantasies and preferences onto the characters, which is even more cringeworthy than usual once you take away the little bit of distance third-person provides.

Still, I'm willing to give first-person a shot, especially if I recognize the author as someone whose work I already enjoy.
