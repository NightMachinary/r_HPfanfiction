I have the reverse, when I start reading a fanfic written in third person, I'm already fearing the head hopping. When it's well-written both perspectives work fine in my opinion, but when it's bad, third person really breaks all immersion I have in a story.

Having one paragraph in which one character says something, and both her thoughts and the thoughts of the person she's talking to being shown to the reader just breaks my enjoyment of the story.

I think perspective should be fixed at least on a per-chapter basis. That means no switching between first and third person and no switching between who we are following constantly. Unless the main character is a legilimens and that is part of the story, don't let show me the thoughts of other people.

Also, most fictional books (as in, actually published works) I read are first person. It's just easier to get in a story and read it to the end without any fuss. A book being in third person doesn't mean I won't read it, but it has to be better for me to enjoy it. It's automatically at a disadvantage in terms of immersion.
