It's interesting knowing this is a pet peeve because as an American, I usually don't notice until I read a scathing review about the incorrect British terms. Usually when I start a story, I can tell by certain words like trousers or mum that the author is either British or is putting effort into writing it like that, but if a person grabs a "cookie" from a jar I won't give it a second thought.

Where I do get messed up though is incontinuity. Like if they start by correctly saying "mum" but occasionally say "mom," that will completely throw me off.

From what I've gathered solely through reading author's notes, it usually just depends on if the writer has a beta for "brit-picking." If they don't have someone combing through, American writers will slip back into the more comfortable colloquial terms without noticing.
