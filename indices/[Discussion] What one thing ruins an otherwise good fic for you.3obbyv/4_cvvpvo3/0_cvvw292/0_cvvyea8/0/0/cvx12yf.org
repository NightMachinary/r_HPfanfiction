Mm, yes, that's why I don't mind when there's a few slip ups but the author is clearly making an effort. Obviously I'd love it if everyone got a Brit picker, but I understand that's not always possible. But if you talk about blocks but you've had Ron calling Mrs Weasley 'Mum' the whole time, I won't mind. If, however, your story is filled with mom and cell phone, and chips - well, blocks might be the last straw for me.
