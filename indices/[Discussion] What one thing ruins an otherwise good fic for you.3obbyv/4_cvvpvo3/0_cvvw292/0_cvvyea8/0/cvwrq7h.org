As an American, I'd say some things are easier than others- most people know crisps instead of chips and biscuits instead of cookies, and even jumper instead of sweater and trainers for sneakers.

But some things, like saying a few blocks away, it would just never even occur to me that that wouldn't be a thing. I guess the only way to deal with that, when you don't even know it's an Americanism, is to find a Brit to Brit-pick? How else can I watch out for things I don't even know are issues?
