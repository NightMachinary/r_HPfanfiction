That's certainly handy. For reference, I live in Kansas. North and South are named Streets, East and West are numbered. The further north you go, the lower the number gets, south is the opposite. If I'm not mistaken, 1st street would be the center of Downtown, but that likely isn't the case everywhere. I will say that I've no idea if the street numbers can go above 200. The farthest I've ever seen is 170th street.
