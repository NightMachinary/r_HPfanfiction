Since streets in the US (especially in cities) are laid out in a grid pattern, a block refers to the space between major cross streets. So if streets are laid out numerically east to west, then going from 1st Street to 2nd Street is one block, not counting the smaller streets, avenues, or alleys in the middle. Usually when people say "It's a few blocks over," they mean that you're not on the right street now, but you are within walking distance of where you need to be.
