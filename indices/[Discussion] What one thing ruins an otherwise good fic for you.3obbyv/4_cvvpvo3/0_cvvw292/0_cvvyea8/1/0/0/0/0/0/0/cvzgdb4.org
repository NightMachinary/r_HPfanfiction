I live in Kansas too! I'm not sure where the numbers reset because I've been far enough (into Louisburg) that the numbered streets are into the 250s, but within Topeka, Lawrence, and Manhattan, all cities I've spent a little time in, the numbers are small again. I don't know how big a city has to be for the numbers to reset in downtown.
