Some cities are more confusing than others, but often yes. Usually number streets will go one direction and named streets will go the other. I don't live there, but Lincoln, Nebraska, has my all time favorite system ever. One way the streets are all numerical and the other they are just alphabet letters. A friend and I stayed there for a weekend and it was impossible to get lost. We knew our hotel was at the cross of P St. and 12th, so we could wander around and always find our way back just by looking at what cross street we were currently at.
