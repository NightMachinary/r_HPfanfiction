Excellent synopsis of the art and challenge of dialogue-writing. Most of these points can be applied to writing in general, with the implicit critique that too many fanfic authors don't know a damned thing about their craft - and don't care. (Insert 'hobby, fun, derivative work on the internet, etc.' for the reasons why.)
