perverse-idyll covered most of it.

The thing with dialogue is that its a fine balancing act between trying to replicate actual people talking...and yet, not really. There are things we say (unconsciously) in real life that doesn't translate well into a story (the most obvious example being "filler sounds" like um, er, uh, (excessive uses of) yeah, well, of course, really etc.).

To craft dialogue is an art, and it takes plenty of thought to pick the right word.

The second obstacle is that dialogue has two parts two it. One is the question of "How does what x character says relate to the overall plot?" The other is "What does what x character say reveal about him/her to the reader?" Often, a writer focuses on one to the detriment of the other.

Then there's the fact that not all characters sound the same, in terms of nuance (catch phrase, pauses), intelligence (word choice), background and a variety of other factors to consider for one character. Imagine doing that for a cast of say six characters. The sudden "gear-shifting" you do in your head to get into the mind of each of the characters is some incredible mental acrobatics, and I personally find it disconcerting.

Then, of course, there is your personal limitations. In order to write humor, you need to have a sense of it. In order to write a smart character you have to have a modicum of it.

Combining all of these things makes for the most difficult aspect of writing. Good dialogue, after all, should tell your reader everything they need to know about the character.
