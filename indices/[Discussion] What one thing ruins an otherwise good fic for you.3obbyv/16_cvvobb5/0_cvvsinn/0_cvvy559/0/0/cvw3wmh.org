I agree with what you're saying, but often I find that people write dialogue in the way a child plays with a dollhouse. Constant overuse of the other characters name, odd speech about what exactly they're doing, no contractions, plus all the standard poor grammar around speech. Like the other day I saw something similar to this:

"Ron I am going outside mate I cannot possibly stand your bickering any more so I need some fresh air" said Harry.

"What do you mean harry" asked Ron

"Sorry Ron but I am sick with you and hermione" screamed Harry.

I mean, people just don't talk like that. I understand people struggling with characterisation and even wit, but I struggle to understand how people end up writing dialogue in this way. We speak to people all the time, what turns our characters into robots like this?

I do on the whole agree with you. I am not a particularly funny person, so I can struggle with the wit and quick quips required of the characters. But I put that down to characterisation rather than the dialogue construction.
