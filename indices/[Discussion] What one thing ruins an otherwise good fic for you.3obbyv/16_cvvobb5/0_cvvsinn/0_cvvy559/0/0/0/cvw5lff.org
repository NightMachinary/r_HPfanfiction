Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, that's inexcusable. But usually when the punctuation and grammar are that bad, it's not confined to the dialogue, it's a problem throughout the entire fic. Dialogue conventions make the errors even more noticeable and the writing even more incoherent, but it's a symptom of poor language use overall, I think.

I'd venture to say that even the best fanfic uses names in dialogue far more often than pro fic or real life. If the writer is careful, I don't notice it, but it's a compromise. Names can be useful for emphasis or for keeping the various lines of dialogue on track, but the constant repetition is a red flag to me that the writer is barely paying attention to what they're writing, and either isn't correcting mistakes or doesn't understand that lack of punctuation /is/ a mistake, and that whacking names back and forth like the ball in a tennis match will drive their readers crazy.

Actually, I doubt I would have made it as far as that bit of dialogue you quoted. If that's a fair sample of the writer's style, I would have been catapulted out of the fic in the first paragraph.
