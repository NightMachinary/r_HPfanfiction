I agree with HaltCPM. Dialogue is a tricky business, and if you don't have a natural gift for it, it can take several revisions to get it right. As a reader, I know it when I see it - I know when a writer has a talent for timing and turns of phrase - but I can't automatically call upon that knowledge when I'm facing the screen and struggling with characters having a conversation.

As someone who writes adequate but not outstanding dialogue, here's what I run into. Speech often works with beats and rhythms. You have to know how to make it flow, when to pause, how to vary the structure, how to switch off the rules of narrative grammar and echo the informality of speech without getting too slangy or out of character.

And I know this might seem an obvious point, but not all characters sound the same, and it can be surprisingly hard to stay true to tone and pitch and phrasing. Ron and Harry, for instance. It's not as if there's not a huge chasm of class and dialect dividing them, but it's there, and too often (IMO) writers deal with it by making Ron talk like an oaf or a clown. Or on the flip side, they give Harry dialogue that makes him seem dimmer than he is in canon, often unintentionally because they're trying to mimic some idea of what teenagers sound like, or they're overdoing Harry's relative innocence of adult matters (I don't mean sex, I mean all the things Harry was kept in the dark about, re: his destiny and the history behind it). Also, way too many of us forget how dryly sarcastic Harry can be (yeah, I've been guilty of this). He's snarky and scrappy, and he has a very sharp tongue when he's given a reason to use it.

Which reminds me - wit and humor are a big part of dialogue, and they're all over the HP series. I delight in wit, but I'm not a casually witty person myself. I can't always judge whether my attempts at humor hit the mark, or come up with a zippy line even when I know a scene cries out for it. I envy people who can produce pages of clever dialogue without breaking a sweat.

So that's a quick and incomplete rundown on some of the challenges of writing dialogue, for me at least. I'd be interested to hear how other writers feel about it.
