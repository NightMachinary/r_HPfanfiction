I'm with you on the everyone is gay trope, it makes me bang my head. That's not how this works! A mix is preferred as it's realistic. Also mpreg, I can't take that! Men do not have the equipment to carry a child! The authors could easily just use a surrogate or adoption, but nope, total fantasyland! Ugh, it just takes me out.
