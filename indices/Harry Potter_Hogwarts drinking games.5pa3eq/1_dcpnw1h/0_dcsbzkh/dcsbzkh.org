That gives me an idea for a story (Tho I have no idea how), where a powerful wizard (Maybe Dumbldore, Harry, Voldemort, etc) creates some of those mildly-sentient objects, but since they are stronger they either do something wrong or its too powerful so then there is now completely sentient chess pieces that regenerate. Well I assume that they regenerate when smashed. Would most likely be a crackfic, but I'd never write it.
