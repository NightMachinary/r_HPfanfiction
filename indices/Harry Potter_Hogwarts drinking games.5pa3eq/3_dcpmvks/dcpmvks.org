I'd think a HP fanfic drinking game would be best.

Drink every time someone acts out of character (bashing, suddenly speaks like an adult, etc).\\
Drink every time someone mentions "Lord", "House", or "Ancient and Noble".\\
Drink every time someone suddenly masters something after reading a book.\\
Drink every time someone is polite to a goblin or otherwise show's that "he/she is no ordinary wizard/witch".\\
Finish your drink every time Harry winds up with a new girl. Only take a drink if he broke up with the last girl and is monogamous.

I'm sure you're probably dead now but just in case you're not: Drink every time you read something that makes you cringe or annoys you.
