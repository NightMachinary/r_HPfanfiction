I don't usually like when stories have the pureblood supremacists be some sort of misunderstood group just wanting to protect their culture rather than the racist murderous assholes they are in canon. So I haven't read this one as the summary sort of implies that might be the case in this story. Is it? If so is the story well written enough to read anyway, even if that aspect bothers me?
