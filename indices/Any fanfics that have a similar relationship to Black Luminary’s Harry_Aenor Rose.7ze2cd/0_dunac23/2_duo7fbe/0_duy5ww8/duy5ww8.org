The Voldemort in the fic has a different reasoning than the canon one. It becomes more “magic v muggle” than anything.

She ignores but doesn't deny that her followers did bad shit but Harry likes her and finds her charming so he also ignores it.

While I wanted the reader to like Voldemort in this fic (for reasons that are probably obvious now l) it doesn't mean she isn't a horrible person.

Just about everyone in the story points that out to Harry, including a rather surprising one in chapter 29.

So while I do want there to be empathy for the Voldemort character in the story. I don't want that to excuse the actions that followed.
