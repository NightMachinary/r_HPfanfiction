I am obsessed with this story right now and have nothing but praise for it, less the occasional moments of Harry being a cunty twat. Even though the author says in book 1 that the story won't be a multiship one, I think it is hard to discard any of Aenor, Daphne, or Tracey if Hadrian ends up with one of these ladies. In fact, if any of them gets shafted (such as Katie in /A Cadmean Victory/ and Daphne in /Gods Amongst Men/), then I highly doubt I can stomach reading the story any longer.
