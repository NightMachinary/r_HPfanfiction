  did it have it's own foods?
#+end_quote

kinda, we know they definitely had their own drinks, like pumpkin juice being as common as orange juice, and they had their own alternatives for alcohol like elven wine, butter beer or fire whiskey. They also have heir own sweets like chocolate frogs or acid pops. The regular foods seems to more normal though.

  was the only transportation besides apparition available floo, portkeys, or the knight bus?
#+end_quote

there are also magical mounts like Hippogrifs or Aethonans(British winged horses), though by law they have to be charmed invisible, Pottermore also mentions that cars are quite common among wizards and we see the ministry use cars in the books.

  for that matter, does having those basic instant transportation option limit the society? I mean for the love of magic, they have instant transportation and use owls for post, but stick their head in the fireplace for instant communication?
#+end_quote

It depends what you mean with limits, it certainly reduced the need for more advanced forms of communication, but it certainly has advantages in general being able to travel to any part of the country in seconds. It defnitly made the statute of secrecy much more possible since wizards could now live spread out over the country and still visit and trade with each other as if they were living in the same town.

  What about the arts beyond painting like theatre, sculpture....what about the music?
#+end_quote

We know they have their own fairy tales like the Tales of Beedle the Bard, and Lockharts Books seem to have been more literature then textbooks. We do now that they have quite a bit of musicians though, like Celestina Warbeck or Lorcan d'Eath and bands like the Weird Sisters or the Hobgoblins.
