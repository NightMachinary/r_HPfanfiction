I've actually recently come across this website:

[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/index.php]]

It is faster and keeps a record of all stories ever downloaded so downloads are instant for those stories that have already been downloaded by another person as there is no need to convert the file from html to epub/mobi/whatever again.
