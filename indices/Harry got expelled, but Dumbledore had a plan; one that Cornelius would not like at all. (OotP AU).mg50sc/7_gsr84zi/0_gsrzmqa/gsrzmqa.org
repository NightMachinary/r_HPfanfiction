Given how well Harry does with the D.A. in canon, though, actually I could see it happen where Harry's at least a teachers' assistant.

Harry's motivated to learn on account of he wants to be useful in the fight against Voldemort, he's got leadership qualities, and given he mastered a NEWT-level spell in third year, he's definitely got the aptitude for DADA.
