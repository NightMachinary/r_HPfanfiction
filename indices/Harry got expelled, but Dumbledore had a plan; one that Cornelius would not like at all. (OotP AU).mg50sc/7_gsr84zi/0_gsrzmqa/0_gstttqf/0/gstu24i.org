Umbridge only got hired because Dumbledore couldn't find someone in time, so Fudge took the opportunity to send Umbridge.

With Harry taking the spot (I can imagine some paperwork-trickery to make Literally Anyone Else the teacher on paper, but then have Harry do the teaching), no Umbridge would occur.
