We know Merrythought, Rakepick, Quirrell, Lockhart, Lupin, Moody-Crouch, (not Umbridge since she was forced on by the Ministry), and Snape. We don't know much about Merrythought or Rakepick, so Quirrell and Lockhart makes 2/7. It could be argued that Snape and especially Crouch also weren't qualified or teach, not in the sense that they didn't know the subject matter, but rather that they shouldn't be around children in the first place. So at least 4/7 unsuitable hires.
