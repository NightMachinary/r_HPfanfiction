  We know Merrythought, Rakepick, Quirrell, Lockhart, Lupin, Moody-Crouch, (not Umbridge since she was forced on by the Ministry), and Snape.

I'm not sure I would consider Rakepick as Canon since she is in Hogwarts mystery. I have not particular problem with her but Hogwarts Mystery has several things I have trouble considering canon (as the PC fighting a Werewolf during his 2nd year as an example) and I tend to pretty much ignore everything from it.

But ignoring this, Voldemort cursed the post around the mid 1960's right? So by the time Harry at Hogwarts, the Curse had already been in place for around 25 years. Considering the "limited" population of the Magical World, plus the rumours about said Curse, it is kinda understandable that Dumbledore became unable to find any "suitable" candidates.

After all, every teachers during canon were either complete fools (Lockart), or people who had a specific goal in mind and didn't plan to stay in place more than one year anyways (Quirrel with the Stone, Lupin with Black, Maugrey with his retirement/ Crouch Jr with the Tournament . . .).
