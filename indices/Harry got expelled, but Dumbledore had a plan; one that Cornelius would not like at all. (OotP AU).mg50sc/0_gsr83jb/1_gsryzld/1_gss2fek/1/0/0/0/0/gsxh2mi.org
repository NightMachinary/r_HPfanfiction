Power is a relative thing in the Original books (it's somewhat hinted at if I remember correctly) but [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/what-is-a-patronus]] at least states that it is a complicated spell that even adults struggle with + plus currently it has been 10 to 8 years since I read the books completely (in german) so you have me at somewhat of a disadvantage. To the silent casting thing, I imagine it would be more of a finesse, not a Strength aspect of magic. So whilst I will admit that Harry would probably not be a Perfect teacher for Dada he still would 100% qualify based on previous instructors.
