If the patronus really requires a lot of power, then why hasn't Harry been shown to do magic extraordinary enough to be similar in power to repel hundreds of Dementors? I can't remember him performing any feat of magic extraordinary enough to parallel that. Also in sixth year Harry was not able to cast DADA spells silently. They were definitely part of the syllabus and not just extremely advanced stuff Snape made them do because McGonagall and Flitwick also expected them to do so.
