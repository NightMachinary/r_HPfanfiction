I mean, it's hard to get /less/ qualified than Umbridge's deliberate sabotage.

Harry gets good DADA scores, so I can see him getting fast-tracked through getting at least his OWL within the summer with a lot of encouragement from Dumbledore.

He's motivated to do it, as well - he spends the entirety of fifth year /wanting/ to be useful, wanting to be trained, playing that angle would absolutely motivate him to race through the material.

A NEWT would require some exaggeration, but hey. Fanfic.
