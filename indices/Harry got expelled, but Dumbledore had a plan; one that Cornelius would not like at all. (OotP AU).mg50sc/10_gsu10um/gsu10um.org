He could use Harry winning the Triwizard Tournament as justification/certification enough (also being the lone survivor of the Killing Curse is an ace in the pocket). And this was the year Harry ended up teaching DADA anyway with Dumbledore's Army (DA!). It would be the second year with a "mad" professor too. I would hope Dumbledore would make sure Harry could still have his other lessons after classes (instead of detentions with Umbridge)... imagine Harry having his own staff sleeping chambers- are their bathrooms as nice as the Prefect ones? Oh, maybe Harry can have an extra pet... Snuffles staying in his chambers to give advice? And getting Voldemort-induced headaches while reading student essays, so just giving up and giving them credit. Being extra sad that Hagrid isn't back yet to do lesson planning together. But you know who would be angriest about this: Severus Snape. "He hired the 15 year old Potter brat over me."
