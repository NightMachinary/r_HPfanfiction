The curse goes crazy because of the horcrux combined with Harry and instead tries to get rid of him every week, but the magic realised that it's the â€˜caster' last minute every time, resulting in the weekly near-death/major injury scenario. Student bets start. How will Harry almost die this week? What outlandish thing will save him? Harry starts to gain confidence in being able to survive these ridiculous things, and the fic ends with Harry dying of something utterly random unrelated to the curse, where he doesn't ask for help because a year of near deaths have given him overconfidence (it's 1am I apologise ðŸ˜‚)
