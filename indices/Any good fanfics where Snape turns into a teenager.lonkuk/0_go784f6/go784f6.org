There's a very recently published story, "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29422965/chapters/72280395][That Snape Boy"]], that fits what you're looking for. "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23940205][Second Chance]]" is an AU one-shot where he's turned into a teenager during the trio's era. It's not the most in-character story, but it's still kind of fun. Otherwise, "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11075550/1/Pint-Sized][Pint Sized]]" is a multi-chapter that updates every now and again. He's not quite a teen, but he's twelve, so it's pretty close to what you're looking for.
