*Bracing myself for downvotes* Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.

For some reason this sub really hates the fic, but in my humble opinion it's the only good SI I've ever read. Some people also recommend "Curse of Truth" sometimes, but I found it to be super boring and didn't get very far.
