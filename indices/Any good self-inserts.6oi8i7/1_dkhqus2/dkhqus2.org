A Curse of Truth is one of the few good ones. Some of the timetravel ones are basically SIs in everything but name. HPMOR is more AU than SI(though i can see how it seems like an SI with extreme OOC characters) , but clearly worth the time if you have it. If nothing else, it introduced me to Godel, Escher, Bach which was a load of fun.
