I found the Azkaban reform to be a really interesting background element of linkffn(The Aurors) . It's definitely not a huge part of the story, but it ties into one of the story's major themes: Laws and fair justice, and not rage and revenge, are the best ways to bring peace back to the wizarding world and move on after the Second War.

When there's a breach in security in /The Aurors,/ the guards who worked at Azkaban blamed Harry's post-war reforms for it, which I thought was a nice touch. That happens a lot in the real world -- people who worked in a pre-reform system often resent the reforms and resent the extra work that the reforms require, especially when the reforms require the "good guys" to treat the "bad guys" like human beings.
