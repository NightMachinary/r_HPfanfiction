I liked Bellatrix, even before the movies, despite her limited appearances. Of course, with the movie release, and HBC's excellent portrayal of her, I only loved her more.

Why? As a bit of an...older person...you have to understand that when I was growing up, there weren't many (any?) examples of strong, independent women in fiction to look up to. Even heroines were subject to needing to be saved and/or romanced by men.

However, for little girls looking for kick-ass role models, while there weren't many heroines, there were plenty of female villains. They wielded power, didn't take crap from anyone, lived their best life, and didn't need a man to save them. While other girls wanted to be a princess, I wanted to be Maleficent.

So Bellatrix fit wonderfully within that mold. I could do without the sucking up to Dark Lord, but the way she absolutely inspired fear and panic (second only to LV, and perhaps arguably even surpassing him in some instances) made her one of my favs.
