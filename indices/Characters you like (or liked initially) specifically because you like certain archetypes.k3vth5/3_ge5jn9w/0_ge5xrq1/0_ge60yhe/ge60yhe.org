I didn't think I'd have to disclaimer my post by saying, “I do not approve of torture and murder,” but I suppose this is the Internet so...

Kids: There is a difference between fiction and reality, and it is always important to remember that.

We may admire Bellatrix for being an empowered woman: super awesome at what she does, inspiring fear in those who stand in her way, and fully committing herself to living her dreams.

Unlike Bellatrix, however, if those dreams include torture, murder, or any other acts that would be considered felonies or misdemeanors under the California penal code, please check with a parent, guardian, school counselor, or other trusted adult first, before implementing your plans.
