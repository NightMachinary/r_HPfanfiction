I didn't think I'd have to disclaimer my post by saying, “Despite my disagreement with your statement, I am not a child“, but I suppose this is the internet so...

What I meant to say, since you seemed to have missed my point completely, is that while admiring a characters actions and what they represent are not the same. If you're looking for a “strong, independent woman“ who'll fulfill your feminist fantasies then you may just as well lay your eyes on McGonagall, who despite not needing a man to save her whilst also inspiring fear in her enemies, has avoided succumbing to insanity and debasing herself.

I know that it may be a far-fetched realization for someone such as yourself but you can find plenty of “empowered women“ which have avoided becoming blood purists, seeing as that's a rather bad example for a role model, which you stated yourself was what you were looking for in Bellatrix.

I mean, if you want to continue that train of thought, we have Umbridge, second only to Fudge in her incompetence, wielding power and living her best life whilst simultaneously not needing a man to save her. A great role model no?
