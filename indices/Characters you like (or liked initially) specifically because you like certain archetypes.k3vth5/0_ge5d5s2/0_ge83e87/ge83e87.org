That's a little stupid, but I never considered Dumbledore as arrogant, /because/ he can back it up. A lot of his lines should come as bragging, but because /he/ said them, it's just stating a fact. Considering the whole legend around the character, he almost sound humble.

As for Fleur, it may be because I'm a French myself, but she doesn't seem to be "that" arrogant. She often had a point when complaining (Scotland is cold, Scottish/ British food . . . exist, and a 14 years old should not be part of a Tournament prepared to put adult wizards at risk). Her worst (or best) moment was her Alpha bitch tirade at the end of HBP but . . . meh, standard hot french girl (or just standard hot girl?). Goes to Paris (or any big city) and you should find tens of girl like that (and they boy equivalent).
