Yeah, Dumbledore's bragging is subtle. "It was a guess, but my guesses have usually been good." Absolutely a fact, but the last part was not necessary. Another one off the top of my head is in HBP when he tells Harry to have his wand at the ready, but not to worry about being attacked 'cause Harry was with him.

I'm from New York City, so I know what you mean, but when I call Fleur an arrogant jerk I was more thinking about her sniffing at the Christmas decorations in GoF and taking shots at Molly during Christmas in HBP. She's not as arrogant as Dumbledore and James, but it's there.
