Arrogant jerks, especially the unapologetic ones who can back it up. The half-formed ideas I toss around always involve this type. There's a long list of them, either actual characterization or the idea of them, but my top 5 are Fleur, Dumbledore, James, and the Crouches. The only one here who routinely shows up in fics is Dumbledore and even the well-written versions often miss that element.
