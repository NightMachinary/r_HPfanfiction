I really love that idea.

> Snape was fired (after investigation) for being Neville's

As an adult looking back, it seems incredible to me that a teacher would be allowed to terrorize children to this degree. If my memory serves, Neville saw his parents tortured into insanity, but his teacher, a man entrusted with his care, was what he feared most. It's ludicrous that he should be allowed to continue teaching, regardless of his loyalty to the headmaster.
