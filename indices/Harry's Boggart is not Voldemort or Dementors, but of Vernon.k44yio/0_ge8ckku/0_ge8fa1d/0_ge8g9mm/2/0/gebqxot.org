According to [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Attack_on_Frank_and_Alice_Longbottom#cite_note-GF30-1][this Harry Potter fandom site]], Frank was kidnapped first, taken to an undisclosed location, and tortured to madness. Alice was later also kidnapped and tortured.

>Frank Longbottom was the first to be captured.[2] He was subjugated and imprisoned at an undisclosed location, before being heavily tortured by all four of the Death Eaters with the Cruciatus Curse... When he was unable to provide them with anything useful, they targeted Alice. She was kidnapped and tortured in the same manner.

I guess I had always just assumed that they were tortured at their house by Death Eaters who had broken in and that Neville was hidden away before they could find him. It is worth noting that the source the Harry Potter fandom site uses is a broken link to Pottermore. I briefly checked Pottermore for more on Frank and Alice but couldn't find anything substantial on their attack.
