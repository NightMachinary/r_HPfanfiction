I once read this fic that any person who becomes another person's Boggart is immediately arrested for holding, then investigated to the letter and spirit of every law on each and every applicable book. It isn't easy to become someone's Boggart. They literally turn into your deepest, darkest fear(s). Snape was fired (after investigation) for being Neville's, McGonagall investigated for Hermione's, and The Dursleys all arrested and put into magically enhanced non-magical jails and correctional facilities. Dudley became a better person and Vernon and Petunia were killed in prison by other prisoners for being child abusers. (Professionals have standards!) I think. Some of that might be conjecture or my own wish fulfilment.
