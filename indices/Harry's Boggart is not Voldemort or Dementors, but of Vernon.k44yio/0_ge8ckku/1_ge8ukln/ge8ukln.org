Harry is a fighter by nature, he fights against the things he believes is wrong.

He fights against Snape's mentality, he fights against Malfoy's bullying, he fights against Umbridge's teachings.

The fact that his so called "family" treats him the way they do, and yet he can't really do anything about it because he "has to stay there for his own protection" must eat at him.

I could see it messing with him. Even if we push the abuse a bit more then what it was in canon. As long as it isn't extreme like fanfiction likes to do. I'd love for a story that focuses more on him realizing what the Dursley's did to him was messed up and shouldn't have been allowed, I'd love a story where he has to try and trust, and open up a bit more, instead of just shrugging it off and constantly saying I'm fine.
