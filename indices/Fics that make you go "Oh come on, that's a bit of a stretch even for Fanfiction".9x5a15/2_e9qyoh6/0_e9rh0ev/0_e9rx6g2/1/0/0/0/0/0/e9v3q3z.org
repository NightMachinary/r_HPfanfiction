No, Legilimency would not have shown Draco to be a "perfect Death Eater" just because he's a textbook blood supremacist. Voldemort doesn't give a toss about blood supremacy. What he would look for in his followers' minds is loyalty and/or motivating fear in himself. Draco would have seemed a passable Death Eater because of his deep fear of Voldemort that motivated him to follow his orders, but far less useful than a truly loyal one, like he thought Snape was.

The idea that Snape participated in enough Death Eater operations to secure his position in the eyes of his peers was never in question. My argument is that the idea that there's some kind of horrible initiation rite where a prospective Death Eater has to commit some vile and unforgivable act just to prove themselves has no basis in canon. People crucify Snape under the tenuous assumption that he /must/ have raped or tortured /someone/ when he took the mark, when there's no evidence that he ever did anything of the sort. Snape is guilty of plenty of crimes, but people act like taking the mark itself is damning evidence of heinous deeds and should be punishable in itself.
