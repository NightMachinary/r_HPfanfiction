There's really no reason at all to believe that the Death Eaters have any sort of a standard "test of loyalty" anyway. Voldemort is (or at least believes himself to be) the most accomplished legilimens /of all time/. He can sniff out the tiniest hint of disloyalty from very nearly anyone just by looking them in the eye. Tests of loyalty are for lesser despots and muggle thugs.
