The level of loyalty they feel does matter. If Voldemort, using Legilimency, can sense a lack of loyalty, it means that at any point, said person can become erratic and behave in ways the Dark Lord can't control. And their reasoning doesn't even have to be "pure" (Severus) -- it can just be a matter of them working for their own interests (something I can totally see the Malfoys doing, even before Voldemort ended up punishing him endlessy -- hell, he even did, by messing around with a Horcrux), and suddenly decides to do something else if they feel Voldemort no longer gives them what they want.

I'm not saying that they need to be /devoted/ (Bellatrix), but they /need/ to possess a genuine loyalty.
