I think you're mistaking the hubris that unites all Death Eaters with loyalty. Draco thinks he's on the winning side. He thinks Voldemort is the most powerful wizard in history, and a pureblood with a very good pedigree. Virtually all Death Eaters share those beliefs. Snatchers share those beliefs. Everyone on Voldemort's side share those beliefs.
