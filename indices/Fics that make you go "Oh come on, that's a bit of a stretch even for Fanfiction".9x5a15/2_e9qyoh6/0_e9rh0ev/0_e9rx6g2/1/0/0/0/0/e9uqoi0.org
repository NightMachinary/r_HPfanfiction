I didn't say standard tests or some such, but they would undoubtedly have to be part of the team, so to speak. Legilimency is irrelevant, because that tells you their beliefs and emotions and such. Generally participating shows what they are actually willing to do in reality, when it comes time to show they really buy into the ideas. Just look at Draco, he was a blood supremacist and made the eminently clear. So a Legilimency use should show him to be a perfect Death Eater, right? Except when push came to shove he couldn't kill their greatest enemy, even if he had been willing to try indirect methods of murder and an Imperius. The idea that Snape didn't participate when he was a bona fide Death Eater, as some of his defenders try to suggest, is crazy.
