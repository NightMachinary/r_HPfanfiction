  No, Legilimency would not have shown Draco to be a "perfect Death Eater" just because he's a textbook blood supremacist. Voldemort doesn't give a toss about blood supremacy.

This is just untrue. Whether or not Voldemort personally put much stock in blood supremacy isn't the point, his organization was explicitly structured by and acted in accordance with that belief. Draco had all the history and beliefs that made him the perfect person to put in such a group. And Draco would have loyalty to Voldemort, there's no reason to think he'd deviate from his father's indoctrination (in fact, he outright says this at the end of GoF; the whole "you chose the wrong side Potter" stuff).

I didn't say there was an initiation rite, I quite explicitly said there certainly weren't any standard tests of loyalty, that's fanon. As an example, that (I think) Muggle Studies teacher executed at the dinner table in DH. Anyone not OK with that, not OK with killing whoever Voldemort commands (or whatever he commands in general) don't live long. But terrorist organizations, being inherently ideological in nature, don't promote diversity, so as you say it's just a fact that Snape would have done a bunch of horrible stuff.
