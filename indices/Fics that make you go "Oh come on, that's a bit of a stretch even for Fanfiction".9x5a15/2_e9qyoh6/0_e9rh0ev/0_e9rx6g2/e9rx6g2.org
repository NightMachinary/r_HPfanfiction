While I'm not trying to defend Snape's foolishness in his youth here, I can see both possibilities -- him being a complete asshole as a result of his dubious upbringing, taking it out on innocent victims by murder, rape and whatnot who deserves all the hurt he could get -- or him being a misguided victim by poor upbringing and school bullying who turned to the Death Eaters out of lack of other options for him, and who doesn't truly believe in the cause.

Whatever the case is with Snape specifically, I really can't imagine there not being any DEs with second thoughts, no matter what "fun" they performed.
