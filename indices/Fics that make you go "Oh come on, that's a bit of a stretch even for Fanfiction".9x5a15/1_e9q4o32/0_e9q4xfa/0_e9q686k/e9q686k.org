I haven't read Cursed Child and probably never will considering how much it gets panned by people on this sub, so I can't comment on that.

Regarding the Idiot Ball:

It does pop up frequently in canon so that kids can be heroes, as you said. In fanfiction I've seen it in almost every single time travel fic set during Riddle's Hogwarts years. It's the most common reason for me X'ing out of those fics even though I like the premise.

Regarding Deus Ex Machinas:

Technically the Elder Wand wasn't a Deus Ex Machina because a) it didn't pop up out of left field with zero foreshadowing and b) it wasn't used apropos of nothing as the solution to an insurmountable plot obstacle. The Deathly Hallows appeared in the previous books even if we didn't know what they were (a Chekhovs Gun style of foreshadowing common in the books) and Harry was mostly saved by being a Horcrux and having the "mothers love" protection.

In fanfiction it's a Deus Ex Machina if Harry defeats his enemy with an OP spell or ability that he was never shown learning or using previously and/or the convenient solution never makes another appearance in the rest of the fic despite having far reaching implications.
