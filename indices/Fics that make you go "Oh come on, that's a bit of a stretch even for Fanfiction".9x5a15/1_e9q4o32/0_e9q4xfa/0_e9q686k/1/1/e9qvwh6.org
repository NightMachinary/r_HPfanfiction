Deus ex Machina is a literary term, and thus it does have a formal definition. I go with the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina][TVTropes take on it]] though.

What you've described is an example of [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun][Chekhov's Gun]] style forshadowing. Foreshadowing is basically the oposite of Deus Ex Machina. The items that are the Deathly Hallows appeared in the earlier books. Their properties and the fact that they are Hallows was revealed long before the deciding moment in the final book.
