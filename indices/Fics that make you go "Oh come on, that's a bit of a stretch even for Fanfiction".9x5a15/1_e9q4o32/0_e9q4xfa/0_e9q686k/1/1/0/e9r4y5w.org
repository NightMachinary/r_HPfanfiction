Okay this comment is pretty incomprehensible to me, so I think we have a misunderstanding here.

1.) I don't think the Elder Wand is a Deus Ex Machina

2.) Having appeared earlier or foreshadowing are not qualifiers that make something "not a deus ex machina". If Harry had realized that his Holly Wand shoots a Death Ray when he squeezes it real hard, it would have been a Deus Ex Machina, even if the Holly Wand had been around for the whole series. Similarly it can be argued that the very technical properties of wand ownership, which allowed for Harry's victory, are a Deus Ex Machina.

3.) I know what Chekov's Gun means. It is unrelated to Deus Ex Machina - which was my point. A Chekov's Gun can still be a Deus Ex Machina.
