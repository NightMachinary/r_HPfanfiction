I meant the Deus Ex Machina bit was "Haha, Malfoy was the Master of the Wand and i disarmed him even though it had no relevance until literally the last second and he never once held the wand so all of Voldemort's planning was meaningless and surprise Superwand turns on him" it's still a cheesy ending.
