Oh. And here I sat believing that in that scene the only important thing was Voldemort trying destroy his own Horcrux. For me the use age of the Elder Wand was never of importance and only came really into it when Harry and Voldemort dueled in the court.

I would not say that it is Deus Ex Machina. It is set up to well and really does not come out of nowhere as much as it had to qualify as being illogical plot hole solution. It helps, that we already kinda know of its mythical proportions due to Dumbledore amassing slightly unexplainable magical feats in the previous books and long beforehand.
