My suspension of disbelief can always be stretched further. I can believe any plot element as long as the author sets it up and executes it well.

My suspension of disbelief only breaks when an author commits bad writing: flat characters, characters with inconsistent motives, characters handed the idiot ball to advance the plot, deus ex machina, etc.
