Any fic where Vernon Dursley rapes Harry or female Harry.

Like, I get that the Dursleys were verbally abusive and physically abusive in a mild sense (something we see when Vernon grabs Harry's hair and shoves him against the staircase in one of the movies, can't remember which).

But going from that to outright rape is such a stretch that your fic better be damned good to make up for your horrible premise.

That and literal Satan Dumbledore.

Dumbledore wasn't particularly responsible in his handling of Harry, but fics where Dumbledore is portrayed as this evil overlord just for the sake of "the greater good" is so infuriating.
