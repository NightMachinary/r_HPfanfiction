The first example that popped into my head was from Folie Le Deux, the fic that people claim is one of the more realistic and believable Harry/Hermione affair fics. It started off okay, the character writing was logical enough and reasonably paced. And then chapter 2 rolled around and Hermione walked in on Harry fucking Narcissa while giving dirty talk that was so over the top, it gave me flashbacks to the writing of Cloneserpents.
