  Nope. My Suspension of Disbelief doesn't go that far
#+end_quote

To be honest, most pairings. I can see Malfoy weaseling his way out of prison, but I can't see Hermione ever forgetting that he was in firmly Voldemort's camp and only bailed when he had to do the dirty work himself. I can't see Harry forgetting how Snape abused the Gryffindors for six years, even if he was a spy (which is why the epilouge breaks my suspension of disbelief) and so on. Hell, due to personal experiences I found it completly immersion destroying that the "ten dark years" confession never went anywhere. And admittedly, I have no clue how to resolve that without destroying Rowling's vision, but then perhaps she should have written it differently.

Overall, I have no issues with magic, SciFi tech, aliens and so on. But the characters are supposed to be the one connection to the mundane world, and if they forget war crimes in the blink of an eye or their parent's murder, then that goes too far.
