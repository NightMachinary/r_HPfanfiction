This is all based on an assumption that fanfics begin where canon ends. But, as we all know, that's obviously false.

Fanfics can begin wherever (even before Hogwarts), and the characters can change, grow, and develop, altering the course of events.

In fact, I seem to recall that recently you made an outline for a believable dramione pairing (tonks was heavily involved), which seems to be contradictory to your current stance.

Isn't it more reasonable to say that an author can make any pairing believable with good writing, plot, and character development?
