As I was told there and in a few similar discussions, my proposal would not capture the "unique character" of Malfoy but turn him into an OC with the same name.

Same for my Hermione/Bellatrix proposal (turn her immediately after Azkaban to avoid hard feelings). The Bellamione community is in for the dysfunctionality of the relationship (and the smut), not for something which could actually happen.

And since it still remains a concept (I might eventually write the Bellamione one since it is feasible as a oneshot), not something you can find on FFN or Archive, I stand by my point that it blows my suspension of disbelief. At least until something like this gets written (by the looks of it by me), at which point I will concede the exception to the rule. I asked more than once, trust me.
