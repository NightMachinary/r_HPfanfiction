Well I can't even relate to that "unique character" argument. I understand people have an attachment to characters, but even taking an early starting point (year one, for example), Malfoy is still a snobby prat with a bigoted attitude. He's Malfoy. And he doesn't become any less unique if the author forces him to change in a realistic manner.
