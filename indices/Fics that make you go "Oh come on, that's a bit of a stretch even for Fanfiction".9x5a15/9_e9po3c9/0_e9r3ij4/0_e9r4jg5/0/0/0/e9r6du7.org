Yeah, the "Sex God" line irks me as well... Of course, people have different tastes... Personally, I absolutely love Malfoy's character, because he is one of the few individuals in the series that can be a given a complex and believable redemption arc.

At its core, Harry Potter is fairly black and white: Good Guy Gryffindors vs. Sleazy Slytherin Snakes with a coming-of-age story wedged in-between. There's nothing wrong with that, I love the books, but by now I kinda wish there was a bit more complexity to the series...which puts me here in fanfiction, heh.
