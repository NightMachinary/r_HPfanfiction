  I absolutely love Malfoy's character, because he is one of the few individuals in the series that can be a given a complex and believable redemption arc.

What do you like about Malfoy's character in canon? There isn't much depth beyond being a bigot.

Maybe you are talking about his situation? Being the only son of the Malfoys and basically being pushed into a position of servitude to Voldemort, no matter what you'd want out of life.

These two are very different things and if you think the second one is what makes him interesting, then that's perfectly in line with what [[/u/Hellstrike]] is suggesting by turning him into an OC. When it comes to most Draco centric stories he - as a character - is unrecognizable to the one we see in canon. It's just a different character shoved into Draco's skin and his situation. Kinda a "Draco reboot", but authors who do this rarely seem to be aware that they are doing it.
