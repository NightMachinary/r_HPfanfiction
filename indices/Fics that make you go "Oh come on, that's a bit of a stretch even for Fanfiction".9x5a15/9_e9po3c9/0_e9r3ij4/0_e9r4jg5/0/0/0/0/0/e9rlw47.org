You're right, there's little to like about Malfoy in canon. But I enjoy reading about him in fanfiction, because, as I stated, he's in a unique position for a well-written redemption arc, and there are no other /major/ characters in the series (except maybe Snape, depending on your stance) that can fulfill that role.

Consider his character: a bully, a bigot, and a brat. And yet, he's not totally lost. He has the potential to become good. Fanfiction can explore that. It can present a story where Malfoy slowly starts to doubt his preconceptions and question his morals, placing him in the brutal position between the values of his family and the notions of what is “right”.

Now, such a story would obviously be a divergence to canon, but unless your stance on OC is that all fanfiction characters are OC by default, then I cannot agree that it replaces him with someone else.

Stories change characters, yes, but that's what stories are /supposed/ to do! Is Harry Potter in book 7 an OC, because he's changed and grown and matured from the boy he was in book 1? Of course not! He is still Harry Potter! In the same way, a story that presents Draco Malfoy's realistic change and growth (not just popping it on the reader out of nowhere; in that case, you're right, it is an OC), is still a story about Draco Malfoy!

And it's probably a wonderful story with a great redemption arc, and it is a pity there are so few of them.
