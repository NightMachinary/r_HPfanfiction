Lupin could use one after ditching his wife. Show him as loving, divorced father because they are underrepresented in fiction/media. It would also turn Tonks back to the BAMF she was in OOTP and not the mope-y pushover in HBP and DH.

You could give one to Dumbledore for the whole "ten dark years" thing. Although that one is just barely more believable than the war criminals known as Death Eaters.

My all-time favourite would be Bellatrix Lestrange into salty, ass-kicking anti-hero who culls the Death Eater ranks. And unlike Malfoy (or Snape) she actually served a prison sentence and did not avoid her crimes.

Or actually give one to Ron after the whole Horcurx Hunt. He might never get Hermione, but the world is not over if you don't get the childhood crush with absolutely no common interests. That would also add some depth to his character because now his actions have consequences instead of just getting the cold shoulder for a few days like in GoF and DH.
