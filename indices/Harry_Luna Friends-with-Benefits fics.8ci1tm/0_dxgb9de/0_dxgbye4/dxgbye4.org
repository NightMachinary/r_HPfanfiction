Luna is very hard to write well without making her character very different.

I've tried to write some H/L in the past but I don't think I was particularly successful. The closest I've come in what I actually still like is the one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10734495/1/Luna-s-Animal][Luna's Animal]], but that isn't what OP is requesting.
