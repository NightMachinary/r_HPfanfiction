My Auror OCs usually use a mix of mundane and magical ways. Interrogating witnesses (maybe with using pensieves), checking for clues, analysing spell traces and other evidence, etc., and trying to use logic to exclude polyjuice and similar means. I assume that while magic offers more options to conceal a crime, it also offers more options to detect a crime, so it evens out more or less.
