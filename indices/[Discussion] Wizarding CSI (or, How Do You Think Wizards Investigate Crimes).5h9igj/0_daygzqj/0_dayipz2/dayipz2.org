That stuff is really cool, but why not just feed all the suspects veritaserum? Failing that, have their interrogations done by Legilimens. Most fictions tend to put legal roadblocks into these though.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1795399/1/Resonance][Resonance]] is a fiction where Harry Potter is an auror trainee and they use spells in training to detect where people move and for tracking them. Granted in that fiction they don't do much investigating.

Really though, with the number of ways to determine if someone is lying or not using canon harry potter magic... the problem investigators would be solving is /finding//identifying the suspects. Once the suspect is found, baring some legal roadblock they can be fed truth serum and subjected to master Legilimens interrogation. Truth and guilt is easy to find given you have the person at hand.

A side note, I have never seen anyone take a wand at the crime scene and show it to Ollivander. After all, the man remembers every wand he has ever sold.

/After the greasly murder of 4 children... Junior Auror Potter discovers a 13 inch oak wand at the scene of the crime. Following ministry procedure he tags and bags the wand and returns it to the office. Shacklebolt later takes the wand to Ollivander to discover the name of the prime suspect./

/Now Harry Potter is given his first major assignment, track down the owner of this wand./

Yes I'm a horrible writer!
