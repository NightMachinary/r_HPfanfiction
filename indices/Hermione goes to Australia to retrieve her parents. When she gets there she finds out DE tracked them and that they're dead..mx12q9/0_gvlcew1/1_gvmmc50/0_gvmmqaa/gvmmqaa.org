That would be awkward when they turn up at the airport and realise they don't exist in any database.

Plus they were dentists, I don't know if it was a private practice but you can't just stop showing up to work and go to another country. You also can't just immigrate for an indefinite period of time and settle in a new country just like that. What happens to their old identities that just vanished ? Im sure muggle authorities would find it weird. Their old bank accounts are under their old names. It sounds like boring adult paperwork, but it's not as simple as modifiying their memories.
