We only ever saw the war from Harry's perspective, I guess it was what the author wanted. But at the end of the day he was ignorant of pretty much everything about the wizarding world, of the people in charge and other important factors. As a child I didn't really dwell on it, I was more interested about the trio and their adventures.

Years later stuck in quarantine and reading fanfictions made me realise the endless characters and point of views I had 0 idea about. Important turning points that played a big role in the war. It never was just about Harry, everyone in the wizarding world was affected.

How were things before the war ? Was the reaction to muggleborns the same? What did people think of James marrying Lily ? How did Voldemort gather followers? What made them join him while they knew nothing about his family tree ? What was the political aspect ? How was the old order of the phoenix ? Hermione's parents reacting to McGonagall's visit ? What happened to the muggleborns during that last year ? How were things at Hogwarts?

And endless questions.
