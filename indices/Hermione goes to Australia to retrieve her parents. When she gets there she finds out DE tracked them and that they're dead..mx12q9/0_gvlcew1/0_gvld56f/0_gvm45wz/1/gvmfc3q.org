JKR created a lot of interesting characters and never gave them more than 2 lines in her books. I would gladly read about Hermione's parents reaction to the wizarding world, or Black family drama, or get to know Andromeda and Ted tonks. But she'd rather write about Mrs Weasley and Ginny hating Fleur or give us details about Ron and Lavender. (Which lets be honest no one cares about.)
