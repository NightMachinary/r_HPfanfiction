While it's been awhile since I haunted the place, I expect that you'll probably hate Spacebattles as well if you hate DLP. I recall the place being largely a circle-jerk club for JoeHundredaire fanboys and they'd need a substantial overhaul to overcome that inertia.

Other sites, if you're into canon pairings, are [[https://www.phoenixsong.net//][phoenixsong]] and [[http://www.siye.co.uk/][SIYE]], both of which have a significant amount of content not found on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]. If you're into Harry/Hermione, some archives of the defunct [[https://Portkey.org][Portkey.org]] site are still around, which also had a great deal of content not found on the other sites.

You can find hgfan111's stuff on archive if you hunt around; there is also a lot that's not on the main fanfiction site.
