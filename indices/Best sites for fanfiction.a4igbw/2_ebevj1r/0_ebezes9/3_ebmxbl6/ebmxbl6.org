Lot of gen fic, and arguably the site with the best SI/OC fics. Very rarely is there romance, or angst apart from maybe one or two writers. Also fix fics, AUs, crossovers, and strong protagonists, but the level of writing is good enough that it doesn't really matter. Stories like Ashes of the Past (pokemon) and This Bites!(One Piece) are on spacebattles, as well as the Harry Potter fics like Seventh Horcrux and Realignment.
