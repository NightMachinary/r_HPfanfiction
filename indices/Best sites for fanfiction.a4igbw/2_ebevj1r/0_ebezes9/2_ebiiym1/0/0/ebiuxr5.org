Not really.

There's really only the one Fate character who gets dimensionally displaced, and his personality and abilities are pretty well explored. You might miss a non-critical reference or in-joke here or there and the "Dimensional Counterparts" will be more like well crafted OCs than an interesting spin on a familiar character but that's about the worst it will be.

Caveat: The interdimensional mishap that starts the whole thing relies pretty heavily on Fate knowledge. You can pretty easily just handwave it as "A wizard did it" though as it's not critical to the rest of the story
