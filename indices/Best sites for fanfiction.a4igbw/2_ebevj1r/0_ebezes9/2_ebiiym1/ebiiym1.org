It tends to have a Military Sci-fi/Action Fantasy bent, so expect stories and fandoms focused more on action and adventure than on romance and/or drama. I'm not so sure how active the HP fandom is on SB and SV as I gravitate more towards Worm, Fate, and Kancolle on those platforms, but there is a very good HP/Fate crossover, [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/reader][Swords and Sorcery]] that you may enjoy.
