I've read Sunset over Britain, wasn't super thrilled. I'll check out portkey. I'm honestly kind of surprised I never see these other sites; most of my story searches are through google and I only seem to get ffn results. I remember when I was younger I got more diverse sites (SIYE, hpfanfiction, even Wattpad) but now I just don't see them.
