Sufficient Velocity. It's one of the SB trio (Space battles, and it's 2 offspring, Sufficient Velocity (SV) and Queery Quests (or something like that, QQ))

SV focuses more on Worm fanfic and cross planar (MtG style planeswalker) stuff, which I've come to read a lot since finding the site.

Originally I heard of SV after Shade Umbrus that Ravenclaw fic was posted there.

BTW, to read faster on the site you can set the thread to 'reader mode' on one of the top bars, or navigate via thread marks. Note, these things didn't exist pre around 2015, so you'd need to read between comments before then.
