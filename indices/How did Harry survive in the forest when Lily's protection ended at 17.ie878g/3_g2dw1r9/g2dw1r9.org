I believe the explanation is that Harry's blood in Voldy tied Harry to the living world, like a pseudo-horcrux. It's not so much that the protection was still in place, but rather Harry's own magic affecting him. That way when the AK hit Harry and /willingly/ he brought about a new Lily-like protection over Hogwarts, or even renewing it.

At least, that's how I understand it.
