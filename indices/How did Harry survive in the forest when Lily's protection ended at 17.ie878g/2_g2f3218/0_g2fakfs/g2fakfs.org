Great explanation. So Harry's mastery of the Elder wand had no impact in him surviving at this point

For clarity: If someone other than Voldemort had killed Harry, would he still had been able to come back. Or is it a requirement that Voldemort did it.

Also, was this a one time thing? Could Harry had taken another Killing Curse from Voldemort and survived (assuming he was willing and didn't resist)
