There are two different things:

1. The power of Lily's sacrifice, which lives in Harry's blood. This is the power that burnt Voldemort in PS. When Voldemort took Harry's blood in GOF he gained that same protection for himself. The power was not gone, it was simply that Voldemort had it too.

2. The Bond of Blood Charm cast by Dumbledore on Harry, powered by Lily's sacrifice, which protects him so long as he is under the same roof as Petunia and calls that place home. This breaks when Harry turns 17 because once he is an adult, Petunia's home is no longer his home.

Dumbledore explains this in OotP:

  “But I knew, too, where Voldemort was weak. And so I made my decision. You would be protected by an ancient magic of which he knows, which he despises, and which he has always, therefore, underestimated - to his cost. I am speaking, of course, of the fact that your mother died to save you. She gave you a lingering protection he never expected, a protection that flows in your veins to this day. I put my trust, therefore, in your mother's blood. I delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative.”

  “But she took you,” Dumbledore cut across him. “She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.”

  “While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, while you are there he cannot hurt you.

The Charm cast by Dumbledore had broken by DH, but the power of Lily's sacrifice remained. (And conversely, when Voldemort took Harry's blood, he neutralised the threat of Lily's protection, but he did not neutralise Dumbledore's Charm).

As for why Harry survived, it was *not* because the Killing Curse killed the horcrux instead of him. This is a complete misunderstanding of horcruxes. The only way to destroy a horcrux is to destroy its physical container; it's impossible to kill the piece of soul directly. That is why Harry himself must die; his body must be "destroyed" (i.e. dead) for the horcrux to be destroyed.

The reason why Harry survived is explained by Dumbledore in DH: the fact that Lily's sacrificial power lived in Voldemort tethered Harry to life.

  “But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again, “and nobody died for me this time -- how can I be alive?”

  “I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”

  [...]

  “He took my blood,” said Harry.

  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”

  [...]

  “He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort's one last hope for himself.”
