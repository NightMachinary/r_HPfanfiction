Harry damnable luck but lily's protection wasnt completely nullified by voldy taking Harry's blood. He still had it but voldy just had a back door so to speak. Lily's protection didnt extend to the dursley house until Dumbledore enacted the wards after he left harry there. He says so himself in either ootp or hbp cant remember which.
