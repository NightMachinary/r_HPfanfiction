This is not correct.

Voldemort was able to attack him directly after he took his blood in Goblet of Fire. Honestly its the protection still holding on the house that doesn't make sense.

The reason the curse failed in Deathly Hallows is because a) Harry was the rightful owner of the Elder Wand, which refused to kill its master, and b) the spell therefore killed the Horcrux fragment instead, leaving Harry unharmed.

Harry lived because Malfoy happened to disarm Dumbledore, and Harry happened to disarm Malfoy. Basically, pure luck.
