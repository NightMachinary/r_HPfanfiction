Maybe have him be only good at select magic from each branch, choosing what seems pratical and ignoring the rest? He could like cheering charms and summoning charms but finds charms to make your silverware dance pointless. Transfiguring your physical equipment to best suit what sport your playing is pratical, but who needs to make a rock into a dog? Potions that help relax your muscle aches and strains are good, but draught of living death is a downer and pretty useless.

You get what I'm saying by now. He can be smart and athletic, but academically apathetic to things that don't affect his interests.
