Rowling's magic world is loosely based on western magicks, particularly magicks of thelema, where intent is everything. To have strong intent, you need to have strong mind.

If a character is physically fit, then he has more healthy mind, that means he has slightly better chances to have strong mind. So physical excercises may indirectly improve your magic.

Everything is connected. "Magically gifted" and "physically gifted" aren't exactly isolated.

Also, if your character is more physically gifted, then his body parts are more used to faster reactions, which gives him edge in duelling.

So, you can make your character average in magical subjects, yet deadly at dueling.

Also Potions, Astronomy etc. don't need that much of "magical aptitude". So you can make him good at them?

Finally, I want to ask a question. What is your defnition of magic?

Is it something that is present inside the wizards, witches and other magical beings/creatures...magical cores or mana etc. etc?

Or is it something that is ubiquitous in nature (like an electromagnetic field), but only wizards, witches and other magical beings/creatures can consciously/unconsciously sense it, manipulate it and channel it through them?
