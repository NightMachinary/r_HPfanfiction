That's a nice take on it.

The character I'm writing is, though still young, extremely intelligent. A genius, even, on top of being extremely athletic, so that already gives him the edge against other characters.

That's why I'm toning down his magic. He's not even supposed to be a wizard, but somebody did something and voila.

I guess my take on magic is that it is ubiquitous in nature, but only magical beings such as witch, wizards, magical creatures, AND magical “things” influenced by magic have access to it. Their access is limited to whatever is present within them (magical core, charms, casted spells, etc)

In this case, the character I'm writing isn't a conventional wizard with a magical core, but is more of a magical “item”.

Anyway, thanks for the answer!
