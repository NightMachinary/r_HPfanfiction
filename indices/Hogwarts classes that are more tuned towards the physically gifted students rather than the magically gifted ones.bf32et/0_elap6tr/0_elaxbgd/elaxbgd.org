  If a character is physically fit, then he has more healthy mind, that means he has slightly better chances to have strong mind.

I would suggest taking this and driving it even further.

Your MC is athletically gifted, so let him be "the youngest seeker in a century" instead of Potter. Now that he's on a Quidditch team with people years older (and much more physiologically developed) he feels /huge/ pressure to keep up. He starts doing pre-dawn runs around the Black Lake and early-dawn drills on the pitch and yadda yadda.

He gets his hands on Muggle books that relate to fitness and such (don't fall into the trope of "martial arts uber alles" but instead it's stuff like yoga and pilates and body weight fitness and such). The personal discipline and mental fortitude that it takes to keep pushing helps build his willpower, even if his IQ and magical power are still stagnant.

In a way, that's not all that different that Potter in canon. Not necessarily a magical powerhouse, but when it comes down to it, he can do remarkable things (win a battle of wills with Voldemort during the Priori Incantatem, repel 100 dementors with his Patronus, etc.). Show him stumble frequently in academics, but give him a few moments to really shine based on his willpower and perseverence.

Then, the place to really pull out all the stops is in the Triwizard Tourament. Make the MC a couple of years older than Harry, so he's able to enter legitimately. Gets mocked by friend and foe alike for thinking he even has a chance. And then... wonder of wonders, the goblet chooses him.

How does this new character deal with the Tournament when he struggles to even sustain a bubblehead charm? How does he stack up against powerhouses like Krum and Delacour? How does he react to Harry? Change the Tournament to make it actually interesting rather than the boring canon bullshit and you've got the bones of a really, really good story.
