I think Hogwarts is magic school what teaches magic, so none of the classes would be tuned towards physically gifted students. Just like there doesn't seem to be any tuned to artist, musicians and etc.

If you want to add more general curriculum to Hogwarts, I think most readers will welcome it. You can also add student sports clubs.

Or maybe you can have you character be torn between magic and potential sports career in muggle world.\\
Or you can invent am extra magic class. Something like Avatar martial arts style magic which is usually practiced in Asia or smth.
