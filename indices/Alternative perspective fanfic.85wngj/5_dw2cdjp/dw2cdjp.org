There's not a lot of these, at least that I've read, but here are the ones in my Favorites list.

Marauders' Era and the canon books from the professors' point of view (very funny): linkffn(4207913,4207913).

Slice of life of fifth year from McGonagall's point of view (even funnier): linkffn(3124159).

Seventh year from Dudley's point of view (serious): linkffn(7129525).
