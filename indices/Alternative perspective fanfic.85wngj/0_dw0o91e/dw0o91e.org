Fanfiction was definitely not what I expected until I started reading it. I haven't read too many stories that are simply different perspectives on the series but I will recommend A call to arms Linkffn(8078750) which shows an alternative perspective on Deathly Hallows, specifically what's going on at Hogwarts while Harry, Ron and Hermione are on the Horcrux hunt.
