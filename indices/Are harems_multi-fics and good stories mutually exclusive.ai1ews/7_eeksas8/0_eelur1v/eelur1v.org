  And maybe because he's a badass, he attracts a few girls who want to do him.

And he can have a lot of casual sex with these girls, it's totally believable. But actual relationships and marriage to multiple women? No woman would ever agree to that.

Actually, now I kind of want to see a realistic fic where various female characters end up in a harem due to forced bonding or marriage contracts or whatnot. Hermione researching the ways to get out day and night, and then taking up the cause of outlawing harems once and for all. Daphne taking a page from Mrs. Zabini's book. Susan using all her DMLE connections... The list goes on. And Harry wishing for the times when Voldemort still was his biggest problem.
