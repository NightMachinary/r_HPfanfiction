  the MC is treated as THE MAN for simply having said harem.

What is the alternative, really? Would a story about a wimp who gets a gaggle of girls be a better story? I've found this narrative of anti-Harry rhetoric over the last year very frustrating. I'm not opposed to reading stories where others are heroic, but maybe it's just me, but I like stories where Harry is a bit of a badass. And maybe because he's a badass, he attracts a few girls who want to do him. Also, on a similar note, when have we decided that there can only be one badass per story? A lot of newer stories have Hermione be all awesome and shite, but Harry is diminished in some way (Escape by Singularoddities, I'm looking at you). Why can't they both be awesome? I want to read /that/ story. (*sorry for the rant, it wasn't really pointed at you, your statement just got me thinking*).

I agree that a lot of Harem fics are contrived. They have to fabricate rampant bisexuality amongst the women simply to make it semi-believable. I'm not saying this can't be an enjoyable read, but it isn't realistic. There aren't /that/ many bisexual women out there, so the chances of all the women in Harry's life also liking women just seems unlikely.

But then, are harems realistic? The only real ones are in situations where the women aren't usually there of their own free will. +Or Mormons.+ So there's a reason why harems in fiction have to reach beyond realism in order to make it work.

I enjoyed Rune Stone Path (someone linked it elsewhere so I won't), but again, despite it being very well written, the author had to make all the women love each other too. There's nothing wrong with that, but it makes the situation more and more unlikely. I also enjoyed linkffn(Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble), as that was one fic where they didn't have to force the girls together to get them with Harry. Instead, they're all sisters. Granted, that's contrived on a whole other level as they had to shake some magic in order to get Hermione into the bond when it should have just been the Delacours.

In the end, the answer to your question is: it depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for uber-realism and believability, then no. If you can look past the things that authors tend to do in order to make harems happen, then yes. There are a lot of harem fics out there that I've enjoyed, but I don't point to them and say "that's realistic."
