  What is the alternative, really? (...) but I like stories where Harry is a bit of a badass.

You can have him a badass when tearing through the Death Eater ranks but needy for attention because he was deprived of love for most of his life.

You can make him inexperienced because if, for some reason, he ended up with Fleur, Tonks and Gwenog Jones, he is a 17-year-old virgin and the others are guaranteed to have some experiences when it comes to sex, relationships and life in general.

You can have him wary of the weight of the world and needing someone who can take the burden off him for a few hours. There is a saying that behind every great man there is a great woman, and while that is overgeneralised, you can certainly apply that to Harry.

And it would be more believable than OPHarry bitchlapping foes left and right before pounding his harem all night long.

  Why can't they both be awesome?

As someone who gets that kind of criticism in one of my stories, often it is not very believable for Harry to be awesome as soon as the story starts. I mean, unless you go with post-war, he has no combat training, no proper DADA education and he is struggling with silent casting. If you pair him with someone like Tonks, who went through years of Auror training, mastered the DADA course and was tutored by Moody, he will be lacking behind in pretty much every aspect other than balls, luck and the plot-armour against Voldemort. You can obviously train him up, but that won't happen overnight. Harry and Hermione would balance each other out, but someone like Tonks, Lily or Bellatrix (time travel is your friend) is bound to be stronger. So at least initially, he ought to be the weaker link. He can certainly outgrow that, but it takes time.
