Because no one has done that so far. DPSW has a really, really creepy undertone to it because Harry is basically grooming his own Harem. Rune Stone Path was decent but dove too deep into pureblood culture to justify the whole thing (because you have to marry everyone for some reason).

Emerald Coven was decent IIRC, as are "The Power of Seven", "It could only happen to Harry" and "Fugue", but all of them focus more on the porn than any deeper plot.
