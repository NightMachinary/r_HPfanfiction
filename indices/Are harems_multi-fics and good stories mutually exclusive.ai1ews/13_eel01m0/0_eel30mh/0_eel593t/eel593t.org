You can focus on the advantage at marrying those women's (political...) Maybe give each of the wives a personality and make them hate each other and not suddenly become bisexual. What I mean, is not to give Harry a harem if he doesn't need one. If a asexual!Harry finds it worth it to marry multiple women, then it should be a good harem.

On the other side, I'm just speaking theoretically.
