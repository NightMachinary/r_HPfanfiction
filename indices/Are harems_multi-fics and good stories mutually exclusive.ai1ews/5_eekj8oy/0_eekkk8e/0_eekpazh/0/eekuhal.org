  Saying Hermione would be happy with being "one of the wives" to a man she didn't even want to bond with is just breaking any suspension of disbelief faster than even 6000 level magical core ever could
#+end_quote

I'm not saying that she would be very happy, but it is a sacrifice she would be willing to make in canon, especially if you killed off Ron at some point. And while not into having Lavender riding her face, I can easily see a postwar reconciliation of the two which turns into a friendship, especially if the magical society decides to shit on Lavender for being a werewolf.

I also did not mention that there would be any lesbian shenanigans (although who knows what Harry and Tonks can get up to with some Polyjuice)

  I think I would much rather prefer honest porn to this kind of "realistic" justification.
#+end_quote

I agree. Porn should be porn and often those justifications ruin the story because they are too complicated/forced. But we are not talking about some "Harry bangs all girls" smut. The example I gave might not even result in regular sex after the ritual is done (or outside of it if it is an ongoing effort).
