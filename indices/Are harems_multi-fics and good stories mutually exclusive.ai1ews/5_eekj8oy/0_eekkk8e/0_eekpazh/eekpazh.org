I think I would much rather prefer honest porn to this kind of "realistic" justification. I don't see how any of this character could be anything but miserable in this relationship in your scenario, especially if they didn't even choose it for themselves. Saying Hermione would be happy with being "one of the wives" to a man she didn't even want to bond with is just breaking any suspension of disbelief faster than even 6000 level magical core ever could. Would you be as open to a fic where Hermione, Harry, Neville, Zacharias Smith and, I don't know, Adrian Pucey were forced together, regardless of whether some or all of them were into this kind of relationship or they actually were monogamous and straight?
