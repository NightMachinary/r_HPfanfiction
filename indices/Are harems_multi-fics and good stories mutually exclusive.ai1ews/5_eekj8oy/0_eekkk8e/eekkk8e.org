You can have a harem without turning Harry into Ã¼ber-chad. Say after the war there is some residual spell damage and Harry has to do some obscure ritual which binds three women to him or die. The end result is the same, but you lack the harem dynamics ("all women please the sultan"). Harry doesn't want it, Hermione not so much, but prefers it over Harry dying and uses emotional blackmail to make him agree because she doesn't want to bury a friend.

You could make it into a huge hurt/comfort arc with Hermione (whose crush died in the battle), Lavender (who is shunned as a werewolf) and Tonks (whose husband ran away after knocking her up and got himself killed). You don't even have to make the sexual part the central element and still end up with Harry married to three girls.

Obviously it would still be a little wish fulfilment, but honestly, we are discussing a world of magic. That has some wish-fulfilment by default, even before taking the triumph of good over evil for granted.
