While it's possible, of course, to write a good polyamory story, harem fics are a distinct trope/genre which is 100% unrealistic male fantasy that requires total character assassination and complete disregard of common sense. The difference is that in a poly fic all the participants in the relationship are treated as equals as the writer explores their relations with each other, while in a harem fic, there is the protagonist, THE MAN, and all the women he has as a prize. C'mon, does anybody really thinks that canon Hermione, for example, would stand for this shit?

It's also ironic that while marriage law trope is bashed to oblivion (and rightfully so), all the "marriage contracts" get a pass, despite often meaning basically the same thing for the participants. Probably because it's Harry the girl has to marry, so she'll be in love with him by Sunday anyway and completely OK with him having other wives, like she is from a country with Sharia law and not Britain.

I don't say that it's wrong to write this type of fic, but it's pure wish fulfillment that has little to do with good writing.
