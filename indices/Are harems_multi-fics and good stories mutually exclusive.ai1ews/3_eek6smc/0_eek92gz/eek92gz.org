  Harem stories generally aren't too good though since there are simply too many characters in the relationship to do any of them justice

I wouldn't say that four characters are too much to develop them sufficiently, especially if you take four somewhat established characters where you only have to show how they would adapt to the harem situation (say Harry, Hermione, Ginny and a wildcard like Tonks or Lavender).

I mean, from a narrative point there shouldn't be too much of a difference between establishing four characters in a tightly knit group and four characters who all are in relationships with each other. It's twelve interpersonal relationships either way. It certainly would be challenging, but certainly doable if you are willing to commit to a longer project (200k min).

5 would be worse and 6 near impossible (just look at how much canon interactions we have between Neville and Luna or Ginny and him), but 4 should be in the realm of the possible.
