Yeah, much weirder is that the 1st years of that world act a bit like adults with their extensive knowledge of wizarding culture and being heirs to Ancient and Noble Houses. It's kind of ridiculous, but really well-written and enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously. Maybe it's the complicating planning, the secret identity thing going on, or the revenge scenario in similar vein to The Count of Monte Cristo, but it appeals to me much more than the romance/harem part. That's just a bonus.
