A bit late, but Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches is the only one I've fully read so far, and none has managed to top it since. It helps that it is regularly updated to this day and the author is very self-aware with the story and is clever in handling the cliches, lore, world-building, magical system, politics, and the overall direction of how the story started and where it is heading. They also made the girls well-written characters in their own right that are actually competent people, and it pleases me to no end that there is no repeated explicit bashing of any characters in the story.
