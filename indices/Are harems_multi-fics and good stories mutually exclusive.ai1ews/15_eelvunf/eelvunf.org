harem/Multi fics usually share the same point of views when dealing with such relationships and suffers from overuse of the same cliches and that is why, I think they are so reviled.

​

Also, the authors tend to lazily address such issues and place very little focus on their writing.

​

But yes, it is possible for an author to go and write a very good multi fic without cardboard and adoring female characters, or to have a harem fic where the world does not revolve around the amazingly manly male character. ( Btw, you can also read some parodies that are pretty good or crack fics and have a blast.)

​

I really, REALLY like the Cult of Dionysius , as the author created a whole A-U about Harry having strange powers and where his multi relationship is a natural consequence of the plot. Harry and the girls struggle with the idea of a multi relationship and when they start with it they are very young, but it is not a smooth sailing and they keep having problems in how they behave towards each other, the rules they want to establish etc...

​

The author also has a couple of other fics that deal with such issues in other settings, but read and see if you like his style:
