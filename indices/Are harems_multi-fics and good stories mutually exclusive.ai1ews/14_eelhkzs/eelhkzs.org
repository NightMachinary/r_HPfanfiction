Well, No. I've not read maybe good harem fics, but I â€˜have' read a few of significant note. There are so many fics out there that atleast some of every category are great, no matter your preference or opinion. I've learnt that if you've not found a good one yet, you've just not looked hard or long enough.

Though it depends if you count threesomes as harems, I can even think of a noteworthy threesome fic off the top of my head; it's a trilogy, in fact.
