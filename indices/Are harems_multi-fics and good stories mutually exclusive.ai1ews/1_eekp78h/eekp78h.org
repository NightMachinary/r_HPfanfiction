It is possible, though requires more skill than most fanfiction authors have.

If you take elements from Imperial Chinese harem systems and adjust as necessary for the social mobility (inside the harem) that you want and the lack of actual Imperial titles, you can have any number of individuals jockey for positions of prestige in the harem. Lots of internal strife that may or may not be hidden from the focal point, and even to the public at large. Where securing an invitation to a party or as a speaker at some conference or whatever before the other spouses can is all a ploy to help them be considered the primary spouse

Alternatively, the harem itself can be the driving force for the conflict. Like, if you have a harem with at least one pureblood, one halfblood, and one Muggleborn (especially if the Muggleborn is the focal point of the harem), that's going to send the traditionalists into a hissyfit. Perhaps enough to make them take rash actions to take the harem apart by force of politics and law, discredit all of them socially, or hire extralegal problem-solvers (read, assassins).

A third problem is audience: people who look for harems don't tend to appreciate the plot that gets in the way of sexy times, and people who look for plot don't tend to look for harems.
