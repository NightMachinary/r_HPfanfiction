There are exactly two fics that I can honestly say I read through till the end and actually enjoyed that were multi. Here goes:

linkffn(13059856) - has a good start, but is currently not updating and stops right before the multi can visibly happen, but up till that point, the people actually involved in the multi are reasonably fallible and human. No OP mega-masculine power wank. Triwizard AU fic.

linkffn(12501270) - is a four way soul bond fic. okay, I lied, I haven't read the last 2 chapters or so, but up till that point, not a lot of smut (none at all) was going on, and the fic focused on developing the relationships between all four people in a pace that was comfortable for the people involved.

In case you are looking for well written straight up harem fics, I can't help you there :/
