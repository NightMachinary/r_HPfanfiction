Honestly, most stories on that list are unbelievable by virtue of chosen partner. I mean, Fred or Molly's brother would do, but Crouch Jr? Lestrange? Hermione would rather take cyanide than touch the men who worked towards the systematic extermination of people like her. The Death Eaters were literally magical Nazis and she was their "Jew" equivalent. Such pairings are basically Anne Frank/Heinrich Himmler, but with magic. Even discounting all the atrocities and murder, they would be out just for their involvement in Lily/James death, the parents of her best friend by association alone. And that whole Longbottom business. Don't get me wrong, the idea has some merit, and I am a sucker for the whole "it's always the quiet ones" trope this builds on, but the partner choice is, well there is no polite language to properly express my opinion on that.

Also, reverse harems mess up succession/inheritance considerably, especially if you have more partners than children. A woman popping out 10-20 children is way worse for her health than 10-20 women popping out one or even two each. I mean, given that a pregnancy lasts 9 months and you need some recovery time afterwards, it would not be an effective tool for repopulation.

Why would Hermione even agree to that in the first place, you can simply marry muggles and have them repopulate the world? Hermione wouldn't care about potential blood purity and given that she brought down one inhumane Ministry already, she would be the one leading the charge with the Red Banner of the Revolution, not bending over and taking their laws which violate countless human rights.
