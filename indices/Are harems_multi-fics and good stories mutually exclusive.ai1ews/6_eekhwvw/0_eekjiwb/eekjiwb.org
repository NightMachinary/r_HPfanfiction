You can go for subtler changes, like children accidentally forging magical marriage bonds akin to unbreakable ones by accident (and magical children being taught not to do so). Say, Harry, Hermione and the Patil twins end up in the same kindergarten/elementary school and they "play" wedding. They exchange the vows and forget about it until a decade later when someone checks the Ministry paperwork in the aftermath of the war and finds three magical marriages for one Harry Potter.

One of the biggest issues I see with harems is that quite often, they are "fuck or die", which is not a good base for a relationship. So the whole marriage law spiel is a no. Similarly, I don't see Harry caring that some magical family would die out if he doesn't take a second/third/fourth wife.
