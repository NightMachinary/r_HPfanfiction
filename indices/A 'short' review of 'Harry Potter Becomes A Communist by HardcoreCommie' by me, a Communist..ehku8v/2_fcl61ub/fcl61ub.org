Damn sounds like a fic where I actually might like and agree with Dumbles for once, privatizing education and capitalism who knew the who ole twinkle eye had it in him.

Now I won't talk about how I abhor communism on every level or the multitudes of reasons it's failed every time it was implemented, but if I were going to write a fic like this I imagine the most logical choice of an enemy should be Lucius Malfoy. Pretty much for the sole reason that he is probably the single richest person in wizarding Britain, and to not have him as the ultimate enemy in a commie fic seems like a missed opportunity.
