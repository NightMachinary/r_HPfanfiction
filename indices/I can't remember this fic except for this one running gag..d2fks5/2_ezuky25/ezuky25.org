Ooh! Ooh! I know this one!

I believe you're thinking of Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion, by Driftwood1965.

linkffn(5483280)

Harry learns that if he is too sick or injured to serve as champion, then he can pick a substitute. So Hermione injures him and he picks Ron, thus allowing Ron to shoot for wealth and glory.

If I remember correctly, Draco keeps getting caught in Ron's problems, which causes Lucius to question whether the boy could possibly be related to him.

And everyone lives happily every after.
