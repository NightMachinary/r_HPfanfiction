Not to our knowledge, and if anyone ended up like them, I think that's the kind of information Neville would mentioned to Harry when he gave him an overview of the situation.

Even if the Carrows were terrible human beings, they were limited into what they could do for most of the year. The students still present at the school were not "trash" they could play with, but young witches and wizards "of good stock" that had to be raised into good little puppet for their new regimes. Snape was also there to keep them under a fairly short leash.

According to Neville, they only went all out with the punishments after the Easter Holidays, when Harry escaped once again from Voldemort clutch and the situation worsened for the bad guys. And when they went all out, the students in danger managed to escape them and join Neville into the RoR, so even if some of them were hurt, nobody was killed or turned insane.
