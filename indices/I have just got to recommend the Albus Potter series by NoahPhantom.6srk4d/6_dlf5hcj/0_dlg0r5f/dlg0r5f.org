Same. I think I read 2 and a half books, and then I just couldn't do it anymore. I really like the idea of the Muggle World finding out about wizards, but it just sort of happened...and it wasn't as exciting as I would have thought. Plus, Albus was annoying. Gotta give the author props, though; he wrote seven books and FINISHED them. Not many authors do that.

P.S. Also, I like your flair. Not sure if it's a reference to the new John Green book or the infinite regress problem, but still cool either way.
