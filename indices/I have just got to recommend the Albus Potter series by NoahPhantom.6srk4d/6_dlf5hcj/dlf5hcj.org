Eh, in my honest opinion, it tries too hard. Nearly every Chapter has some form of exposition in it that they couldn't let you know with flashbacks (why wasn't first Chapter the Duel with Inget so we didn't just get Harry giving exposition about everything?)

Next there are the annoyingly over specific descriptions and the annoying lack of creativity. It tries too hard with the whole 'new cool' wand things, to the point where it got annoying after Albus' sorting.

There is no tension, no build up, no reasoning, just spontaneous moments.
