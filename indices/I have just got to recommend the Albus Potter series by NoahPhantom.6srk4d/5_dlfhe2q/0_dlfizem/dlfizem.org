The author admits that Albus is a Gary Stu but he starts becoming a bully and a jerk in book three. Everybody calls him 'perfect little Albus Potter' as a nod to his Gary Stuness. He's also too nosy.

The first book was slow but it gets better. I think it's because of all the child prodigies and Desulgon is ridiculously OP but he serves a better role later. I was honestly surprised by him. He was/is my fav.
