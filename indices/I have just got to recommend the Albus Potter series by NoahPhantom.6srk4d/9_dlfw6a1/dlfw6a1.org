I look at it this way. I have to decide the stories to read and the ones that not good. The best way is the Favs and Follow numbers. They, in my mind, is the best way to see good stories. If a story, after 3, 4, 6, 8 years, has only 200-400-600 Favs or Follows, there is a reason most time. So in this case NoahPhantom published book 1 of his series on Oct,2012. that's 4.5 years ago and he has Favs:467 and Follows:229. And that is his best one, the other's have very low numbers.

Book 2 Favs:268, Follows:134, Book 3 Favs:300, Follows:192, Book 4 Favs:308, Follows:220, Book 5 Favs:227, Follows:188 Book 6 Favs:203, Follows:168, Book 7 Favs:226, Follows:280.

I admire that you like NoahPhantom and his series so must, but in my mind there are more series and stories to read first.
