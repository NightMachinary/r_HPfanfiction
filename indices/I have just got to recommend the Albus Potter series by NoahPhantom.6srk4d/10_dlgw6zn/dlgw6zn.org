I am glad you found something that you can identify with and fall into with delight. I have never tried them nor probably never will because I read Harry Potter fan fic for, well, Harry Potter. I am not interested in next gen nor any of the other stories with a tertiary canon character as a primary focus as the stories are inevitably an OC set in the Potterverse. I also will probably never read Alexandra Quick for the same reason.

There are many good stories that never gained a following or the buzz needed to make them popular. The lack of popularity isn't necessarily a comment on the quality of the fic, nor is the inverse true. Enjoy what you enjoy.
