Oh, thanks! =)

I know that Harry and Percy are similar in personality except that Percy is funnier and more extroverted. I also heard about the playful style of writing.

I've never actually watched the movies but I heard that they were too awful.

Again, thanks! I'll definitely check them out once the Harry Potter obsession had died down a bit. I've honestly only read the Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children series after the books and I can't get through another book. Everything seems too...boring in comparison to Harry Potter. I don't know, maybe it's because it's the first series that I truly got invested in.
