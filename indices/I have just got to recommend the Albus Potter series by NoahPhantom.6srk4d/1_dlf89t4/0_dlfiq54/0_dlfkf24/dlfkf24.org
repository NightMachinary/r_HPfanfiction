Oh yeah, I definitely wouldn't judge the series based on the movies, haha. It's been a little while since I've read the books, but I think that if you like Harry Potter, you may like that series as well. However I would like to point out that the tone is definitely a lot more playful than HP. Also, if you've read Homer or other epic poetry, the theme of a long quest with many trials will stand out as a very prominent part of the entire series, which makes it quite entertaining and exciting in my opinion. This is why I think the Albus Potter series that the OP recommended reminds me of the Percy Jackson series.
