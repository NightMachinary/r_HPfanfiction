I like it. I'm about to finish book 5 but I think it focuses way too much on magic and stuff than the characters and there too many child prodigies for my liking (Alec, Aidan, Albus, Lucas, Rose). The plot twists are good but some are a bit predictable and the OCs are interesting and believable (Desulgon, Wilcox, Exo, Eftan). They're all complex. It introduces new things too and they're all believable and they fit easily into canon.

Overall, I like it and I highly recommend it.
