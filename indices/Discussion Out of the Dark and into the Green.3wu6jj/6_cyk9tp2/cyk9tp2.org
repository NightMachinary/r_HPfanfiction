I just finished up everything today and I have to say I really like it.

I do agree with the idea that too much time was put into his relationship with Al for him to drop off like that. I do hope he comes back (and maybe even Harry helps him get his magic back, or at least we find out the story behind how he lost it, maybe from Sirius?)

I do like the dynamic of him growing up away from the wizarding world but still finding his magic. I am also intrigued to see how his moral compass continues to evolve as the story progresses.

Overall I was pretty bummed to not have any more of this story to read lol.
