I had the same feeling. it started slow and I wasn't sure where the plot would go. What chapter are you on? Chapter 12 is where things get moving. Sirius, Dumbledore, Lucius, Voldemort and the Tri-Wizard tourney come into the plot.

 

What I like about it: Harry running off and accidentally finding a mentor has been done a lot of different ways, some of them pretty cliche. In this fic the author takes the time to develop the relationship, it has realistic flaws, the author uses a little known canon character and weaves a good story about his history. Harry is just this kid, he learns magic but isn't a genius or ninja assassin. I felt the chapters with the muggle interaction were good. It was used well to develop Harry's moral outlook and leaves him conflicted about what he's done. Chapter 13 or 14 is where Harry really gets dropped back into the wizard world and Voldemort, and the author did a good job portraying how how freaked out Harry would be with all of these people knowing about him when.
