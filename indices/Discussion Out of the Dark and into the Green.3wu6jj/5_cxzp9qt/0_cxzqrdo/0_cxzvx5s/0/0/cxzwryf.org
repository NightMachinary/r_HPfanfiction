I've read everything written so far, so I must have forgotten or not read or misremembered something. Time for a re-read, I guess. I have it on update notification on ff.net, so I'm fairly sure I've read the latest unless the author published elsewhere like DLP or something.

Edit: I remember Sirius offered to delay the wand search, but delay isn't halting forever.
