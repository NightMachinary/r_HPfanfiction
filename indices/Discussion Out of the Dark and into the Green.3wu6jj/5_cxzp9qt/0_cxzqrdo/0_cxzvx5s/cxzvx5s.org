For me there was a bit too much time spent on the mentoring relationship for Al to just die like that. I'd rather have had him survive and pop back up with Harry or else it not have focused so much on their life together. I've read everything that's been written so far, and the place Harry is in right now is a bit scary. he just refused to sign because they had no evidence, BUT he's forgetting there are two killing curses on his wand and he's guilty of other stuff. If they search his wand or background they're going to have evidence.
