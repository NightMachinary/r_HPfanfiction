Then I don't recommend reading it. Actually this fic is pretty old and full of tropes and has a bashing group (oh no, not only Dumbledore and some Weasleys, but also your Filch, Flamels and, if I remember correctly, Seth from mythology. Are you impressed?). It was just one of the first fics I've read and I'm a bit fond of it, it has an interesting plot (including Atlantis and the whole Seth thing) but, oh dear, how many tropes are there... and OOC too...
