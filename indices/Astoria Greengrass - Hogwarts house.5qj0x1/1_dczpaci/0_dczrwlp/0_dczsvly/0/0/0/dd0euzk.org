Fair nuff. I don't either tbh, in that I don't consider the whole time-turner events to have happened. Especially considering Rowling's comments on the creation of Time-Turners and the problems they caused.

In fact, time travel gives me such a headache, I prefer to pretend that /so many/ devices for time travel didn't exist. Or that Hermione, a 14 year old, wasn't given one, unsupervised. I like stories where the turners can only do five, six, seven, or eight hours in a day, and thus, aren't really useful for anything but overambitious students and Unspeakables experimenting with paradoxes. Even eight is pushing it, tbh.

Given Pottermore's article on them, I'm amazed a play was written with people travelling so far back. Almost the entire cast it seems went back to see James and Lily alive!
