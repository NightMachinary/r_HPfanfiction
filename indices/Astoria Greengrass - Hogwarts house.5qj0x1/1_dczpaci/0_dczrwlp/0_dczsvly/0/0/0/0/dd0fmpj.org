Yeah, I see it exactly the same way. The worst is that CC uses so many ff-tropes, and does it so badly. I just glance over it, really.

Also, it doesn't really change anything I wrote, because what you say differs from what you think, and that again differs from what you act unconsciously, see racism and sexism. A lot of people aren't consciously racist / sexist, but still act that way. I'd believe Draco would still kinda act that way - especially in choosing a partner for life. Maybe he can 'police himself' for most of the time, but I doubt he can influence who he falls in love with. And I doubt his sub-conscious would allow him to date a muggleborn.
