Yeah, while he doesn't really consciously believe in the idea of blood-purism anymore, I still don't think he'd want to dirty the line. He unconsciously will still be judging people based on blood for a long time - it takes time for a habit like this to go away, and that would make finding a non-pureblood wife hard. If you dislike something about someone, and can't even admit it to yourself, you wouldn't fall in love with them.

So he finds the next best thing - a non-traitor pureblood, who understands him, and shares his view.
