Do with her what you want / need her to do. Canon gives no info, so it's your character to craft / form.

Figure out what Malfoy would look for in his wife, and start from there. My personal analysis:

- Malfoy always wanted to be accepted. He wouldn't want to piss of all his old buddies, so that basically eliminates Hufflepuff and Gryffindor.
- He'd also want a pureblood wife. He was raised for 17 years in the belief that blood is important, he wouldn't want to be the one to dirty the Malfoy line.
- Malfoy would want a smart wife. While I think he toys with the idea of a dumb trophy-wife he sees the advantage of a smart and powerful witch by his side. His mother saved his life twice by being smart (Forest, Unbreakable Vow). He also had enough of Crabbe and Goyle.
- Now that a big part of society hates him he'd probably like a non-Slytherin wife, simply to dispel rumors and kinda redeem himself.

I think these personally would see her in Ravenclaw for that reason. He has an in with her (Slytherin Daphne), she'd be smart, not too dark of a family, Ravenclaw, neither Slytherin nor Gryffindor, magcially powerful, pureblood.

All together in my head she's now Ravenclaw, or /possibly/ a Slytherin.
