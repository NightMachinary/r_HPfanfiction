I see it as two camps. If it's ever canonically revealed, the choice would probably be Slytherin because that's the obvious choice for someone who marries Draco, or something else, because JKR would do that just to shake conventional wisdom with perhaps some fan pandering and whitewashing thrown in on the side.

Personally, I do find her being in Ravenclaw slightly more interesting. The idea of someone possibly still following older ideals (blah blah pureblood tradition, etc) but not being in Slytherin can maybe lead to an interesting plot (usually doesn't). Alternatively, perhaps she sees her sister in Slytherin, and decides that's not who she wants to grow up to be, she sees the isolation and bigotry or whatever fanon people throw in.

I think I wrote her as a popular Ravenclaw in my most recent story but I can't honestly remember.
