Honestly, because of her family I would say Slytherin. Daphne was a Slytherin and according to the information I know, she and Draco both changed their views on blood purity after what they saw during the war. This tells me she (most likely) held the same bigoted blood purity beliefs as other pureblood families, likely making her a Slytherin.
