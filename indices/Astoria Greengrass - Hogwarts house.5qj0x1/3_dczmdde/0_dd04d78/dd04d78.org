A Gryffindor would never have married Draco. He was an arse all through his school years, finding a girl who'd overlook that, in Gryffindor, his main target, would be difficult. The same reasoning applies to Hufflepuffs, or maybe even more so, because they'd be loyal to the bullying targets, like Justin.
