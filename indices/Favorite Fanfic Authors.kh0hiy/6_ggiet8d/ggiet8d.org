Ffn.net links I think are down at the minute so they might not work... Just as a warning...

Some of my favourite authors (They're all Ao3)::

Flamethrower :::: writes very intricate and detailed plots with so much foreshadowing and subplots and politics and eugh. It's juicy. Everything they've written is fantastic.

Marie Kavanagh::: Focus's on the Black family and really has them down to a T. How they understand the family dynamic, how she portrays so much in such small gestures and comments. Mostly Young Sirius so you really get to see how and why he grows into who he is.

MissKingBean69::: Focus's in young Marauders. She has such a great grasp on their personalities, really letting each character be individuals and with their own motivations. And she can write an OC like no one else. It's incredible.
