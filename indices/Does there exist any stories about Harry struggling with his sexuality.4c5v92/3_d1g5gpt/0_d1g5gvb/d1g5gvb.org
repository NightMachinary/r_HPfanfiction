  Jaffar lifts the automaton's chin and admires him as he used to admire his own mirror image as a youth, but this is so much better, so much more fulfilling than a mere reflection. It is because he is gazing upon an improved version of himself--yes, he has dared improve on God's creation, the piquant arousal only blasphemy can bring now curling up his spine, licking at his groin. He has taken the liberty of erasing a few wrinkles, of straightening the teeth a little, of making the doll's hair a little thicker, fuller: and what surprises Sarosh hides underneath his robes, oh--Yassamin shall find out soon enough.

  Pleased with himself, the image of himself, Jaffar chuckles, unable to resist the temptation of a kiss. Jaffar builds a silver replica of himself as a birthday present to Yassamin. But it would be foolish of him not to test the doll first, would it not? Only to make sure everything is in working order, of course.
