  War was never something that was finished in a day, but for Harry Potter, his life seemed to fall apart in one.Death's master was not a title anyone would want if they knew the consequences, but Harry didn't know this, being busy with his trying to stay alive in the midst of a war.So when the Hallows claim him as their Master, what's he to do but go a little insane?
