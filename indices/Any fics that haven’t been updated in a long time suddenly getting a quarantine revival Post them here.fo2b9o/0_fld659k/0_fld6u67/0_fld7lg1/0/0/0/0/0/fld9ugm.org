Aah ok. So that did kinda happen with a character in Bespoke Witch (but was completely justified and well fleshed out, not 'bashing' as such). I won't say who as to not ruin the plot if you ever decide to read. It was only one character too, and the people around them are supportive of them (should mention, Bespoke Witch is a Hermione is wife to House of Malfoy story, aka both Draco and Lucius, but not in a threesome way)

So far in Rivers that not any sort of bashing that I can tell will happen. Hermione / Draco and all the characters around them are very realistically flawed and hurt as they should be after a magical war. And it ain't 'pretty flaws' in all honesty.
