#+begin_quote
  In attempting to stop Sirius from falling through the Veil in the Department of Mysteries, Harry goes half through it himself before being dragged back into the living world. After the battle, things should have gone back to normal...but they don't. Something about Harry is changing, and he doesn't know why, what to do about it, or just what it means for his future confrontations with Voldemort.
