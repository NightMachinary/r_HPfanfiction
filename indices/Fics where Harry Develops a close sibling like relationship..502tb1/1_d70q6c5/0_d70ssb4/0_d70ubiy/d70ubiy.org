I enjoyed it, a more well adjusted Harry, who isn't a super harry despite having more training than in canon, the characters, especially Minerva and Albus seem more human than in some other fics- it's not a bashing fic despite the premise of Minnie going being albus's back to give him a real family.

The original characters- Harry's family- relatives of Minerva, are actually fully fleshed characters- they feel like real people, which is rare in Harry fanfiction, and the American magical world doesn't seem like a cheap rip off of Diagon Alley and Hogwarts, but a fully developed American magical world..
