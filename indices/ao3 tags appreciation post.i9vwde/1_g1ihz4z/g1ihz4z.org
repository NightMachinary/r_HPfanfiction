I wouldn't read a fic with those tags, cause I don't fancy much smut, but yeah it sometimes can be quite amusing to read the tags. Problem of potions has ‘Professor Snape is still a terrible teacher' ‘he's lucky Harry has such low standards'. But tagging every single character that appears is really annoying because sometimes that character appears for only 1 chapter
