I can't speak for all writers, but there have been a lot of discussion about this on the Drarry Discord. Some people post to have a personal record of their progress with the craft, some to share with friends, some to mark the completion of something. A lot of people there post to be part of the community, and only really care if the other community members read, and what they think. I know very few people who agonise over what strangers or non-writers think. We were actually talking today about how nice it would be to restrict access to your works to only certain users, like back in the livejournal days. Back then you shared with a select community not with everyone, so it was easier. No one felt entitled to what you'd written. Now there's so many people who think it's okay for them to throw their opinions at a writer because 'you did this in public', even though the writer had only posted for the intent of sharing with friends. I've even had friends approached, and asked 'Hey, i like your writing, can you write a fic for me with this and this?' By complete strangers. I don't know where that level of entitlement comes from. I've also had a friend publish chapter 2 of a 15 chapter work, and someone came along and told them that if she was doing A, then her premise was weak and she should do B instead. It's like... why do you think this needs to be said?

As for me, in general I guess I care about my readers if they seem nice, but the ones who whine that I haven't catered to their whims... they're a joke. Why would I worry about their opinion? Same as people saying they don't like my outfit -- i didn't get dressed in the morning for their benefit so why are they bothering me with their problems? It might be hard for Gen Z to understand, but not everything used to be so public. People used to bother other people less. It was nice.

I hope that answers your question? Please do feel free to seek clarification, I do find the topic interesting.

(As an aside, AO3 has only just made it possible to turn off comments. Last week I think. Previously all you could do was untick them being sent to your inbox or email. I wish turning them off had been an option while I was still writing fic! That said, you're right, I can now go turn off commenting!)
