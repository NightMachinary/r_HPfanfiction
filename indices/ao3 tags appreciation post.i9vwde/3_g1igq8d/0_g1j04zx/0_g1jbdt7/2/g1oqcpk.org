Tags are for finding shit and to filter stuff you (don't) like. They are not jokes or one-liners, you have the description and the whole story for it. For every tag, ask yourself if that is something more than 1% of your readers would search for.

Rather than "Harry and Hermione are together", "but it's only an act", "but they might catch feelings", "who knows", "I do", "but I am not telling" that hypothetical fic should merely be tagged as "Harry Potter/Hermione Granger" (from the relationship category, not freeform) and "pretend relationship", maybe "friends to lovers" if that's the angle the author goes for.
