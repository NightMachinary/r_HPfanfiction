Some writers don't care about you though, they're writing for themselves. And no fanfic is "necessary" so I don't know why you're annoyed at a writer for doing something you don't like. They didn't do it for you. It's only a "problem" for people who feel entitled to things, and if you'd skip a great fic like Nightmare Club (I recognised 'sentient doors') because you had to scroll down, then good, you don't deserve it.
