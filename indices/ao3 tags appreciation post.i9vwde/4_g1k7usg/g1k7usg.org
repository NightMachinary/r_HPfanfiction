I probably overtag because I don't read or care about tags at all. But I know that fandom (specifically the Drarry fandom which is what I write for) expects a fairly comprehensive level of tagging. I don't get it, I don't care about it myself, but it's no skin off my nose to tag and potentially make my fic a safer reading experience for the kind of people who do need tags. If it was up to me I'd probably just put the main pairing and whether they bone or not, and whether they die or not, but I get that this is a fandom convention now so happy to go along with it.
