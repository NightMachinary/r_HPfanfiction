I can't remember where I first saw it, but I ran across "Ninety-five things canon did wrong nailed to the door of Number Four Privet Drive" and loved it enough to use it myself.

I've put up a couple of tags of stuff reviewers/commenters have said they liked, on the basis that if one person liked it enough to comment, there were probably a dozen or more who also liked it but couldn't be bothered. So tag it, and let people who like that sort of thing find it.
