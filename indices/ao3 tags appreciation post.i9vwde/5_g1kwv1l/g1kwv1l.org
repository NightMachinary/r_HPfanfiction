I kinda immediately disregard fics that feel the need to make up a bunch of tags like "I wrote this at Oh-God-Thirty in the morning", "sorry not sorry", "maybe <insert thing here> if you squint", or other useless non-information.\\
Like, it's fine if you put one in there for humor value but if most of your tags are in that variety I just don't read your fic.

Occasionally I'm surprised and amused by the fact that something is an actual acknowledged tag - linkao3(11291784) this one has "Oh No There Is Only One Bed What Do" which I laughed out loud at when I clicked it and it had a bunch of entries. Also the "<Character> Is Their Own Warning" tag made me chuckle the first few times I saw one.
