You're unlikely to have read it, because, to the best of my knowledge, there's no English translation yet. But why not. (Also, it's less "was actually the good guy" and more "was the Dark Lord for a while, then had a change of heart". And a bit cracky.)\\
There was a wiki input thread on a similar topic a few months back, I should have posted it way back then; looking back I'm really sad that I didn't do it (and the thread is probably archived by now).

The name is (well, translates to) /Professor Riddle's Chronicles/, and the fic itself is [[http://www.snapetales.com/index.php?fic_id=8314][here]] (Russian only, so far).\\
Essentially, Tom Riddle's desperate bid for the DADA position in 1967 goes through after Dumbledore can't find any other candidates again. Turns out that Tom is actually rather tired of all the Dark Lord stuff, and the kids those days don't seem to know anything anyway...\\
Most functional analysis (and probably most math in general) I've ever seen in any HP fic (and that's /including/ that classic ditty /Harry Potter and the Elliptic Integral/).
