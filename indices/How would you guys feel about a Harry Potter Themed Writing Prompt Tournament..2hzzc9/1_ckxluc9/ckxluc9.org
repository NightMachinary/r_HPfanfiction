I could imagine writing for this, though I'd probably do it through a different account and not my fake.

Some suggestions:

- There should be guidance on length.
- Consider not holding a competition (which in my experience inevitably lead to controversy and hard feelings over how stories are judged, followed by diminished participation), but rather seek to put together collections of stories based on a given prompt. That way everyone wins as there's more stories to read (no disqualifications arising from submitting a prompt or judging) and no need for judges (or delays as judging takes place).
- Consider opening an account on ff.net (sidebar-linked on the sub) where you post collections of stories written for each prompt. As an example of what I mean, here's one that was done for the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1328677/The-Reviews-Lounge][Reviews Lounge]].
- Open it up for multiple submissions. (Why not?)
