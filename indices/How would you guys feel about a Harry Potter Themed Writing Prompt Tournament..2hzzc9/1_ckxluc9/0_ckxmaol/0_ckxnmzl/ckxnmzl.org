Perhaps this will be the exception, who knows?

My experience is with participating in writing competitions on various sites where the dynamics I described seemed to play out time and again. Even communities as homogeneous as SIYE or DLP saw the personal tastes of the small number of judges seeming to dominate outcomes more than the quality of the writing. Here, where there's a mix of highly polarizing elements (tolerance for canon pairings, slash, etc.), I think the chances are good that there'll be hard feelings.
