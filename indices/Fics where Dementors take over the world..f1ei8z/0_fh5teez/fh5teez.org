What do you think happened 70,000 years ago to nearly wipe out humans? It was no supervolcano, dementors multiplied until the earth practically froze over!\\
It was really touch-and-go for a few years there with the last surviving pockets of sapient creatures, but eventually the dementors faded without enough victims to feed on and the climate went back to normal.
