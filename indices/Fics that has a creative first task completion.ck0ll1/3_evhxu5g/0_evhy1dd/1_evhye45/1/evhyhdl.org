#+begin_quote
  Hadrian Black is entering his fourth year at Durmstrang Institute, and looking forward to it. He has excelled during his time there, and hopes to bring pride to not only his aunt, but his school as well. And, he has been given the chance with the reemergence of Triwizard Tournament, only problem it is being held at Hogwarts. Rated T.
