There was one that I remember from a long time ago where Harry summoned up a bunch of cows for the dragon and traded them for the egg. I cannot find it anywhere though, I think it may have been deleted from ffn.

I also remember Harry created some modified type of niffler at one point, and the pairing was probably Harry/Luna but I'm not sure (could have been no pairing at all). If anyone knows what it is or how to find it, I'd appreciate it.
