Honestly there was a fic I read that talked about Harry being absolutely terrified of the dragon. Hagrid warns him about it and Harry is so scared he goes to Hagrid's hut begging for any tips on dealing with the beasts.

Hagrid was like: there's one thing dragon's respect: Domination. And how does one creature dominate another? He throws his shite at it.

And so for the task Harry brewed a simple laxative, popped a squat in the arena and hurled his steaming mudpies towards the dragon and it backed down long enough for him to retrieve the egg.

I've forgotten the title, though.
