I think I reced this recently, but for raw nonstop fighting, there's always the very very AU linkffn(The Skitterleap by Enembee). (Sadly that story has more of a stopping point than a real ending.)

He has another couple of very AU stories with a lot of action (and unconventional magic) in them. Two of them form a series, the first of which is linkffn(By the Divining Light by Enembee) and the second of which is linkffn(Conlaodh's Song by Enembee). Those both feature very AU Skilled!Harry, but in a world in which he's not overpowered and his winning isn't a sure thing. (And again sadly, that story clearly was supposed to have a third part which was never written, but I still loved reading parts 1 and 2.)
