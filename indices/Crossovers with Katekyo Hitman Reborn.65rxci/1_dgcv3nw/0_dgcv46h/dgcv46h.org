  Prophecies where tricky things and lies are even tricker, Sirius's death becomes a catalyst and Dumbledore's lies crumple like a house of cards. Harry is left with a burning question...Who is he really? Crossover with Katekyo Hitman Reborn! Co-written with the lovely Araciel, who got me back into writing, go read her work, all of it is amazing!
