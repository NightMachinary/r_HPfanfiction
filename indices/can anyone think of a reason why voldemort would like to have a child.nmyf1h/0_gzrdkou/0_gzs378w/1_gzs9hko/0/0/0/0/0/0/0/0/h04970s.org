Well you must keep in mind Harry is a 16 year old young man saddled by a baby withouth anyone asking him despite barely being able to take care of himself. A baby that belongs to the man that murdered his parents and woman that murdered his godfather. He shouldnt think rationally. He should be angry.

I like the story as it is and hope you write more of it. It has a lot of potential. Also while Harry needs to be angry, it shouldnt be the main focus of the story. Maybe make him talk about it when he meets with Hermione and Ron, break a few things in his anger even but Main conflict shouldnt be on Harrys emotional issues, it should be on the war at hand.

Furthermore, Maybe Delphini is the power he knows not? Voldemort might try to use Delphini to take Harry down, only for it to blow up on his face as Delphini chooses Harry over him? If you want story to take a more tragic turn, you can make Voldemort kill Delphini and add a few chapters about the backlash of it over the trio.
