He is pretty angry. xD But he still won't let that make him act like his aunt toward Delphi. I think that'd be too far for a canon Harry. And canon Harry just isn't going to hold Delphi's parentage against her. I just don't see it. So I wrote him not. He's an incredibly empathetic person, you know? He spent his whole life being treated like shit for who his parents were, by his aunt and uncle, so he's just not gonna turn around and do that to her. I mean the guy feels bad for Snape during his worst memory, and he even feels sorry for Voldemort for how shitty his mom was in the pensieve memories. It's just not his nature.
