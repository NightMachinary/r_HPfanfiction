I wasnt trying to be too critical of the fanfic. I think it is a good story. I was pointing towards certain things i tought to be inconsistent so you can improve it on the later chapters. Maybe Dumbledeore wanted to give Delphi to a safe family but they refused her because she was from Voldemort and Harry was the last safe resort? Also a short look into Petunias thought process when Harry said Delphini was his would be good too i think("Never have i heard such a blatant lie..." Petunia tought at the ridiculous decleration.)

Also Harry should resent Dumbledore more i think. Maybe he starts resenting Delphini too at some point only to realise how close he came to acting like his aunt. That would be some good character development.
