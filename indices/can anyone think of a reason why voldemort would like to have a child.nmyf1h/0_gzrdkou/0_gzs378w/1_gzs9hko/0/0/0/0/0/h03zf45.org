Dumbledore explained it in his letter? Anyone in the house gets auto protected from Voldemort, behind the strongest enchantments ever, so if you snatch a baby from him what better place to stash it? And Dumbledore might have had other reasons for putting her with Harry the Horcrux too he didn't tell him about.

Petunia DOESN'T want another one, and she wasn't the one inches from throwing him out in fifth year, that was VERNON. SHE actually told him Harry had to stay. She knows better by now than to try to go against it, so yeah, she decided she has no choice but to help keep Delphi there. Not that it mattered because Harry took it into his own hands to leave. And personally I think not even Petunia would be heartless and cruel enough to just kick a baby out like that. She DID still take Harry in after all.

Anyway, look, it's a fanfic, I don't really care how solid the reasoning is, it's just to get the plot going... xD Have a little suspension of disbelief if it's not doing it for you. I thought it was solid ENOUGH, at least, to get the ball going.
