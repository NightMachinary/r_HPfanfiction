I mean yeah, maybe?

I already think I went a bit too far with Harry's anger and resentment toward Dumbledore as it is. I don't want to edge into bash territory, you know? I want to still keep Harry canon. But if I need to do more there, I'll give it a go?

Harry already isn't having a great time with Delphi, and I think I did put a bit in there about that. But yeah I guess it could go further until he realizes it?

Thanks for your thoughts! I don't think it's TOO critical. xD At least it's not like those pointless FFN.net reviews that just go all "Your story stucks and go die."
