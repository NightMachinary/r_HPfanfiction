Lol sorry. After reading it though, i have to say this fic has some plot problems. Why does Dumbledore leave Delphi with Harry instead of an actual adult with the capability of caring for a baby? Like Weasleys for example.

Also why would Petunia want another "freak" in her home when she was an inch close to throw Harry out summer before fifth year?
