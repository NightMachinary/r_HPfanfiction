I used this reason in a fanfic of my own. Reasoned that if there were canon rituals that needed "bones" of a father, then there were probably a lot of even sicker rituals that needed body parts/blood from one's own CHILD. Only the most depraved dark wizard/witch would have a kid just to use as a ritual sacrifice or a tool. Voldemort fits that bill; so in my story he had sex with Bellatrix just to get a kid to do the ritual and get more powerful.

Which leads to Snape stealing the baby away and giving her to Harry, and there you go - a Harry raises baby Delphi fic. Under the assumed name of Daisy, with a neat cover story in place that Harry got with some witch in the past school year.
