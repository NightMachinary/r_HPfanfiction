Torturing prisoners into making horcruxes for experimentation. Destroying Phoenixes (using a Dementor's kiss on a Phoenix, the author is certainly creative). Experimentation on a 8 yr old Tonks to study Metamorphy (after killing her parents). He doesn't do anything to his daughter though, just her blood is used in a ritual. Poor Harry on the other hand has his skull turned into a horcrux while alive. It's almost funny when you realize that the original is in Russian.
