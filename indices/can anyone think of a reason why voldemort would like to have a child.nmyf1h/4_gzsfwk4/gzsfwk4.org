Actually I think Voldemort wouldn't want a child.

I don't think he would want the danger of possible attachment, sire a possible rival who would perhaps one day want to overthrow him, nor does he need a heir if he is "immortal". Why put another parselmouth/descendant of Slytherin out there if it destroys his "uniqueness". I don't even think he would sire a child for ritualistic purposes as I think it's more likely he would search for an alternative first.

If you need a reason you can use any of these but I don't think canon!Voldemort would ever have a child, not to speak of the fact that his resurrected body might not even be able to produce one. It's one of the main reasons I dislike Cursed child after the "improved fucking timeturners" Time travel doesn't work that way! I've read fanfic with more believable plot damnit. But I digress.

If you write a believeable story thoigh no one would question you.

There is a fic called "Heir Apparent" in which Harry ends up in the past and Voldemort thinks he can be no one but his son though I doubt he would question the reasons of his "future self"
