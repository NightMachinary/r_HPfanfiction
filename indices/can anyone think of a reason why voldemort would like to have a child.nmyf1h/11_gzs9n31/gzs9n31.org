Huh never really thought about it before but considering Voldemorts body is formed from Harry's Blood and Pettigrews Flesh does that mean Delphini is technically either Harry's biological Niece or Grandaughter depending on how you view it?

Wonder if that was why Voldemort had her, to ensure he has a successful claim for the Potter Vaults once he killed off Harry (Black Vaults too if Sirius left it all to Harry) after all his body may disputed due to being artificial but Delphini would be essentially pure in that regard

Or he saw how powerful Lilys protection was and wanted a devoted family member to protect him in the same way, who better then a devoted daughter raided from birth to be devoted to you & your cause who would willingly sacrifice themselves to save you

We saw how powerful a mother son bond was, why would a father daughter one be any weaker? Plus it has a symmetry to Harrys situation that may appeal to him
