A lot of very bad people did, and do, have children and heirs. Arguably, the most logical purpose for having a child, natural or adopted, is to further propagate your specific individual value system. Because individuals whom you yourself nurture from infancy are most likely to do things the way you do. So if you're Voldemort, or any other despotic tyrant badguy or literally anyone you can think of who has the long-termist motives* of founding a New World Order, there's no reason /not/ to want children, and every reason /to/. It's probabilistically the best way to expand you influence posthumously.

* it's a different story for those badguys who are unlike Voldemort and do bad shit out of short-termist self-indulgence. That's the kind who would not have children.
