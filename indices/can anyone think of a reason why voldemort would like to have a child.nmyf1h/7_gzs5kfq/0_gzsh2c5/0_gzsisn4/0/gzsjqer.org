I get your point, but I still don't think Voldemort would "lower himself to that level". I think it's more likely he would order his death eaters to "reproduce"

I feel like it's also likely that he would resent the idea of having children with his talents because they would take from his uniqueness and he'd lose some advantages like being the only heir of Slytherin/speaking parseltongue.

/If/ he were to produce children I think he would settle on one heir on which he would focus.

I doubt he'd want a bunch of possible upsurpers around (once they grow old enough) and I think every child of /Lord Voldemort/ would be too special to be used as canon fodder not to speak of the fact that he would probably be so annoyed by them if they would become entitled
