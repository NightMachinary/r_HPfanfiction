Lol you're still thinking of "raising children" in the normal, paternalistic, goodguy way. Think more in terms of "organic expansion", or even "long-term combat unit production". (Think like a despotical asshole...)

If he's immortal, it's more cannon fodder; if he's not then it's insurance. Win-win.

Yeah a lot of people in HPFF have clued in on the pureblood baby farms, I hate to bring up this comparison but look up /Lebensborn/. Though actually many regimes all over the world have gotten the idea, especially in good ol Africa; the "production time" of child soldiers is about half of everywhere else.

A point in favour of making baby Death Eaters of Voldemort's lineage is that they might inherit some of his exceptional magical talent. True or not, we can't really say (there are examples for and against), but at least /he/ believes it.
