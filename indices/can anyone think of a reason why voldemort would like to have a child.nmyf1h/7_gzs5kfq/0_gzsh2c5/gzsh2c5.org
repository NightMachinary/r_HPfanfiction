Although one could argue that Voldemort would see "raising children" as beneath him and tasks of his Death Eaters/followers.

And if he's immortal, why would he need an heir?

I think it's more likely that he would advertise arranged marriages and having many children than himself becoming active in that department.

Besides, who knows what someone could do with a person sharing Voldemort's blood?
