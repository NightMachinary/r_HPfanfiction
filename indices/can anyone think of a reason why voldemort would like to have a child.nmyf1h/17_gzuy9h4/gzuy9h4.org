I'd only believe Voldemort to have had a child if it happened like straight out of hogwarts or something like that (how unfortunate if the first time he had sex a lassie ended up pregnant with his kid. But it happens)

But after is resurrection? Definitely not.

He doesn't even have a nose so I refuse to believe he has a fully functioning penis.

Admittedly....... the thought of him having to use fertility clinics sounds horrific (for them) and hilarious
