I totally agree. I doubt Voldemort would ever want a child nor do I think he would've have slept with Bellatrix although that is just my personal opinion as I could kinda see it happening. Anyway, his ressurectes body resembles a snake so who's to sa that there isn't some snake DNA in there as well, making him effectively sterile or so

Cursed child in my opinion is just a "glorified" fanfic. I mean I've read fanfics with a more believable plot. If they hadn't said it's part of the "canon" universe I would at least have let it slide. But I'm more attached to "A very Potter Musical" so there's that.
