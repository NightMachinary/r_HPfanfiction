I've been writing an AU where Voldemort has a wanted (more accurately: intended) child. He meets a semi-human creature called a doppelgänger that should he have sex with, creates a genetic replica of him. The doppelgänger can split his soul and place half in the boy once he's born. When Voldemort dies or is killed, he would then assume his son's body. The doppelgänger can take the son's soul out and carry it again, starting the cycle anew. Voldemort isn't immortal per se, but it's a buffer to death. Of course Everything Goes Wrong™ or else there'd be no story, but that's the gist of it.
