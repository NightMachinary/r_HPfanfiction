Fuckwhotookmyname2 I think people down vote it because Eclipse isnt particularly popular and I recommend it in this post. People lack attention spans, and since it starts off weaker they hate it, bash it, and dub it awful. They could not be more wrong. The writer gets flames weekly it sounds like. People love to hate it and miss out on perhaps the best OC story ever written and their amazing writing all because they are part of an instant gratification generation and have no attention span. So what if the first ten short chapters aren't beautifully plotted? There's more than 900,000 words of perfection after that. People get mad I recommend it so much so down vote. Jokes on them since they're missing out.
