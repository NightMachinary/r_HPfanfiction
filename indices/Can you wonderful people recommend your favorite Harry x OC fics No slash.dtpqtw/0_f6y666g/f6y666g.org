I'm digging Eclipse of the Sky by Firefawn on fanfiction.net. In fact I just re-read it. The OC is great, the best I've read, but it starts off weak. Don't get tripped up by those early chapters. The author tells you straight up the early chapters suck, but they took a decade and a half hiatus, came back, and hot dog I don't know what this writer did but in that time they got good!

Description is, "Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, and Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Dark Harry/OC"

I recommend it, but you've got to stick with it. Believe me it's an over million word fanfiction so a few subpar chapters early on are worth it. They really fix all the OC issues masterfully. I almost didn't read it because of those at first, but glad I did. Harry doesn't start off dark or powerful but when he gets dark he gets dark!

They also got a Harry and Daphne one and their version of Daphne may as well be an OC so check that out.

Another excellent one that is low key is Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19. They've got a nice slow burn. I only have 2 complaints with this one. 1 the writing is too simple. It is almost too easy of a read and I enjoy higher reading levels. 2 the chapters are short and they only update once a year. I enjoy this, but the amount of time it takes for them to update with such tiny chapters isn't very impressive. It is still worth a read. A plus is this is good from Chapter 1.

The description is: "He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead."
