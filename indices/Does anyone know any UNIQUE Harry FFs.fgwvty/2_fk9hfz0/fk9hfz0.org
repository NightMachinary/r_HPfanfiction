- not Hufflepuff or Gryffindor
- ambitious or innovative
- not a pushover, can take care of himself
- no crazy/insane Harry but I love it when he's morally ambiguous and Dark Harry or Gray Harry is completely acceptable
- a harry that actually cares to learn about the world he lives in
- any rating is fine
- not a complete copy of canon
- a harry that questions everything or at the very least isn't a mindless robot who can't think for himself
- 50000 words PLUS
- witty/sarcastic/you never know what he might say

I know it's a sin to say here, but Harry Potter and the *Methods of Rationality* (HPMOR)?
