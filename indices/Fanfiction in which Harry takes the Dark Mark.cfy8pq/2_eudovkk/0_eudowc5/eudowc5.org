  After looking into Snape's pensieve, Harry makes up his mind to take charge of his actions---but before he can, he is sent back in time to 1975. He must find his own way back to the future without upsetting the time line, but the Dark Lord is on the rise, and Harry's never been good at keeping his head down.Canon Divergent after "Snape's Worst Memory" in OotP.

  Sequel to The Will of All Others. Harry is trapped in every way under the rule of Lord Voldemort. Now he has been summoned to an Alternate Universe where everything is at once so much better and so much worse. As the events of his world threaten to repeat themselves, how can Harry save this universe, when he couldn't even save his own?
