I can honestly say I've never paid attention to punctuation. (Unless it's something obvious like a question ending in a full stop or triple exclamation) I'm shit with commas both in my native language and English. I'm okay at spelling, but commas are beyond me. I just pepper them randomly and hope some are in the right positions.
