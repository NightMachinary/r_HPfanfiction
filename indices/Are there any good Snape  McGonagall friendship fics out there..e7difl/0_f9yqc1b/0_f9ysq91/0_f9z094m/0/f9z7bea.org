Well, the story started when they relationship already existed, so that wouldn't be that bad. Unfortunately, H/Hr relationship seemed like the weakest part of otherwise really nice story, and yes, I really liked McGonagall/Snape relationship there (although, I missed some kind of Snape conversion story, but that's another point). And yes, the best part was the Percy/Audrey story (there is no way how can I be persuaded that Audrey was not a Muggle; looking at you otherwise rather nice linkffn(12181042)!), and apparently I was not alone, so there is linkffn(12373273).
