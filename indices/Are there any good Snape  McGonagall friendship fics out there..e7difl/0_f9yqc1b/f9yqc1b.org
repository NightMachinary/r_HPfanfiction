While it is not the focus of the fic, it is a big part of it. I really enjoyed the development of their friendship. The story is a marriage law AU, wherein Hermione says 'hell no' and flees with Harry and her family to the US. I also really enjoyed the development of her parents as people and their relationship with Hermione and magic in general. They are badasses. Linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities).
