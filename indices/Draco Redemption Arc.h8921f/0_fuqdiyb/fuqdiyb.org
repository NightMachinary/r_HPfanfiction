I feel like it's less Snape getting a good redemption but more that readers fail to understand complexity and nuance.

Snape did unbelievably brave things. He spied on the Dark Lord, a master of legilimency. He had to stare into the Dark Lord's eyes and not give into his anger at Lily's death. Snape loved Lily in the only way he knew how. To Harry, who has never known his mother and who idealizes his parents as a result, Snape seems like a brave man with his heart in the right place.

Of course, we, as readers who don't idealize Harry's mother, see that Snape's love is unhealthy. We see how badly Snape treats Neville and Harry, the people he sees as being responsible for Lily's death. We see how Snape's love is less love and more obsession. We don't really see a "good redemption". To Harry it may be. But to readers, we see it for a bad man only doing good to spite the man who killed the person he wanted. It's a nuanced redemption. He did the right thing, after causing a lot of harm, for the wrong reasons. It just seems like a good redemption to those who see that Harry now views Snape as a good man.

This part is more subjective. Draco was a coward. All he did was obfuscate when his actions threatened to condemn Harry to death and even towards the end, he was still claiming to be a death eater so long as it kept him alive. I don't think he deserved a redemption, it was Narcissa Malfoy who really did the right thing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]] has a slowly redeeming Draco Malfoy but it has a lot of issues with the story, namely pacing.
