I read most of the old and most likely abandoned fics because I like the concept being written, especially when that concept is pretty rare or written well. Many of these fics had potential and was interesting to read but the author just ran out of ideas. Some make me want to actually adopt the stories and finish them myself. Adopting a story is an actual thing people do too.
