I think I would be much more disappointed/upset if I was reading a real book and it cut off halfway through, or if I was watching a TV show that was cancelled after a number of episodes or the like.

But that's because in general, published fiction is a lot tighter and has a lot more tension than fanfiction does, which is honestly part of the reason I read and like fanfiction. When I'm too stressed out to read published novels, in which bad & distressing shit is always happening to the main character, I can still read fanfiction, where even the most angsty stories tend to be fluffy and low-tension in their way.

This same lack of tension is why I don't really mind when there never ends up being a next chapter, because the narrative doesn't really demand one, nor feel incomplete without one. It'd be like if /Friends/ or /The Office/ were cancelled after five seasons, vs. if /Game of Thrones/ had been.
