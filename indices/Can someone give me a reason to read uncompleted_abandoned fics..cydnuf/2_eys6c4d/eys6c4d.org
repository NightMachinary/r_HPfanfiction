I think this is really a personal thing -- ultimately, unfinished stories /really bother/ some folks and don't bother other folks at all. When it comes to fanfiction, I generally fall into the latter category, partly because fanfic authors aren't great at writing convincing endings anyway, and so the story doesn't miss much from having them left off, and partly because the reason I read fanfiction is to explore new ideas or to spend some more time with the characters, and neither of those things miss much from having the ending left off.

Also, there's a bunch of wonderful, wonderful incomplete or abandoned stories out there, and it would be a shame to miss out on them! There's also nothing quite like reading along with a story as it's being released. That's doubly true for stories that update rarely or which you thought abandoned, where getting the email that they've got a new chapter is an amazing gift.

Staple abandoned fics include Out of the Night, by Raining Ink, linkffn(The Life and Times), linkffn(A Long Journey Home), linkffn(Harry Potter: The Last Avatar), as well as a number which have already been linked, like 0-800 rent-a-hero.
