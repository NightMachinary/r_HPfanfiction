Yes, it is disappointing, but still plenty of those unfinished stories have a lot of good story written already. Yes, it is disappointing not having the resolution, but better something than nothing. I really like some Northumbrian's unfinished stories (which given he seemed to give up on fanfiction and write the original stories will probably be never finished) like linkao3(6057483;3068435;8402590), which despite not being finished are some of the most finest pieces of fanfiction I know about.

Or linkffn(8429437) is probably unique (as far as I know) in many aspects, and if I skipped it because it is unfinished (and it has title like some novel of Marquise de Sade) I would miss very nice piece of writing.
