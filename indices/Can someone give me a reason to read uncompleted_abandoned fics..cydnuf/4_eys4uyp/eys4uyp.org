:END:

After I read a story, I don't even remember the ending unless it's a bad or shocking one. I mean, in all happy endings they usually just resolve the problem or finish off Voldemort, right? Forgettable, and easy to just pretend that happened in a story without an ending. "What's the ending?" "Oh, they killed Voldemort." Done.

What I tend to remember are the cool ideas and nice/dramatic character moments, and you can have some of the best of those in stories that are never finished. I also love length and really having time to get into a story, I'd much prefer a 300k unfinished than a 40k finished if both were wonderfully written.

My three favorite unfinished:

linkao3(C'est La Vie by cywscross)

linkao3(Messing With Time by slythernim)

linkffn(The Lesser Sadness by Newcomb)
