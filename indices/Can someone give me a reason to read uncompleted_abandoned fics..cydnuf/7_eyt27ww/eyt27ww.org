I usually have no problem reading incomplete fics *IF I know beforehand* so I am mentally prepared for the sudden absence of story. Unfinished stories that are unexpected feel like a mass avada kedavra on every character and now there's a huge hole in my heart because the world that I immersed myself in has been shattered.

Nightmares of Future Past was my first experience with the pain of an unfinished story. It felt like a mild cruciatus curse.
