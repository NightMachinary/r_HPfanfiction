I'd say it varies based on the fic. Some, like !linkffn(Harry Potter and the Children of Change) don't end on a cliffhanger and are such joys to read that it's honestly worth it to read them. That said, for every fic that ends on a decent note, there are fics that end on extreme cliffhangers. I personally enjoy the gamble once in a while, though if you're not sure, then ask around.
