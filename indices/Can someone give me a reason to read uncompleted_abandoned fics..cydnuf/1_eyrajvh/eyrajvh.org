I personally go fandom to fandom looking for a niche story genre, and will take anything for that, bad stories, incomplete stories, the works. Because of this, if I want some trope and have exhausted all the completed fics I can go to incomplete ones and find more reading material.

Plus, if you always limit yourself to completed stories then you'll miss out on some gems of the fandom like (imo) I'm Still Here (though I'll admit my pairing and trope preferences do color that statement.)
