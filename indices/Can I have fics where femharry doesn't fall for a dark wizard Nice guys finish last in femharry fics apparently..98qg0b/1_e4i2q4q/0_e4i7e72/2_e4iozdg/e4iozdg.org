To be fair, the op never asked for a good and well written fic, just not a femHarry/Dark Wizard. And yes, I agree with most of what you said, except the fact that that canon Harry is better at magical skills. Have you read the crossovers? those are the ones that I love... If only there were more people that wrote Eragon/Harry x-overs...
