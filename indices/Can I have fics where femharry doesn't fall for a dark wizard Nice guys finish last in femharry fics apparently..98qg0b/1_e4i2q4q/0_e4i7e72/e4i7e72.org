The Last Peverell is pretty bad though. Interesting backstory which could have led to some pretty cool stuff given the time travel, but all squandered doing (and failing) at being a schoolgirl. It features the completely (or nearly completely) irrelevant magical core, a manipulative Dumbledore who is both super obvious, and super incompetent, some random pureblood culture that doesn't really do anything for the story, nor does it really fill much worldbuilding, and worst of all, a Mary Sue who is simultaneously the best thing ever and also incredibly incompetent given her backstory. I mean really? Defeats Voldemort and other dark lords nine times, is an adept politician (which can be inferred from her backstory), yet fails to do anything of notice politically despite having huge amounts of influence over other Houses, and is beaten black and blue by a pack of six Death Eaters-in-training (which includes a Hufflepuff somehow), nearly losing. Honestly, canon Harry, at the same age (5th year), has her beat for for both leadership and magical skills.
