Yeah, there's a reason I avoid HP slash and read almost exclusively straight pairings. All of the popular slash couples are creepy garbage like Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort or Drarry. How about someone NICE being in a relationship with Harry for once? Like Neville for example, I would love to read a proper romance like that.
