The problem begins when Harry is in a slash relationship with anyone from the canon cast. Can you seriously imagine anybody from the acceptable canon age group who would be compatible with Harry? First Voldemort is right out. He is not even in the list. He killed the kid's parents and he is about 70 or 71. Snape literally spend his all his teenager years hating kid's dad and lusting after his mother. Draco is almost acceptable but that is just for the sheer fact that he is more like a tsundere/yandere girl in a boys body. I would like to see Neville/Harry but I can't imagine them going further than being bros for life.
