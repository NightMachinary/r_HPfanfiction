It is really, I mean Really Hard to do justice to Ron. Most fanfic writers who wrote hp fics can't write him anything but a jealous poor kid, someone who speaks without thinking, the glutton, Ron the Death Eater or not even bothering to add him into the fic itself. Ron's character matures as the books advance. We don't see a genius kid or a protagonist when we read him. And that makes it really hard to write him as he is. And all of this is even without going into the can of worms that is Romance in HP. Like I said, Ron is a character that matures as we see on the screen or while reading the books. He isn't a happy go lucky shounen character from some action manga.
