  How about someone NICE being in a relationship with Harry for once?

Sounds reasonable

  Like Neville for example

Please not. Neville sucks in fanfics, either as Ron v2 or WBWL. Literally, the only decent characterisation of him I've read has been a smutty "Harry joins Neville/Hannah" one-shot (and there was a fem!Harry one where she has an exhibition thing and turns Neville into a friend with benefits, but neither have much of a plot).
