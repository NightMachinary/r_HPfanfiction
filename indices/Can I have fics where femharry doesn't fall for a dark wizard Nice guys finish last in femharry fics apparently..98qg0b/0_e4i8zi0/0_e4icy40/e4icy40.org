The fanfiction community in general has some mildly startling tendencies. Taking someone like poor Harry and making him the perverted lower half in a submissive relationship with the literal monster that murdered his parents and attempted to ruthlessly kill a one year child because of a half over heard prophecy told by a drunk oracle. There are ways to make these relationships seem believable, but the authors tend to err down the path of prolonged deus ex machina and sudden and unexplainable shifts in character. I don't know /what/ in a story for /children/ about a magical school, told from the perspective of what I've read is a self insert, has engendered so much /strange/ attention. Myself, of course, included. Only Merlin knows what that story has done to us.
