My suggestion is to have experienced or powerful wizards and witches use the simple disappearing effect with little to no noise as they have mastered the art of apparition while new or weak wizards and witches use the "swirling air" effect with a louder noise. Signifying a difference in power. A lot of fics use that system and it's in my headcanon too. :)

Maybe show the newbies stumbling or at least pausing to get their bearings while the pros disapparate mid-step and apparate smoothly, continuing their walk as if they didn't just cross hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye. :D
