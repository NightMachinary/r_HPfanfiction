I don't know, ownership aside, with such an emphasis on blood purity and blood status, the importance of ensuring offspring is actually yours could easily lead to that kind of 'purity' culture. You don't want any half-blood bastards or a witch passing off a child as not yours if it's really the muggleborn down the street.
