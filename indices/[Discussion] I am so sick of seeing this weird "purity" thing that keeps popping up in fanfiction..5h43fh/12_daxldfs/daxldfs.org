While people misunderstanding the difference between an 'alternate secret society' and 'ye olden days' in relation to the wizarding world plays a significant role, I think the real problem simply lies in where people draw their inspiration from when writing. Specifically, people tend to write about things they are either familiar with or dream about. The latter produces the fantastical and irreverent wish-fulfillment adventure-type fics while the former produces the more introspective and slice-of-life type fics. When you read about the main character having harems and everyone fucking like rabbits the writer is drawing on that second source of inspiration. On the other hand, when you read a story where the characters are all sexually repressed virginity worshipers the writer is drawing on that first source of inspiration because, unfortunately, such attitudes are still prevalent in many parts of society, thus people write about it.
