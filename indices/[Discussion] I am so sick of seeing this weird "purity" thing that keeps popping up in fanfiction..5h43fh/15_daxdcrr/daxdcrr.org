I've come across this a fair bit, probably more than most since I use to crawl through the Harry/Daphne section quite a lot and you know how that nonsense is with how people portray pureblood ideology and purity and whatever. Rarely is it done right, and it's usually quite polarizing, either it's some huge deal, or no big deal at all. Personally, I don't really think it matters, so if it's not really relevant to a story (it shouldn't be), then there's no reason to bring it up at all.
