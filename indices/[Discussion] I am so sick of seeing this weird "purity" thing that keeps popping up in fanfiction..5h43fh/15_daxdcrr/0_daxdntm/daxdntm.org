I think my problem is that I've read a lot of fics in either Marauder era or earlier, Slytherin fics, political intruige etc. where the author thinks it's "cute" to have side bits where everyone's protecting the girl's virtue or whatever. And it's so common in the political fics that I just want to tear my hair out.
