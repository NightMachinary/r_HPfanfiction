  I even once wrote a short piece where witches and wizards had sex asap because it made them unusable for dark wizards and their rituals that require virgins.

See, that makes much more sense to me. Here's one of my favorite little snippets concerning that idea:

[Remus]"...it's an extremely poor risk for Harry to remain innocent. He could be used in all manner of dark rites as a virgin. We can only be fortunate it didn't cross Voldemort's mind during fourth year when Harry was kidnapped after the third task.” He winced when Molly paled. “The Dark Arts are ripe with virgin sacrifice rituals, you know.”

Hermione promptly raised her hand and blushed when Moody and Remus both laughed. “Right, well, does that mean that a witch must have an intact hymen or does it require penetration by a wizard?”

Remus blushed furiously, Molly gaped in horror, and Moody grinned at her. “You'd need a wizard, lass. There are some rituals that call for a ‘witch who has never known a wizard intimately' and are considered in the same class of acts as a virgin sacrifice.”

Hermione huffed and shot Ron a shrewd look. “What? Don't look at me like that! There is no telling what a Death Eater might do with me---I don't want to be a virgin sacrifice.”

“Who does?” Sirius asked blithely as he entered the kitchen.

Now /that's/ how virginity should be viewed in Harry Potter.
