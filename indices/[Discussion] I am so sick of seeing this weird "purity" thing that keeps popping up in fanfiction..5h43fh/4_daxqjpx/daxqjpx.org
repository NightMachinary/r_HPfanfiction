I know what you mean. Gender disparity in general makes no sense in that universe. With the exception of pregnancy, magic ought to level the playing field on every other subject (and some of those mpreg stories even ignore that... but.... /shudder/).

Hence a lot of the gender powerplays probably never even existed in the first place. It would make a lot more sense for purebloods to find the "purity" stuff the christian muggleborns bring in to be rather weird.

I even once wrote a short piece where witches and wizards had sex asap because it made them unusable for dark wizards and their rituals that require virgins. (I admit, I was hangover af when I wrote it - do not mix Sangria and Scotch. Friendly warning.).

But hey, we have almost 0 tangible lore for it, so I always figure "whatever makes the authors boat float". I don't have to read it. The only one we really follow is Harry, and for all we know he's so emotionally stunted that hes the very exception to the rule.
