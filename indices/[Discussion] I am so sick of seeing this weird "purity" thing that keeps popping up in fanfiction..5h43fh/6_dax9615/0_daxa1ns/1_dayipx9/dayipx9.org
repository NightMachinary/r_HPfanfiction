  There was fic, I think it was called The Problem with Purity, which made sex this super important thing, although I'm less inclined to hate it since it was technically a plot point.

It was a plot point, but Hermione was a huge mary sue, I tend to read Hermione centric fics and have read other with army sue Hermione, but in that one it was almost unbearable. I still finished it, but I really didn't like it that much.
