You see, this kind of answer makes me kinda want to read outside of my habitual tropes. It could be great ! Super interesting. But with fan fiction (I read HP mostly, with a bit of Marvel CU on the side, for Loki), I don't really want to read anything that doesn't involve my favorite parings, and I like somewhat uncommon stuff (Hermione, with older guys, Snape, Lucius, and more importantly Voldemort/Tom Riddle). I haven't been reading FF for a long time but I think I kinda read almost everything I could about those pairings (definitively read everything readable, and even terrible fanfics with HG/TR or LV as a main pairing). But I can't find it in myself to read anything else. I tried, and will keep reading when I think about it, that fic about Neville and Ginny and the resto of Hogwarts during their 7th year. It seemed cannon, which I don't usually read, but it's the first time something different gave me interest. I'll keep trying ! It's such a wonderful fandom with a large range of stories, I know I'm missing out, I just have to try.
