Indeed, but being Ron, we know he's good at chess and Quidditch strategy, but he's not a war aficionado nor a great reader. We don't know much about Ginny, so it's plausible she also can strategize, but more importantly, could become war obsessed after her Diary experience. Padma is a smart girl we know little about, so it's conceivable to invent a grandfather who was high up in an army, and that she learnt heaps about battles and weapons and the good old days. Same with Susan, I don't see Amelia being the type to refuse to tell a kid war stories, and we could pretend other family members were retired Aurors from both wars. A half-blood might have a granddad each from magical and mundane ww2, who like to swap stories and teach young Junior who lost parents in volde's war all about battles and wars and fighting.

I like this one. An orphan raised by four world war vets jointly, from both sides - three fighters and a nurse. If only I could write, and actually knew anything about the military.
