Roundabout Destiny by MaryRoyale had the weird purity halo in it (along with a lot of other nameless stories I've found that involve time travel into the past). Recently I found a fic called "Nobody cared" in which (amist tons of other problems) Gryffindors are all apparently rule-breaking bullies who get their prefect duties taken away because they have sex.

There was fic, I think it was called The Problem with Purity, which made sex this super important thing, although I'm less inclined to hate it since it /was/ technically a plot point.
