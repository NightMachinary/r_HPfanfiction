I recently tried to reread TPwP and found I couldn't do it even though I enjoyed it the first time around. A few months ago I read an article about Elizabeth Smart, how worthless she felt after being raped, and the dangers of a society that places a high value on virginity. It really changed my perspective.

Before I found fics with emphasis on physical "purity" just eye-roll inducing but now I can't even read them. In my own fic, I changed a scene where a character is able to gather a rare potion ingredient related to unicorns because he was a virgin. Instead I made it so anyone could do it so long as they were "pure of heart". It's probably extreme of me, but I refuse to write anything that implies that being a virgin makes anyone extra special. Even something as silly as being able to collect fungus growing on top of some unicorn shit in the light of the full moon.
