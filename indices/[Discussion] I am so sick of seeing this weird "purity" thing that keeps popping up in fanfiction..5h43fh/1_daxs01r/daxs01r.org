This reminds me of something Jason Isaacs said regarding Lucius Malfoy's initial costume and how it clashed with his concept of the character:

  “I went to the set, and they had this idea of me wearing a pinstripe suit, short black-and-white hair,” Isaacs recalls. “I was slightly horrified. He was a racist, a eugenicist. There's no way he would cut his hair like a Muggle, or dress like a Muggle.”

My headcanon is that exact attitude was widespread among pure-blood society after wizards passed the Statute of Secrecy, with the societal separation really having begun /before/ the 1690s for such a law to even be considered.

Pure-blood witches and wizards would want to distance themselves from Muggles as far as possible, not absorb their culture. And they would both naturally diverge from that point of isolation.

Muggles had an emphasis on purity and chastity, so maybe wizards started associating that with the same barbarous culture that burned and hanged their people, and went "nah."

Even putting the Statute aside, magic evens the playing field. Gender seems to have no bearing on magical ability. Witches can just as easily cast spells, make potions, etc., as wizards do. It's difficult to imagine literally empowered witches putting up with being the "inferior sex" and all that phrase entails.

Not only that, but magic also could have offered things that contemporaneous Muggle societies of the past would not have had -- in theory, Rowling's brand of magical system could certainly have spells or potions to prevent pregnancies, determine paternity, and eradicate sexually transmitted diseases.

So, for me, I just don't see a purity culture as very widely-supported among wizards.

Unless you're talking blood purity. ;)
