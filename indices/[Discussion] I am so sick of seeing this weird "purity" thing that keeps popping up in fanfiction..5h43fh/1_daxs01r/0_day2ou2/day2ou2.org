  Unless you're talking blood purity. ;)

Actually, this opens a whole new can of worms, because a witch who was intimate - even unwillingly - with a muggle would probably be seen as 'impure', though I'm going to say that a wizard would likely /not/ have the same issue. If anything, it would be more like the Roman view of homosexual acts: penetration is fine, but being penetrated is deplorable.

One could write a strange yet interesting fanfic around this concept.

But two pureblood kids getting it on between classes? Aside from some potentially awkward political complications, it'd be seen as 'kids being kids."
