I understand that from a logical, rule-based point of view it seems off, but from a more psychological view, I think it could still be justified. If you want to follow the whole old-school families, Lords and Ladies thing, wizards and witches were expected to be very composed and controlled, which is completely inconsistent with being okay with teenagers being dragged by their hormones into broom closets.

All it would take is a few kids confusing sex and feelings for their parents to see sex as something that corrupts their minds and makes them act stupid. Considering how hysterical wizards get, I can easily see them being very superstitious about how a sexual relationship can send you off the deep end, even if you can't get preggers or an STI (and we have no evidence that wizards can't get those).
