And it doesn't help that the average level of sex education nowadays is somewhere beneath the basement. The stupid perception that sexuality is shameful for girls and women does not help it any either as that, combined with the above, results in eternal perpetuation of harmful nonsense.

Source: My sex education amounted to my being afraid of hurting myself with something stupid and thus asking around about anything and everything the girls around me were talking about until I got answers of some worth; it took years, by the way, and the fact I hadn't done anything stupid in the meantime is probably a small miracle; it also made many people comment ... badly on the fact that I wanted to know, because why not, let's shame a girl to death.
