So putting it into a story where it doesn't provide some kind of benefit to the story is just bad writing, I'll give you that. However, the idea that because they had a minister of magic that was female in the 1700s doesn't mean they don't have gendered hang ups on the sexes AND even if it did, not having issues with gender doesn't mean you don't have issues with sex. The idea of a purity spell seems ridiculous to us, but at the same time, less than 200 years ago, putting the bedsheet to hang outside a house after a wedding night to show bloodstains was a legitimate thing....
