  I get that people seem to think that because the wizarding world still carries the aesthetic of the 1700s that they would carry similar societal expectations, except that the MOM had a female Minister for Magic IN the 1700s. A society that doesn't have a gendered hangup on the sexes obviously would not have a problem with sex, because that sense of ownership is the only reason the idea of purity exists anyway.

Well I can assure you that the US still has huge hang ups about virginity despite no longer having chattel marriages and having a number of high ranking women. I think your contention here is just wrong.
