Honestly sex in fanfiction rarely adds anything to begin with, and in fact usually starts killing the plot. Now this isn't to say it can't add something, just that it usually doesn't.

For every well written romance or drama that uses sex tastefully to build up the plot we have hundreds fics that implode after it's brought in. Obviously this doesn't include smut-fics, where sex is the whole premise.

The virgin detecting magical wedding is a god awful trope, I will give you that. But, authority figures preventing their charges from having sex should 100% be a thing. Between maturity, potential sexual assault, rape, and pregnancy the staff at Hogwartz better damn well be actively discouraging it on premise. Of course, proper education into the matter should be offered.

Sorry, rambled for a long while their, but when it comes down to it, overall I feel sex is rarely used well in stories, nor is sex prevention used well. In 99% of stories honestly it should never come up, and if it does it honestly shouldn't be a big focus. Acknowledge that it's happening, we don't need to read several chapters about hooking up in closets, or of professors patrolling the hallways.
