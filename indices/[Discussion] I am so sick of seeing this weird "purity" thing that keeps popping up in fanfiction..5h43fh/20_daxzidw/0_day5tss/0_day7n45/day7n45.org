What are you talking about, you should absolutely discourage sex in a school full of children. I am not saying you should punish the students harshly or anything like that. But a good education into the matter, trying to discourage it from happening through said education, and an open door policy are all responsible things that should be used.

No sane administrator wants children to be running around having sex. The consequences are life altering if something goes wrong.
