Of course they don't want their students having sex. But will telling them not to do it stop them? No.

The best way to approach this problem is teaching kids about how to have sex safely, that's it's okay to have sex and it's okay not to be ready or not want to, that having sex is something natural.

Telling them not do it will not help because sex feels good and they are hormonal teenagers. Abstinence only does not work.
