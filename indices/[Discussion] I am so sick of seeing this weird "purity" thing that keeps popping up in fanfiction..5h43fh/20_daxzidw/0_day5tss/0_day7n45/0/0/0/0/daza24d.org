  See what happens if you actually think your argument through?

Yes. You still get people who don't give a damn and just want to put you down because it makes them feel better.

  We teach people how to do it safely, and then let them do it. Sports, driving, or sex - it's the same, just the age at which you start differs.

This is the very thing I effing recommended. Tell them to wait until they learn, immediately teach them, and then let them choose. But no, you had to get oh-so-righteous and decide that what I wrote was that we should tell them that sex is evil.

By the way, considering that my point basically amounts to “teach them of the risks and how they can prevent those”, your examples are crap because any trainer worth their money does discourage people who don't know anything from going into serious training without learning about it and we do teach people how to drive before letting them do it. And yes, I am aware that the examples you used reinforce what you said, but since this is the very same thing I said and you are /disagreeing/ with me, it makes the examples crap for the purpose of showing that I am wrong. Because I am not.
