  Because you started with "I am not the person you are replying to, but I do think that it should actually be discouraged." and entered a conversation which was basically me vs. someone who thinks sex is bad.
#+end_quote

And yet I explained in the next paragraph that I do not mean it in the same way that the other person. You seem to have missed that, but you claim to have known. You acted as if I treated sex as bad despite the fact that more than once I wrote that I object to shaming it and treating it as “evil” which as far as I know counts as the same thing, and again you claim to have known what I meant. You say that you agreed to the “they shouldn't do it if they don't feel ready” thing, and yet you continued to go on about how I am wrong about discouraging it when I wrote that this is the one form of discouragement I support at all. My latter reasoning for why I called that particular thing a “discouragement” you called “defensive”, without giving any reasoning for it; this does not at all support your claim of agreeing with it, neither of those acts does. Twice, you have said that I did not write things that I wrote, as if that was a way to prove me wrong, and yet again there is the claim that you knew what I wrote.

We started from a difference of opinion. My first line wasn't the best, not even close to it. But then so was your first reply, whilst the latter part of my comment, the core part of it, was not as bad. And your claim that you knew, when you acted as if you had no idea, makes what happened worse because it means that you knew I did not mean what you wrote I meant with your cherry-picked stuff and tried to prove I am wrong for. And this---knowing that someone does not mean what you imply they mean and then getting onto their case for what you know they do not mean---is something I do not believe proper for an actual discussion, but rather an underhanded way to undermine someone.

  And what exactly could have been productive there? As far as I can tell, we both agree that teenagers should get good sex ed, and that sex is not bad when people are ready for it.
#+end_quote

It could have ended after one reply, maybe two, with both of us agreeing to that, maybe disagreeing to the reason for me classifying what I did as “discouraging”, and not wasting time on a useless back-and-forth “no, you” thing that this became. I believe that in comparison this would have been much more productive than what we got simply because of lack of stupid disagreements over things that you claim you knew were expressed with the wrong words and yet acted as if you didn't.

Look, I really do get that I could have worded it much better. I do, really. But the same thing /really/ applies to you, especially with your claim to have known what I meant when you were replying. I did not know what you meant when you started acting the way you have, and so I replied with what I replied, some of it wrong (I do admit my second comment was aggressive, which was justifiable considering the circumstances but not excusable), but if you really knew then at any point you could have stopped the very thing that was happening. You did not. /That/ is a failure in communication, and that one is on you, no matter what was wrong with my replies. And honestly, right now I am continuing because I have seen a few discussion chains go to a weird place because you acted in a way similar to that, so I am writing to say that please do stop that and reply to what actually is meant when you /know/ the other person has failed to convey their ideas, rather than replying to a few words taken out of the context and meaning you know about which then results in nothing useful.

I do know I made mistakes here, sure. I could have not made my second comment what it was; I could have tried to reply differently than I have; I could have not used the same opening sentence for the first comment of mine that I have. But I know you also made mistakes. Are you capable of admitting to /that/? Because so far it does not appear to me so, and that is the core of the problem we got to now, or at least I think we did.
