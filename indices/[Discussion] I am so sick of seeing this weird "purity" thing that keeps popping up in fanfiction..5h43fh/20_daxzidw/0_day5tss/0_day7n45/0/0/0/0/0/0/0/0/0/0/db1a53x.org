Because the overall tone is closest to discouraging: since many teenagers who do not have anyone to educate them do encourage their peers to not care how ready they are and just do it because why not, I believe it is worth it to mention when providing the education in question that they should not do it if they are not ready to provide a counter to that recklessness, which in my opinion makes the overall tone of it closer to discouraging than neutral because there's no mention that they should do it if they do feel ready to balance it (as I do not believe such a mention to be necessary if a thorough education---including the fact that sex can be pleasurable and there's nothing wrong or shameful with it “just because”---is provided).

Many teenagers are unsure of many things, including how ready they are to get intimate with someone else. Many of their peers encourage them because there's nothing for them to gain from discouraging, but if they do fall for that before they actually are ready they may---though they also may not, it depends on a lot of stuff---regret it. The adults around them in many cases discourage it in a destructive way, by presenting sex as evil or shameful or both; it is discouragement of the kind many people think about the most, true, and it's fairly useless to be honest. Then you have the people who say it's the girl's own choice; while the fact that they do not try to shame the kids or pull them into sex is commendable in itself, for those who don't really know what they want and how they feel it provides nothing, and the peer pressure trying to sweep them remains. That is why I believe it to be worth it to say that “I think they should not do it if they do not feel ready”; it is discouragement of a kind, sure, but it also says that the choice is completely theirs to make once they feel they are ready, and it provides them with /something/ to catch onto if they don't really want to be swept by peer pressure and do it “because everyone else does”; and if coupled with actual sex education worth something, it also means giving them some means with which they could judge if they do feel ready.

That is why.
