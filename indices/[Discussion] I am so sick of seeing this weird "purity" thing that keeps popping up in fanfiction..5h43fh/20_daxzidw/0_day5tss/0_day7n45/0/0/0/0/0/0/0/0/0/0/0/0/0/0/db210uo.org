And you once again keep ignoring parts of the comments I wrote, which means your messages indeed are biased. Time and again I wrote that one should not try to say the very same thing you are accusing me of continuing to say.

Sex isn't bad. There you effing have it. And I am really tired of your cherry-picking of what I wrote and not paying attention at all to the rest of what I wrote, especially when it means picking one sentence in a twenty-sentence comment and treating it as if it were the entirety of it. Tired enough that I wrote back despite previously writing that I will not.
