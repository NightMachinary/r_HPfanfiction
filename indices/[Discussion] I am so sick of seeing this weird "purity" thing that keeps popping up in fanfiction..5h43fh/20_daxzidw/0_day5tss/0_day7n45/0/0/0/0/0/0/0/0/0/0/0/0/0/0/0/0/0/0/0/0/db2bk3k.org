Because you went about it all wrong. Do note your first reply, in which you acted as if I wrote that it should be discouraged regardless of the circumstances, which simply isn't true. Then note the fact that later on you wrote that I didn't write something that I have already written, more than once, and later it happened again with something else that I'd also already written; and none of those things you'd actually addressed, outside of giving the word “defensive” with no reasoning that led you to such judgment. This is your first reply to mine:

  So, should we "discourage" sports too, since if you have an accident on the field you can ruin your life or even die? What about driving? Why should kids learn how to drive if they can kill themselves and others in accidents?

  See what happens if you actually think your argument through?

  We teach people how to do it safely, and then let them do it. Sports, driving, or sex - it's the same, just the age at which you start differs.

You wrote in your previous comment that it is all because the initial sentence of my first comment coloured the perception, but your replies could very easily have been construed to focus on that one sentence to the exclusion of anything else.

You did not actually address the rest of the message, the core part of it, nor did you agree about anything here. No, this very message centres just on the word “disagreement”, and just like you say my one sentence coloured the conversation from my side, so has this comment from your side. And allegedly by that point you knew that the word “disagreement” was not what I meant and that it was just unfortunate phrasing; if so then this is the very worst course of action you could have chosen because if you really knew then this message of yours, as one that does not actually address what I wrote and implies that I had not been thinking at the same time, can be taken as rude and condescending. And, again, we are talking about the impressions being coloured, so take that and think for a moment why would I not try to justify what I said earlier and that maybe if you did not concentrate on that one stupid word to such an unhealthy degree this conversation could have actually been productive and instead it isn't.
