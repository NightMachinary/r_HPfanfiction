Except for the possible consequences. About which the adults are wont not to talk because so many think it's better to shame it all or present it as evil, and the other teenagers don't talk because they simply do not know.

And right now I think it's quite likely that your perception of it as “defensive” is caused by you being biased after this whole stupid chain of comments where you were mostly just automatically disagreeing. Or maybe you simply live in a place where sex education isn't a complete mess and so there is no need to do what I am talking about, but considering that I'd explained myself and you still do not see it I am inclined to believe in the first one.

Anyway, I won't reply to that chain of comments anymore as that would be completely unproductive, what with the fact that there's nothing more any of us can add to actually make this discussion progress, so that's that.
