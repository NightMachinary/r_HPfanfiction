And you do not get the fact that you could have commented on that earlier instead of replying to one word “discouraged” as if the rest of the message wasn't there, then chiding me for not writing something that I showed you I did actually write but you didn't read, and then not even acknowledging your mistake here.

Look, what I know by now is that it all boils down to the difference in circumstances: Where you live sex education is---assuming it is as you wrote it is---comprehensive and actually useful, making it unnecessary to discourage anything because the kids know what they ought to know, and were you to actually write about that I would have admitted that. But where I live it isn't so, meaning that the only thing the kids hear is other kids pressuring them into that regardless of how they feel about it, and most adults telling them that sex is bad and shameful, making the situation far more complicated and in my opinion making it necessary to tell them that no, sex is not bad, and yes, you should not do it if you do not think yourself ready.

I did say why I think it is necessary to provide them with an alternative. You could have questioned its necessity, but instead you called it all defensive and decided that you are done. I did mention, time and again, that I think sex should not be shamed or said to be evil, and yet you acted as if I never wrote that. I did write that the discouraging should take the form of telling them not to do it if they do not feel ready but not telling them that they simply shouldn't, but you acted as if I didn't for how many messages? And you never acknowledged that you missed that one, or if you did then you never showed it. You could have written that I hid it in a wall of text so you missed it, or you could have written “sorry, I missed it”, and I would have understood because mistakes happen and sometimes on both sides. But you didn't do any of that. Heck, if your first reply concentrated on that one and went about the semantics of calling that discouraging, this discussion would have turned out much more constructive too, because whether or not one calls something like that discouragement or not is up to the person and I would have understood and possibly even admitted that I shouldn't have used such a word for it because the other party felt the word unsuited. But, again, that didn't happen and instead of replying to the core of the message you concentrated on the word “discouragement” to an unhealthy degree. And most of all, I did write, at the very beginning and then mentioned it again and again, that it is all because sex education where I am is a useless mess and the adults in general simply do not want to talk to kids about it. And yet you chose to not see that either.

Frankly, with all that, throughout the entirety of this “discussion” it felt as if you weren't replying to anything I wrote, but as if I was instead some kind of stand-in for people who are trying to shame sex where you live and who annoyed you. I can understand that as I get that people can get emotional about things of this kind when others are being irrational, but I tried to explain myself and again and again instead of addressing /what I wrote/ you replied to ... something else, cherry-picking stuff in a way that made a lot of our comments pretty much a waste of everyone's time. Do look at it from that perspective and tell me, would a little bit of annoyance at my side not be justifiable right now? Even now, you boil it down to “you don't get”, but have you ever, at any point of this discussion, actually read the entirety of the comments I wrote and tried to look at them with what information I gave you instead of with what you see in your country? Because to me it looks like you didn't even try to do that and as if all I did was a wasted effort because the other party decided not to actually read anything and then by the point they maybe did they'd already decided that since we were disagreeing for so long there simply cannot be anything right in anything I say. It does not feel good, let me tell you. It feels like I'd wasted time and effort. And this isn't the first time I'd seen you do something like that with some kind of discussion, nor am I the first recipient of such an approach.
