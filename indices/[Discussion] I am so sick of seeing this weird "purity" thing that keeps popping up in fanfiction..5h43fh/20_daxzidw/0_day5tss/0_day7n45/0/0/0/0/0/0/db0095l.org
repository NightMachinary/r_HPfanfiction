Considering I wasn't talking about discouraging sex per se, but rather about discouraging it before one is ready alongside providing appropriate education on the topic, I am not wrong according to what you say /so do stop for a moment and stop automatically disagreeing, for insanity's sake/.

Many people give in to peer pressure even though they are not ready because they do not know better and because nobody who knows actually told them anything. Some of them come to regret it. In my whole life, I did actually teach one person, personally, about sex and sexuality and all that stuff, and after a few years this person---unless you want to accuse her of being a liar---is both grateful to me and satisfied with her sex life; and yes, I did tell her that I personally discourage having sex if she does not feel ready, which was the kind of discouragement I was talking about from the very beginning but you did not notice it for whatever reason.
