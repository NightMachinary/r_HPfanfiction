  I read them - but why should I answer to stuff I agree with?
#+end_quote

Because that's usually what you are do when you disagreed with something else.

#+begin_quote
  My entire point was that you led with one stupid line, which coloured your whole post.
#+end_quote

Again, you could have told me that I should have put it differently, then, instead of treating it as if that was the core of the message. And you say it coloured it, the possibility of which I will not dispute, but later on you chided me for not writing things that I actually did write and you concentrated on the word to a degree that would make any external observer agree that it's not about the word colouring anything.

That does not make for a healthy discussion, and though I will accept that I might have put it differently and that at least some of the fault lies on me, the way you replied to it makes the lion's share of it go to you. You could have acted in many ways that would have made for a better discussion, but instead you chose the one way that showed you as not trying to actually reply to my comment. Indeed, you say you agreed with some of what I wrote, and it took how many comments exchanged for me to get you to stop talking about this one part to the exclusion of everything else and doing it in a way that could be construed as you disagreeing with all of what I wrote?

So, again, while I do accept I could have done it better, I put a lot of the blame for what happened on you.
