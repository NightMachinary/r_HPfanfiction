My goal was to get you to rescind the "sex should be discouraged" line. I also think I was quite clear about that. You even commented that I fixated on that line. A line which you defended stubbornly and weirdly. And that I did not understand.

Could I have worded that better? Probably. I could have let the matter drop too. I could have written "Well, starting a long post with a statement you don't actually mean is a bad idea", or something like that.
