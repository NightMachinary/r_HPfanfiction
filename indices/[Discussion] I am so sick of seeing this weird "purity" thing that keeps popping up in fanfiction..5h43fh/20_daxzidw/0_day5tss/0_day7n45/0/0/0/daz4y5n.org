So, should we "discourage" sports too, since if you have an accident on the field you can ruin your life or even die? What about driving? Why should kids learn how to drive if they can kill themselves and others in accidents?

See what happens if you actually think your argument through?

We teach people how to do it safely, and then let them do it. Sports, driving, or sex - it's the same, just the age at which you start differs.
