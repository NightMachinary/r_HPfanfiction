I read them - but why should I answer to stuff I agree with? My whole damn point was that sex shouldn't be discouraged, and starting a post with that line was simply more fuel for the idiots who think so. As is trying to justify the whole sham. If you write page-long diatribes about how sex ed should be good and why sex when ready shouldn't be discouraged, then why can't you simply say "sex shouldn't be discouraged"?

My entire point was that you led with one stupid line, which coloured your whole post.
