I am not the person you are replying to, but I do think that it should actually be discouraged.

That said, it should not be done by saying that sex is evil and stuff, but rather by talking about the possible consequences and showing sex as something that should not be done unless one is ready to accept the consequences and pay for whatever mistakes were made; obviously, talking about alternatives (i.e. masturbation) at the same time would also be necessary. So more of a “please do not do this if you are not really ready, you can harm yourself that way; here, this is what you need to know to be ready” thing.

Because really, I think that in a lot of cases sex education as it is fails both in teaching about masturbation as a thing that is normal and acceptable (especially when it comes to girls) and about the fact that sex can have consequences, long-lasting ones, and some commonly thought to be working ways to prevent those are nothing more than misconceptions, traps for those who do not know better (like the whole “you can't get pregnant if you are a virgin” nonsense, in many cases sex education does not explicitly address stuff like that).

Edit: And when I said “discouraged”, I meant by comparison, by presenting it as something with possible consequences and with actual alternatives (masturbation) that do not have those consequences, and as something that should be taken at one's own pace rather than rushed because “everyone does it”; not explicitly by saying things that are blatantly false or by shaming the kid for thinking about it because that's probably the second worst idea there is (the worst idea period being not to tell them anything about sex).
