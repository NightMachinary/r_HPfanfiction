There is a rather large difference between knowing something is going to happen, and being ok with it. Yes, students will get into things they really shouldn't. No, it is not ok for teachers to ignore or encourage such a thing. They have a responsibility to get students through their halls as safe as possible. Education is key. Almost as important though is taking precautions to try to make it happen less. Sure, the determined ones will find a way, but if they can cut down on sex in school then there will be less incidence at school. Give the kids the tools to be safe, make sure they know that their could be consequences, STD's, Pregnancy, make sure they know that sex isn't the end all be all of relationships, make sure they have a healthy attitude, yes it feels awesome, no it doesn't mean love. Tell them to not do it at school. I don't feel like it's that crazy of a concept.

As for your question, how weird that you would even ask it. I feel like there is not real good answer to it, because either way I am advancing a weird stereotype. I will say that usually when America comes up in these sort of things it's because of lack of education, which is absolutely not what I am encouraging. Education is the first and most powerful tool when it comes to preventing teen pregnancy and disease.
