I really don't want to rise your blood pressure. I'm just taken aback and honestly curious as to why you seem to like fics like The Vanishing Cabinet, which you have praised as the best time-travel fic with a H/Hr pairing. I've read it for, I think, 3 chapters and was in a constant state of deja-vu. Its a fic written as if someone had taken some sort of ready-made copypasta template and just added a few details. I read almost exactly the same story at least two dozen times.

I say it again, I'm not judging and whatever floats your boat. I'm just honestly curious what you find endearing about these sort of fics.
