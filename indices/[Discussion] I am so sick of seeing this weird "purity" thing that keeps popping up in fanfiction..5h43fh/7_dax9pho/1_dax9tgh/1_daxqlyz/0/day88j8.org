I don't know much about him (other than that he was one of the Author AMA people), but I read part of one of his stories in which an underage Harry rapes an underage Hermione (and is still the good guy afterwards). In context, it's supposed to be justified (part of some weird ritual to make someone a slave because Hermione interferes in his life or something) but I think that he just has a different view on a lot of stuff like that.
