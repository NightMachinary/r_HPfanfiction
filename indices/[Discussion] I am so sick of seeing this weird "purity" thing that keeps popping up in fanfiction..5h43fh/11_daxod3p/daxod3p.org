Well, I have to point out that just having a woman as Prime Minister doesn't mean that the society has no hangups with regards to gender any more. India had Indira Gandhi (in the 60s, even, and then in the 70s again), but I really doubt anyone would claim with a straight face that India had no issues with gender back then. Of course, it doesn't mean that there have to be problems with sex.

I used a quite liberal wizard society - to the point that the wizards thought British muggles were prudes - in one story, to show that wizards didn't have to be stuck in the Victorian era. Of course, some critics thought that teenagers thinking a lot about sex, and talking a lot about sex, was "overdone" or "weird".
