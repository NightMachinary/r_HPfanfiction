I found one case in which purity was done in a moderately interesting way. Not having sex by the age of seventeen made you a Pure Adult, with a bevy of associated powerups. Perhaps one person per century made it to Pure Adult status.

The story is more about social relationships than anything else, and conflicts that can be resolved with power aren't the focus, but there's a fair bit of power creep. That can be grating. It also suffers from the standard problems in powerful!Harry stories: the protagonist is the only one who does anything proactive, can do no wrong, and can defeat Voldemort without the Dark Lord managing to get a shot off.

Refreshingly, it's Hermione, not Harry, who gains all these benefits. Hermione's the second most popular target for that, but that still leaves like fifty powerful!Harry stories per powerful!Hermione story.
