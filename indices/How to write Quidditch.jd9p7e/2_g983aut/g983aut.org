I find Lee Jordan's biased commentary from the books really entertaining if you're going for a comedic effect. Other than that, I've seen a few fics where someone in the stands is having a conversation, while occasionally noticing a good move or cheering which I've enjoyed.

If the scene just feels like a description of the sport or canon rehash, I tend to skim though it.
