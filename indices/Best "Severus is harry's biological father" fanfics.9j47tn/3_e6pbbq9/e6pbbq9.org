[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1963825/1/Mine][Mine]] linkffn(1963825) involves Snape rescuing 5-year-old Harry from Dursleys. There are hundreds of stories involving Snape rescuing young Harry from Dursleys but most of them are of a very questionable quality. This one is written well. Very sweet and warm story, almost too sweet but manages to stay within a reasonable level of cuteness.
