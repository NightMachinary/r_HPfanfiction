Had they hooked up, Severus wouldn't have become a death eater. Or so I would like to think. Anything is possible, we'll need to take a trip in time to find out for sure.

So just imagine, they have hooked up diverging happens to drive them apart. Lily discovers she's pregnant but doesn't tell Severus, who by the way is on a downward spiral. And then well she marries James has a kid and the rest as we know if history, until 4th/5th/6th year when the truth comes out

What happens then???
