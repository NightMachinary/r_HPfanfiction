I liked /Practicing Liars./ I thought the characterizations of Harry and Snape were interesting and worth reading. It is HP/DM preslash, which was annoying, but I still liked it and the pre-relationship stuff wasn't too overbearing. (The White Dementors in it are, in my opinion, one of the eeriest 'monsters' in HP fan fics.) linkffn(5428900)
