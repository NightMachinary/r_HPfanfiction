200k words in and the events of The Hobbit are in sight. As for his magic, Harry remains a immortal squib for quite some time. He never does regain his full power, whatever magic he does is closer to that of Gandalf. I will advice readers to get acquainted very well with the Tolkien verse via simpler fanfics before enjoying this epic.
