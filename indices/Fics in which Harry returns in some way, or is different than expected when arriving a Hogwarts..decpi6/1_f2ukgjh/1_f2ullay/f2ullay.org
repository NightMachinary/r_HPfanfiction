  When the Hogwarts letters go out in 1991, Harry Potter doesn't receive one. A year before, the Dursley family sent the child to an orphanage in London with a different name and a new identity. Growing up in London alone, Harry may escape the abuse of the Dursley's but he enters a world of neglect and handwork. When he's 13, he befriends a blue haired boy called Teddy, whom over the years becomes the closest of friends Harry could have asked for.At 16, Harry is getting on with his life just fine. He's got two jobs, college, a great group of friends and an endless supply of cigarettes to keep his hands from uncontrollably shaking. And then, Teddy's parents announce they're coming down for the week and suddenly Harry has people coming up to him saying he's supposed to be dead and that a Dark Lord is after him.
