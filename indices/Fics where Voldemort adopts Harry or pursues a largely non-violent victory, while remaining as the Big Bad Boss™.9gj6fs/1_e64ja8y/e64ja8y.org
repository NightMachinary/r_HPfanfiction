Benefits of Old Laws is the title of the story, but I can't recall the author or any other details well enough to find it again. In which Tom Riddle uses a legal dodge, an "I-was-possessed" equivalent to an insanity plea, to avoid responsibility for what he did as "Voldemort" and starts organising as a serious political movement. And also making sure Harry is properly cared for, for the first time, because reasons (which I recall being plausible in-story, albeit I can't recall much). I don't think it's complete.
