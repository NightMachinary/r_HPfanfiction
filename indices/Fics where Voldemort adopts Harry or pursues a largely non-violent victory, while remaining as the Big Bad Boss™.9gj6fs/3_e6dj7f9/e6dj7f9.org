Harry becomes Voldemort's protege, and pseudo-ward, in an unconventional fashion. The story begins in the final moments of Goblet of Fire and continues through the Half-blood prince, so there are a few action oriented confrontations towards the latter section of the story. But the majority of the violence in the end is not precipitated by Voldemort and Riddle's involvement in said events is based around keeping Harry from harm.
