Dumbledore in that fic is different from what we see in the books, but he has good intentions even if misguided. To me it's a believable -and often chilling- take on what Dumbledore could have developed into if the curse in his hand affected him more.

For me, bashing is when a character has been written so badly that they are no longer well-rounded and have been reduced to their negative flaws. So a fic can have a malevolent or manipulative Dumbledore without me considering it bashing, as long as the character is well written.
