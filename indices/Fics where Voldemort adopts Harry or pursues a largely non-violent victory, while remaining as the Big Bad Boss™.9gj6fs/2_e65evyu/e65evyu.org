"Benefits of Old Laws" is probably the largest and most well known example.

Others I've enjoyed:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/30/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][A Well Groomed Mind]] - Harry has a mental break and realizes that Everything Was a Lieâ„¢ in 4th year. He eventually meets and is adopted by Voldemort. The story has an interesting take on Voldemort's faction as more rational and humane than Dumbledore's, with some great world building. Unfortunately it also has some poorly executed Dumbledore, Ron, and James bashing.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/17/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots][Lord Voldemort and the Intricate Plots]] - Voldemort is more cautious when dealing with the prophecy. Rather than kill baby Harry, he kidnaps him and begins looking for ways to overturn the prophecy without falling into the self-fullfilling trap. Meanwhile, he keeps up the political game while putting all his more overt plots on hold.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/28/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - Voldemort successfully steals both Harry and the Philosopher's Stone at the end of 1st year. He coerces Harry into becoming his apprentice and gradually takes on a mentor/father figure role. Meanwhile, he pursues his goals in a more rational way than the first war. Contains a Dumbledore with questionable intentions, but no overt bashing.
