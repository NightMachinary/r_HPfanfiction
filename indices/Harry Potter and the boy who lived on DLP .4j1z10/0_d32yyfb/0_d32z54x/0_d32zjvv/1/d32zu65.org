Think about it this way, The WbA section of DLP is for authors to get feedback on their work from others who are active and knowledgeable in writing/reading HPFF. If you can't even be bothered to participate in the community enough to make 5 posts, why should you be given the option to read and comment on the authors' unfinished work?
