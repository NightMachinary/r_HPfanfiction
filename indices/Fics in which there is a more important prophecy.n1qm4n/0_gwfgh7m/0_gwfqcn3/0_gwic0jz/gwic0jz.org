It's not for everyone, certainly. I do think it gets more flak than it deserves, eg people getting upset about how it depicts Draco's plans to rape Luna Lovegood when he's older even though Harry is horrified by what he's hearing and wants to tear apart the Wizarding world to put a stop to that kind of thing. But not everyone is going to enjoy it, and that's okay.

It's a thought-provoking read, though.
