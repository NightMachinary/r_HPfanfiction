The Prince of Slytherin has another prophecy, and it is so much more ominous than the canon prophecy. It literally starts with the line This is how our world will end (i wouldn't consider it much of a spoiler but if you want to go in pretty much blind I'd definitely skip it).

A note for if you decide to read this fic: a lot of people (myself included) dislike the prologue, so I'd suggest reading at least the chapter after it before you make a decision on whether to continue or not.
