In /What's a Little Death between friends?/ Harry is ridiculously overpowered, to the point of being able to duel Voldemort to a standstill. It also contains the whole Lord Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin trope, which I didn't mind but you might so fair warning. On the other hand, the writing is very good and the story reads easily so I recommend it. linkffn(12101842)
