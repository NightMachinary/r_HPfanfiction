  Prompt: What about Lupin? Lupin, who lost everything the night James and Lily died, who forgave Sirius, who died in battle?--When they told him the news about Lily and James, Lupin finished the mission he was on before he went to Godric's Hollow. He stood in front of the Potters' ruined home and fell apart in the cold streets. He picked the pieces up, slowly, over years and years.In the first half hour, he remembered how to breathe. He picked up his composure sometime the next week. He patched together nights of sleep. Sometimes the stitching couldn't hold; sometimes he couldn't pull himself out of bed in the morning.Remus kept picking himself up and patching himself together. Today, he walked by a beautiful woman with long red hair and when she laughed he didn't flinch with sorrow. Today, he made a joke, the kind James would have collapsed at and Sirius would have smirked at. Remus patched himself together, scars and sorrows, kindnesses and chocolate. We are the ways we rebuild ourselves.(a brief, rambling character study of Remus Lupin)

  A post DH AU in three parts. We all craft our own happy endings. Even in the best of all possible worlds, romances decay and constellations fall from the sky, but Remus Lupin will pin them back up in a world that has already forgotten what he sacrificed.
