The funny thing is he is completely correct in the general idea when it comes to being careful about both his lycanthropy and letting people know, but he pushes it beyond what is necessary (probably because of his self-loathing/lack of self-worth). People don't treat werewolves well, and werewolves are dangerous, even beyond the full moon (what Greyback does to Bill, for example). But not all people are going to treat werewolves poorly, and outside the full moon their danger is mostly by choice/action, not mere existence.
