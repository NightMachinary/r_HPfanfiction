Well, I don't know how much it'll help and I'm not particularly eloquent, but I've always assumed he spent the first several years after Oct. 31, 1981 rather drunk, being a self-loathing werewolf who lost literally all of his actual friends in basically a three day period.

Frankly, his sense of self-worth (more accurately, lack of) pretty much explains everything we see him do. Why does he never track down Harry like some other witches and wizards (Diggle) do? Because he thinks he isn't worthy enough to go see him. It's why Harry was the one who had to first reach out to Remus for Remus to actually say anything about Lily and James. Heck, during Snape's worst memory he obviously wants to speak up about what James/Sirius are doing to Snape, but doesn't want to do anything to risk the only friendships he thinks he will ever have. The whole thing with Tonks? Lack of self-worth.
