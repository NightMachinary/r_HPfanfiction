I think this is something I'm going to explore further in my fic, which will not be about his school days but about his time in the Order until Oct. 1981 (it will be the first of a 3 part series). Remus is right that Harry only sees him around people from the Order, so I want to show that for Remus all this self-hatred and immediate assumption that people are going to treat him like shit must have come from somewhere. I think it's reasonable to assume that his first couple of years out of school he was fairly optimistic about the future - his fear of rejection at school proved to be false to a wild degree, his friends went to extraordinary lengths to accept him. I imagine then, he had allowed himself to hope that others might also accept him, that maybe his father had been overly paranoid trying to keep him hidden away, that though he may never marry or have children, he might be able to hold down a job or at the very least continue having these brilliant friends support him through his transformations. Perhaps this was when Wolfsbane was invented too. The future must have looked, perhaps not bright, but steadily improving. But then, as the war continued and he tried to stand on his own two feet, he was faced with prejudice and discrimination at every turn, he has a series of jobs that eventually turn into unemployment when he can't get good references, Wolfsbane was expensive to buy and difficult/dangerous to make, and then in one fell swoop he loses his entire support network. With Lily, James, Peter and Sirius gone, not only has he lost his closest friends, but there's no need for the Order of the Phoenix anymore. It's disanded, and the only constant thing close to work he's had is over. Because of all this, he ends up pushing his careful management of his condition to the extreme we see later.
