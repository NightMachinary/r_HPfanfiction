I just find Remus a hard character to write, even though I love him, so I've been looking for in depth insights into his character that smarter people than me have created, or little headcanons (that actually seem plausible), or fan art that doesn't have big scars across his face (harder than you'd think). The Pottermore writings have been really helpful and I've been writing out his dialogue from POA to gain a good sense of the way he speaks, but I still don't feel like I know him very well, which has slowed down my planning a lot. want to do the fic for NaNoWriMo so I'm running out of time!
