I agree completely with this as well. There was a really good write up about Remus in this one subreddit I found called HPrankdown which basically ranks all the HP characters while giving them thorough analyses. I absolutely loved the one for Remus. If you want to check it out, here's the link: [[https://m.reddit.com/r/HPRankdown/comments/4fb9ri/remus_lupin/?ref=search_posts]]

Good luck on your story, I can't wait to read it!
