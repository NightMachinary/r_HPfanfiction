It's especially prevalent in wolfstar fan stuff. They make Sirius really camp and bitchy (which, wtf, bit homophobic??) and Remus just horribly drippy and twee (and don't forget the insecurity about his facial scars which are never mentioned in the books!) Wolfstar shippers are worse than Dramione shippers, there, I said it.

It's driving me up the wall because I'm trying to do research for a Remus Lupin fic and all I find on reddit is lots of Lupin bashing and all I find on tumblr is wolfstar cheese.
