  fandom completely brutalised Remus and Sirius's personalities and always make them do corny stuff like this

Exactly. In canon, neither of them /do/ corny. In fact, they both seem to have a bit of a hard edge, though Remus hides it unless he needs it (Flight of 7 Potters kill the enemies thing, Shrieking Shack) and Sirius doesn't flaunt it or hide it.
