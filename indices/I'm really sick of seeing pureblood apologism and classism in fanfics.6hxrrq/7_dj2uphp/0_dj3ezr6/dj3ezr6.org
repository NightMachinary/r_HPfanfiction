Exactly. I'd like to read a fic where Harry is raised by Death Eaters, and actually practices the views he was raised by. Instead we get tons of fics where he's raised by Voldemort but changes his mind on blood purity because Hermione gets good grades.

I'd just like to read something /new/, you know?
