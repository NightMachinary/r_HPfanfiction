We see the book through Harry's eyes -- so we're bound to miss out on a lot of how the wizarding world works. He doesn't have to worry about blood purity (as Hermione said in book 6), and for most of the books he's too young anyway to see the effects of blood purity on wizarding society.

Now, the comparison I often make in my mind is "pureblood vs muggleborn" to "citizen vs immigrant". Imagine wizarding society as its own country with very strict citizenship rules -- you're either grandfathered in, or your family has to spend several generations as productive members in wizarding society and/or marry purebloods to become a proper citizen. Much of the blood purity stuff has explanations then:

High level Ministry posts are restricted to 'citizens', much like the law requires in the UK and most countries in the world. The Wizengamot, comparable to the House of Lords, is either hereditary or appointed, so naturally its members are mostly purebloods. There may even be laws favoring purebloods for employment, like most countries in the world, that prioritises employing ‘citizens' over ‘immigrants'.

Voldemort and the Death Eaters are akin to a fascist movement that seeks to restore power to the citizens of the wizarding world (which may exclude House Elves and other sentient magical creatures) and enact far harsher immigration laws. They may also fear losing their traditional values to a new wave of immigrant culture due to, perhaps, a surge of muggleborns following WWII?

There is no canonical evidence for difference in magical ability due to blood purity, but neither is there empirical evidence for the contrary (i.e. blood purity doesn't affect magical power at all). So the question of blood purity is reduced to an arbitrary definition of ‘citizenship' defined by the citizens, which would naturally be exclusive, as the wizarding equivalent of the Enlightenment hasn't seemed to have happened.

So why hasn't it? Why haven't the muggleborns risen up demanding more rights? It is possible that they have and were repressed, but it is also possible that there was never an opportunity. After all, it is far easier to leave Wizarding Britain than any physical country. Perhaps a wave of disillusioned muggleborns returning to their old lives leads to purebloods condemning all muggleborns as ‘unable to fit in with wizarding culture' and so began a vicious cycle.
