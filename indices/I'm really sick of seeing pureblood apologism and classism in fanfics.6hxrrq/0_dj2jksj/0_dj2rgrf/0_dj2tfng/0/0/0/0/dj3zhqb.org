Also magical society doesn't seem to want any mixing. People don't seem to be able to live with both, they almost all seem to choose one or the other, and for muggleborns, it looks pretty limiting. You wanted to be an animator or astronaut or whatever...sorry, we don't have those. You can teach or work for the government or learn a trade, and by the way nepotism is how we do it around here. And you can't do anything with computers because haha we naturally interfere with electronics like big ol' magnets. If I had been a muggleborn wizard, I don't think I would have stayed in that world after I was allowed to do magic unsupervised, and I would have some serious questions about it if my eternally hypothetical kids were invited to join it.
