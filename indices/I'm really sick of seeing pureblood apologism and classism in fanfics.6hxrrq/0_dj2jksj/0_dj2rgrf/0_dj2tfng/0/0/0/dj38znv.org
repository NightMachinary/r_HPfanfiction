They're born magical. They aren't born into the wizarding world. How would you bring muggleborns into wizarding society? You could force them to integrate at an earlier age because then you've violated the parents' rights, and the muggleborn child's right to their muggle culture. You could make it a choice for parents, but then you've got parents who will refuse and muggleborn kids still end up basically immigrating at 11. Not to mention the potential secrecy violations from having little kids running around sharing with their muggle friends. Magic doesn't simplify social problems. It just changes them.
