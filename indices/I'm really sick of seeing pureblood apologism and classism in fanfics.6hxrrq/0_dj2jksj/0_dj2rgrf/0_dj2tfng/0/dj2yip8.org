They aren't born into the magical society though; they are born into muggle society and raised there, insiders to Muggle culture. They are basically randomly selected and given the choice of joining this secret magical world when they're eleven, and very little seems to be done to ease them through any culture shock or help them integrate. They are told that what they grew up with is inferior and their familes are looked down on, thought of as subhuman and inferior. They are pushed to leave their own world behind. People move countries for a variety of reasons, but usually to improve their life. Muggleborns join the magical society to improve their lives and learn to use a gift that has just appeared for no apparent reason, and most of them join with optimism, hoping for acceptance and to feel at home among other magic users. I don't know if you have ever been treated like a stupid foreigner in a country you've lived in, but it kind of sucks.
