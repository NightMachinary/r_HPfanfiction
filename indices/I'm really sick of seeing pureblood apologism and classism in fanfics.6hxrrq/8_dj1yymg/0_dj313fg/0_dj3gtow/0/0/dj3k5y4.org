Get real. DE's killed muggleborns for being muggleborns. Just like Nazis killed jews for being jews.

Hermione is not Robbespierre. Robbespierre didn't have Veritaserum to ensure that they didn't execute innocents (and yes, Veritaserum is not perfect, it can be fooled - but even if a few guilty can escape, it still means no innocents are getting condemned). Hermione and co. were ruthless, and brutal, but not by far to the extent of the atrocities committed by the Death Eaters. And as the story shows, the radical changes end up being tempered, and Harry/Hermione realise just where they are headed, and step down, before they start killing innocents for convenience or out of paranoia. But yes, they are damaged people. Fighting a war as children, getting tortured, killing people, and seeing friends get killed, will often do that to someone.
