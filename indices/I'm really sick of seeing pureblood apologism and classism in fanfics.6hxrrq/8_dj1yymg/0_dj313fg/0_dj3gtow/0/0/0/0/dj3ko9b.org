Kingsley accepted a Marriage Law and let it be enforced by the Ministry's Aurors. That's pretty much legalising and enforcing rape.

The fic shows each scene through the biased viewpoint of a character, with many of them being teenagers with PTSD blaming everyone they can for whatever bad happened to them. Draco thinks that Harry and co. had been abusing Felix Felicis all the time. Harry and Hermione blame Dumbledore (and rant at a stupid portrait) for all that went wrong in the war against Voldemort. The Tsar thinks that he has the sacred duty to preserve the pureblood way of life, and keep the filthy mudbloods oppressed. Augusta Longbottom thinks that should she try to preserve her own way of life she'll be killed. The Prime Minister thinks he can take control of the "rebellious province" now that they have been weakened. Percy thinks that the current "muggle culture good, wizard culture bad" view will soon change once the muggle laws meet magical reality and will be judged wanting because you can't simply transport muggle laws to Wizarding Britain.

Does't mean any of them is correct. Doesn't mean that all of them are wrong either. Other than those who think that muggleborns are worth less than purebloods and should be oppressed. Those are wrong.

And it's not muggleborns vs. purebloods - it's muggleborns, half-bloods and purebloods versus pureblood bigots. Krum is dragged into his own revolution in Bulgaria, which is not really split along the muggleborn/pureblood lines. The Prussians have a three-way civil war. Poles fight against Russians. The French have their own revolution, with the Delacours outmaneuvering the muggleborn leaders. Ron, Ginny, Neville and co. distinguish themselves in the war in Europe, with Ron arguably becoming the most famous war hero, outshining Harry and Hermione.

Even the pureblood aristocrats fighting for their right to oppress muggleborns have their good sides, with the Tsar making a difficult but ultimately noble choice at the end - in line with his views.

Draco hasn't any redeeming features, though.
