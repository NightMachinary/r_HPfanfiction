That's why I don't read many SlytherinHarry fics. They tend to idealize the so called pureblood values and bigot attitudes.

If you want the complete oposite to this pureblood loving fics, you must read linkffn(hermione granger and the marriage law revolution). Where all this elitist non sense is purged like in the French Reign of Terror.
