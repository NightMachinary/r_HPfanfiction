its because Rowling repeatedly said that not all slytherins are evil, but she still made every slytherin boy in harrys year a blood purist. even slughorn and snape, who are used as examples for good slytherins, seem to agree with blood purity to a certain degree.

So either blood purity is as stupid as is sounds in the books and makes everyone who believes in it basically a idiot , or you base it on realistic problems and have the death eaters be extremist of a cause thats partly understandable
