The real or perceived elimination of ones own culture by an (seemingly) powerful authority or movement is the cause of conflict of all kinds throughout the world.

If we assume that Dumbledore and his buddies are this perceived authority, the people who would rather celebrate Yule than Christmas would probably rally towards a countermovement. The inherent injustice, corruption, or lip service of this countermovement's ideals is then often secondary, as long as it counters the perceived threat to one's own culture.

The Death Eaters are only the peak of this countermovement that (and I'm adding worldbuilding here for the sake of argument) arose from a wide-spread fear of loosing magical customs and identity to a movement that endorses muggle festivities. They are like the KKK in that they're building on a foundation of culturally accepted, but by far not as volatile and violent racism. Understandable? I think so. Excusable? Of course not.

Its a simple thing to accept that humans never do anything without a reason. That reason can be profoundly philosophic in nature, or instinctual. Its also well understood that this reason does not need to make objective sense, but only needs to be subjectively sound - at the very least.
