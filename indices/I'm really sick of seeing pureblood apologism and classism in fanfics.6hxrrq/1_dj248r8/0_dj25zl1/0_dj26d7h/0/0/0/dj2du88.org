And people understand that they see a muggleborns blood as lesser than a person born into a wizarding family. That isn't hard to understand, sure it's completely ridiculous when you look at say Hermione in the books but then again you have racists who believe black people are are born genetically and mentally inferior even though you have so many signs that point to that being a stupid belief as well.

Edit: I'm really unsure what people are struggling to get here there are real tangible examples of hate in the real world where people believe people are lesser due to the colour of their skin or sexual preference. I have no idea why people think the wizarding world would be so different.
