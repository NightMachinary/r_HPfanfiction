But "they're not like us, they're..." is already a subjectively sound reason for many people to (violently) hate others. You don't need culture clash, you don't need some perceived oppression or whatever, you don't even need muggleborns to bring parts of their culture into Wizarding Britain. Even if all muggleborns aped magical culture, their origin would still be enough for the bigots to hate them because their blood is seen as impure.
