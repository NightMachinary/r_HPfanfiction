because there is even less base for the racism in the books than their should be.

realistically speaking there should be a difference between muggleborns and purebloods, because they are basically foreigners introduced to a new country and they should at least do worse in school in the first couple of years.and people like the malfoys would most definitely make sure their child is taught some magic before they are accepted into hogwarts and during the holidays.

but in the books there is literally no difference between people of magical and muggle families except minor cultural ones. there is no difference in accents, nothing in terms of education, they even look the same and seem to have the same customs. And even what we know of the history of the founders suggest that muggle born were merely considered not trustworthy. And if you consider pottermore canon than we know that until the statue of secrecy 300 years ago even the malfoys intermarried with muggleborns and muggles if they were rich enough.

It makes no sense that blood purity exist in circumstances like they are shown in the books.

and the diffrence between white supremacy and blood purity is that the former at least attempts to prove that they are better by using flawed logic and statistics that show a difference( which normally can be explained by other reasons than ethnicity)
