There's often some root cause or underlying conflict behind racism or prejudice. Humans need to have some rationale for what they're doing. It might not even be true (often it isnt) but we dont even get that in canon.

Evidently there's a large majority that, while not death eaters, are slightly prejudiced against Muggleborns. And that's certainly true of Modern society as well (in the Us for example there is a lot of institutional/subconcious bias against minorities, even when outright racism is looked down upon).

I'd be interested in a fic that explores this. What do the wizards that aren't death eaters but are slightly prejudiced against muggle borns tell themselves? What are the dog whistles?
