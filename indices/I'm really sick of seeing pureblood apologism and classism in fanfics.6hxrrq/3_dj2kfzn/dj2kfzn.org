There's a reason most of society no longer goes by Victorian error super traditional culture anymore. It's because it's fucking dumb bullshit. So I agree fics that make gryfindors and muggleborns out to be uncivilized philistines since they don't obey unnecessarily complicated etiquetteâ€‹ and courtship rules are overdone and usually annoying. I also don't remember any canon evidence of that even being a thing, Malfoy certainly didn't act like it was.
