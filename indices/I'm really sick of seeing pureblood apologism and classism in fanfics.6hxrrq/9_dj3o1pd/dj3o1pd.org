It would be very strange if all purebloods were the same, and had the same ideology. I like fics that make the difference between a traditional ideology and the blood purity ideology.\\
There's a good chance that those will overlap to a point since it stands to reason that purebloods are more likely to be traditionalists and also more likely to be blood purists.\\
Muggleborns, coming from a different culture, are more likely to be progressists.\\
It is only logical that you would find different factions between the purebloods and also between the muggleborns.\\
Actually, a political faction that promotes a traditionalist lifestyle and political stance while being willing to include the muggleborns to society makes a lot of sense. It seems like a classic moderate right political stance to me.
