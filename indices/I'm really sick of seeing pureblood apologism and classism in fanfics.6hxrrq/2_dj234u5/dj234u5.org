The worst is when people somehow make out that muggles/muggleborns/halfbloods/whoever else the raving, racist terrorist brigade despise are the actual bad guys, that fear of nuclear annihilation (for example) is enough reason for Voldemort to murder a whole bunch of people and take over the Ministry, /for the protection of wizardkind./

The Death Eaters and Voldemort have parallels in their ideology with the Nazis (particularly the SS), and it really bothers me that so many authors don't seem to see that. Political conservatism isn't wrong. Preserving tradition and tempering reform isn't wrong. Classifying people by their quality of blood, and treating anyone who's not in your special inbred corner as second class, murdering or throwing them in prison when you have the power, and otherwise causing murder and mayhem /is definitely wrong./

On top of that, class is a boring and overdone trope not just in HP fanfiction, but in literature in general, since everyone just looks at Marx and Engels' work and loses their minds, demanding that everyone seize the means of production and free the proletariat, and more often than not end up sounding just like Robbespierre with how much they want to put one group or other to death.

In Harry Potter, the pureblood faction is mostly a bunch of violent, sadistic, racist scumbags, and short of a full AU (which is fine to do, by the way) should never be apologised for.

By doing so, some authors (depending on the angle from which they present their apologia from), end up /indirectly apologising for the fucking Nazis, just like people who do the House-Elf bond trope do for slavery./
