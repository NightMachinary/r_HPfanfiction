  just like people who do the House-Elf bond trope do for slavery.

Eeh... I wouldn't go that far. The fact that they're an entirely different species gives some leeway. I'm completely on your side when it goes into "OMG Hermione, you so dumb, you're trying to murder them" territory. Any muggleborn would not be comfortable with treating any sentient, emphatic and intelligent species like the house-elves the way wizards do. Therefore its understandable and admirable that Hermione goes in the field of activism against this perceived wrong.

But I'll accept any good explanation by an author that makes the elves out to be symbiotic or parasitic by nature. I myself have a fic in which house-elves are merely those that get their magic from humans. I described woodelves as hanging around Centaurs, Fauns and Nymphs. Rock-elves gather their magic from giants and trolls. Imps get it from vampires and Lich. They're a different species. I don't see why they can't be symbiotic in nature.
