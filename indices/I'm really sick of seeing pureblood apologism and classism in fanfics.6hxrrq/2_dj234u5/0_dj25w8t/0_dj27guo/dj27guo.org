Okay, I was more than a bit general there, I think the real issue is that even if it is necessary, many authors don't see fit to allow Hermione to push for Elf rights or whatever, and like you say, have Harry smack her opinions down and generally be a condescending asshole. It doesn't matter so much if they're symbiotic or not, but treating them as less than human and somehow ignoring their rights and explaining it using the symbiosis as an excuse is despicable.
