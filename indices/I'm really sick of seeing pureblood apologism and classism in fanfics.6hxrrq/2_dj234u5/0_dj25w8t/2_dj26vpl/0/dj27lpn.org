But the only one who has ever called it slavery was a muggleborn - Hermione. Given what elves she meets in her lifetime, that's probably the right thing to call it, too, from her perspective. If we assume that house-elves are symbionts or parasites, the wish of Dobby to be free is almost like he's suicidal. Crouch banishing Winky would be to deliberately ask her to go and die.

But as far as we know, there are also quite a few elves who are perfectly happy with and defensive about their life, because their symbiotic bond (or whatever you want to call it) isn't corrupted by an unequal power-balance. As is the case of Hogwarts house-elves.

My explanation in my own fic, is that the human - elf bond corruption is a relatively new problem arising through an influential, but due to his own upbringing rather ignorant Dark Lord. As I stated before, muggleborn and muggleraised could easily mistake a symbiotic bond for enslavement and act according to their own principles and values. People like Hermione would then go against the perceived wrong and try to free the elves. Voldemort would thrive on it and misuse the power he has over the symbionts. Both paths don't end well for the elves.

I'll completely agree that we're walking a fine line between mutual agreement, with one side being in command, and enslavement with one side being in power. Its also a fantastical - imaginary line. Its impossible to compare a sentient-sentient symbiotic relationship with a real one. We humans live in plenty of symbiotic relationships with other species - most noticeable dogs, who over time have learned to read our expressions and moods. However, there is (obviously) no symbiotic relationship with any other sentient species we could compare the house-elve to humans one to. Its only assumptions I make on "What if,..." questions that lead me to think that calling this relationship slavery is just not correct. So I personally call the systematic abuse of house-elves a bond-corruption.
