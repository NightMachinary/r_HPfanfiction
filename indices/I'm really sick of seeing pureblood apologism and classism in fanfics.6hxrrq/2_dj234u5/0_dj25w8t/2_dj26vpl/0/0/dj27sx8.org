If they are treated as property, have no rights and cannot leave someone's employ when they want to, then it's slavery. That Hermione is the only one to call it that just means that either everyone else is a dumb idiot, an evil asshole, or both - or that JKR fucked up her world building and characterisation, again.

Being dependent on someone doesn't give them any right to enslave you. Hermione trying to free the elves is completely in the right - as Dobby proves, they can work for others out of their own free will, without dying or needing to be enslaved.

I really wish people would stop making up reasons to excuse house-elf slavery.
