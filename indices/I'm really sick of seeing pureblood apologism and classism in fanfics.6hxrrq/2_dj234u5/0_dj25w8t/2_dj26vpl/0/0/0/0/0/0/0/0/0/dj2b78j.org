Did I say one could? I'm trying to say there's no information on the nature of house elves and their relationship with wizards. For all we know they could be magically perfected slaves of a type of wild magical creature. Or they could be physical manifestations of the magic of a wizard house, and devotion to a family depends on how well the elf is treated, or at least perceives itself to be treated.
