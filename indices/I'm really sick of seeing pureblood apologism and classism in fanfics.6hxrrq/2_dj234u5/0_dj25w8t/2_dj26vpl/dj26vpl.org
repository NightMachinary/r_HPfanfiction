It's still inexcuseable apologism for slavery no matter what. Even if House-elves needed wizards to survive or were symbiots, that's no excuse, none at all, to enslave them. Babies utterly depend on adults to survive, yet if anyone would claim that means they were property, he'd be rightfully condemned.
