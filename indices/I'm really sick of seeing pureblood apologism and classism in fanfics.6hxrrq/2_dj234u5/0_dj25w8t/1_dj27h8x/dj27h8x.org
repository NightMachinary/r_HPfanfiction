  Eeh... I wouldn't go that far. The fact that they're an entirely different species gives some leeway.

We know for a fact that every house-elf we see outside of Hogwarts (Dobby, Winky) is at least kinda unhappy, one going as far as hurting himself just to disobey, and literally dying for the one who freed him.

So I find it really hard to say it's not slavery. They are forced to obey, can't get out, and sometimes hate it. It's really not cool.
