I'm not saying that its /not/ slavery. I'm just saying that I'll accept authors writing it as something else.

If the house-elves would be humans, there's no question about it. We know humans don't get anything out of the labor the house-elves do, if they're not paid or otherwise compensated, let alone mistreated like the prominent examples presented to us.

On the other side, if an author writes that its totally slavery and the wizards have subjugated, degenerated and enslaved an entire species, I'll also accept it as fact of the current story.

I just dislike the absolute position that it /must/ be slavery no matter what.
