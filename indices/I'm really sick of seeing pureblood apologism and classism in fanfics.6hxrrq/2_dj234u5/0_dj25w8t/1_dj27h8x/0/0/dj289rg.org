Yeah, I just said that it's hard for me to say that.

What makes it especially bitter is that a lot of the authors who do the "house-elf-bond"-thing also usually are pureblood-apolgists: "The mudbloods ruin our culture, so we must kill them!" (They'd never phrase it that way, but c'mon)

I just dislike this kind of fic severly, because very often it feels like the author has put no thoughts in the implications of what he's writing down, and hasn't thought things through.
