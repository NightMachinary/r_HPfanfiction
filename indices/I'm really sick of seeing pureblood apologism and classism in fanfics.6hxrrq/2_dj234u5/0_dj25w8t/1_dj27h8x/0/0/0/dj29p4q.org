Yes, I know that the house-elve bond thing has a bit of a fandom induced vibe to it, since its often seen in combination with those glorifications of a blatantly racist and genocidal mindsets. I also greatly dislike this genre - if you can call it a genre.

Unfortunately there aren't enough fics out there with well thought out worldbuilding.
