Why is the only correct interpretation "Death Eaters are Nazis, so they must be the bad guys in the fic". If I portray a sympathetic DE, does that make me a Nazi apologist? Can't it just be a story I wanted to write? Does everything I write reflect my own views? Am I not allowed to explore other points of view? Say I just want to make DEs the heroes and write a story where the view presented is that they're right. I can't do that?
