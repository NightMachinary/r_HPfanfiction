It's alright, I suppose I /am/ being very absolutist here. I've looked into it, and Rowling flip-flops a little on this issue, but she does say she drew (and in some ways inadvertently) a lot of inspiration from Nazi Germany, among other totalitarian and racist ideologies.

  "Well, it is a political metaphor. But... I didn't sit down and think, 'I want to recreate Nazi Germany', in the---in the wizarding world. Because---although there are---quite consciously overtones of Nazi Germany, there are also associations with other political situations. So I can't really single one out."

Rowling based Voldemort on Hitler and Stalin (interview with a Dutch magazine in 2007).

[On the inclusion of the 'blood' system, independently devised before she was aware of its parallels with Nazism]

  "...some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to notice the similarity."

Harry Potter is full of political messages, overtones and undertones, but in blunt analysis of the Death Eaters and Voldemort's ideology, I choose to interpret it as a parallel of Nazism. Of course, there are other arguments to be made that it more closely mirrors 'traditional' racism or the arguments put forward by intellectuals to justify the slave trade.

So, I'll admit now that I was wrong in saying it is the canon interpretation of the Death Eaters, because Rowling doesn't commit to clearly saying so. However, with the way that the Voldemort Ministry force genealogy tests on the population to determine the amount of non-wizarding blood in them, coupled with the way they represent muggles in the pamphlets Harry sees when he's heading to Umbridge's Office, I feel that the blood purists lend themselves most strongly to Nazism.

Hope that gave you some food for thought, and sorry again for being quite so blunt and aggressive in my arguing.
