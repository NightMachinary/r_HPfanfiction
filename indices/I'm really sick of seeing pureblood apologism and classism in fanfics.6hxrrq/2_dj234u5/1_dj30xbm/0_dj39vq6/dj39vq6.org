Well, technically it's not the only 'correct' interpretation, but authors seem to forget that it's the canon interpretation. DEs /are/ parallel to the Nazis, just like Harry has his mother's eyes or Snape's hair is greasy.

But anyway, my first comment was rather angry, as this issue has irritated me in the past, but as a result I never actually got across my main point.

I'm not advocating censorship, although it absolutely sounds like I am. What you write doesn't have to reflect your real opinion, and it's absolutely your right to write whatever you want. If you decided to defend the Purebloods, it wouldn't make you a Nazi apologist straightaway, and any interpretation of your work would depend on how you approached defending them. If you just went out there and said, "I think they were correct, I think all mudbloods should be killed, go Voldemort!" then by openly supporting their racist views - and crucially - /trying to convince the reader that that racism is somehow correct/ then I can see immediately why people would interpret those arguments badly.

What I'm hoping for in voicing my perspective on how apologism for the Purebloods /can/ sound is for more authors to consider their words, and the way in which they present obviously evil characters like the DEs as sympathetic, the protagonists, or like you said, even heroes. Taking HP canon as-is, not changing a thing but then somehow insinuating that the DEs are the good-guys is just poor writing, to me, and it takes considerable effort (in my reading experience anyhow, as I'm not a great writer) for an author to present such a blatantly antagonistic character/faction as something the reader should be supporting.

For Pureblood apologism to truly work, I believe that the author would have to build an AU around that premise, where they both construct and then explore the reasoning behind them joining Voldemort's little weekend murder-club, and construct a narrative where it would truly be the best decision to preserve their way of life/kill all the mudbloods/take over the world, etc.

Readers would need to /understand/ the characters and their motivations like in any other story, and I feel that much of the Pureblood apologism that takes place right now makes no effort to actually attempt that.

And all of that said, I'd never actually call you a Nazi apologist unless you actually started defending their ideology/actions, in the same way that everyone condemned that one weird guy on here who kept trying to use rape in stories and justify it.
