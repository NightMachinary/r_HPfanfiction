Persoanlly, I rather liked the way it was done in The Bladk Heir, amd Vindico Atrum. Here, there were perfectly valid reasons for hatred between light wkzards, mugleborns, and dark wizards but they were understood by relatively few people. It has been a while since I read them and Vindico Atrum is abandoned but I seem to remember that Harry did not want to ezterminate muggles and muggleborns, but did want to stop interbreeding for a very good reason that was not just 'weak muggleborn filth'.
