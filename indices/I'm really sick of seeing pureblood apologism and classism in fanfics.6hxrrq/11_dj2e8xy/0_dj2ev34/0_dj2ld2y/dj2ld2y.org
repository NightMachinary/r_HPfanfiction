One word: 'magic'. The reason concerned different types of 'magic' and the negative effects of interbreeding on the existence of those types of marriage. On this basis.... yes, they are perfectly valid. Imagine a particular ethnic group had a distinctive type of magic which would be destroyed and not replaced by something new if they interbred with another ethnic group. Now, there is a decent reason to not mix and procreate together while still living with each other. In the stories I mentionned, it was not so much racism, as protectivism and 'magicism'.
