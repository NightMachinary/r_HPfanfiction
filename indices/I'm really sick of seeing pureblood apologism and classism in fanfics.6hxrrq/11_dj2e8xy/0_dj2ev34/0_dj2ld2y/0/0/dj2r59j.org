Indeed, in cannon, no such differences are present. That is why I did not mention cannon.

And no, it is not. Racism is 'prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.' this is not the same thing at all. Whilethere is racism in the fics I mentionmed, what I am talking about in regards to Harry and magic is not racism. Two siblinngs should not have children with each other because of the negative concequences. The same is true, in the fics, for light wozards, dark wizards, and neutral (muggleborn) wizards. The true racism which calls for the elimination of allmuggles a d muggleborns is, to my knowledge, condemned in the fics as racist nonsense. The prevention of harmful interbreeding is quite different and makes sense in the context of the fics. To my mind, you cannot simply condemn the stories as racist drivel because of how it handles and explains the issues. I suggest that you read them and see for yourself.
