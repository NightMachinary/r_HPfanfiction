It is not bigotry in the context created within the story. Also, here is a massive difference: this is fiction and made up groups. These are different worlds. Things are not the same. Therefore, what seems idiotic to us for logical, scientific reasons, may be utterly redundant in these worlds. This is especially true when MAGIC exists. This is racism: 'All black people should die necause they are all rapists.' That is a stupid, illogical statement with no scoentific or statistical basis. This is not racist: 'Dark wizards should not have children with muggleborns because then 'dark' magic becomes 'neutral' magic which means x,y,z and is bad for a,b,c reasons. We know this from research and the fact that a god, yes a real one, showed us that it is true.' See the difference? Idiocy promoting genocide vs a segregation of procreation based on a sensible reason backed up with evidence.
