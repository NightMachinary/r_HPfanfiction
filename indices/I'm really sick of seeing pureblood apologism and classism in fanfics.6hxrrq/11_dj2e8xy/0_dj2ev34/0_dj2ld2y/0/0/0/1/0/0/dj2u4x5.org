Real life vs fiction which creates an interesting story without harming anyone... reasonable borth control vs illogical discrimination.... A stroy where a clear distinction is made between Harry, who wants to control who does what in order to protect magic, and Voldemort who just wants to kill anything vaguely muggle because... he is a little bit nuts vs real life racism where you get apartheid, the holocaust, purges, etc...

Yeah... no differences at all...
