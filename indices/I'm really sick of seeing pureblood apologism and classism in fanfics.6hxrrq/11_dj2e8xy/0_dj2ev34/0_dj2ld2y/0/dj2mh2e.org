But in canon, there is no such difference. The most powerful/skilled/talented wizards and witches are either half-bloods or muggleborns (Dumbledore, Voldemort, Snape, Hermione).

So, if a story makes up such a difference, like magic vanishing, it's the same as a story inventing some negative effects of African-American and whites having kids together. And such a story would be rightfully condemned as racist drivel, not lauded as having "very valid reasons" to keep them apart.
