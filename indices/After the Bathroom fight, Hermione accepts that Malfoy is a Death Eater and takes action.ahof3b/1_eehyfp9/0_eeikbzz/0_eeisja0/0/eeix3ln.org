Thanks.

No Longer Alone, which is a PoA divergence where Harry ends up adopted by the Tonks family after the school year. Family/friendship-focused, a lot of emphasis on the characters, not so much action. Follows the stations of canon loosely, a greater divergence is scheduled for the chapter After the First Task.

Dawn of Darkness is the sixth year divergence I mentioned above. Basically, Harry takes Tonks to Slughorn's Christmas party because he needs some insights on the Horcruxes and what os going on. After waking up in her bed the next day, they agree that Harry should stay for the holidays and there is romantic fluff while more and more of the main plot is set in place, with the Ministry seemingly cracking down on random people and the Minister centralising power. After a spot of trouble, the pair decides to get out of Britain to figure out what the hell is going on. I was very dissatisfied with the first chapter and rewrote it three times before going back to writing the next update.
