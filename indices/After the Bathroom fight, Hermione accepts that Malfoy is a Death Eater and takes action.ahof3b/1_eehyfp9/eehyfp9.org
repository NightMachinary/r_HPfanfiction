Dude, I really wish I could contribute an answer as that's a really underused scene to flip Hermione's view on the subject. Though, so much of HBP was contrived angst that severely hurt the characters and their development so I guess a lot of scenes could've turned out to help resolve issues if JKR hadn't wanted the plot to turn that way. H/Hr fics could start here, H & Hr friendships or counter-attacks against Malfoy, Dumbledore, Snape, etc could also start here.

I'll let you know if I ever find anything but maybe that's a good place to start your own story? HBP is a bit untouched compared to other books for story starts.
