Even if Hermione believed Harry, was there anything she could do? I mean Hermione would probably expect Dumbledore to do something about it and we know he didn't.

Anyway, Harry and Hermione take action against Malfoy and Snape in this one. Warning: Don't expect them to be soft with Death Eaters as they were in canon. They're pretty OOC.
