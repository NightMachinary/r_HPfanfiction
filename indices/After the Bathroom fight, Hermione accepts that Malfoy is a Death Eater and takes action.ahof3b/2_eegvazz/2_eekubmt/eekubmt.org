Interesting fic. I don't think that it's an implausible evolution for both Harry and Hermione to go Dark as a result of Ron's death. Harry is already pretty impulsive when it comes to the Dark Arts, and with Hermione, I think that once she convinces herself that murder is the answer, she'll go all-in on murder and not second-guess herself. The character dynamic that results also makes a lot of sense. (I.e., *Harry:* DIEDIEDIE! /Avada-/ *Hermione:* [after a nonverbal /Expelliarmus/ disarming Harry] No, not yet, Harry. This scum is more useful to us alive, for now.)

It's also refreshing that the fic doesn't undersell Hermione's talents and abilities the way a lot of Ruthless!Harry fics do: notice how Hermione casually casts most of her non-Unforgivables nonverbally and is usually the one to cast the more complex spells.
