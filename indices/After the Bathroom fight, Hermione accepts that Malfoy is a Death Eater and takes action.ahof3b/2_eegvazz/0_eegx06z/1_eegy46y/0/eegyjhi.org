Dumbledore cannot interfere if he does not know what is up. And she had no issues going against authority, just look at the dash for the PS, the casual violation of the laws of time travelling, her complete disregard for Umbridge and her decrees and her overall rejection of Voldemort's Ministry.

Admittedly, it takes a lot to push her to do so, but Hermione is definitely willing to defy authority if she sees the need to do so.
