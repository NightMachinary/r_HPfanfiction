There was a very good reason (though not one the trio considered): escalating the fight against the regime would have been a very bad idea.

The Death Eater regime was confident in its supremacy, slow, bureaucratic, eager to preserve some veneer of legitimacy, taking its time. They would arrest known allies and associates of Harry Potter and then just let them go. (See Lupin's news in Chapter 11 of DH.) They would content themselves with taking the Muggleborns' wands, only killing those who resisted. They did nothing to secure the Ministry against infiltration. Voldemort wandered around Europe, looking for the Elder Wand, instead of hunting down the non-Potter enemies of the regime.

If the good guys started killing Death Eaters, all that could change very quickly.
