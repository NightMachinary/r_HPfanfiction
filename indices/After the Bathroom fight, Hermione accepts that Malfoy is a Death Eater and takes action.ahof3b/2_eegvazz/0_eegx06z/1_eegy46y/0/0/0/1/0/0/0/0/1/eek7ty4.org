It's debatable what the optimal action would have been given the protagonists' knowledge, resources, skills, and time constraints, but it made the most sense in character. The trio are not child soldiers.

As you know, I like powerful!Hermione as much as the next reader, but what you are suggesting as an alternative sounds like it may well be beyond her capabilities---especially since she doesn't know either of these people, unlike her parents, and doesn't know whether or not either of them knows Occlumency, for example---with potential to backfire badly.
