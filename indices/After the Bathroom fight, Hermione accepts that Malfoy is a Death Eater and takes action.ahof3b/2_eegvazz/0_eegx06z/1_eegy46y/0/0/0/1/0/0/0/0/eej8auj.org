I loathe that scene. It shows pretty much everything that's wrong with DH - the characters suddenly get the idiot ball and make up shitty excuses just so they don't do the right thing and remove two mass-murderers from the war. If they didn't want to kill them, then Hermione should have replaced their personalities as she did with her parents and turned them into good guys who think they are undercover spies.
