This. Exactly this.

They have absolutely no reason to spare those Death Eaters. Kill them and transfigure their bodies to hide the evidence, or wreck their god-damned memories. There is a civil war going on and they've lost control of the government. There is no just court of law or due process that could hold the Death Eaters accountable anymore. The trio should've learned their lessons and killed them.

And Dolohov kills Remus in the Battle of Hogwarts. There's no knowing how many lives could've been spared had they acted.
