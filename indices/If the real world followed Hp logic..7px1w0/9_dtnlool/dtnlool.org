Late to the game here, but I think it makes sense with context.

The wizarding population is /tiny./ Britain all together is only about 3000 wizards. They can't kill them, they need them.

This is also why the wizarding government has always been so lax on allowing former dark wizards to exist alongside the rest of society- they just can't survive without them.
