Everybody who read the books knows the Ministry is far from perfect. Fudge did not execute Barty, he didn't have the Dementor under control and it kissed Barty without being told so. I don't really see how you come to the conclusion that private citizens can kill Death Eaters legally. All your examples concern Ministry personnel. But in general, my point was not whether or not Dumbledore could get away with it, he probably could, but that he doesn't mean he should be faulted for not killing them, because he lives in a society with a government that has institutions that deal with criminals, and as you pointed out numerous times, comes down rather hard on Death Eaters, even only suspected ones.
