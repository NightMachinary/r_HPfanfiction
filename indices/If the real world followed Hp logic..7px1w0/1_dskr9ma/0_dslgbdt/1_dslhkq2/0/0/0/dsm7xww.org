It is self-defence if they use reasonable force. Killing someone you can also restrain easily with non-lethal force is not reasonable. At this point, they don't know that the Ministry will fall, that the DE will be free to kill. At this point, you have Dumbledore, who is experienced and powerful and known to keep a level head, who can restrain the DE without killing them. Had he killed them anyway, even though he didn't have to to keep himself and those around him save, it would not have been self-defence.
