You seem to be disillusioned to how the Ministry of Magic actually acted.

Pre-Hogwarts: The ministry authorized extra-judicial killings and threw people in jail for life without trials. While not entirely relevant, it shows what the Ministry thinks of 'Human Rights.'

Book 2: The Ministry throws Hagrid in jail without any obvious trial to stop attacks.

Book 3: Sirius escapes from Azkaban, the Ministry issues what amounts to a kill on sight order for him.

Book 4: Fudge finds an Azkaban-escapee, he executes him extra-judicially, nothing happens to Fudge.

Book 5: The ministry literally allows an employee to torture children, this person keeps their job, no major scandal results from this.

Book 6: Wizards are wrongfully arrested just to look like progress is being made against the Death Eaters.

So what does that mean in Book 6, aka the only one where the Ministry was fighting Death Eaters?

- If you've escaped Azkaban you can be killed without any legal fuss.
- If you are killed while participating in a Death Eater attack there will be no legal fuss.
- If you are caught on any suspicion of being a Death Eater, expect Azkaban.
- If you are subdued and are a Death Eater, expect to wake up in Azkaban with a life sentence.

In conclusion: Dumbledore totally could've killed every Death Eater there legally, the Ministry didn't give two shits.
