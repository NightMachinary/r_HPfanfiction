I very much disagree with your assertion.

The DoM battle was a perfect life and death situation where 12 hardened terrorist killers were trying to torture and murder 6 school pupils. More than half of these 12 were also prison escapees and should already have kiss-on-sight orders after them.

If Dumbledore was willing, he could perfectly use lethal force to get rid of them all under the need to protect innocent children. Azkaban, by this time, was already known to be a revolving door facility. The Ministry was also known to be infiltrated with Voldemort's spies and sympathizers.

Later, these 11 would cause untold harms to hundreds, if not more, innocents. The two Carrows alone had crucioed countless Hogwarts children and traumatized many of them for life! Dolohov murdered Remus, and Bellatrix murdered Tonks. Yaxley was instrumental in taking over of the Ministry and rounding up many Mugglesborns and shipping them off to death camps.

Furthermore, the stake against Voldemort was extremely high. Voldemort winning and consolidating his power in Magical Britain would lead to deaths of thousands or even millions. They were fighting against a monstrous enemy who was a combination of medieval barbarism/sadism and Nazi nihilism (or in other words, an enemy even worse than the Nazis or ISIS), and yet JK Rowling wouldn't even let them use lethal force during the Final Battle.

For example, the Trio knocked out Fenrir Greyback after he had already mutilated Lavender Brown. Why didn't they follow up with a lethal strike to put that sadistic serial killer permanently out of business? We saw Greyback getting back up later, ready to torture, mutilate, and murder again.

I say fuck that!

I totally despise the argument "killing will make you as bad as them".

No, killing the psychotic inbred serial killer isn't going to make you as bad as a psychotic inbred serial killer. Everyone who dies from here on out is all your fault. Fuckin' idiot.

And even if it does make me just as bad, one man's soul, one man's conscience, is not worth more than the lives of thousands! Yes, I will stoop to the bad guy's level and it will be worth it.
