I disagree. Dumbledore knew, after the way Death Eaters were let go in 1981, that the Ministry was corrupt. He knew, after a year with Umbridge, that the Ministry was an utter failure in 1996, and could not be trusted. He knew that he couldn't trust the Ministry to make the right decisions, not any more. As (former) Chief Warlock, he had an intimate knowledge of the Ministry. He cannot plead ignorance nor trust; he should have known better.
