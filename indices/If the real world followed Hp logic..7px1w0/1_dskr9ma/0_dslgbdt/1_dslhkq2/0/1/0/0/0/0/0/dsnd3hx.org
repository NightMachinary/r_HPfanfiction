Dumbledore didn't trust them with discovering all of Voldemort's secrets and fighting the Death Eaters on every front, but apparently, he still trusted them with handling the captured Death Eaters. He did what was in his power, for example trying to convince the Minister to remove the Death Eaters from Azkaban, but at the end of the day, Dumbledore is one man, part of a larger society, that chose a way to deal with the Death Eaters that did not work in the end. Should he have started murdering them, because he did not agree how his society dealt with them? What would that have made him? Also, the Death Eaters were not broken out of Azkaban until shortly before the Ministry's fall. During Harry's sixth year, they remained there. It seems it wasn't that easy for Voldemort to break them out again.
