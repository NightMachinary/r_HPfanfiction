I think the mistake is putting all of this on Dumbledore, and not taking into account the other characters, their influence, capabilities, agendas. OotP showed us that Dumbledore's power has its limits, which makes him a more realistic and likeable character in my opinion. A Dumbledore that could do no wrong, and always makes everything right for everybody wouldn't make for a very compelling read and would make all other characters kind of unnecessary. In the end, he was just human like the rest of them.
