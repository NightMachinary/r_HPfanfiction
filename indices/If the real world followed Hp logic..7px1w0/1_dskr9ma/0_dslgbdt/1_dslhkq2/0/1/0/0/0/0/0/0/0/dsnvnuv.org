I mean, I certainly get where you are coming from, and I enjoy reading fanfics that explore that mindset, in Harry, or Dumbledore or other POV characters. Hell, I write a story like that myself.

I just don't agree that it was Dumbledore's duty to kill them and that he somehow failed by handing them over to have a trial. As I said in another comment, I think if anybody failed on that front, it was the Ministry. They could have sentenced the Death Eaters to the Kiss, they could have improved the way Azkaban was run. They didn't. Had Dumbledore started killing Death Eaters, disregarding his society's rules on how to deal with them, claiming that he alone knew how to deal with them, that he had the right to determine who got to live and who to die, even though the democratically elected government, the people had not given him that power, he would have started working outside of society, like Voldemort. He would have been a very different character altogether. I see him in a different role in the war. He worked at dismantling Voldemort, at figuring out his secrets, a job others could not do, did not even know that it had to be done. The "small squabbles", the fighting and chasing down and imprisoning/killing of Death Eaters was not his main objective, that was the Ministry's, the Aurors' job.
