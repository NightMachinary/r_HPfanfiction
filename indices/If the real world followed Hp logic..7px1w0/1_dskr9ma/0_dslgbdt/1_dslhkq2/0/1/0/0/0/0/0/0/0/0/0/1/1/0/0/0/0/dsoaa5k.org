Yes, there were instances when Dumbledore seemed to act the way he did for plot-related reasons. I don't agree that the actions you describe in your post - like taking it upon himself to reform the Ministry - would have fit well with his canon characterisation. We were given a reason for his lack of action in that regard, JKR had him tell us his weakness, his reasons for his inaction in his own words. The character that would act as you describe it, would not be the Dumbledore JKR wrote.
