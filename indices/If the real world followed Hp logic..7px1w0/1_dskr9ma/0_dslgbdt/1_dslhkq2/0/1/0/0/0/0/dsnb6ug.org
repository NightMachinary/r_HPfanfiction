Dumbledore created a vigilante organisation to fight Voldemort. He already acknowledged that the Ministry wasn't able to handle Death Eaters. And after Voldemort broke them out of jail, it was obvious that they couldn't be kept in prison anyway. Killing them was the only moral action at that point. Every murder by the ones Dumbledore spared is his fault.
