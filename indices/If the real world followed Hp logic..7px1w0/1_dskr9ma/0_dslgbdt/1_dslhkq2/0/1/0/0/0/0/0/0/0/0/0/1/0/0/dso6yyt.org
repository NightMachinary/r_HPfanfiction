I would beg to differ. Chamberlain did realise his error, and took steps to correct it - Britain started to build up her armed forces following the Munich betrayal. Dumbledore, though, didn't seem to learn anything since 1981. Of course, had he learned something, Harry wouldn't have been the hero of the series - and might not even have realised there was a war going on.
