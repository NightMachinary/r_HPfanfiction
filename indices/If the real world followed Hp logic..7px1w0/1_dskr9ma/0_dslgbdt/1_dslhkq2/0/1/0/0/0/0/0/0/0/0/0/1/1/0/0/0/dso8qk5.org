There's a vast difference between a perfect Dumbledore, and a Dumbledore that's not a stupid plot device, unable to achieve anything that would even threaten Harry's role as the hero. Of course Dumbledore isn't perfect - but neither is he an utter useless idiot. Yes, his power has limits - but he could do far, far more than in canon. The man who defeated Grindelwald cou8ld and should have done more to fight Voldemort, more to protect the innocents, and more to reform the Ministry.

At the very least, that would have allowed Voldemort to be more than a cardboard cartoon villain whose plans wouldn't pass muster by a six year old child.
