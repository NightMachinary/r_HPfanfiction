You're right about the beginning of the second wizarding war, my mistake. I disagree though that the rest is semantics. I think it is important that the Ministry is still in power at the time. Dumbledore is part of a society that has an agreement on how to deal with criminals, and him being a powerful individual does not give him the right to disregard it. You kill criminals when necessary, capture them when possible, they get a trial, they are sentenced either to prison or to the Dementor's Kiss. Like I said, I think the fault in how they dealt with the Death Eaters happened after the battle. If they knew they couldn't hold them in the prison as it was, then they should have acted accordingly.
