Like I said, I think we need to differentiate between war and a time before the war, which was when the DoM battle took place. We know how all of it continued, but the characters in the book didn't. Dumbledore didn't know the future. At the time they still had a functional Ministry, so the better question, in my opinion, is a) why they didn't sentence them to the kiss and b) why they didn't make changes to the prison. We know from Nurmengard that not all prisons are guarded by Dementors, we know from the DH that there are charms that can stop even Voldemort from entering.

Also, later on even Harry did go in for the kill. When the 7 Potter's fled Privet Drive, he stunned Death Eaters fully expecting that the fall would kill them.
