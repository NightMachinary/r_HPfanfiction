The previous commenter had a point though:

If Dumbledore had been truly an ambitious and ruthless strategist, then he would not have settled for being a simple educator, but would have joined his friend Gellert. That would have been mega bad.

So now we have the other extreme in canon Dumbledore, a man so scared of employing power when he should have. As I said in the other reply, canon Dumbledore was the Neville Chamberlain of Magical Britain, a decent man who had failed in military and political leadership.
