I think you wish for a different character because Dumbledore had one very defining characteristic: He did not trust himself with power.

Which is why he became a teacher and later Headmaster, and never sought a career at the Ministry. He was no general in a war, he was not the Minister. He was an intelligent, powerful wizard and his contributions were integral to Voldemort's defeat. Did he have his mistakes? Yes. Does this make him some kind of bad guy, who is at fault for all the people the Death Eaters killed later on? Not in my opinion. He had certain beliefs and he stood by them, which was his prerogative.
