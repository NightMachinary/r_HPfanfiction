JKR didn't write Dumbledore as a character - she wrote a plot device, then tried to dress it up as a character. His actions do not match up with his characters at all. He doesn't do what's right, as opposed to what's easy, for example. He doesn't learn from experience - he is not wise in that aspect. And the way he endangers innocents is outright evil.

That's why when I write Dumbledore, I ignore his actions in canon, and have him act as a man with his experiences and regrets would act. After all, he was a Gryffindor - no matter how much he fears power, he should be brave enough to do what he has to despite his fear.
