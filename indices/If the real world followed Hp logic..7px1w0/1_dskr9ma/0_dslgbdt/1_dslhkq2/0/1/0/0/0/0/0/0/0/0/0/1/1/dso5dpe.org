Dumbledore was perfectly capable of saving the child from imminent danger without killing. He was just not willing to kill because of future situations that could possibly arise, while there were still other institutions to deal with them. And the Ministry did keep them locked up until they fell to Voldemort.

You seem to think of Dumbledore as some sort of public property, as someone who doesn't have a right to make his own choices, but only exists to serve the people. I disagree with that.

Also, Dumbledore could have had more than one reason why he didn't just kill the Death Eaters. We don't know what the alternative timeline where he killed them would have looked like, what actions that would have provoked Voldemort to take.
