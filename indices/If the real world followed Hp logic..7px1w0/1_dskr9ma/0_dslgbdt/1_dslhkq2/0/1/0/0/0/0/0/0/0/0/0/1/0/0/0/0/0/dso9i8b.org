If we are going to discuss the literary aspect of characters, then I think Voldemort was really the source of the problem:

Voldemort is my most disliked character, both in a literary sense and his in-story behaviors. IMO, Voldemort hardly expressed much competence beyond raw destructive combat power. He was compulsive obsessive, refused good advice, and only relied on fear and terror. So he was basically another typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain. Such a villain would be easy to beat if the protagonists actually knew something about politics, strategies, and tactics, especially if someone with equal combat power was on their side (Dumbledore).

Basically, if you just increased canon Dumbledore's competence slightly, as in "Petrification Proliferation", you would have canon plot shot easily and Voldemort crushed like a bug. Where's fun in that?
