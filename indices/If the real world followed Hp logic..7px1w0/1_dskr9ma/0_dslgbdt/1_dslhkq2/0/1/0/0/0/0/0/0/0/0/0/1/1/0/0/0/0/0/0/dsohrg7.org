You probably already guessed it, but I don't agree ;) No matter, I think we are returning to the topic that started this conversation - mainly does Dumbledore's behaviour make him a bad/evil person. If you don't see him as a person, merely as a plot device, it makes sense that you would view the matter as you do. I see him as a character, with strengths and weaknesses that are the reason he behaves the way he does. Our different understanding of this fundamental issue is probably the reason why we don't come to any kind of agreement here. Was nice discussing it, though.
