Dumbledore could have done much more. But as I said - it wasn't really his fault; he was reduced to a plot device, handing out cryptic clues after his death, instead of preparing the trio before his death (Only an idiot would think it clever of Dumbledore to hide his information so the Ministry could not tamper with it after his death when he could have given everything freely and unhindered a year before that. That was sole,y and stupidly, done for some dramatic but utterly artificial tension and revelations in book 7.)
