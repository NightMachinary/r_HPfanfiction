That's no excuse. Dumbledore knows what happens when he doesn't do the right thing: Innocents die. Also, "Dumbledore doesn't trust himself with power" is utter bollocks. As a Headmaster of the single school for all of Wizarding Britain, and as the Chief Warlock and the Supreme Mugwump, he held a lot of soft power. And he founded and led the Order of the Phoenix - arguably a general in the war. He couldn't have done that if he actually believed he wasn't to be trusted with power.

And no, he had no right to sacrifice innocents for his beliefs. I don't give a fuck about anyone's faith, belief, or principles; the lives of innocents take precedence over all of that. If you need to kill to save a child, you have to kill.
