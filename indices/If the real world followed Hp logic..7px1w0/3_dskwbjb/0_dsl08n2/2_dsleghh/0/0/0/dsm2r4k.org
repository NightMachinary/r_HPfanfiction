It were Green Berets who were supporting anti Taliban tribes. They were deployed primarily as artillery/airstrike observers but ended up partaking in an assault against a stronghold outside of Mazar I Sharif (or however that is spelled) where several armored vehicles were waiting. Without AT weapons they had to rely on Us planes to take care of those.
