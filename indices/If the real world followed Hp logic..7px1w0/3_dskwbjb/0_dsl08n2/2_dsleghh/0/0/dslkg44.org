I was thinking of an attack by Dostum (I think) forces during the first month of Afghan war, where attacking with horses was basically the sole solution (only way to attack quickly enough) and the airstrikes just helped hiding the attacking forces long enough (a strategy invented with artillery, long before aerial forces).\\
And yeah, in the battle of Hogwarts, as it was fought, two of three machine guns nests would have been enough; well, till L.V. started explaining that they were wizards, and that brooms were usefull sometimes.
