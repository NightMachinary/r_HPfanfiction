I think I found the story you were referring to and that sounds more like cavalry used to guide airstrikes and then mopping up the remaining enemies. They had no AT weapons to deal with the T-54/55 tanks and ZSU-23 SPGs. Without air support, that attack would have died a quick death.

Generally speaking I was thinking about a Battle of Hogwarts with the defenders setting up dozens of machine guns and mortars to quickly end Voldemort's assault.
