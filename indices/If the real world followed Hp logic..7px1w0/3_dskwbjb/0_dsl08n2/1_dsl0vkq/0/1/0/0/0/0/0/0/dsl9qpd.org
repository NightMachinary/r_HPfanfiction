If you assume protego was that powerful, then you would fall into the opposite end of 'muggle wank'. Unless you are going for curb stomp pics, this kind of imbalances doesn't make interesting reads.

My assumption for protego is generally this:

Highly dependent on casters. While Voldemort and Dumbledore's version could stop machine gun bullets indefinitely, those cast by puny Ministry minions wouldn't even stop one 22 pistol round. Those combatants at the Battle of Hogwarts should fall in between the two extremes, but all their protegos could be brought down by sufficient automatic fire.
