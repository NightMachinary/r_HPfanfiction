But what is the range on Fiendfyre? I was talking about a Battle of Hogwarts where Harry's side has machine guns set up on the battlements. Hogwarts is surrounded by open ground, creating a large killing zone. If a Death Eater was to cast Fiendfyre, would he/she be able to direct the flames hundreds of yards towards the walls or would it devour something else like random trees or even the Death Eater ranks?
