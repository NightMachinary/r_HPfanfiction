Because we know that the naming conventions of HP are played straight and near-literal; Severus Snape is a severe snake, Remus Lupin is a werewolf, and Dolores Umbridge is an unpleasant offensive person. If there were irony, then Snape would be someone obsessesed with rules (like Percy), Remus would be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupinus][foxglove]], and Umbridge would be a police officer.
