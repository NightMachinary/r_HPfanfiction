Depends on your headcanon, but I believe a lot of "wandless" magic requires hand gestures, or great concentration (which you're unlikely to get with /a still-bleeding stump for an arm/). I mean, maybe Voldemort could do it, but definitely not Dolohov. Not to mention all wandless magic is already weaker than wanded magic.
