I dunno, if I was someone who watched, lets say, Bellatrix Lestrange torture my daughter, kill her, then Voldemort command his snake to eat her body while I was forced to watch bound and wandless, I'm not entirely sure I would care about being HUMANE with them. I'm pretty sure I, and the majority of people here, would try to do her serious harm or death. People will deny this but it's so easy to do over the internet, when not faced with the situation, or when you don't even have a child.

But I guarantee you put a child of someone in harms way, that parent is going to do ANYTHING to protect or avenge them. And if a Death Eater, who kills and tortures anyone they want for the fun of it, dies? boo hoo. The world won't miss them I'm sure. They already proved what a fantabulous contribution they've been to the world, haven't they?
