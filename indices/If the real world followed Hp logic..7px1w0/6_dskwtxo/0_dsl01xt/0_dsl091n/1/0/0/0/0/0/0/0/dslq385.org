It's okay, sometimes people say I post my opinions very condescendingly and arrogantly, and sometimes re-reading them I see it. And I don't always explain myself until I get responses (Usually cause I just assume people will know what I mean). But I don't mean to be condescending, it's just when I get really passionate about something (Even the stupidest of things) I get really into my argument, but I don't mean it to come out condescending or patronizing or rude but it does. and if it did this time I'm sorry, I really got to work on that

So we're okay? I hate arguing with other people. especially over something fictional! haha
