I never said to become a psychopath or go out and kill willy nilly. There's a big difference between what Voldemort/de do (which is just go kill, execute, torture) and self-defense.

in the heat of a battle when they are throwing avada kedavras at you, 5 to 1 (Lets no forgot that the DE's, dark creatures, people that were imperio'd, people that were blackmailed, etc all out numbered them 5 to 1 at least) I wouldn't be worrying about if I stupified them.

Same as if lets say I was in a corner, unable to escape someone who was raising a knife to stab me, but I had a gun. I'd shoot. Not stop to think 'oh god if i shoot him when he's about to stab me and kill him i'm just as bad as he is'

And common wizards are nowhere's near the greatness of Dumbledore, look at what they teach at hogwarts, they teach things like stupefy in seventh year? (Based on triwizard when harry and hermione train they say Cedric and other champions know these spells, perhaps 5-7). When you're going to battle dark wizards and witches that know how to eviscerate you, skin you alive etc. They have spells you can't even block. Dumbledore has a great vast knowledge of spells, the common wizard does not. Surely the common every day wizard have more than the spells taught at hogwarts, for sure. Dumbledore might be capable of taking those alive and doing as you say, just like the best boxer might be able to knock another one out, but I could not; nor could the common wizard. Dumbledore easily could defend himself against Voldemort, while many familys, Aurors, other dark wizards, etc could not even with all their knowledge and training; nor could they do so against even his death eaters (Longbottoms, among many others).

So what Dumbledore could do is not a good measure for what a normal magical person could do. And by the time the war really broke out, (IE Book 7) we didn't have dumbledore.

You first action shouldn't be kill--I agree on that, you don't just go out and kill people you don't like, but when there's no other option than I think it's fine.

That does not mean one should go seeking them out and execute them one by one. Or torture, etc. But in a life or death situation with no other option but to kill or be killed....than yes. And I do personally believe that by Book 7 it was just that.

Otherwise let's just throw Molly Weasley (She killed Bellatrix, and did not in fact take her alive), Harry Potter, and I'm sure a few other students who ended up killing in self-defense, or in battle into prison. It just makes no sense to me.
