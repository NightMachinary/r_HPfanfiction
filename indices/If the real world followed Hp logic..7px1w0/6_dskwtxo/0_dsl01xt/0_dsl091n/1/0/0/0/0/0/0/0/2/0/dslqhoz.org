I think alot of it has to do with what type of people they are, where they were raised (Environment, culture,etc), how they were raised. And of course the natural Fight or Flight instinct, which is something people can't control, it's something hardwired into their brain, when something frightens you, you either run from it, or fight.

Mine is hardwired to fight. So i think all those factors contribute to how one reacts in a given situation. But do not worry about it, I was rude too, which I am sorry for. So it's all good :) I think we both have knee-jerk reactions haha
