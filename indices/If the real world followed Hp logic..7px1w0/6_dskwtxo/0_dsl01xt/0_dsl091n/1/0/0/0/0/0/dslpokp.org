Not to start another argument between us, but I was only insulting to you (By the bed time comment, if I sounded rude in my opinion/first comment i surely hadn't meant to be) because you had in fact insulted me first "You're as gross as they would be" because we have different opinions? Thats the only reason I insulted.

An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind, I know, but I can endeavor to be much more nice, if you will
