I agree torture is not okay in any scenario ever. Ever. I mean if you need information so bad why not just use Veritaserum? Even under torture they could resist, or lie. Imperio them, and then do the truth potion, so it'll be harder to resist either.

I know Imperio is another unforgivable but if you need information I can kind of justify it since it doesnt really cause pain or harm, so long as once the information is given it's taken off.
