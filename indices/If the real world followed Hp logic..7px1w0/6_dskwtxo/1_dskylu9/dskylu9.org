Yes Achille, I think of it like the Force in Star Wars! It has like two dozen different options for STOPPING, CONTAINING, and for DISARMING that that is why it is such a huge deal if you immediately jump to: I am going to use it to torture and kill people right off the bat.

It is BECAUSE there are so many other legitimate options that killing with magic (or the Force!) is such a big deal and so frowned on! Because there are a dozen ways that you don't have to! At least that is part of my harry potter head canon on the unforgivables and why azkaban is even a thing, and in my head canon or maybe canon, only murderers and torturers go to azkaban.
