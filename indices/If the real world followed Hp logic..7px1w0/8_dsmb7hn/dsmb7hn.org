You're mistaking a ragtam team of people who oppose Voldemort (the Order) and a bunch of teenagers (DA) with soldiers who have trained for months or even years to be able to kill without hesitation.

Killing isn't easy, no matter how many power fantasy fics you've read.

EDIT: Don't forget that Aurors were given permission to use unforgivables against Death Eaters in the 70's. That's what you should compare to the military, not the Order.
