I've never read any of Ravi Zaccarias' books but I've listened to a lot of his sermons. I have read The Case For Christ and The Case for a Real Jesus. I also read Arnold Fruchtenbaum's commentary on Genesis during bible study one time. I've also listened to a few of his talks/sermons.

You know, I describe one of my stories as: "One of which is the daughter of the Death Eater and the other is a temporally displaced Jesus Freak. Together, they fight crime. Well, Voldemort anyway."

PS The Jesus Freak is me.

Have you ever listened to some of the stuff Chuck Missler has out? He's a bit far out in some of his theories but the way he applies science to prophecy and biblical writings can be fascinating.
