  I've never read any of Ravi Zaccarias' books but I've listened to a lot of his sermons.
#+end_quote

I've read one of Ravi's books (End of Reason, which is brilliant) and I love listening to his sermons. That man, he is our generation's C.S. Lewis.

  I have read The Case For Christ and The Case for a Real Jesus.

I actually got Strobel to autograph my copy of CRJ when he gave a talk at my hometown.

  I also read Arnold Fruchtenbaum's commentary on Genesis during bible study one time. I've also listened to a few of his talks/sermons.
#+end_quote

I've been reading his tome on Genesis for a year (it's a very dense read) and it's beyond fascinating. I especially loved his attention to detail with Abraham.

  You know, I describe one of my stories as: "One of which is the daughter of the Death Eater and the other is a temporally displaced Jesus Freak. Together, they fight crime. Well, Voldemort anyway." PS The Jesus Freak is me.

Isn't that the one where "you" went back in time and raised Harry?

  Have you ever listened to some of the stuff Chuck Missler has out? He's a bit far out in some of his theories but the way he applies science to prophecy and biblical writings can be fascinating.
#+end_quote

I haven't actually. It's not that I don't find that material interesting, but at the same time, I approach prophecy with extreme caution, because of Matthew 24:36.
