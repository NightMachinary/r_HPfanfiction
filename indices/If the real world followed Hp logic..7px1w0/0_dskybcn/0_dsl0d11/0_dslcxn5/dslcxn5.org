When Dumbledore stumbled into the wreckage of Godric's Hollow, his heart sank. All three Potters were dead. He cradled the empty, broken from of Harry Potter in his hands. Voldemort was gone, but not defeated. What would happen when he returned? He closed his eyes, weeping silent tears not just for the Potters, but for all the others that would die when the Dark Lord returned.

No. Dumbledore clentched his fist, gripping the elder wand. He gazed down at the dead child in his hands. No. No, there would be a defender of the weak, a protector of the innocent. He knew just what to do.

Rabbi Eliyadhu Bar-Emon of York ran a small yeshiva attached to the Synagogue, where he had a dozen jewish boys he taught daily. He spent his evenings in the small house next door, studying the ancient texts or eating dinner with his wife and two daughters. And, on rare occasions, practicing magic.

Eilyadhu was a graduate not just of the yeshiva, but also of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He had spent his life in the pursuit of wisdom, both as a Ravenclaw, and as a Jew. He had largely abandoned the magical life in favor of teaching the holy scriptures, but he had more than a few ancient texts of Hebrew magic. On occasion, he even wrote down some spells and lore he had uncovered on his own.

The night of October 31st, 1981, Rabbi Eliyadhu was copying a passage of an old mystical text when his wife knocked on his study.

"Eli, someone is here to see you," Rachel said.

"Oh? It is late, and I am busy. Can they not see me tomorrow?" Eli asked.

"It is the Headmaster, Dumbledore," Rachel said. "He seems concerned."

Rachel had not attended Hogwarts, but rather had attended a yeshiva in New York where she was born where young jews with magical heritage were taught. Eli had trained at the same yeshiva after he had graduated from Hogwarts, and fell in love there.

Eli stood and hurried out, finding the old wizard standing in the hall, carrying a small wrapped bundle.

"Headmaster, it is an honor," Eli said, bowing. Though Dumbledore was a goyim, he had Eli's respect both as a master of the arcane and as a wise and venerable man.

"Rabbi, I come with a terrible request," Dumbeldore whispered. There were tears in his eyes, and his voice was pained. "There has been a great and terrible tragedy. The Potter family was finally attacked by Voldemort. All were slain."

Rachel let out a soft moan and covered her eyes, rocking back and forth. Eli closed his eyes and muttered a short prayer. "This is terrible news. But why do you come to me? My wife and I, we live apart from the magical community. Our daughters are not yet old enough to take a wand. Why do you come to me with this news?

Slowly, Dumbledore unwrapped the tiny bundle. Eli gasped to see the child within, it's forehead marked with a scar. But a moment later, he felt his heart sink. The child was dead, pale and lifeless.

"This was Harry Potter," Dumbledore said softly. "But he has been slain. However, there is a prophecy. Voldemort is not dead, only banished. He shall return, and only a child marked by him may slay him."

"Why do you tell me this?" Eli asked. "I cannot raise the dead."

Dumbledore nodded. "No. But you could create a Potter. From this broken form, you could create a golem. I know you have the writings of your ancestor, the Rabbi of Chelm. And you have long experimented with perfecting such a form." Dumbledore held out the dead child to Eli, and after a moment's hesitation, he took it.

"Eli, no! Such a thing is forbidden!" Rachel warned.

"Perhaps," Eli muttered. "But I have longed to make a golem for years. Headmaster, are you certain of this?"

Dumbledore nodded gravely. "There is little time." He held out a small device, like a golden watch. "But I can buy you a few hours."

With a trembling hand, Eli took the Time Turner. Rachel's eyes were wide with horror, but Eli met her gaze. "The prophecy must be fulfilled, my love. Only the Creator Himself can cause such a thing. It must be done." With trembling hands, he spun the Time Turner twelve times.
