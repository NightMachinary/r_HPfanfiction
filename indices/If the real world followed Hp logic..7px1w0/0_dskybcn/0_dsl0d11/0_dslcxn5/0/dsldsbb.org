Paragon. Paragon, Paragon, Paragon. Why is it every time I make a random joke on reddit, I end up inspiring you to create yet another awesome story. I mean, for Merlin's sake, I'd read the /hell/ out of this if you continued it. It's extremely strange and unexpected but by the same token extremely engaging.

^{Just one thing that my nitpicky side won't let himself be silenced over --- canonically, the Ministry-made Time Turners are restricted so that they cannot be used for more than 5 hours at a time. Though I suppose Dumbledore might be good enough to have made his own Time Turner with no such limitations. There. I have said it. I will now return to anxiously waiting for your next update of /Golem Harry/, /Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal/, and --- a guy can dream --- /Red-Headed Stepchild/. And also maybe work on my own story.}
