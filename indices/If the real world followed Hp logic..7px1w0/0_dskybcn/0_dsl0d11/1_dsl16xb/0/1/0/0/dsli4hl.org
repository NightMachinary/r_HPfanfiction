I was basically half-joking with my previous comment, as what I wrote most likely hadn't been intended by Madam Rowling. Nonetheless, lack of intent aside, I did consider Vernon's personality to be a fit to a word that was close enough, and as for Lucius while I personally find nothing pleasing about that fop whatsoever you can fairly easily find fics in which authors wax poetic about how aristocratic and pleasing to eye his looks are, which added to the fact that some authors seem to think that his name actually is “Luscious” made me think that the alleged meaningfulness of his name is absurd enough to be a perfect opener.

Though, seriously now, it's fairly obvious that out of all the Malfoys he, despite being seen after Draco, is the one who is most defined by their name, that being “bad faith”, but that would leave us with trying to find a meaning for Draco and he'd have to be called “Titill” for that.
