How is Lucius at all "luscious"? And I'd never considered the Vernon/Vermin thing. Don't know if it's right or not, really --- all the Dursley names sound like they were made up to simultaneously be utterly pedestrian and vaguely unpleasant (Marge Dursley. Mister Vernon Dursley. Just try saying those names out loud), all in contrast to the /wizard/ names, most of which have a meaning or are at least colorful and odd.
