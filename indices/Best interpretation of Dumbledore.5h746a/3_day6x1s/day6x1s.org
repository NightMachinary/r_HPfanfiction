it's a good question. he's a character which most authors completely whiff on. doing it best-- enembee comes instantly to mind. great writer, great portrayal. i really like joe's dumbledore in wastelands, even though he doesn't get much screentime. that's by far my favorite type of characterization: harry and dumbledore are both powerful and have a mutual respect. it makes sense.

also, hpmor's dumbledore gets a lot of screen time and is a truly fascinating character. most authors write triumphant, boring scenes where harry criticizes dumbledore-- but very few successfully have dumbledore articulate excellent responses.

I've not run across many others that don't completely fuck this part of their story up. stages of hope has a good peripheral dumbledore. may edit with more.
