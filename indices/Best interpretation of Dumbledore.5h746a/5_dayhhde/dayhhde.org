This Dumbledore has completely run out of fucks to give. He's basically seeing just how far he can go before someone in the wizarding world calls him on his IDGAF mentality. So far, he's extremely disappointed.

Although Harry and co (especially his adopted 'uncles') are all hilarious, Dumbledore himself is by far the funniest character in the story, perhaps even one of the funniest characters I've encountered so far in any HP fic, and I've read Seventh Horcrux, A Black Comedy and The Lie I've Lived. Go read it.
