In my mind the best are: The already mentioned Magicks of the Arcane, linkffn(The One He Feared by Taure; What You Leave Behind by Newcomb; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin; The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond). That last one is also the only good soul bond fic in existence.
