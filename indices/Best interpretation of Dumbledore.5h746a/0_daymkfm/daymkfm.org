Two Dumbledore "moments" from not-already-mentioned fics that I think capture his sense of mischief and oblique meaningfulness (which is a beat a lot of Dumbledore writers miss) very, very well:

From linkffn(3384712) /The Lie I've Lived/:

  "Might I have a word with the Supreme Mugwump?" I ask casually, catching Dumbledore on his way back up to his office from the evening meal as we wait for the staircase to realign.

  He chuckles, "It is a rarity when a student can address me thusly without fear. Then again, you are not the usual student. What can I do for you Harry?"

  "Nothing really, I believe that the rules of this tournament forbid such things, but it is possible that one of your braves might be going off the reservation, so to speak, this weekend. Speaking hypothetically, would this be a problem? No surprise tasks suddenly popping up on the horizon and such?"

  "Quite a lot happening this weekend with the Quidditch match. I don't believe the individual champions have anything to worry about. With everything going on, even someone as famous as you could get lost in all the festivities. Although, it might leave Poppy out of sorts, if her assistant were not available to help tend the various injuries involved in the match, but I'm certain she could get by. Of course, I'd never approve, but I would have to wonder if a student were to go missing, where might he or she be?"

  "I hear France is a lovely destination this time of the year. Among other things, there's a young lady recovering from Dragon burns there and seeing a friendly face might aid in her recovery."

  He nods sagely and continues our non-discussion, "Indeed, a most wonderful country. I myself find the guest quarters at the Flamel estate to be most accommodating. I hear one of my former staff members, who stopped by for a visit recently, is enjoying them at the moment."

  "Really? What a coincidence. Small world, isn't it?"

  "I do believe you are correct. Well, it was nice spending a moment with such a promising young student, but I really must be going. Sometimes, when I get in such a rush, I find it difficult to remember all the details of a conversation. I'm glad we had this opportunity to talk, Harry. Do forgive me if I don't seek you out this weekend, I do appear to have my hands full. Don't spend all weekend sequestered in your workshop - remember to get out and enjoy yourself some."

  "Sound advice, I'll keep it in mind. Good night, Headmaster."

  "Good night, Harry."

And this similar but deeper scene from linkffn(5677867) /Ginny Weasley and the Half-Blood Prince/. It's a little long to quote the entirety of, but the conversation between Ginny and Dumbledore in Chapter 9 ("Acid Pops") is very, very in-character for Dumbledore. Sections like this:

#+begin_quote
  "I'm positively certain!" exclaimed Ginny. "One-hundred percent certain! Absolutely, definitely certain! I... " She closed her eyes, counted to ten, and after a moment continued on more quietly. "There's nothing good down there, Professor. There never was. All that's left in the Chamber of Secrets are bad memories. That's what's so stupid about this. That's what I don't understand. There's nothing I want through that door, but I keep coming back here. There's nothing in there that can hurt me, but I'm too scared to go in. Sometimes I come here, like tonight, and I don't really know why, and I feel like I must be losing my mind."

  Dumbledore seemed to seriously entertain this possibility, but then shook his head slowly. "I don't think that to be the case, Miss Weasley. You were held in the power of a memory, as it were; a memory Tom Riddle trapped in his diary. You now have nothing left from that experience but your own memories of it, memories of what must have been a terrible ordeal for you, one that few others can truly comprehend. It is not at all surprising to me that you are both drawn to and repelled by the remnants of those memories." Dumbledore turned from the door and looked down at her over the rims of his half-moon spectacles. "If I may say, Miss Weasley, your plight is not so uncommon, nor should you be so hard on yourself for it. After all, your own worst memories are the one enemy that you can never outrun."

  Ginny shook her head ruefully. "Yes, well, with all due respect, Professor, I still feel frustrated and just... stupid. Because the reality is that you can't get hurt by a memory."

  Out of the corner of her eye, she could have sworn she saw Professor Dumbledore flex his blackened hand under the sleeve of his robe. "You would be surprised," he answered her with a soft smile.

And then this bit at the end:

#+begin_quote
  "Before we part, Miss Weasley, there is a small favor I would like to ask of you, if I may be so bold."

  "Oh. Of course, sir," Ginny answered, surprised. Dumbledore smiled, and then withdrew from the folds of his robe (again with his left hand) a small piece of rolled-up parchment, tied loosely with a silver string.

  "If you could pass this on to Mr. Potter when you see him," he asked. "I'm afraid I simply won't have the time to find him myself. It seems I am destined to be late. Now, now, don't fret," he said, cutting off her apologies for keeping him. "It is not your fault in the slightest. It is my own. Remember, 'late' can mean a great many things. Will you give Harry the parchment?"

  Ginny nodded. "Of course, sir."

  "Thank you, Miss Weasley." He handed her the parchment, but did not let go immediately. She looked at him questioningly. "It is a private message," Dumbledore told her. "But not so private the world would end should someone else's eyes fall upon it. I trust you will respect that privacy as I would expect any of your more industrious siblings to do."

  Ginny looked at him for a moment, wondering if he was actually saying what she thought he was saying. "Of... course, Professor?" she replied, not assuredly at all.

The way he slyly, obliquely gives Ginny tacit permission to read the letter -which contains the passphrase to his office, is just... so damn Dumbledore. And the fact that she needs to talk to Fawkes to understand something about himself... Dumbledore's giving her the keys to self-discovery, but he's not doing the work for her.

That's the essence of Dumbledore, to me. He reminds me of a Nietzsche quote, from /Untimely Meditations/ -

"Your true educators and formative teachers reveal to you what the real raw material of your being is, something quite uneducable, yet in any case accessible only with difficulty, bound, paralyzed: your educators can be only your liberators."
