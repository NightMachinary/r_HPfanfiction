You should definitely check out the youtube video "Msscribe: The Harry Potter Fandom's Greatest Con-Artist - When Posting Goes Wrong" by Eldena Doubleca5t. It goes over the Ms. Scribe incident in a lot of detail (it's about an hour long, which I enjoy greatly, but if you don't care for long videos then you could just put it on 1.25 or 1.5 speed). It's not a primary resource obviously, but it gave me a good understanding of the whole thing, and has plenty of screenshots and such of the drama. Hopefully that's helpful!
