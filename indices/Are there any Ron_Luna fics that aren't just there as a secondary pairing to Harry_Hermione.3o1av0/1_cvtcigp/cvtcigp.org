Shadow Walks by Lorien has this. Luna's character voice isn't captured well at all, unfortunately.

EDIT: Oh, you meant it /isn't/ a secondary pairing to Harry/Hermione. For some reason, I read the opposite. But, no. I think a couple of smut fics with the pairing though. Let me see whether I can find them.
