I guess, but some tropes break the suspension of disbelief so much you just can't keep them. I guess if you make the story very AU and change huge parts of Lily and James' personality to the point that they would give up a child, it could work. But if you change them too much you run the risk that them being together or doing the things they did in canon that led to their deaths will also change. I just don't know if there are any fanfiction authors that are good enough writers to pull something like that off.
