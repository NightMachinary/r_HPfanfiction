I say do away with all the WBWL stuff and abandoning one child at the Dursley's. Neither are believable anyway. To my knowledge people don't call Harry The Boy Who Lived in universe and it's a mouthful of a title anyway, and there is no universe in which Lily and James would just leave their child on some doorstep while also being the same people who would sacrifice themselves for their child, squib baby or no. (Also unbelievable because you can't tell if someone is a squib when they're a baby.)

So now you just have a pair of twins, their parents just died and they've been shipped off to live with relatives. As they grow older one of the twins starts noticing odd things, memories keep surfacing in dreams of a life lived outside of England, of having friends and family he's never met. And these Dursleys, why do they seem so much more familiar than they should? He doesn't know why his aunt petunia seems to hate him and his brother but sometimes he feels like he should, like it's just on the tip of his tongue.

And it just keeps unfolding until he's forced to accept the reality of his situation. At which point you can start true canon divergence and wreck all his canon knowledge. The moment he does something new, everything changes, slowly at first but more noticeably down the line.
