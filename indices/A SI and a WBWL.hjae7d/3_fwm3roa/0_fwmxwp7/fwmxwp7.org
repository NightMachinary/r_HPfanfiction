Never got it either - ok, Harry has a twin, ok, people think the twin is BWL, fine. No chance in hell the Lily and James everyone talks about with basically reverence give their kid to magic-hating muggles. I could see maybe Sirius taking one of them if whichever parent survived can't handle two kids but even that's a stretch to me. If the surviving parent feels overwhelmed they have Sirius and Remus to help them out, why would the Dursleys enter the picture at all?
