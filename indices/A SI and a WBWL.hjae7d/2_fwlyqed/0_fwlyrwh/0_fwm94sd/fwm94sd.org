...I'm really into this idea lmao. It completely veers off the revenge aspect that the WBWL stories that I've read have going.

Oh my god. Queue /The Parent Trap/. lmao

No but actually I'm now dreaming of Harry's twin popping up at the Dursleys and kidnapping Harry and their parents, who feel guilty as all get out, can't bear to send him away again. Which subverts the entire point of the prompt, I know, I know... I'm tired. I need a Harry's twin SI story now with sibling fluff. sigh
