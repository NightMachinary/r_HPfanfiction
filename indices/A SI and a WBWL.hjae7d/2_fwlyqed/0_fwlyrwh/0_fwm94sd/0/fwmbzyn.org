Harry was a quiet child. A bit lonely, a bit weird. But who wouldn't be in his shoes?

His only friend was for the longest time only a neighborhood dog that no one claimed was theirs, that he named Mr Cuddles and totally adored Cuz it bringed him untouched (not counting dog slobber on the box) burgers suspiciously often.

Except he sometimes met this bizarre boy who looked a bit like his own reflection in a puddle after the rain. The boy, named Leopold, appeared in the weirdest moments, always in rush, always hiding or running. Sometimes they hided together. They played games and Leo stayed till a weird loud crack took him away.

Harry was a bit sad but not overly worried. Mr Cuddles slinked from the shadows and he just knew Leo will also appear again in a week or two. He always did.
