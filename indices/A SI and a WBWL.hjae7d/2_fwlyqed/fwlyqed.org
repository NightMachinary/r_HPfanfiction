In those fics SI character usually is riduculusly overpowered, brain-power wise. Of course they figured it out. They've read books. They've seen movies, musicals, name it all. Their brain was probably corroded by innumerable fanfics. They barely know wand from a stick but they /will/ try to cast fiendfyre at anything remotely horkrux-like.

I mean, it's an easy bet that they will try to reach true Harry.
