I could see Lily and James both surviving along with Harry and his twin. Then Lily and James ends up fighting over how everyone is treating Harry and his Twin differently. Fighting enough that they end up splitting up. With how rare divorce is in the wizarding world, I can see them having a law that if there are 2 kids, that the oldest kid goes to the parent with the strongest magical family, and until the kids turn a certain age the relatives from the other side of the family can have nothing to do with them. So the Twin ends up with James and Harry ends up with Lily. Then some time later Lily is killed/dies and Harry ends up with the Dursley's because neither James or any of his relatives can have anything to do with him until he's 11 or 13 or 17 or whatever age the law says. And Sirius being James's 2nd cousin(?) is close enough that he counts as Harry's relative on his father's side. Maybe James and the other marauders don't even know about Lily's death until Harry reaches that age because of how the divorce laws work.
