That could certainly be interesting - particularly if the SI had no idea they were in... a fanfic, as it were. James and Lily? Not that unusual names. Uncle Sirius? Maybe out of the picture because screw you James for abandoning my godson. Magical World? Parents keep SI out of it because of the hero-worship and they don't want it to spoil his character; the most they do is say "when you go to magical boarding school". Magic? Yeah okay neat, but on its own, not necessarily the indicator that "hey, they think I'm Harry Potter, but what is this, my name is Alphonse, where's the real Harry??"

And I mean hey, they're a child, with a child brain, particularly if it's without the whole "I was fully cognizant from the womb and wow being breastfed is traumatising but not as much as birth", more a slow "wait why do I know random things and have random memories, what odd dreams... ohhhh waiiit... could it be...? no don't be absurd" dawning realisation that they're /maybe/ reincarnated. They have enough to deal with to focus on small hints that aren't in your face (particularly since it's a quite far-fetched thought, to be reborn as Harry Potter, but your parents are alive, and your name isn't even Harry).

Enter Harry Potter. As in, the real Harry Potter. And suddenly... oh shit. Reincarnation is the least of my problems.

...I'm very into it and I'd definitely read it if someone wants to get on writing this lol
