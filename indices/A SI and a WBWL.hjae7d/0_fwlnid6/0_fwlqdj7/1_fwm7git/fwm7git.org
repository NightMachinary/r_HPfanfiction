Well I mean obviously Alphonse would know about magic, but I was thinking, parents having magic that they use wands for doesn't automatically lead to the obvious conclusion "they think I'm Harry Potter". It could just be a random universe that has magic. Particularly since James & Lily probably do the simple spells we know of non-verbally, and a lot of other spells we don't know of at all because they're household spells and were never mentioned in the books.

You're right, it would have to be done delicately; it only works if James and Lily are super over-protective and careful. Maybe half because Alphonse as the BWL would be a target, so has to be hidden & protected, and half because having gone to school with the Malfoy & Co of their time, they're very wary of spoiling him and turning him into an arrogant twat. (Or an anxious mess, knowing he's a target.) So they shield him from the general public in the magical world.

It'd be very interesting, the dynamic between Harry & Alphonse! Harry would probably be wary and resentful, and I don't know if he'd have the wherewithal not to blame Alphonse for their parents' actions (having grown up with Dudley, who is very much his parents' son and can easily be lumped in with them, particularly from a child's POV).

Also what if Alphonse gets sorted to Hufflepuff. Because loyalty is important to him. And the rift the drama would cause between him and their parents... and knowing how Harry is treated at the Dursleys', Alphonse would probably throw a fit at even a hint of a suggestion that Harry should go back to them. I mean if I were a child, I'd definitely make the best of the opportunity to throw temper tantrums while it's still a somewhat acceptable thing to do lmao.
