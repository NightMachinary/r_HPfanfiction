Possibly - but I mean, look at it from the standpoint of someone who doesn't have HP on their mind first thing in the morning. They're a child and slowly starting to realise they're reincarnated. I mean this would be happening before he's eleven; he's probably busy realising that he's reincarnated, processing the fact that his old world & life are gone, that his family & friends are effectively dead to him and think him dead, that he has new parents now. All of which is probably difficult to accept. Add in the part where magic is apparently a thing now, there's a lot he has to process in the first ten years of his life. And /possibly/ he'd pause a little at Lily & James Potter, but well, they probably aren't going by Potter in the muggle world for security reasons, so while he technically knows their last name, it's not like it comes up often. Making it easy to forget, for an under-11-yo. In addition, he thinks of them as mum & dad, not Lily & James.

Yeah, even if he never were to go to Hogwarts, if he makes it to 15 and still doesn't get suspicious, that would be a bit slow of him. But a child? With a lot going on already? And a child brain? I don't think it's unreasonable at all. Even if the thought did occur to him, vaguely, he'd probably brush it off easily, seeing as there's no Sirius Black, and his name isn't Harry Potter, and it's quite the far-fetched thought to begin with really. From the outside looking in, it'd be more obvious, but living it, with all the aforementioned caveats... I don't think it's unlikely at all he wouldn't realise until something really obvious happened.
