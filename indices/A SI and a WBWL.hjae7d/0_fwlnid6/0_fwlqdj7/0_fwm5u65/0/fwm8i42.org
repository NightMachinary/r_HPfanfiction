See I'd probably not be a good candidate for that SI's position, I'm too tired for drama lol. If James & Lily, my parents, are good people, they'd 1. have to have a very good reason to have given up Harry, and 2. feel very very guilty about it nevertheless.

Ohhh, maybe the horcrux in Harry's scar played a role? Since the one in the locket did have the ability to affect people around it, and without Lily's sacrifice to act as a shield, maybe it's all Harry's magic can do to keep it separate from Harry himself. It can't prevent it from affecting others around them, not when Harry is still an infant. (Maybe as his magic grows stronger, it starts being able to.)

So James & Lily notice that they feel unreasonable resentment towards Harry, that being around him influences them somehow, they take him to healers and everything but nobody knows why, and then paranoid Dumbledore makes an appearance and is all "what if Voldemort isn't really dead... what if he's in Harry..." and they don't believe him but can't discount the possibility completely either. They can't bring themselves to permit harm beign done to Harry, but as time goes by the situation turns increasingly dire until they agree to send Harry away. To a place without magic, for reasons.

...anyways what I was getting at, I'd probably get my parents to take Harry back, because obviously Harry isn't evil I mean look at him. Also he's my brother.

I'm not really into the resentful revenge shtick, which probably makes me the wrong candidate for this trope, I think...
