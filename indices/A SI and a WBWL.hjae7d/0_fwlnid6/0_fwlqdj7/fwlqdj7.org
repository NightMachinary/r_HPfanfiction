Nice way to go at it. Upon learning about Harry and all the Voldemort stuff, Alphonse immediately realises he's likely not the Boy Who Lived despite how adamant everybody else is.

The Potters would have to go Muggle for it to work, though, cause I can't see a HP fan watching new Daddy draw his wands and perform a spell and not immediately go /'wait a minute...'/

Another fun idea would be Voldemort doesn't know which of the twins he hit with his curse, and just assumed Brother is the bwl.As a result, SI becomes Harry's unwilling meat shield.

Not only that, but Harry, obviously sorted into Slytherin and wanting to spite his family, starts getting cosy with the wrong sort (maybe Malfoy and his crew).

Chaos ensues.
