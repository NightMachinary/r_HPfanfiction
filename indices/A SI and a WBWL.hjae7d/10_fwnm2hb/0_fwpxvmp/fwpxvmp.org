  Nah, the SI with his meta knowledge can solve everything so easily that would make the SI the real chosen one anyways.

I'm not so sure about that.

Obviously, in such a story, it's gonna be an Evil!Dumbledore, therefore we have two extremely powerful wizards with decades of experience (three if Grindelwald is included) plus an unknown amount of others who could be there despite not being mentioned in the books but could very well come into the game if SI makes enough waves.

We don't really know how the prophecy works (in canon it was self fulfilling, but this is a fanfic), and anyway, SI isn't protected by it since /he's not the boy who lived./

SI has never used magic before and has no knowledge of it. His talent is unkwown, as is his intelligence. Even if he's the greatest genius since Merlin, I very much doubt it's enough to surpass the real players before the deadline. Decades or centuries of training and experience aren't easily overcome.

This is a WBWL story. Harry is driven, ruthless, extremely perceptive and talented, he will more than likely be an occlumens/legillimens before starting Hogwarts if he's not a natural. And he's pissed at SI on principle. I don't know about you, but I think I wouldn't enjoyed getting reincarnated into Jim Potter in Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches.

This one might be more frivolous, but SI's the wrong Potter. The one James choose to keep. The one Snape hates the guts of. SI's not gonna like potions.

It's very possible to make a story where SI is really gonna be in danger, outweighted and outsmarted by just about anyone who's someone around him and is gonna have to fight more than hard to have a chance to prevail (or even remain a minimum healthy).
