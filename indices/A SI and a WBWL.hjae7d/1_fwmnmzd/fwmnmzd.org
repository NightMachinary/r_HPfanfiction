Eh, if I was doing SI /and/ WBWL I'd have the SI not be related to the Potters at all, and have all these other differences on top of WBWL to completely throw them off.

Make their knowledge of canon utterly useless: Hermione is an airhead obsessed with gossip. The Weasleys are blood purists and the Malfoys are wholesome cinnamon rolls. Peter wasn't the Secret Keeper or traitor, it really was Sirius. Grindelwald is headmaster of Hogwarts.

You know; make the SI feel like they're having a goddamn stroke.
