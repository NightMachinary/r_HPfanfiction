Oh boy, it takes the international stage. Dirty bombs, Corperate sabotage, jokes about infrastructure, theological debate, it has it all. Not really a harry potter story, more focused on the world stage, but he does set up the inital conflict. The DEFCON plotline was frankly insane, and has set my headcanon for the role of the ICW. I read that thing for like a week, got 95% if the way through, then got distracted, wo i still havent finished it.
