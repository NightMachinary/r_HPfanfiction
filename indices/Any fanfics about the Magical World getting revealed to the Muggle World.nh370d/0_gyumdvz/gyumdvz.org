[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1149623][Disillusion]] is an essay fic about a very AU timeline where Harry and Neville are artificially aged and raised as super wizard weapons, then tossed aside once they won. Harry decides to bring the statute of secrecy down as revenge. It's an excellent fic. linkao3(1149623)
