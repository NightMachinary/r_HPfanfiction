Crossovers are hit or miss for me. Generally I hate superhero crossovers. The few HP crossovers I have enjoyed were either Star Wars or Star Trek (due to the endless possibilities with magic, time, and space), Twilight (due to the vampire connection), and the occasional LoTR (rarely). I also have always been curious if there was an HP/Eragon crossover out there but have yet to stumble on one.

If you do have anything to suggest by all means. I asked for one type of thing, but I enjoy exploring pretty much anything (except for male slash) and am always up for new things to dive into.
