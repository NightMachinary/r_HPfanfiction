Most MoD fics make Harry immortal, or a time/dimension traveller.

Few personify Death though. A few ASOIAF crossovers come into mind, with the whole stranger thing. There was one Twilight crossover too I think.

Usually the genre is ridiculously cliche in plain HP verse, so I prefer crossovers(Plus no Hermione there). Lemme know if crossovers are your thing, and Ill try to dig them out.
