I've read this before. I made it a few chapters in and couldn't go on. He's supposed to be a powerful Sith, according to the narrative, but he's an absolute animal. Does nothing but kill and have sex. This seems to be consistent with most of what Darth Marrs writes, and there's nothing necessarily... wrong with it, but it's not my type of story. I won't say it doesn't fit the prompt though, besides the creepy sexual behavior in it. Thanks anyway!
