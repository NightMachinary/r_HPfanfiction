I like 'These Cuts I Have' by Melindaleo - it's very canon and realistic up to a certain point where it rather lets itself down with a bit of a silly plot line. But certainly the first half of the story is very good, and has realistic reactions from the majority of the characters. I especially like the portrayal of Ron's grief - he becomes very overprotective, which I think would be quite likely in canon. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129968]]
