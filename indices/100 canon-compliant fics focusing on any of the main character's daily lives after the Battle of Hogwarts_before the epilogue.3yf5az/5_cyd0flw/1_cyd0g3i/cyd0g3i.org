#+begin_quote
  The war ended, but life didn't end with it, even though it sometimes felt like it had. It isn't an easy road for the survivors as they seek to heal their world. Despite everything they persevere, trying to find closure and happiness, but it's a tightrope that they walk - one that spans the gap between being a lover, or a liar. Then again, the best of us are the people who are both.
