Well, there's /Dinner With the Weasleys./ The fic is set about a year after the war, during the summer following Luna and Ginny's graduation. It's told from Luna's perspective, and it's mostly just her musings on the Weasleys. And musings on Harry and Hermione and Dean. And musings on life in general.

There's not much in the way of plot, but for this fic, it doesn't really matter. This fic is like going to your grandparents' house for Sunday supper after church.
