I absolutely adore this story and am eagerly awaiting updates, so please don't take the following as a deterrent: The beginning of this story is possibly one of the most grim and dark depictions (at least of the after effects) of torture I've ever read.

To put into perspective, a large portion of the story is Harry desperately trying to fix his body (and soul). He's MoD so he can't die, but his body is pretty much trashed.
