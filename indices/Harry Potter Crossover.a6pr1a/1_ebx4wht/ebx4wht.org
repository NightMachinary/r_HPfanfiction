Two that I enjoy enough to reread are

linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal by Disobedience Writer)

linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon)

The first is a crossover set in the Game of Thrones/Song of Ice and Fire universe. The second is set in the Firefly/Serenity universe after the events of the Serenity movie.
