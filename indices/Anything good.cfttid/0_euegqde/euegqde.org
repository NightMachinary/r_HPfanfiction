If you like competent (if slightly AU) characters, not much bashing, good plot and battle with decent romance in the background, I'd recommend everything by Starfox5. (If just for the similar name)

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lady Thief; Divided and Entwined; Democracy by Starfox5; The Dark Lord Never Died; Patron by Starfox5; Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution; Returned, Reformed and Really Trying; Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider) and more
