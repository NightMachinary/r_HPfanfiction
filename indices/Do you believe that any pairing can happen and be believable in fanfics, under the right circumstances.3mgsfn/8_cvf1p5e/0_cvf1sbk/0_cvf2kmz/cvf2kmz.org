I think it can work without time travel as well, by playing with the possible trauma that drove Bellatrix to become a sadistic loony and the care that Hermione has for other people and creatures in general. With a lot of hurt, a relationship can take place if a situation allows Bellatrix to open up to Hermione.. As mentioned though, it would require a very good author to pull it off. Also, I think it can surely develop if the story allows Hermione to harden while Bellatrix softens, personality wise. Plus, if you're into that kind of stuff, I see a huge potential for sexy domination smut haha.

Oh and I think Bellamione is the ship name, yes
