Mmmm.. Nyes. Personally, I'm a sucker for femslash, which makes a lot of pairings unrealistic if the story 100% canon. However, if you can see past little tweaks like that, I believe almost any pairing can be believable. I've read some convincing and not to mention fantastic fics with Bellatrix and Hermione pairing, for example. I think it mostly depends on the author and their capablilities. If they can really dvelve into the slightly hidden characteristics of the characters in question, then they can make a story that makes sense. However, it will probably (and usually) require a lot of development between the characters.
