  Just remember that for (for example) H/Hr to happen, you have to change either Harry or Hermione's character (or both).

The problem with this pairing, or any other that doesn't really click with their canon personalities, is that people try to make it happen quickly. Characters change over the course of a story, Harry and Hermione in DH could probably work out, if they both weren't already involved to some degree with another. However the problem lies in people trying to get Harry and Hermione together for the Yule ball. Or in Hermione and Draco getting together in their Hogwarts days instead of a decade later when grudges have cooled and opinions have changed.
