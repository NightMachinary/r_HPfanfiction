Of course. You create your own story, so you can do whatever you want. Whether it's believable or not is up to the quality of writing, of course. Just remember that for (for example) H/Hr to happen, you have to change either Harry or Hermione's character (or both). Make Harry more of a bookworm, make Hermione less naggy and more outgoing etc.

of course, with more unlikely pairings like Harry/Snape you have to change A LOT. But still, it's your story, so do what you want!
