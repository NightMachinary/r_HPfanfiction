Not without a good amount of backstory changing or being brought to light. Mostly for characters being homosexual.

I'm a hypocrite when it comes to females and bisexuality though...

But Evil characters falling in love with Good characters and vice/versa requires as much history change/retelling as turning a typically known "hetero" character "homo". Doing both in the same story pushed the limits.

Making women all a little bit bisexual or willing to share a guy like Harry ... is fantasy, it had better have at least SOME reason for it to happen that is believable if you squint really hard and are willing to ignore it. Same for men I suppose, but that isn't for me...for those that are into it I suppose the fantasy is good enough reason for them to keep reading it.

A well done fic will have enough background changes explained, that you can believe anything that happens. Even if it is Harry falls in love with Voldemort or Hermione and Snape. I have not read any fic that did it well enough for me to finish them... but that is probably a predisposition as much as poor writing.

TLDR To each his/her own. For me, anything can be explained well enough to be believable within that fic...I just havent seen it done well enough to explain things I would never think of writing myself.. personal taste plays a huge role in whether it is believable or not.
