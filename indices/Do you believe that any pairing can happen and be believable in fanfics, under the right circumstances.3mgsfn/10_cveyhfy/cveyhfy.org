Nope. They key word is "believable". So, when you have something like Snape/Hermione, the only way that's going to happen is with some extreme personality changes, and then, those characters aren't actually Snape and Hermione. They're two OC's who just happen to share the same names. Like, you can age Hermione 15 years, make her Slytherin, a Death Eater, and a pureblood, but then, the character isn't actually Hermione anymore despite having the same name.
