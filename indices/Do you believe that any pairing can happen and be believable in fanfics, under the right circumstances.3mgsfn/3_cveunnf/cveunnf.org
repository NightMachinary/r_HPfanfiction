It really depends on circumstances.

For example, Hermione/Lucius, with canon personalities, at any point 1997 onward? Nope. It'd require a no-war AU, a Lucius that wasn't a blood supremacist, and/or a Lucius that changed sides early on. But throw in some time travel to way before the first war, stick them both as the same age and before way difficult decisions have been made, and there could be a shot. Awful ideas as a teenager (like blood supremacy, racism) can go away with the right reason.

What's difficult is keeping the characters in-character long enough to establish them, then having the charger development be long enough to justify the changing of their personality from canon. Just about any two characters can be tossed together and work.
