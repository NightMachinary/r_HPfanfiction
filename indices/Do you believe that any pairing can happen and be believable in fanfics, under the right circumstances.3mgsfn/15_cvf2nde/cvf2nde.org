I see character's sexualities as part of their personalities. I know that there's a little wiggle room and I know that sexuality can be seen as more of a spectrum, but that's how I see it for the most part. Changing canon Harry's sexuality is like making him blonde. You can do it, but it's not something that happens organically or for environmental reasons. Of course, if it's a background character, we don't really know what was going on. I don't think Harry's gay, but I don't see Seamus being gay as a huge break from his canon characterization.

I also think that a fic that pairs Harry (or Hermione) with a more important character (like Fleur or Hermione or Luna or Draco or Snape) is inherently OOC because we know that the relationship didn't have legs. In a different universe where canon!Harry sat in Susan Bones' compartment, maybe Harry could have fallen in love with Susan Bones.

But canon!Harry and canon!Hermione weren't compatible, and to make them compatible requires changing the characterization of one if not both. Same thing for any romance that involves two primary characters, like Snape and Hermione.

In AU stories, it very much depends on the pairing as well as the structure of the story. Some pairings are more plausible than others, and it depends on the point of divergence. In a world where Hermione was sorted into Slytherin, maybe she would have fallen in love with Draco. But in a world where the point of divergence is Ron dying the final battle, Hermione falling in love with Draco is a lot less plausible.
