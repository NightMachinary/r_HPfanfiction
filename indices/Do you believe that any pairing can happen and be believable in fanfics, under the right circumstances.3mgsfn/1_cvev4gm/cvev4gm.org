Yes and no. For some characters yes. For some no.

I don't think Bellatrix and Dumbledore could fall in love, no matter how many time travel and bizarre tags you put on it.

I do think two characters who aren't inherently evil can. An example of this is HarryxTonks. Yes it's a stretch for most, but in the right set of circumstances, where the two characters have time to show each other how they are decent people, love *could* blossom.

That said, if it's an AU as all of these are, cannon characters aren't really shown. It's how someone wants to bend them, and that's great, but it's not the cannon character. It can still be a wonderful story, and in some cases it's outstanding (maybe it's just me being partial to romances).
