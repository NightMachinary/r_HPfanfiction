I've actually read a couple of really strong Harry/Tonks fics, there was this one that was called the something summer, I don't remember exactly. Anyway, in this, Tonks is an unspeakable and during the summer after fifth year she realizes how horrible the dursleys are, rescues him, then recruits him as an unspeakable and they slowly fall in love. The descriptions of the unspeakables structure and training are amazing, and the romance is an addition to the story, rather than the whole plot. If anyone knows what I'm talking about could you link it or give me the proper title?
