A hesitant yes.

For all the hate on cross-generational pairings, we sometimes think too much like Muggles on this one. These guys can potentially live upwards of two centuries, so age itself isn't an issue. Power dynamics still are, however, so teacher/student relationships really should remain platonic in a non-crack, non-squick fic.

Orientation (if we're talking about being somewhat faithful to canon interpretations) is a really tricky one. There's probably a case for many canon characters having a fluid sexuality, but for say, Harry to start banging Draco, Snape, Lucius, Voldemort /and/ his mother's house-elf while denying that he was ever attracted to the opposite sex in the same breath is just... well, you get my drift.

Then there's interspecies relationships... even interanimate relationships (I'm personally a consummate shipper of Hogwarts Castle/Giant Squid, though the Castle is arguably animate... maybe even sentient. Not sure what the term for this would be)
