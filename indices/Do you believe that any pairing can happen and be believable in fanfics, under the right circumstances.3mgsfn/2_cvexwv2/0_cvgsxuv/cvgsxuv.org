  For all the hate on cross-generational pairings, we sometimes think too much like Muggles on this one. These guys can potentially live upwards of two centuries, so age itself isn't an issue. Power dynamics still are, however, so teacher/student relationships really should remain platonic in a non-crack, non-squick fic.

When people complain about cross-generational pairings I've never heard them complain about, say, Remus and Tonks. But even if it's not a teacher/student relationship, if one person is a teenager and the other an adult there's going to be a power imbalance. The difference in maturity and life experience makes it impossible for that to be an equal relationship.
