I think what makes Delenda Est work is the fact that when the story begins, Harry sees Bellatrix just as the reader does. Harry sees the idea of a friendship (much less a romantic relationship) with this sociopathic Death Eater as rather abhorrent. But as Harry becomes more comfortable with Bellatrix, so does the reader. Even then, Harry will occasionally take a step back and acknowledge the dissonance and the fact that this relationship seemed so unlikely to work out.

Multiple people have said that they were surprised that the pairing could work, and you get the feeling Harry felt the same way.
