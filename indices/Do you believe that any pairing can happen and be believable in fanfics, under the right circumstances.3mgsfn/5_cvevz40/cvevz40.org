Yes. And this is coming from a staunch Harry/Ginny shipper. If you change Harry and Hermione's personality, for instance, and place them in an AU, then why wouldn't it make sense?

Every ship has more or less potential, depending on how probable it is in canon. Ginny/Luna would be more probable than Ron/Umbridge, but it still requires OOC and AU.
