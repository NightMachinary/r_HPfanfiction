If I remember correctly, you can skip the only scene that's explicit Snarry. Hermione finds a pensieve and experiences them having sex as though she is one of their bodies? It's not really material to the plot, but an intrusion on their privacy. Other than that, all the other graphic scenes are het (Harry/Hermione, Hermione/OMC).
