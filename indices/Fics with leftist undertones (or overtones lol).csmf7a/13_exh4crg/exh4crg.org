There's a pretty decent series of one shots in a story of one shots about Vernon who suddenly becomes a borderline socialist and Harry following in his footsteps. I wish I could remember the name---you might do a request to see if someone remembers it.

There's really only the Harry becomes a communist parody that I can think of, though. But yes, it would be nice to see something different since so many fics revere purebloods or try to both sides the death eaters and the order of the phoenix or straight claim the death eaters had a point.

Also, not necessarily a "leftist" fic but it pokes a bit of fun at the pureblood artistocracy trope "Harry Potter, Lord of the Swamp."
