An exploration of wizarding culture as pertaining to working and middle classes. It's a WIP but very interesting, and I've been trying to find works like this ever since reading it.

Everytime people talk about wizarding culture, it's all, moste ancient this and lord that and other stuff and nonsense. What about the vast majority of wizarding people who probably don't come with vast manors and many, many vaults in Gringotts attached to their birth?

They'd have their own tales and their own ways of working magic and their own impact on society. They might not make someone a social pariah for not greeting them in the exact correct fashion, but they'd have other social traditions and taboos, etc. And what about down-market neighborhoods such as Knockturn alley? Some enclaves would have to have more Muggle influence in them while others would be more isolated. I can imagine insular wizarding villages peppering the British countryside. And the Welsh and the Irish and the Scottish would have vastly different mythologies, the same as they do IRL, especially considering how anti-nobility Scotland is. This is a whole society of possibly hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world that separated from the Muggle world centuries ago, which is a vast amount of time in terms of social evolution.

So what kind of culture do the Weasleys and the Lupins and the McGonagalls of the world have?
