I'll just drop them in the post in case anyone else is interested.

[[http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/10/steven-attewell-steve-rogers-isnt-just-any-hero][There's good reason to think that Steve Rogers is likely an FDR Democrat at minimum]], and possibly a full-on socialist, and a lot of fic writers have run with that interpretation of him:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2439302][All the Angels and the Saints]] (Steve/Bucky, E) - Besides being a complex, emotional, and epic love story, this fic also really captures the intellectual atmosphere of 1930s and 40s NYC - Bertrand Russell, the Little Blue Books, the Radical Woman's League, the Lincoln Battalion, the Freethinkers Society, and more. One of my all-time favorite fics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17854124/][Where the Need is Greatest]] (gen, T) - Canon divergence AU where Steve takes a look at the history of American interventionism post WW2, goes "fuck that", and joins Doctors Without Borders instead of SHIELD

A couple fun outside POV fics from the perspective of Steve's [[https://idiopath-fic-smile.tumblr.com/post/117149098318/steve-rogers-pr-disaster-gen-4k][publicist]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/817036][personal assistant]] (both gen)

There's a bunch more out there, but those are some of my faves.
