"Left-wing politics supports social equality and egalitarianism, often in opposition to social hierarchy. It typically involves a concern for those in society whom its adherents perceive as disadvantaged relative to others as well as a belief that there are unjustified inequalities that need to be reduced or abolished."

So. Google gave me this. This doesn't sound bad at all? Why would you be worried about a fight starting over it? Everybody having equal rights should be the norm in the world. Just ask yourself this: Would /I/ want to be discriminated against in life? If the answer is no, then you can't ever say it's right to do it to other people. It's that simple. Anybody who tries to deny others the same rights they have themselves is just immoral and wrong.
