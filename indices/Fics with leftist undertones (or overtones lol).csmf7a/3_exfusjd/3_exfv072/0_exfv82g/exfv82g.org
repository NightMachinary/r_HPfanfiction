I don't care, dude? If someone wants to be a racist or a homophobe, or a bigot in general, because they BELIEVE other people shouldn't have the same rights they do because (insert skin color, race, whatever), then they're just plain wrong. I'll gladly tell people they're wrong on that. Because it is. Never be afraid of calling a spade a spade - or discrimination discrimination.
