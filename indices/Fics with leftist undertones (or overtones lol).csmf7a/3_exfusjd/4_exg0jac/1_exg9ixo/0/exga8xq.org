The World knows China is committing human rights atrocities at worst, and is abusing their citizens at best. And we know Big Tech is helping them to build their surveillance state beyond any reasonable point (assuming their is one.)

Is it a reach to say Big Tech (Google at the center of it) is helping China to find dissidents, knowing they will be placed in re-education camps or made to disappear? That's probably up for discussion.
