By that logic, I'm helping China build its surveillance network whenever I buy a product manufactured there via my minuscule contribution to their economy. It seems a stretch to conclude that Google, Facebook, IBM, etc. are helping to build China's surveillance network because they collaborate with Chinese Universities/AI talent on research. An unfortunate effect of capitalism is that the AI talent pool of China is a competitive advantage that American tech giants can't afford to ignore. I can somewhat understand one's disdain for them doing so (I think?), but it still feels like a highly misleading claim.

Now, if you had a source that could prove that China was contracting Google to spy on their citizens abroad or to develop algorithms directly for the Chinese military, then that would be a good example of ' helping the Chinese government to track people's "Social Score"'.

Also, while I didn't address it in the prior response, I was unable to find anything about Google directly aiding China in covering up evidence of the re-education camps.
