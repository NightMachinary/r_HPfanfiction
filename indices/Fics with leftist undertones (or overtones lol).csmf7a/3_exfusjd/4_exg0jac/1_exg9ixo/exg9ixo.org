Out of curiosity, do you have a source for Google helping China with tracking social scores? Using Duckduckgo and Bing, I couldn't find anything to corroborate that other than a deleted Infowars video which I won't honor as a viable source given the controversies that follow Alex Jones. Also it's been deleted, invalidating any information it holds as it's is not observable.

I'm not asking because I don't believe that it's possible, but because it matters a lot to me as a modern consumer given Google's power over the internet. Were it to be true, my behavior would likely change.
