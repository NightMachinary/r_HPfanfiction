Google "Right-wing Politics" and see what the results are. Or participate on Reddit as a non-leftist, and watch how fast you can rack up negative karma.

The assumption is, of course, if you're not "left wing" or are against the "left wing" that you must be against "equality" and "fairness", etc. Which, as a Libertarian who has equal disdain for Democrats and Republicans, is complete and utter nonsense.

If you're curious, look into Google's hiring and advancement policies, including the multiple lawsuits they're currently in over them. Then ask if that's what "equality" means when you read that definition.

Of course Google's motto of "Don't Be Evil" kind of goes out the window when you realize they're helping the Chinese government to track people's "Social Score" and have gone out of their way to assist China covering up the fact that they're putting people into "Re-education" Camps, and several million people (the majority Muslims) have "gone missing" from those. Presumed dead by many, but an inconvenient thing to discuss in any event.

Ask yourself if a company that facilitates, or even participates, in that is the company you trust to run the entire Internet - because they pretty much do. And you can watch videos online of their executives online talking about the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential election being a mistake they won't allow to happen again.

As far as fanfic goes, everyone is allowed to read whatever they'd like, obviously. Personally, I have a hard time thinking of Communism/Socialism (i.e. what many 'Leftists' advocate for) in any sort of positive light considering it has resulted in many, many times more atrocities than Nazi-ism did. But hey, some people like Death Eater centric fanfic where they're justified in their actions because of Reasons, and I'm sure I've read some stuff other folks find terrible over the years too. It's kind of like playing the GTA games - nobody condones murdering people for fun....but Video Games!

To each their own and all that.

As to the worries of incivility - you've been on the Internet before, right? :-)
