Sorry, I read the original post where it says "don't start a fight" and I honestly didn't think I was. I thought I was answering a question someone else asked, and not even replying directly to the original post. Without being dismissive, insulting anyone, or using vulgarity.

Of course, this being Reddit, I get downvoted and the vulgar non-reply is ZOMG aweosme!!1ty because my viewpoint isn't the popular one.

Or maybe etiquette really says you're not allowed to say/do anything the OP says not to? That's a serious question by the way - I'm old, so I apparently don't understand this whole Internet thing as well as I thought.
