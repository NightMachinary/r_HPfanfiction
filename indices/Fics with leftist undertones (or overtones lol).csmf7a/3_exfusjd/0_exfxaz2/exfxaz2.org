  Why would you be worried about a fight starting over it?

Unfortunately politics is a very polarizing topic of discussion. It can lead to heated arguments where we forget the human behind the screen and result in discussions that violate Rules 2 and 3 of the subreddit.

There is too much to go into a discussion than can be simplified into a reddit thread, or even comment. I encourage you to do more research on your own, using unbiased, neutral sources for information. For the most part, we tend to recommend not discussing politics because it can lead to less-than-stellar comments.
