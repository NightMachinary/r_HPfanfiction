Nope. The code behind the HPFF archives has been essentially static for over 5 years. I can't imagine Jay deciding to overhaul it, which would probably be required to address the shortcomings in the filtering and search. It's a shame, really. There are so many fantastic authors there, but they never get the kind of readership that even so-so authors draw on FF.net.
