Yup, the old fandom archives like fictionalley and skyhawke are horribly neglected, some are dead (illuminatedtext's remix archive for one), and the rest of the fandom are spread out on blogging services like Livejournal and Dreamwidth and personal website on old ISP hosts. Its pretty sad to see some gems with little no to exposure, or worse - locked down like a virgin's bedroom
