8/10. A nice little novella that bridges the end of DH and the epilogue. The entire thing felt like something JK Rowling would write, but it doesn't have an air of "fanfiction" to it. Characterization is perfect, I don't mind the OC(Astoria), but its a little too short for my taste. Ah well.

OT: The search function for that website is bloody terrible. Is there anyway to filter it AO3/FF.net style?
