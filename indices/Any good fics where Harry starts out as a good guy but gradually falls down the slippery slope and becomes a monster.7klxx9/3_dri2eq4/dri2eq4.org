I personally think linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) is your bill. I enjoyed Art of Self-Fashioning, but the Harry from that story was inherently different to begin with.

In OTWtG, it's canon Harry that's sorted into Slytherin. There's a slow burn, as Harry does what he can to fit in and adapt. He starts experimenting with darker spells, and has a different set of morals. In fact, [[/spoiler][Fawkes refuses to transport him because he's dabbled a little /too/ far, and isn't the pure soul he was in canon]]

I truly enjoy the Snape in this fic as well. He's not suddenly a second father/mentor because Harry is in Slytherin and has his mother's eyes. They still aren't that fond of each other, but there's definitely a certain level of respect that doesn't exist in canon.

Out of all the authors who attempt to have a "gray" Harry, this Harry isn't an edgelord, believes he's still an inherently good person, but faces (realistic and not contrived) issues with the Weasleys and the Order.
