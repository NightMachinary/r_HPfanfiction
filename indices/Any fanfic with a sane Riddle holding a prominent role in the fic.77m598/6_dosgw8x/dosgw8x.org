[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5216059/1/Of-Elusive-Realities-and-Convincing-Facades]] Hermione/Voldemort, he's as sane as he can be, which is my favorite portrayal of him - a villain, still the bad guy, but intelligent, cunning and strong. I also really like the base idea for the story : the minister has gone crazy and is at war with both the Death Eaters AND the Order, so Voldemort and Dumbledore make a pact to work with each other until the ministry is done with. Hermione is sent as an emissary to stay with Voldemort and his side and make sure everything works well. It's an interesting idea and I liked the way it's used in the fic.
