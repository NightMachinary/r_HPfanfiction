linkffn(Again and Again)

Some information, minor spoilers:

[[/spoiler][Harry is stuck in a loop, reliving his life over and over. He decides to try something different to bring an end to the loops. Harry captures Voldemort and forces him to merge with one of his Horcruxes. Voldemort realizes that the horcruxes weakened him and drove him insane - he goes and absorbs the others.]]

Fair warning, this is slash. Trust me when I say that I am /not/ a fan of slash.

This is one of the very few slash fics that I've read through despite that.
