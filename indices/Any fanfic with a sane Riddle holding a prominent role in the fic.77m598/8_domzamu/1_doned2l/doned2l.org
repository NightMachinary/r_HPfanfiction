You were one of the first commenters so i read it first and my god... It's nearly 6am and I'm already 31 chapters in. I posted this midnight and I'm quite in love with this story...! Pity the author didn't seem to have completed it. I absolutely love her writing, the characters are very well written and developed, the plot is incredibly detailed (I definitely must reread this once I'm finished with it) and I'm so incredibly enamored with these set of characters vs the original set ngl! I'm not even finished but I think I must sleep now or else be absolutely hammered for staying awake over 24 hours...!

I really do love this Riddle. I'm happy thanks, this fic was perfect! I never really loved the HG/DM pairing but this one was stunning in the sense that it's not exactly DM from cannon! a much more lovelier pairing too than canon hg/rw lol

edit: it's 11:28am now and I finished the entire beautiful thing, thanks so much again for commenting it! Reverse has been a wonderful read...! Now time for me to take a nap and recover before resuming my daily activities (thank goodness it's the weekend haha)
