The crowd was instantly silenced. Harry looked between the silver spoon and the chicken egg Dumbledore pressed into his hands and the giant sprawling maze just feet away. What was happening?

“But, Sir, the maze-“ Harry started to say, completely baffled.

The other champions looked just as confused as he felt. Krum scowled at the egg. Fleur scoffed, mumbling under her breath all the while “-cannot believe zey are making us compete like zis-“. Cedric simply shrugged and accepted his egg without complaint.

Dumbledore watched the champions expressions with a twinkle in his eyes. “The maze is currently being rampaged by hungry Blast-Ended Skrewts, so we've had to improvise.”

The crowd grumbled openly now, completely uninterested in something as mundane as an egg and spoon race. Harry guessed they would much rather watch one of Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts try to eat him. Dumbledore drew a line in the grass about ten feet away from the champions, winked at Harry, and joined the other judges in the stands. Professor Moody limped forwards with the Triwizard Cup floating beside him, and he set it down on the grass just behind the finish line. He smiled at Harry, and his magic eye rolled around wildly.

“Eternal glory awaits the champion who successfully crosses the line with their egg intact, without the use of magic!” Dumbledore announced. A few students cheered half heartedly. “You may begin on my whistle. Ready now?”

A sharp tweet shot through the quiet, and Harry started to slowly make his way across what had been part of the Quidditch pitch. His egg wobbled back and forth across the spoon, and he was soon sweating due to the intense effort of keeping the egg from falling. All that, mixed with the intensely silent crowd, made Harry feel as if this egg and spoon race was the hardest thing he'd ever had to do.

A soft thump came from behind Harry, and he risked turning his head slightly to see what had happened. Fleur lay sprawled on the grass, her egg splattered on the ground. “C'est des conneries!” Fleur cried. Harry wasn't quite sure what that meant, but he knew it wasn't nice. Much to Harry's surprise, however, was the fact that Krum hadn't even left the starting line. He was simply staring blankly at the egg, almost like he'd never seen one before.

The crowd was cheering a little bit now, and Harry shuffled slowly to the finish line, shoulder to shoulder with Cedric. The Triwizard Cup glowed brightly just across the line, and Cedric grinned at Harry.

“Let's finish together,” Cedric suggested. “Hogwarts will have won either way, and we can share the gold.”

“Sounds good to me,” Harry replied, and when a few moments later the two boys reached the line, they crossed it together.

The crowd clapped politely, completely unenthused at the conclusion of the Triwizard Tournament. Harry tossed the spoon and egg at his feet, and with a wide smile shook hands with a beaming Cedric. But that smile was gone in seconds when they both grabbed a handle of the Triwizard Cup, and a familiar tug hooked at Harry's navel, and Harry thought glumly “Why can't I have just one nice and incident free school year?”

(That prompt is great!)
