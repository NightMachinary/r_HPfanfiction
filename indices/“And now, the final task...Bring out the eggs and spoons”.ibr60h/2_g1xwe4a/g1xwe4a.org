"Champions must carry eggs on spoons while transversing a maze. If the egg stops touching the spoon, it will explode. If you touch the cup, the egg gets deactivated," Ludo Bagman seemed deflated at such a mundane sounding task.

Harry takes his egg and puts it on his red spoon before walking off at a cautious pace. That was strange. He anticipated a maze, but not the egg and spoon, and figures out how to balance the egg and spoon on his left hand, while casting Point Me with his right. Later, Cedric takes his yellow spoon and egg before transfiguring a pebble into a tray, before placing his egg and spoon on top and rushing off. Krum takes his black spoon and transfigures his own hand into a cushy looking, flat appendage with a depression in the middle, before tearing off strips of his robes and strapping the spoon to his arm. Fleur takes her spoon and egg, before gliding off with perfect Veela grace.
