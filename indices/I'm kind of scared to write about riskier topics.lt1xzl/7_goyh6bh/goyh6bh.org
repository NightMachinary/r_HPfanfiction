I think the question to ask is why you want to write about these topics, and what type of story you want to write? You say that the stories wouldn't be the same without these topics, does that definitely mean that they wouldn't be as good? Or does it mean that they wouldn't have the tone you want? Remember that Game of Thrones has incest, torture, and unhealthy relationships and was very popular. It also wasn't for everyone and many people didn't watch, many of them because of those very same things.

In the end, you write what you want, for the reasons you want. Quality writing will out. If your execution is good, the people that are interested will enjoy it and the people that aren't won't. If its bad, then people will dislike it the way people dislike poorly written things and only the people who are specifically there for incest, torture, and unhealthy relationships will like it.
