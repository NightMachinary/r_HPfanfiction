You can always write the fic the way you want, including the topics you're worried about, and then let it sit for a while; sometimes getting some distance from your own writing can help clarify how you feel about it. And if possible, I'd recommend finding a beta reader - when I'm uncertain about how I've written something, a second opinion is invaluable.

If you're worried about getting negative feedback, I'd suggest posting on AO3, which has much better privacy options than FFN. You can chose to restrict your work to registered users and moderate comments, or even prevent anyone from commenting.

Finally, on a more general note, writing about heavy topics sensitively, like writing in general, is hard, and you might not do it perfectly. But it's also something that gets easier with practice, and I know I, at least, would /much/ rather have people tackle difficult subjects and occasionally get it wrong, than only ever have people write "safe" fiction.
