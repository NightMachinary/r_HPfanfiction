Are you perhaps the author of the most splendid and glorious [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4413323/chapters/10023830?view_adult=true][^{A Big Happy Weasley Family}]] ? The man/lady who noped out of writing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12628886/14/Dragon-Lily][^{Dragon Lily}]] ?

I think he went overboard worrying about what other people thought in regards to the latter fic; he even closed his account when he thought his friends/family had found his fics lol. I'd say just take a shot.
