  So, I have a few WIPs and they contain some more... controversial topics. Incest pops up in a few of them, as does torture and very unhealthy relationships.

Hmm, controversial, yeah...there`s this series of books, I don`t know if you heard about them, they are called The Chronicles of Ice and Fire, they have all of these things and more, and are wildly successful.

Write what you want, just make sure they are cohesive, and with good grammar and spelling, this, along with an interesting premise will make the story good.

Also, make sure these controversial things are truly important for the plot.
