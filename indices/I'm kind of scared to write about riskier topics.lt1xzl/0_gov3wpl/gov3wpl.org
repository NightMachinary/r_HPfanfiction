I'm of the mind for you to write your stories how you want to write them. Who cares what others think about them. Some people will like how you approach such topics, some won't.

The problem I am seeing a lot these days that is starting to encroach on fanfiction is "my story must please everybody".

No story can please everyone. There will always be smaller or bigger numbers of people that hate every fic out there. There are always some or lots of people that love every fic out there. Trying to write a story that everyone is going to like is impossible.

If you try to avoid core topics to your stories because your afraid of what some people might say about it, then you are doing yourself and your stories a disservice
