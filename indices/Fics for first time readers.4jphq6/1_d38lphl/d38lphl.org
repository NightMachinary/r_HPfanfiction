I would probably start off with well written, canon-compliant oneshots, such as linkffn(Cauterize; Out of the Fire and Into the Cupboard; The Wendell that Wasn't; The Last Straw - Oneshot)

Then, I would go for oneshots that show a twist, an element of AU: linkffn(Geminio; Yes, Minister; The Greatest Minister of Magic)

From there, I would recommend stories that diverge from canon, such as linkffn(Forging the Sword; On the Way to Greatness) although it might be better with complete fics at first.

By this point, I would also start introducing some common tropes, such as time/dimension travel, dark!Harry, and so forth.

Finally, I would recommend slight AU fics, such as linkffn(An Unfound Door) and then later, full AU stories like linkffn(The Skitterleap; Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic I)

Generally, I would advise against linking smut, at least at the beginning, since fanfiction generally has a bad stigma. I would also recommend against shipping stories and EWE at the beginning, as that may turn off readers who really enjoyed the canon.

TL;DR: Start off with canon-compliant short stories and progressively introduce more aspects of fanfiction with well-written stories.
