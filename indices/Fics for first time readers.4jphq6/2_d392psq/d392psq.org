Start with canon compliant fics.

The first HP fanfic I read was *Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), a wonderful year 6 story from Ginny's POV.

[[/u/FloreatCastellum]] writes great canon compliant fanfictions: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum]] *Not From Others*, linkffn(11419408) is imho the best year 7 Hogwarts fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][Northumbrian]]'s excellent 83 story series is mostly focused on postwar. I like these two from him the best: *Grave Days*, linkffn(5486257 ), is about what happened immediately after the Battle. *Strangers at Drakeshaugh*, linkffn(6331126 ), is about Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2010

--------------

My personal preference leans more toward AU (Alternate Universe) though because there are simply more options and possibilities available:

Want a good laugh? Try *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), where Harrymort finally got his long sought DADA position in the most hilarious fashion. You especially don't want to miss out the Chamber and Graveyard scenes.

Like time travels? Try *Delenda Est*, linkffn(5511855), where Harry got thrown back to 1975 and had to team up with Bellatrix. The first half of the story involved lots of actions with the Marauders, and the second half saw what a sane, non-evil Bellatrix could accomplish.

Not satisfied with the Epilogue or curious about what could have been after Voldemort's fall? Try *The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), where the Ministry kept sucking up to pureblood extremists after Voldemort, and how Harry and his friends decided to fight back. This story is brilliantly written, and I so enjoyed the Trio relationship.

Right now there is a new, very promising fic called *Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994). It's set after Voldemort's return in year 4. But instead of ignoring his return, the Ministry chose to appease Voldemort by passing discriminatory pro-pureblood laws and increasing Muggleborn persecutions. Hermione quickly saw chilling parallels to 1930s Nazi Germany, and began preparing. The story feels brutal, grim, and realistic, as things about an underground resistance should be. It's still in early stage, and the author will update it every Saturday.
