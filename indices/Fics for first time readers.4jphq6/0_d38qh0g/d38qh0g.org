Have they read the series? If so, then any of: linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian), linkffn(The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville), or linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided by Inverarity) would be great entry-points into the fandom. All are high-quality, post-Hogwarts continuation fics that would be easy to read.

I'd also suggest linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle by Inverarity), which has many novel ideas for the Harry Potter universe, yet is canon compliant and won't grind gears.

Of course, getting your friends to read novels for a study might be a bit tough. A quality one-shot might be in order. Perhaps linkffn(Dark Marauder by BajaB), linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair), linkffn(The Twine Bracelet by CheddarTrek), or the impossibly awesome linkffn(India by Perspicacity). (I kid.)
