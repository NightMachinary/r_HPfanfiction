I'd go with something that is canon and post DH but before the epilogue, also complete if possible. If they are into harry potter at all this will probably catch their attention better then some kind of intense AU where harry is a wheel of cheese and Hogwarts is a grocery store or something... I'd probably read that. Anyway that was a bit of an extreme example but I think I made my point, for beginners you want to ease them into it, give them something they expect and doesn't freak them out to much.

I'd suggest linkffn(The First Day by little0bird)

Or something like that, that one might be a little emotional in the first dozen chapters or so for a beginner and it isn't complete haha but it's a good one.
