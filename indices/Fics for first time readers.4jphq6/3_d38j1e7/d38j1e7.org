I'd say it's definitely going to hinge at least somewhat on individual reading preferences, and how old your friends are. Because that can change your recommendation from 'sweet, fluffy one-shot' to 'serious, novel-length piece'. Shipping pieces may be offputting to some, especially if said stories lack proper justification for doing so, (e.g. 'random AU where <Slytherin Girl> coincidentally moves next door to Harry #557'). That said, there are some excellent shipping stories out there. It all depends on your audience, really. My recs, should I make them, would likely be coloured by my own preferences for long, serious femslash, so I'll try to avoid that unless you want examples of LGBTQ stuff?

With that bias in mind, I'd recommend linkffn(9238861) for the latter, as an unabashed Hermione lover. It's solidly written, has no random shipping thrown in (shipping for its own sake - a romantic plot tumour, if you will), and tries to tackle some of the core conceits of canon in a believable way.

For the love of god, don't recommend anything by Robst, no matter how popular the man's stories are. Those things would get ripped apart by anyone with a functioning idea of literary critique.
