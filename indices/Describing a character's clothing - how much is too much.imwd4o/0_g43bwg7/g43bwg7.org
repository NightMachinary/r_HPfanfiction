I guess it depends on why you are describing a character's clothing. In the books as I recall, clothing is often brought up in accordance with character traits. ie, Ron's second hand robes, Umbridge's imaculate pinkness, Dumbledore's quirkiness, Lupin looking like a vagabond, etc. Once you set up a baseline for how people dress, you only need to bring something up if it adds to the characters or story. In fanfiction, it's difficult I think because we already have an idea of what people look like, so its unnecessary to draw attention to a person's dress most of the time.

A situation that you would bring up dress is like so:

"Harry furrowed his brow in confusion as he stared at Hermione. Sure, they were going to go after the horcruxes but she was wearing a rather sturdy set of what he assumed was American military-grade camoflauge body armor."
