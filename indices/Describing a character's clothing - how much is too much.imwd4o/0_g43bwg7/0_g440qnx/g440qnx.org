Now I'm imagining a scene where Hermione shows up in the uniform of a general of the Red Army after having purchased the equipment for an entire armoured division Lord of War style (the Ukraine scene) and proceeds to arm the DA out of her arsenal handbag.

Also makes for a hilarious if short Battle of Hogwarts since that is the one scene where muggle weapons could be absolutely lethal due to the position of Hogwarts and its wards which prevent apparation.
