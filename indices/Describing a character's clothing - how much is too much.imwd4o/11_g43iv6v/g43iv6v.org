If you want to have wizarding clothes very different from the normal ones AND you even care for it, then you should have very firm idea what you are talking and some background document like [[https://is.gd/z6uqnT][this one by /u/Taure]]. However, the point is that you cannot overwhelm reader with it. You can use it only when it actually makes some point in the story. So, yes, I don't want to know what color of jeans Ginny had when went shopping groceries to Ottery St Catchpole (I don't want to know that she was putting on her clothes at all, that is just assumed by her getting up), but it MAY be important when she is going out for the ball and she is trying to impress Harry.
