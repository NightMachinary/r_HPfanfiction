most fanfiction is good because it goes over the top with details. you wouldn't want to read a dark-harry without extremely long winded inner monologues. if your harry is getting on with his life describing the things and places he chooses to live it in sets the scene and mood the same way.

of course if you want your story to read like a regular book you should leave out all these descriptions so your reader can imagine themselves as the main character.
