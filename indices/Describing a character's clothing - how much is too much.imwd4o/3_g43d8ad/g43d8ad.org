Like many other details in a story, they have to add something. I like when we get a brief reminder, for example, of Ron's background being not very rich especially if it's a factor that comes into play in a scene, and he's wearing hand me downs or old quidditch team t shirts. If clothing brings to attention someone's status, someone's demeanour, something relevant to the scene, I think it's as valuable as other details.

And sometimes it just adds the the reader's mind's eye, so to speak - helping them understand the environment or the type of person that individual is.

In saying that, the majority of the time that I read about clothes they don't add a lot, but sometimes I feel like because we all know Hogwarts and the dress code, it can become superfluous. Also, when details are laid on very heavily by a narrator, it can feel like we're lingering our attention a lot on one detail. Writing ultimately communicates thought, and so it makes us spend a lot of time thinking about clothes. If there's a good reason why, then be my guest, but I usually like actions. So someone fussing over someone else's collar or pleats on a dress, to me, is more interesting than a narration itinerary of exactly what everyone is wearing. It might show a character being nervous, for example.

Also with girls? You can do a lot with this - someone can be friendly by adjusting your clothes, altering them with spells, repairing them, changing colour. Or they can pay compliments and wish they had those clothes because they don't have money. One thing I saw someone do was depict Lavender as quietly gossiping to figure out where Hermione got fancy robes, because she was awkward about asking (showing lavender's sometimes poor social skills) and because they were awfully tasteful for a muggleborn (hermione in that instance had been lent them).

So clothes are never just clothes. They do tell you about someone or about events, but I kind of want to see how they contribute - to someone's character, or to plot, or conflict, or something. Irrelevant lingering on clothing can lag the reader behind so whatever you do decide on, try to make it fold in to the scene. As a woman, I can say that in women's circles clothes contribute a lot to social dynamics and when I see an author do this capably I always love to see it, and they're often women. When I see male authors do it I'm like ðŸ™Œ well done, well done. A lot of blokes miss those kinds of details. Makes me wonder what details of men's lives I miss actually.
