Personally, if they mention a brand clothing i am out. I am not here to read about a 12 year olds dream clothing. Does the scene require mention of clothes? Such as a convo while getting dressed? Yes mention them wrangling with the clothes. -chop up their sentences as they pull something over their head. I do however NOT ever need to know the brand.

...if i have to read one more fic about some chick wearing her jimmy chochoo (or whatever) shoes, im staging a intervention.
