Look... I'm not great at writing but I do strongly believe in being sparing about descriptions of anything... including clothes. It's a lot of extraneous detail in many situations so what matters is to focus on the important stuff.

For example, I've been working on an Azkaban escape fic so descriptions are obviously pretty important. First, naturally, comes the Prison Description (of which there are many in even my short, WIP fic, but only one describes the clothes). Second, comes the "escape" description. And I guess eventually there'll be a third important description: the resolution/ending... with a possible epilogue description too. But even in this context I don't think I've been over describing. Consider the escape description (prior to acquiring a hat to hide Harry's scar):

  C crossed the plaza with purpose. She looked a lot better than when she'd gone into the hospital. So did Potter, of course, but Alice had proved a better judge of C's size than Potter's. Where her second hand muggle t-shirt and jeans fit C well, the suit Alice found for Potter was made for a larger man who'd followed 90s fashions closely. It wasn't the 1990s. Worse still, the salmon colour scheme did not suit the auburn beard Potter opted to keep, despite the barber's advice. He did agree to have it tidied up, though. Fitting in was important.

(Alice is an OC muggle Doctor, not Alice Longbottom. She's barely in the story and gets a very cursory description (she had a pimple)... her colleague gets a tiny bit more because I wanted to make a joke.)

There are also two more muggle OCs in the third (as far as I'm in) chapter. They don't get any description of their clothes at all. Vernon is also in the chapter. As it happens, I do mention the colour of his tie, but nothing else.

I would argue that the quality of the writing has to be pretty good to sustain more detailed descriptions. I mean, that paragraph above is reasonably wordy but the actual level of detail is pretty scant, right?
