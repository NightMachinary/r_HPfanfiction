Characterisation dependent.

If your scarf signifies their connection to their mentor who gave it to them, describe it. If that scarf will be a murder weapon later, mention it. If it's not relevant to plot or characterisation, let the reader imagine if they have a scarf or not.

If your POV character is Lavender Brown, describe the clothes of people she encounters like a fashion magazine might. If it's Harry Potter, maybe make a mention if they wear something outlandish.
