Honestly, variable.

Normally it's a case of clothes being something that attracts the eye because they're big things people see, but people don't usually care about minuta of the design. If it's something 'common' or just establishing, then probably a vague type/cut/colour and maybe image description or if there's something that is liable to draw attention to the clothes. If it's something special or there's a major change, particularly if it's something not commonly seen then it's more likely to get more attention, though it's also situational. Someone in the midst of a conflict or under pressure probably won't have much attention for someone's looks at that point.

For a couple of examples:

#+begin_quote
  From the smoke a pair of shapes ran through a deserted section of the city. Two girls, tall for their age and well built, *one sporting a blood covered hand to go with her red t-shirt, the other wearing soot covered blue.*
#+end_quote

First intro for the protagonists in a fic I'm trying to write, note in the bolded section how there's little there on the clothing apart from contrast and indicating they'd had encounters.

#+begin_quote
  There was the sound of shearing metal as she turned to find her sister standing tall once more, *dark plate armour covering most of her body*. “Should keep a watch on your back, sis,” Megan commented over her shoulder.

  “That's what I rely on you for,” Sally replied, checking the abyssal before turning to the rest of them, a *second turret attached to her arm. A backpack shaped like her hull locked to her back, two pentad torpedo launchers locked to her legs and several other items forming over her body.* “You good?” she asked.
#+end_quote

Once again, the same pair in the same fic, but things changed, so there's things happening, though even then there's not too much description of what some things are right there.

#+begin_quote
  Commodore Shipperley met her gaze easily. “Commander, let me introduce you to the beginnings of your new command. Angela Kilburn, HMNB Devonport,” he indicated the young woman in an *older navy uniform.*

  As the woman stepped back, Shipperley indicated the blonde teen. “Robyn Stevens, HMS Zenith, pennant number R95,” this time the fourteen year old in a *cadet working uniform* nodded.

  “And you obviously know the other pair, Megan Jones, the new ‘Rhyfelwr' of Plymouth and Sally Jones, newly awakened HMS Zephyr pennant R19.” *Both her nieces were wearing what looked like their cadet uniforms.*
#+end_quote

Once again, they've changed outfit, but there's not much to the descriptions even then beyond 'navy uniform' or 'cadet uniform'. Most navies tend towards somewhat similar styles for working uniforms so people can probably imagine it.
