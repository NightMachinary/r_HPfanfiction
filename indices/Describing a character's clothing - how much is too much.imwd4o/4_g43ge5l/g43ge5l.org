By what metric, though? It's your story. Add as many details as you like.

Generally, I agree that words should serve a purpose. But the purpose might require a very detailed approach. So for instance, we are never told in Canon what a "robe" is. I wanted to define exactly how that looked like, and what "fashion" would mean, in terms of robes, so I just spent some 2,000 words on getting dressed.

That covered my purpose. And that aside, it was a fun thing to write, which already is enough justification.

On the other end, it might be nothing more than a line -- a few words -- a colour, playing with contrasts and characterisations. There is no universal answer to "too much", really. It's a you-know-it-when-you-see-it thing -- if you're in the middle of an action sequence, and go off on a tangent describing in detail mudstains on socks, you're /just/ doing something wrong, it doesn't mean that it's too much as a matter of principle in general.
