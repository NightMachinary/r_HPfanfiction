linkao3(25133773) Clones and Wizards is also good, here Harry is transported to Star Wars years during the Philosophers Stone incident, so he doesn't know much magic or magic lore, he has to learn himself, also the characters involved are not usual suspects, entirely new characters, a lot of exploration about the situation of Clone Wars.
