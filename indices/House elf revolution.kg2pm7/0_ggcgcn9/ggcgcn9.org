A related idea I wrote recently:

*/Hermione Granger and the Narrowly Averted Disaster/*

"And with thirty-one to twenty-five, the Ayes have it. The House-Elf Legal Protections, Exchanges, and Regulations Act is now law of the land," the Chief Warlock pronounced.

* * *

That night, at an informal SPEW reunion to celebrate the HELPER Act, it was Neville who broached the question.

"Why no emancipation?"

"Emancipation?" asked Ron.

"I mean, your law gives house-elves an unalienable right to change masters, but not to be freed. 'Exchange' could be 'Emancipation'. Why not?"

Hermione hesitated.

"You didn't have the votes?"

"No, that's not quite it." She shook her head. "It's rather embarrassing after all these years...

"Anyway, back in---I think---'96, I did some research on whether house-elves had any non-house relatives. And what I found was rather disturbing. House-elves once were---still are, biologically---imps, driven to create chaos and destruction. I really didn't want to believe it, but all my research confirmed this. It turned out that back when it happened, binding them was a humane alternative to genocide."

The table was silent, perhaps less aghast at the revelation than at Hermione's willingness to speak of bondage and genocide so casually.

She ploughed ahead. "It's true. Harry, remember what Dobby did to you in our second year at Hogwarts? He had the best intentions. But, he was acting of his own initiative, and so he went about them in the most destructive ways possible. They can't help it.

"I estimate that a free house-elf will generally be bound by their cultural conditioning for a generation, perhaps two. Eventually, they, or their children, will revert to their base instincts. That's why I stopped leaving clothes out for them."

"Why didn't you tell us?" Harry finally asked.

"I... I guess back then, I didn't want to admit that I almost caused a disaster. And later, I decided that if more people knew, they'd take it as a license to abuse their elves. And also, we'd have an even tougher time getting the HELPER Act on the books.

"I couldn't give them freedom without causing disaster. I tried to give them the next best thing."
