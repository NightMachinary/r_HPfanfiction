Now that I think about it, we find out their birth dates when Harry sees their graves. That probably when their age is established.

Idk, I think everything in the text implies a closer age, like 2-3 years at most. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't refer to it as similar to Draco and Harry's rivalry; a 17-year old having beef with an 11-year old is just bullying. It's in PoA we learn the details of the conflict, which imo at the very least heavily implies same year.

I guess it's possible people interpreted Snape as younger rather than older, but I think that with the added context of being the same age as Harry's parents without knowing how old they were, the more likely age is 40+. He doesn't really present youthfully, either.

Either way, I don't see the rationale or allure behind a Snape/Student ship, but that's just me :)
