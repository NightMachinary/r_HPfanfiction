  Idk, I think everything in the text implies a closer age, like 2-3 years at most. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn't refer to it as similar to Draco and Harry's rivalry; a 17-year old having beef with an 11-year old is just bullying. It's in PoA we learn the details of the conflict, which imo at the very least heavily implies same year.

Fair enough, that does make more sense contextually. I can't speak for boarding school, but I went to two different school that both hosted grade to high school students so I saw a bit of everything. So anything is possible, but that does make more sense.

Honestly for me, I wasn't into the whole teacher/student thing, but even as I first read the books I didn't really realise how much older Snape was even with those clues. My brain simply read, didn't really think of the finer/unsaid details. Always imagined him younger than he was until I saw the movies/read the wikia. Probably the same with a lot of others.
