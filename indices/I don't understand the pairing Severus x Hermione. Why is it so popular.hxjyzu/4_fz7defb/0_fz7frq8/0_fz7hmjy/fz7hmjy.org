Oh right, I actually had forgotten about those facts? possibilities? Idr, It's been a while since I've read the actual series in it's entirety.

Well even with it being mentioned in PS, it leaves a possible 6-8 year gap at max between them depending on birthdays (unknown at the time). Again it's been a while, but I don't recall someone mentioned that they all were in the same year in POA onward, just that they were there at the time time. And even still, I don't think in-book there were mentioned ages for Sirius or Remus. And they were often considered younger than they actually were. I /think/ the first solid showing that they all were in the same year was the pensive scene in HBP. Again, could be wrong.

A lot of information came out outside of the books and even after the series ended.

Also, fandom gonna fanfic. I think if you add in the real life time between books, then the theory or idea that Snape was younger than he was could have spread in popularity for the people that were writing fics while the actual series was ongoing.
