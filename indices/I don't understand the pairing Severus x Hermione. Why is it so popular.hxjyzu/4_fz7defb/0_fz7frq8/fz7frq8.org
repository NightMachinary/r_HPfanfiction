  Snape not really having an age confirmed in the books until I think Half-Blood Prince
#+end_quote

This has me thinking. Quirrellmort tells Harry that Snape was at Hogwarts with James. So by the end of Philosopher's Stone we know that they're about the same age, and later(PoA?) learn that they were in the same year. But when do we learn that James and Lily were only 20 when they had Harry? I can't recall if it's mentioned in the books at all, but we know about it somehow?
