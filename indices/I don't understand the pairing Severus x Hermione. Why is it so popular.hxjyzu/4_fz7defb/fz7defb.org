I think it was a mix/verity of things:

1. Snape not really having an age confirmed in the books until I think /Half-Blood Prince./ It was just known that he was the youngest of all the professors. So some people took that as him in his early to mid 20s, not in his 30s.
2. Some people in fanfiction are really into that teacher/student thing or power dynamics
3. Some people just really liked Snape and Hermione was already a character (a main one at that) established in the series. So people would user her as an OC (or self-insert) rather than making up a whole actual character because less people read OC-centered fics
4. Alan Rickman is popular (rinse and repeat no.3)

Personally, I'm not into the ship or any other Snape/Student equivalent and usually avoid fics that have it tagged (unless it's like a really background ship that pops up randomly/untagged in a fic im already invested into- then I skim it over). I can never get over the fact that they met when Hermione (or Harry/whatever student) met when they were 10/11 years old.

Honestly, if Hogwarts was more of a college/university rather than a grade school thru high school, I think the Snape/Student thing would be even more popular than it is now. Since it would be two adults (17/18 and 31) at a first meeting rather than a child and adult (11 and 31).
