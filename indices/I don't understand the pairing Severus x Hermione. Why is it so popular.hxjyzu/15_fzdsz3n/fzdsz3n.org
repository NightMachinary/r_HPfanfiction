I used to dig it a lot when I was younger, though now my taste lean towards more canon. And I think a big part of the appeal is the older, smarter, misunderstood guy fantasy and equal part Alan Rickman's sympathetic performance.

I'm guilty of a lot of SI when it comes to Hermione and I think the books and the movies do Romione and Harry so wrong that I detest her peers' idiocy and declare (to myself) that no one her age could possibly keep up with her and/or appreciate her. [This is also why my first foray into fanfics really lean into Dramione because at least he was thrown into the bottom end in the last two books and there's no way but up for his character in my head but I digress.]

Enter Severus Snape. The youngest Potion Master, who created his own recipes and spells and just so brilliant. Sure, he was an asshole but it's because he was forced to stay in the job he hates to protect the manifestation of the people he loves and hates the most to atone for the folly of his youth. If only he was given a plot where he can do this while simultaneously open himself up to other people and a lot of early long fanfics delivered this, which only sparks the popularity of the ship.
