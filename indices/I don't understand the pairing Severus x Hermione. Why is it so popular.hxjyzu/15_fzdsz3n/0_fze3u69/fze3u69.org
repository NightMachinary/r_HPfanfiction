I still think he's abusive and petty. I mean, really? Antagonising 11-year-old children? Trying to belittle Harry because of his father? Do you realise how fucked up is that? He has so many emotional issues... I don't know how can people say he's sexy or attractiveðŸ˜‚

In no way I think he's redeemed himself of everything he's done thorought the years... At all.

In any case, good analysis! I like it
