Possibly. We're never really told class standings or grades for the class of '98, outside of his friends' OWL scores. We know he was made prefect, but so was Ron so clearly that has nothing to do with grades. He did well in potions, possibly undeserved but we don't know for sure; but Neville was good in Herbology and nobody claims he's a genius. Class standings and Head Boy/Girl for their year weren't valid due to the circumstances, and we never saw their NEWTS. (Do we even know who were Head Boy/Girl during the occupation?)

That said, the truth is I didn't think about their peers. :)
