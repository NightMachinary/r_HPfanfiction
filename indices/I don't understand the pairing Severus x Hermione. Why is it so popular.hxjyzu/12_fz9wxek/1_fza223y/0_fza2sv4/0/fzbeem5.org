Honestly, I love this subreddit so much. I love that you've put that much thought into the Hogwarts class of 1998 class standings.

I guess I remembered Hermione & Draco being mentioned as top of the class, but honestly it's probably from fanfiction because I can't keep it all straight in my head! ðŸ˜‚
