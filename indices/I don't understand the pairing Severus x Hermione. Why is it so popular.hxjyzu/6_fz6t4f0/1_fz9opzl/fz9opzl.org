She is? I honestly never got that impression at all, and always found it odd when people made the comparision legitimately (and not just in jest). Hermione is far more studious, and far more socially awkward (Lily was supposedly popular, Hermione is not, and I never got the impression from the little we see of Lily that she was the kind of person to go into a panic for an exam). They're both Muggleborns sorted into Gryffindor, and I've definitely seen people less friendly with Snape in postwar SSHG snark to him about the likeness, but I personally never found them any similar at all beyond those 2 things.
