  Okay, so maybe after a long day of antagonizing Harry Potter, insulting his students and generally sneering and being curt, Snape goes down to his room in the dungeon, turns on The Cure's “Disintegration,” and cries while hugging his pillow, because deep down inside he's all wounded and sensitive.

Bwahaha, nailed it. Also all the notes about how problematic it is to try to "fix" a jerk like Snape. Yeah in reality it would be toxic as fuck, but it makes a fun story :)
