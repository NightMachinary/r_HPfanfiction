I don't know, but I read a good one. I liked the interaction between them. If well-written, there is a chemistry. Hermione is intelligent enough to see through (in time) the layers of deceptions Snape puts on. Depends on how you interpret Snape. Evil or broken, but a really strong man? To be a spy and deceit Voldemort... If you can see through his teaching style and get a glimpse on that, you cannot see the man as the same ever again. But only, if Snape is not a twisted evil in the service of good (through Dumbledor).
