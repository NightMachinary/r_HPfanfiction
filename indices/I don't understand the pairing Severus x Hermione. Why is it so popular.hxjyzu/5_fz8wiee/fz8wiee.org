I like this ship, but ONLY (and it is a strict ONLY) when the premise is that Snape survived the war and around ten years later he ends up working with Hermione for whatever reason and they reconnect as the people they are now, not the people they were then. She MUST be 25 or older and successful in her own career and they must have not seen each other in the intervening years - in other words, the power imbalance is removed and they are relating as two adults, not a former student and teacher.

I think their characters, their fanon characters at least, are suited. And I enjoy these fics with these specific premises because you get to see Hermione thrive in a relationship with an intellectual equal and generally get to see Snape open up and become a human being with feelings other than blind rage. But there absolutely has to be a situation in the fic that puts them on an equal footing before the romance starts or it is indeed icky.

I absolutely agree that any student/teacher stuff, or even when she's only a couple years out of school and they still relate as "authority figure speaking to to child" are gross.
