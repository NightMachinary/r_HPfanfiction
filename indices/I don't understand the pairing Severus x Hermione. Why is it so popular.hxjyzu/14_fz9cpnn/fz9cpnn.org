While not a pairing I particularly like, I don't /mind/ it. I mostly browse Snape fics. The vast majority of SSHG fics are teacher/student smut -- which are probably mostly written by people with either a teacher fantasy, a fantasy for Alan Rickman or both. I avoid those fics. Then there are the SSHG fics I actually read -- post-war ones. While I don't /like/ them in the sense that I go out of my way for them, they're common enough when I look for Snape fics in general that I see them crop up a lot. And their personalities are at least a decent match, if you file off Snape's more cruel edges (basically more like the behaviour of movie!Snape rather than stuff like "I see no difference") and focus on his intelligence and academic interest -- something he shares with Hermione. They're both the kind of people to study for studying's sake, rather than merely doing well enough based on just talent, and I could see them get closer as a result of some research project that calls for both of their skills, or similar.

Hell, I've read a couple of Marauder-era SSHG, and I genuinely believe that if Snape was pulled away from DE recruitment camp, a teenage Snape and Hermione would be an almost ideal match.

And besides that -- it's not like you have a lot of options for whom to pair him with otherwise. I've always viewed Snape as really only having 3 non-OC female prospect that I can see him end up with, depending on time period and circumstances. Lily (move him away from being entrenched into junior DE recruitment and I could very well see it happen), Narcissa (if she's portrayed as morally good with Lucius being the monster she wants to get away from, or who met an untimely death) and Hermione (due to above reasons).
