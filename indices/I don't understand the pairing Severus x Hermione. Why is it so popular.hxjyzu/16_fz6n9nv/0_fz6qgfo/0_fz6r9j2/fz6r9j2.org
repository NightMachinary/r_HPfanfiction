That would require me to attempt to relate to people that are interested in an emotionally abusive man in his 30s either seducing or accepting the advances of a girl he meets when she is 11 years old.

It's pretty nasty, truthfully. I don't know what drives fanfic authors to want to see protagonists (like Hr or Harry) get molested by Snape/L. Malfoy/Voldemort. It's genuinely baffling.
