Two reasons, three things.\\
First, you are coming off very judgmental. I'm not sure if you meant it that way, but you should be aware of that. It's fanfiction. People can ship whatever they want.\\
Second, the first reason people like it is because it's hot. There is a lot of really good Snape/Hermione smut based on the teacher/student thing. Top bdsm material right there. There aren't really moral issues because it's just smut. It isn't more complicated than that and they aren't real people.\\
Third, the second reason people like it is because it can be done well once the characters are aged up a bit. Look at Remus/Tonks! Yes, the age gap is more forgivable there, but the concept is still the same, and Hermione isn't just anybody. In most of these stories, she's broken, and is Snape, and they're both just looking for some comfort in a godforsaken war. Where there's war, convention is abandoned and you take what you can get. As for age, the reason that it's a problem is because of the power dynamic created by the relative maturity and wisdom of the elder. In Hermione, we have someone intelligent enough not to be fooled easily, and someone who has been forced to grow up far too fast by Voldemort's war. She isn't just some teenager - she's had to figure out what she stands for and what she believes, because it was that, or die. As a result, she knows what she's getting into if she starts something with Snape. Additionally, Snape is broken, and lacks the maturity and wisdom to manipulate her effectively even if that was his goal. As a result, anything that happens would be a result of organic chemistry rather than manipulation. Finally, it's interesting, although this point you probably don't connect with as much.
