I meant to be judgmental. Your Remus/Tonks analogy is a bad one, because he didn't meet her/have daily contact with her when she was pre-pubescent. It is MUCH different to say "i'm 40 years old and I met this really great 25 year old that i fell in love with", versus "I'm 35 years old and this 11 year old really turns me on". Even if a story has them not get together until Hermione is of legal age, it is still really, really sinister. /He's known her since she was an elementary school student!/ What about that is hot?

Fanfiction is about wish fulfillment (we write what we wish the original author/creator would have done). That's why harems, OP!, super-rich protagonists are all very popular tropes. What does it say about a "pairing" where a 6th grade teacher falls for his student?

I'm not telling anyone they can't write about molestation/grooming. It's words on a screen, no one's being hurt by it. But yea, I think it's pretty fucked up.
