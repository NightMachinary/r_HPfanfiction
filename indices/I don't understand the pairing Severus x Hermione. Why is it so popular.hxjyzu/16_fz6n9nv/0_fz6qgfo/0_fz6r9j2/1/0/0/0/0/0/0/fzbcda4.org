And if it was real world, yes, it would be problematic. But this is fiction, and fanfiction at that. You might prefer to read fic that conforms closely to the standards and morality of the real world, but for many people, myself included, fic is a space to explore things that would not necessarily be accepted in our society. It doesn't mean that we want these things to happen, or that we think they are acceptable in reality. It's just interesting to see what might happen if they did.

Yes, a lot of it is taboo exploration. But why is that a bad thing?
