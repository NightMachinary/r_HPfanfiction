Does Snape fuck her when she's 11 years old?

Then why in the world do you keep /bringing that fact up?!?/

What does it /matter/ what she did or how she was when she was younger. /She's not anymore/.

Imagine this: You are 11 years old and you meet another 11 year old. You become best friends. You spend more time with each other than with your families. When you grow up, you hook up and get married. Is that weird?

Listen to your argument: If you know someone from when they were 11 years old and you date them when they grow up /you are a pedophile!!/

Like wtf man.

Did they fuck when she was 11? Did they fuck when she was 12? 13? 14? If the answer is no, /then why does it matter?!?/ They are both adults and they can make their own decisions and if they want to fuck then who are you to say that it's wrong?
