It's hot because of the power imbalance, not besides it. She's 17, and he's a teacher. Power exchange is hot. That's the whole reason bdsm exists. Not everyone judges something morally before deciding whether it's hot or not. It's akin to separating art from artist.

Fanfiction is sometimes about wish-fulfillment, but not always. Sometimes it's just because someone was curious about exploring the interactions between these two characters without having any kind of moral angle. It isn't that people think, "this is fucked up, but I'm ok with that." People just don't always think about it, and that's okay. You don't always have to in fanfiction. Just because you can't turn it off doesn't mean everyone else can't.

It's great that you're okay with people taking the action, but I think you should refrain from judging people from reading it in the first place. That isn't right or fair, because there's nothing actually wrong with reading it. Your judgement is baseless once you actually think about it.

Finally, just responding to my Remus/Tonks analogy is straw-manning my argument. If you want to have a productive discussion, you should consider the other points I made as well about Hermione's relative maturity and Snape's immaturity. Here's another argument: Hermione is a completely different person at the end of the books than at the beginning, and so arguments that that gives Snape an advantage are silly. You said that Snape would have to be grooming and molesting her. It isn't molestation if she's an adult, and it isn't grooming, because she's the smartest witch of her age and been through a war, and Snape isn't capable of that besides. He's too broken.
