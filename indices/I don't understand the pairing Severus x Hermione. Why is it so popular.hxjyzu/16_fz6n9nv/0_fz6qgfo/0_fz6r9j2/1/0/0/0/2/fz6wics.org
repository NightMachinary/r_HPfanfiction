I guess it depends on whether you see her as a different person or not. I combine the fact that Snape never really knew her and that she came back a completely different person after the war to be equivalent to her meeting Snape that 7th year. I think both of them were so used to not seeing each other as people that he hasn't really watched her learn or grow because he didn't want to. For the sake of the ship, I count the first moments when he really sees her in a fic as him meeting her for the first time.
