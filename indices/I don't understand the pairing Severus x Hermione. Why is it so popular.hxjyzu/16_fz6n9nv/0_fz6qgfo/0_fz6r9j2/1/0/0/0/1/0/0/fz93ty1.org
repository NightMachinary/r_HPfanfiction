Who the actual fuck said /anything/ about /grooming/?

Do you know anything about Snape? Do you /really/ think that Snape would care to groom a fucking child, Snape?! Broken fucking Snape that still loves Lilly and fucking hates himself and, by extension, most of everyone else Snape?

I get the feeling that you've never even /seen/ an actual Severus/Hermione fic or that you've only seen the pure smut/Dead-dove-don't-eat ones.
