Look, i appreciate you writing out these justifications. And i don't think it makes you a bad person or anything like that for reading it.

Here's the issue I haven't seen you address - Snape meets Hermione when she is objectively /a child/. He spends more time with her than her parents do for 6-7 years. It is a TOTALLY different situation than a 17-year old having a crush on a teacher. If you are an adult, just imagine that. You watch an 11 year old child grow up, go through awkward puberty, date other kids, get in schoolyard arguments, etc. It doesn't matter if Hermione is the most mature 11-year old on earth. She's still a little girl.

Snape isn't meeting a teenager at 17. He's watching a child grow up. Now, to be fair: if an author makes Hermione a transfer student, or Snape gets hired her 7th year, okay. I wouldn't be so squicked about it. But otherwise... well, personally, I find it very disturbing.

To each their own, though.
