It is impossible, yes, based on the context in canon (Snape being in authority over her from childhood). This whole discussion is akin to the controversy over Vladimir Nabokov's /Lolita/, where a middle-aged man gets together with a young teenager. It is considered a hugely influential piece of literature, but is also to this day exceedingly controversial.

Just like we've been discussing, people argue over whether that book is decent or not. There's nothing you can say that would make me feel that such a plot could be crafted in a way that isn't horrifying and disturbing, and I suppose that nothing I say will convince you it isn't problematic.

Have a good night!
