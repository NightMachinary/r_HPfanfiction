I think I know what the problem is.

You and I have read completely different fics with Severus/Hermione.

I will tell you as bluntly as possible: Snape did /not/ groom Hermione.

How hard is that to understand? An adult and a student can end up in a relationship... /without grooming!/

Do you think that such a thing is impossible? I thought I was plain enough in my previous comment, or did you not read it?

Snape, as a character, has no interest in grooming a child into a relationship. It's Hermione that pushes it. It's Hermione that wants to help Severus out from his depression. All that while Severus is doing his best to push her away. Severus does /not/ want Hermione. He did /not/ groom her.

Is it that impossible for you to comprehend that Severus and Hermione could have a relationship /without/ grooming?
