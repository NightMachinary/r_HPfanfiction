I'm sorry but this is absurd.

Your attempt at justification reads as a list of excuses for predatory behavior. Why try and defend the actions at all?

In any modern context the relationship is disturbing. Just like the myriad of stories in which you have a protagonist like Harry rape/mind control women into sex slaves are unsettling.

There aren't moral or in world justifications. The only fesible justification is the fact that it's taboo fetish exploration in a fictional setting in which the negative consequence of it existing are little to none.
