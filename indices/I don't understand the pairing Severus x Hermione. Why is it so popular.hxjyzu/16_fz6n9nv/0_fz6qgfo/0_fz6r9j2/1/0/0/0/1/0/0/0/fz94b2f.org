What you are describing is grooming though. An adult guiding a child into adulthood and into a relationship with the adult.

Like I said in another comment, I wouldn't be grossed out if Snape was hired in her 7th year, or she was a transfer student. But an adult guardian-type figure (again, HW profs are way more engaged with their students than regular teachers) who is in charge of a young girl for years and years is... yuck.

But look man, it's words on the internet. If you like fantasizing about that stuff, you're not hurting anybody. Lots of stuff on the internet is pretty ick, reading about a middle aged man slowly seducing a child is far from the most objectionable thing I have seen online.
