Everyone magical more than what, about four years younger than Snape has been taught by him. Anyone within seven years of his age was at school wih him, and he didn't endear himself to many in his younger years. You're not leaving him with many romantic options here...

Also, just because he knew her as a child did not mean that he sexualised her as a child. People grow up, and he would be with the older version of Hermione, not the younger one!
