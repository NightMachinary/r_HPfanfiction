You can't be that obtuse. Your example is nonsensical and meaningless. Here's what I am saying:

You are 30+ years old. An 11 year old child then spends several hours a day with you for the next 7 years. You see the kid grow up, make friends, be awkward, go through all the weird and annoying parts of getting older. You have authority over the child, more than a teacher would (boarding schools are way more involved than normal k-12). The child, after spending years and years in your care, is now an older teenager.

You're trying to tell me that it is okay, in that example, for the the adult to seduce and have sexual relations with that teenager??? You see nothing immoral or problematic?

How is that at all similar to two children growing up together and deciding to enter a romantic relationship when they're older?

These opinions really must be from younger people. Please believe me, once you're older this concept (grooming a child and waiting for them to get older) will seem really awful to you also.
