All of this really comes down to the writer. The problem with these tropes is that writers too often just use them as shortcuts. Exe flash Veela puberty is in stories for no other reason than to make a Gabby/Harry relationship easier. Other times, its just cut and paste and I can see every story beat a mile away.

The thing is, its very possible to use common tropes to make things /more/ interesting. To put more challenges in front of the characters and provoke interesting character development.
