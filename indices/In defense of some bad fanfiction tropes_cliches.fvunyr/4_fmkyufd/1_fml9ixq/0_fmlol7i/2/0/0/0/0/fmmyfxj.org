I think it's partly preconceived notions about how abusive the Dursleys are that's affecting how people interpret the text, too. If people think they were subjecting Harry to extreme physical abuse, they'll read what's there in that context. Petunia /must/ have been trying to kill Harry, because that's how evil Petunia is, and Petunia is that evil because she tried to kill Harry.
