I think people have different ideas on what a pan is and how effective it would be as a weapon.

If you are thinking about cheap, light and thin aluminum cast and teflon coated pans that you can get for less than 15 USD dollars - not effective weapons. A smack would hurt, but not kill.

But grandma's cast iron skilled that is 150 years old and weighs a ton could definitely kill somebody.

Finally there is the factor how serious you are with the hitting. Depending how you aim and how fast you are on the draw an older child or teen will duck and you will have made your point even without actually making contact.
