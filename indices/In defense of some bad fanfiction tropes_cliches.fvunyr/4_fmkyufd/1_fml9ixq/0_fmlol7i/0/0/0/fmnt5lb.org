Harry would have done accidental magic, no?

What's stop him from giving you a lobtomy when he get's mad as a 4 year old?

Think of it from a layman perspective, not a harry potter reader. You literally know nothing about magic except that it killed your sister and her husband, and that it happens randomly from your nephew.
