I mean, can you imagine living in a world where wizard's and witches exist....

and you're normal?

That's fucking terrifying.

I mean shit, how easy is it, for example, to use magic rape a muggle and get away with it scot free. The wizarding world hates muggles as a general rule so they won't even care to really enforce it either.

I've always been a "fan" of the muggle borne theory that explains their numbers as being leftovers from wizards who used mind-wipes or potions to have criminal fun.

Does it excuse their abuse? Not really.

But humanity has done far more horrific things to fake witches. What would they do to real ones?
