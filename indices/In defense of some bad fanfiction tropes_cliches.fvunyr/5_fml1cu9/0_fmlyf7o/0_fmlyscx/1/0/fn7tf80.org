i thought it was one way as harry>girls rather harry<>girls and doesn't change until later? basically the girls can feel him and will get his scars but until he gets pieces of their souls he won't get any scars from them. he is literally walking around with only a quarter of a soul.

â€‹

and something to think about soul bonds where they share a piece of there souls. wouldn't that be a naturally occuring horcrux?
