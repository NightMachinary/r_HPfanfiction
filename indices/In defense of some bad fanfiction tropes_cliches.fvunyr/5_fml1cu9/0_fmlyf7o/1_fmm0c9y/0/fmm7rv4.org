It's very much NOT Harmony, that's the whole thing. It shows how bad it would be if you were soulbonded to the wrong person. And also shows how bad it would be if you were soulbonded to the RIGHT person.

Really, give it a read, just to explore these two things. I loved the author's take on the whole soulbond concept. The story isn't a giant vat of pain and misery. It's quite a bit more lighthearted and very unique.
