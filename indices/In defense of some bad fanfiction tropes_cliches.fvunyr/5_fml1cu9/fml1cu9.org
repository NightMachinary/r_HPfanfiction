I immediately thought of the Soul-Bond trope. There are /so/ many bad fics that feature it, and they mostly just boil down to the author trying to make Harry as OP as possible, and to avoid drama between the two Soul-Bondees because they /understand each other so well./ However all of what I've said does not a bad fic make.

Enter my favourite fanfiction of all time; [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/series.php?seriesid=54][Meaning of One]] by Sovran.

It has OP!Harry and the instant complete understanding of their bond mate, but the brilliance of it is that it explores all the ramifications of the bond and the other characters' true to canon reactions to it. It considers all these little things that would simply be glossed over, like how they can't play that many card games with each other because they always know what the other is thinking and seeing. It's story /about/ Harry and Ginny's life with the Soul-Bond, both during the everyday moments and the high stakes fights with Voldemort.

There is just so much you could do with the Soul-Bond trope and it's never used, poorly thought out, or just a footnote. There have been so many times that I try to find a fic that captures the same magic as MoO that I end up dropping.
