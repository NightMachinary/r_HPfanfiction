I've seen a number of fanfics make the point that Harry's distrust of adults and need to rush into danger personally could be credited to the Dursleys' abuse. His whole childhood, adults abused him or believed lies about him. By the time he gets to Hogwarts, he believes adults are useless and it's up to him to protect the Stone/smuggle out a dragon/catch the Heir/etc.

Granted, this isn't spelled out in canon. But it's a kinder interpretation than "adults actually are useless, why is no one doing their fucking job".
