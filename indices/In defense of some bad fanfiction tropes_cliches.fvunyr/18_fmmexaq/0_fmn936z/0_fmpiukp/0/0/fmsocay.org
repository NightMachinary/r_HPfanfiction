"He doesn't trust them /because/ they are actually useless" is my interpretation of canon, too.

I do like that moment as an illustration of a good character having character flaws. McGonagall isn't evil or malicious there. She's carrying a bunch of paperwork and some 11yo kids run up thinking they know better than all the adults. She should take the time to figure out why they think that (especially since they have info they shouldn't, i.e. the Stone), but for just a moment she gives in to frustration and impatience... and evil nearly prevails. That scene, done right, can be a gem.
