  He should be a quivering mess

I did a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fqzz94/harry_potter_has_no_shortage_of_traumatic_events/][post]] recently about this. I have plans for a fic that include semi-realistic consequences for things that happen in canon.

I had ideas ranging from Harry liking small dark spaces, due to his cupboard being safe, to him having tons of trust issues, due to never really having anyone he can trust.

  If there was ever a posterchild for obscurials, Harry would be the front of the line.

I've read one or two Obscurial!Harry fics, and they're usually pretty fun. And yeah, he was probably only spared due to the fact that he didn't know enough to properly repress his magic. Or something.
