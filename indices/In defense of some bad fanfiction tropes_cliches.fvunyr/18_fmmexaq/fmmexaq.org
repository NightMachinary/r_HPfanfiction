  *Abusive Dursleys:* Canon Dursleys were already kind of abusive. They /did/ starve him, not to the point of dying, but still. Going from there to beating him from time to time doesn't seem so far-fetched.

  Now, regularly breaking his bones, literally starving him to death, /raping?!/ That is on the too much side.

First, they were most definitely criminally abusive. The kind of abusive that puts you in "you're going to become everybody's prison bitch because you abused a child" prison. Second, Molly Weasley disagrees with you. Right after Dobby shows that they did do that, months of living like that would put him in the hospital AT LEAST. That diet regiment they forced him and Dudley to do was not conducive to living either. Third, they did get physical with him, there's plenty of times when they swiped at him, manhandled him, and swung a frying pan at him (in such a casual way it seemed scarily normal).

This is my big problem with JKRowling. "Abuse builds character"... Yeah, a sprinkle. She dumped a whole sack of it in Harry's backstory, and dumped another three more during the course of the series.

I see them going that far at the start with the accidental magic. The stuff happening /during/ the books looks like they were scared of going too far when the freaks could come. I already covered starving to death above. The raping part I won't comment on.
