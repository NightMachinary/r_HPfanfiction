  *Fleur's 'Allure' and other Veela things:* Say whatever you want but things like "no such thing as part Veela", Veela Bonds, Veela mates, fire affinity makes the lore richer.

The allure is part of the lore though. I don't understand why some people dislike it. i still maintain that the veel in Harry Potter are based on the samodiva from slavic folklore:

  Men who gaze upon a Samodiva fall instantly in love (or at least in lust), and women take their own lives at the sight of such beauty.

  Same goes for Harry being immune or resistant. It makes him stand out. I do think being resistant is much better than flat out immune. It showcases his willpower.
#+end_quote

That's another point which I agree with. I don't know why some people disagree with it. Harry has an exceptionally strong will- he could withstand Voldemort's Imperius curse at 14! Considering how powerful Voldemort was I'd say Harry could be able to resist a veela as well.

  *Life Debts:* Now, I don't remember how literal Life Debts are in canon, but I do like the idea of some kind of magical binding if you selflessly save someone's life.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how they work either. Harry saved Pettigrew's life at the end of Prisoner of Azkaban and Pettigrew couldn't harm Harry in Malfoy Manor. Though it's not clear if that was because Voldemort gave him the magic hand that strangled him.

  *Marriage Contracts etc:* The wizarding world is so much stuck in the past, that these kinds of things are really not that unbelievable. I also like the theme that Harry wasn't allowed to have a good childhood, and now he wasn't allowed to be a free young man.

I can definitely see the richer families do this sort of thing as a kind of prenup.

  *Manipulative Dumbledore:* I personally don't really like this trope. But canon(intentionally or unintentionally) does have some basis for this. And it does make sense for a guy who has achieved so much in life to be a little grey. As long as you make Dumbledore a good guy in the end, I think it's fine.
#+end_quote

It's often done badly. I really want to see a Dumbledore who is not evil, but is hellbent on keeping the peace. Before WWII some British were against war with Hitler. I think they called it "appeasement". I would love to see Dumbledore as a kind of Neville Chamberlain but most fics just make him out to be cartoonishly evil.

Overall- great post. I agree with your points.
