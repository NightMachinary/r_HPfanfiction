Neville Chamberlain really gets a bad rap, though. The common perception of him is that he tried to buy peace with Germany by surrendering Czechoslovakia without a fight; essentially, giving the Nazis a Danegeld and expecting then to settle down.

Realistically, the UK was fractured, indebted, and militarily weak; they stood no chance against a rearming Germany at that point, and there was little to national will to fight. Chamberlain was well aware that appeasement wouldn't last forever. What it did was /buy the Empire time/. Time to train, time to rearm, and time to survive. Even then, it was barely enough; the blitzkrieg smashed both the French army and the BEF aside and Britain came a stone's throw away from losing their army at Dunkirk.

Chamberlain lost his career over the whole thing, but his stalling saved the UK (even though the coming war would shatter the Empire). He's something of a tragic hero, especially in light of his service during the First World War.
