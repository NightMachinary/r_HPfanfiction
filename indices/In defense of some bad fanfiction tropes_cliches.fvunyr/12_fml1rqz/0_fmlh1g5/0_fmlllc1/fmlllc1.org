The problem with this was that Germany's military was also not the war machine it was in 1939/1940 and that it needed more time to rearm and its economy was entirely dependent on mass borrowing and spending through legal loopholes and the MEFO bills program. Also, the German/Czech border was extremely rugged, mountainous and naturally defensible which was exploited by the Czechoslovakians who built up defenses and had a capable army. The Czech region of the nation also had lots of heavy industry and had a very advanced tank industry, so much so that many of the German heavy tanks were of Czech origin or design.

When the Sudetenland region was handed over due to the policy of appeasement and weak Czechoslovakian will, this allowed Nazi Germany to later take over the rest of the nation, seizing the Czech industry, tank designs and gold supplies allowing them to appease their lenders and continue borrowing. Finally, this act caused a schism between Belgium and France as the Belgian King lost faith in France and withdrew from their defense arrangement, opting for a non-aligned stance between Germany and France. This meant that instead of the Maginot Line funneling German troops in pre-prepared defenses with Belgian, French and potentially British troops manning them, the entire French strategy was ruined as now the Germans would be to invade Belgium and enter Northern France, consisting mostly of wide open plains with little natural defenses favouring the attacker.

When the Germans invaded Belgium, the French were forced to dash into Belgium to attempt to salvage what was left of the original plan, over-committing their troops and sending their reserves, causing confusion among French troops and command, further exacerbated by glaring flaws in the French High Command.

Although it is more obvious in hindsight and his motives are understandable caving to the demands of an imperialistic nation you fought within living memory, sacrificing a minor nation and expecting other nations not to distrust you doesn't necessarily make your actions justified. Although I understand the man and sympathize that he was between a rock and a hard place, I feel like being on the wrong side of history doesn't mean "he gets a bad rap".
