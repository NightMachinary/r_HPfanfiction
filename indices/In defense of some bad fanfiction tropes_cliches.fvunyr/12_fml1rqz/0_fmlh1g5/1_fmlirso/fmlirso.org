Exactly. It would be great if there was a manipulative Dumbledore fic like this. Unfortunately most manipulative Dumbledore fics make him out to be cartoonishly evil. His only motivation seems to be to control Harry, lead him to his death and steal his fortune. I'd like to see him manipulate ministry officials and wizengamot members not just schoolchildren.
