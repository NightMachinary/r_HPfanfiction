I agree. He's the new Lord Slytherin? He's just been outed as a Parselmouth to the whole Wizengamot. Lord Gryffindor? The goblins wanna have a little "talk" about the expired lease on that famous sword. Make Harry /earn/ his titles.

Another variation that I'd like to see more done with "grateful public naming the Boy Who Lived in their wills". I find that more realistic than "Lily Evans was the squib-born granddaughter of all four Hogwarts founders". But Voldemort killed all but one member of an ancient family? Sure, why not name Voldemort's killer your heir, what have you got to lose?
