The one trope that I see has a lot of potential, but is constantly turned to shit is the *Harry is the heir to a bunch of families trope.* I just don't like the way people make him the heir of *All* the founders, Merlin, Morgana, 30 families he isn't even related to, etc. In most fanfictions, as soon as he gets this knowledge, he becomes super rich, gives him half the Wizengamot, Ancient vaults full of 'magic artefacts' which we never see, gets like 20 marriage contracts, and other bullshit. I mean, COME ON! Its pretty much just an excuse for a harem fic.

Usually, this also comes with him getting some *RIDICULOUS* inheritance of magic. How does making him a descendant of Dracula's house let him get superpowers in the name of /its a vampire thing/?

This trope has some serious potential. Make Harry the heir to those families, sure, but give him /complications/. /Tension/. Make it so that he has to do certain things to be worthy of that family name. make the family magics test him and find him lacking, and have a sublot of him trying to become worthy of a family's magic. Make his powers gradual.

In a lot of Manipulative!Dumbledore fanfiction, The Potter family charter, or Sirius's will, etc. emancipates him. So he instantly gets access to everything. Make it so that he doesnt get everything right away. Let him go through multiple tests, or have certain rules limiting his power over the house. Give him the *Rights & Responsibilities* without infinite resources. Make him *work* for it.

Also, the marriage contract subtrope (can it be called that?) have the girls he's to get married to instantly fall in love with him. They meet him ONCE and they're like, yep this is the guy i want to spend the rest of my life with. They dont even care that he's married to multiple people. The authors say 'They all love each other as much as harry' all of a sudden. Thsi has GOT TO be fixed. Give the relationship tension. Make it hard for harry to woo them. Make someone resent the contract, and try to break it at any cost, and let Harry try to prevent them from doing something stupid. People usually *don't* like being forced into something without their consent.

I'm done now. Sorry for the rant. :)
