One thing that I don't get about manipulative!Dumbledore fics is that the writer usually makes Dumbledore cartoonishly sneaky and evil (like stealing Harry's inheritance and blocking his true magical abilities evil) but then when Harry finds out about this they make him hyper fixate on something totally irrelevant Dumbledore also happens to have done. Like 'I can forgive you for allowing me to be abused all these years, stripping me of my magic and stealing my fortune, but filling out my Gringotts paperwork for me? Unforgivable!' ???
