  The wizarding world is so much stuck in the past, that these kinds of things are really not that unbelievable

So the wizarding world is somehow stuck in the past... even though Magical Britain in canon had better gender and racial equality than actual Britain did in the 1990s, and showed numerous examples of magical innovation and creativeness within canon? Seems legit.

I think people have a really absurd view of marriage contracts, and use the term synonymously with arranged marriages. An more accurate marriage contract would be a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_tax][Bachelor Tax]], something that dates as far back as *Ancient Rome*. Similarly, an alternative to fanon's absurdly stupid arranged marriage contracts would be simply be the Ministry passing a new [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_on_childlessness][law that that increased taxes on childless adults]]. Another alternative would be a law similar to Nazi Germany's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensborn][Lebensborn]] which gave German mothers money for each child they had with their German husband. A magical-equvalent would be giving financial aid to married witches who gave birth to magical children, with the requirement that those childrens' father also be a wizard. If the Ministry needs to be presented as remotely antagonistic, then adding in even more money for each "pure-blood" child would help.

The reason I don't like marriage contracts might sound petty, but its really because what fanon calls "marriage contract" is just "forcing Harry or Hermione to marry someone they don't want, such as Draco". This is usually because the writer in question lacks the ability to convincingly have Harry or Hermione be in a relationship with Draco/Snape/Lucius/Bellatrix/etc without it being a forced marriage. Such an attempt would likely result in a completely OOC Harry or Hermione, and/or even more commonly, downplaying the villainy of their partner.

Contrary to the circlejerk fanon likes doing, Magical Britain was CONSISTENTLY more progressive than Britain was. The gap obviously get closer over time, but the magical world is far more progressive and modern than their real-world counterpart in the same year, and in many ways is more socially advanced than the current world.

What people don't realise that those arranged "marriage contracts" wouldn't be designed for pure-blood families to intermarry, but likely to prevent inbreeding and/or reinforce pro-muggle values. Most importantly, they wouldn't be something that Harry or Hermione would be trapped it; all it would really do is inconvinence them. For example, the aforementioned Bachelor Tax or Childlessness Tax. The idea of Harry or Hermione being forced to marry someone doesn't make any sense since even actual marriage laws from centuries ago never forced people to get married.

IIRC, even Nazi Germany (a literal dictatorship) never technically forced 'aryan' German women to have loads of children with their equally 'aryan' German husband, but just gave them massive monetary incentives to encourage them. What they ACTUALLY did was send people to concentration or death camps for marrying and procreating with those deemed genetically inferior (Jews, disabled people, non-White people, and anyone else who wasn't German). In theory, Germans were never actually forced to marry a specific person under the Nazi regime, but instead told the groups of people they couldn't marry (i.e those who they deemed genetically inferior). An extreme example would literally just be [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rappaport%27s_Law][Rappaport's Law]] exactly as it was shown in Fantastic Beasts... which was repealed in 1965. If Magical Britain had a similar law, it would be far less extreme and would have been repealed significantly earlier.

*TL;DR: Marriage contracts are dumb because they are mistakenly used synonymously with forced marriages. It reflects poor writing skill that the author can't convincingly pair-up two characters without it being forced. Actual marriage contracts would be closer to FB's Rappaport's Law; real-world examples would be Lebensborn, or a Bachelor Tax or Childlessness Tax.*
