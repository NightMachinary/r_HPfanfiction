Purebloods accept it as a way of life, so nothing going to happen there if it's pureblood and pureblood contract.

Toss in the fact that Purebloods control majority of the British Magical world?

Revolution would only happen if it was on the massive scale with no exclusions on blood purity. A couple people? Psssh, people wouldn't care. "Sucks to be them, at least it isn't me!" Now, when the majority of kids are taken, that's when people start screaming bloody murder. Those kids belong to Aurors, Healers, clerks, etc. They just say "fuck you" and don't show up to work. Then the british magical world grinds to a halt. Think Fight Club.

Now before you say that it's not possible, part of the reason that Dumbledore hid Harry at the Durselys was so that people like Malfoy couldn't grab him. Which the way Dumbledore said it, sounded highly possible.
