How is it ignoring everything?

The wizarding world is full of sheep, we have seven books cementing that fact. They will blindly believe whatever the person in power says, and if two people in power say differing things? They will believe whichever is prettier ala book5. You have to set the pasture on fire and kill off half their number before they are even willing to do anything. And even then, they go and blame the wrong person.

​

Even then, revolution? The muggleborn would have had one by now with how Wizarding Britain treated them over the years. Let's face it, it's a totalitarian government.

Going even further, look at book7. Where was the revolution? People didn't give a fuck, they would rather live in fear. All of those rebels? That was a paltry amount compared to the population. But the non rebels sure as shit celebrated the rebels win once it happened though.

​

So yes, in a normal world, mariage laws/contracts wouldn't work. The broken world of Harry Potter? You can bet your ass that it would work. Unless it's on a massive scale.
