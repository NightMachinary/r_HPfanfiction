The show is okay, but pretty heavy on exploiting women's bodies. They change the scene I was directly referring to because the female show runner felt she couldn't properly explain the "point" of the scene without it coming across as actual torture porn, given that, you know, it was.

This is a link to a screenshot of a post I made a while ago about one of the more outrageous lines from the scene in the book: [[http://imgur.com/a/2Lwzacb]]

And here's a chunk of a news article where they discuss the scene in the book and the showrunner's rationale for changing it: [[http://imgur.com/a/TXD5O4M]]

The crop in the middle was to remove an unnecessary photo and an ad for Turbotax.
