Yeah, I don't get why people are so bent out of shape about tropes when they're terribly executed. Like, a huge chunk of the beauty of fan fiction is that it's free.

There have been countless fics where I was drawn in by the premise, but the clumsy execution or unexpectedly painful/squicky plot twists have made me click off it, even if I've read 46 chapters of a of a 54 chapter, 250k+ word story. I felt nothing afterwards except bummed that I wouldn't get to see the characters I was rooting for (maybe, with the way the author was going) get back together after chapters and chapters of angsting.

In comparison, I bought a new copy of /Altered Carbon/ ($15) when the show came out and less than a third of the way through the book decided to get rid of it, because the author suddenly revealed his terrifyingly mysoginistic views in an unexpected and brutal rape scene. I was mad afterwards because 1) I'd spent money on something I wasn't going to finish and couldn't return; 2) I'd given the asshole author my money; and 3) some idiot at Netflix read the book with all of its issues and decided to bankroll a person who thought women are inherently dirty and weak during their periods and have no pain tolerance because of it. (Whoops didn't mean for that to turn into a rant)

This is why I read fanfiction, because it's free and if someone pulls that sort of crap, I can close the tab and forget about it.
