Ah, no. 'Masterclass' is a relatively well known series where famous (technically 'successful', but those two often go hand in hand) people give talks and tutorials and classes on their subject. There's some for poker, for writing, for interior design, for cooking, for sports, etc. They're expensive as heck, though - 180$ for a yearly subscription and 90$ for an individual class.
