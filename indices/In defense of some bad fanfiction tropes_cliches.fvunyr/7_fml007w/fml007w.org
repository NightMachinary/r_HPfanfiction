I mean, it's part of the definition. A cliche is just a trope that's been done a lot that people don't really like/get interested by any more. What's boring and cliche to the millennial-and-over audience of the original Harry Potter books who've been in the Fanfiction scene for years will be completely new to the people who're just getting into the fandom now with the new movies (or to use the cliche - what's old is new to those who haven't experienced it yet). It's all intrinsically relative, so we're all going to see it differently. Just like bashing - if you see Ron as a selfish cunt, then fics portraying him that way aren't bashing, whereas if you see him as a loyal friend, then fics portraying him as a cunt are bashing. If you've seen a million bad Soul Bond fics, you're going to see it as cliche, whereas if you've only seen one, you probably won't.

Personally, I'm basically with Geairt on this one. There's no such thing as a bad trope (or even a bad cliche - Jack from Stargate SG-1 was great at making those fun and interesting), only badly done ones. A good writer/storyteller can make anything interesting or fun. But you've gotta write bad stuff and fuck up before you can learn how to do things better or come up with ways to do things that are fresh and new.

But if you're reading this and being original is something that bothers you, then I offer you some words from the Dan Brown Masterclass on Writing Thrillers - "Every single idea has been done, over and over. You don't need a big idea, you need big hows. How do you build tension? How do you build character?"

Essentially, everything is derivative of something, so put a cool spin or new paint job on it. It's not what you do, it's how you do it - which is why a story about a lonely orphan going to a fucking English boarding school has captured the imaginations of so many. That's not remotely an original idea, but adding in Magic and a Bureaucratically Stagnant Wizarding World was and Rowling wrote a world that felt enchanting and magical that we wanted to go into. A little kid called Harry Potter isn't original (check out the Troll movie in '86 - Harry Potter even fought a troll), but she gave him a scar and a tragic backstory and boom - original. Hows not whats, that's what makes a good story. :)
