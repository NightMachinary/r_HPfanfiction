The manipulative Dumbledore trope came out of a very valid, thought not universally acceptd, interpretation of canon Dumbledore's character. Has it devolved well past the point of validity in many stories? Yes! But the trope itself is not inherently anti-canon.

Hell, some of the "manipulative" moments fics talk about are also ways to explain stupidity in early canon - like having an obstacle course so difficult 3 first years could figure it out.
