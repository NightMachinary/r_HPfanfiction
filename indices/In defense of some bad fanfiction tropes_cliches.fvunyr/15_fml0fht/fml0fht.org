Life debts are usually shitty because they're such a destructive concept. Like, I read a fic once which had life debts be able to turn someone into a squib. That's incredibly fucking stupid, based on how random they can be and how vague. Also, it is never explained how this is enforced? Because the concept seems uniquely human to me. I've always had it just be a honor thing in my fics, no magic attached. So if you have a life debt with someone and that person begs for your aid, the honorable thing to do is help them. Not helping is possible and can't be "punished", but you'll find yourself ostracized and shunned until you can repay the debt. The actual magic of the bond, if it has one, would be incredibly subtle.

Marriage Contracts I hate with a passion, except as an evil to be fought against. A story about two star-crossed lovers being married of to someone they don't want, then breaking free and tearing down the foundations of oppression together? Give me that. A story about two random people bound into a "love, or die" contract just accepting it and "coming to love" oneanother? nono, that's a big yikes. Also don't like the enforcing features fanon often attributes to these. Some are more yikes than others (It'll just /make/ you love them!) but they're all pretty non-canon when considering Andromeda just left her family and literally nothing happened.

Manipulative Dumbledore just bores me at this point. It reeks of angst when a story has him be like that, and he inevitably becomes an idiot to serve the plot. I prefer him being a non-important entity in the story to that. However, I much much prefer him being a supporting character instead of an antagonist. The story already has an antagonist, and if that one isn't savvy or sane enough, you can just make up one. It's your own story after all. I really don't understand why people feel the need to warp established characters out of shape instead of just inventing their own ones.

If you want a "greater good" type of political guy, you can for example create a character like this: "Ingrid Wei√ümann is a german witch who fought for Grindelwald. She believed and still believes in his ideology, that wizards must rule over muggles, because they are too destructive for their own good. In this pursuit, she has become an ambassador in the british minstry and is currently cultivating influence from the inside." There, you've got a political antagonist whose ideology is the greater good, without betraying Dumbledore's entire character.
