The tropes/cliches aren't the problem...the problem is the horrible/repetitive/simplistic stories that everyone has to wade through in order to find the unique and interesting interpretations. I'm with you especially regarding Fleur's veela powers/allure. Why would you want to strip the character of something that makes her unique and interesting?

The "Ice Queen" Daphne trope is the biggest example I can think of that has been mangled over the years. The characterization of a quiet and distant Slytherin is actually justified by canon. The fact that Harry never mentions her in the books means that she does stay quiet, she isn't obnoxious and could be sypmathetic to his views. The problem comes when most writers skip to the end (her being a cold and calculating Slytherin pureblood) and maker her a caricature. The story is about everyone telling us she is "The Ice Queen" instead of showing us why she is the way she is and making her human.

Stories based on Slytherin house are the most egregious example of lazy trope writing in my opinion. It seems like every character, whether good or evil, is manipulating/calculating/scheming/overly ambitious which goes against everything we know about the other houses. Hermione and Lavender are both Gryffindors but their personalities are nothing alike. Luna and Cho are Ravenclaws but are nothing alike.

Most of my favorite stories involve many of the most popular tropes. The difference is they typically look past the surface level implications of the trope involved and create a unique, human and realistic person based on it.
