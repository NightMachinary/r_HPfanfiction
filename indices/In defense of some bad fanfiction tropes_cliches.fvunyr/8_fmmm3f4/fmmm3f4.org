I haven't found a well done manipulative Dumbledore but I can definitely see how you could write one.

Just in the first book -

Harry is 100% in the category of children more at risk for being groomed. He doesn't have parents or strong / healthy ties to adults in his community. His home life isn't great, and his guardians are at best inattentive to him. To add to that he doesn't have any of the community safety nets like cps

Dumbledore does a few things that could be kind of sketchy and are definitely seen in cases where a child is being groomed. 1. He singles Harry out with a familiarity he doesn't have with other students ex. Harry is continually called by his first name where as Hermione is ms. Granger through the books and Ron “mr. Weasley “. Especially that the Weasley children are continually called by the last names is weird. If Harry was Harry because of Dumbledores relationship with the potters the same should go for the Weasley kids. If Harry was Harry because he was a troublemaker the same should go for the Weasley twins, or even Ron and Hermione . 2. He gives Harry attention we don't see other students getting ( random “sage” advice during the mirror encounter etc) 3 right off the bat he gives Harry an expensive “secret” gift (the cloak) 4. Harry is shown preferential treatment that can be argued is at the very least condoned by Dumbledore (being the only first year in Dumbledores entire tenure allowed on the sports teams , points enough to win over Slytherin last minute etc)

Sure most or all can be explained away in different ways to do with the plot but there is still the fact that those things are there and could be used subtly paint a picture of manipulation
