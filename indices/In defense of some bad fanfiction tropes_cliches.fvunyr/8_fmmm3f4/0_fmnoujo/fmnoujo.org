I do agree with what you are saying, but i would just like to point out that Dumbledore didn't buy Harry the cloak. The cloak belonged to James, but Dumbledore borrowed it before the attack at Godric's Hallow. Though it does seem suspicious the Dumbledore doesn't return until Christmas, months after Harry's return to the wizarding world and later then he should maybe have had it returned.
