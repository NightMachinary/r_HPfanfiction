I'm okay with any evil/manipulative dumbledore tropes because the original literally doesn't make sense as a character. (He was never really meant to function as a character but rather a plot device, but that's another story.)

There are only three ways to fill in dumbledore's plot-holes, make him a manipulator, evil, or make him grossly incompetent.

And amateur authors have a pressing need to fill in plotholes. Plotholes that exist for the sake of plot, age rating, general storytelling, or rule-of-cool, are simply no-can-dos. It takes a long time to learn the need for them.

So it's expected. There's really no other way to write old dumbles. Fanfiction is all about correcting the world to your own view after all. And plot holes are the first place to start.

The best way I've seen his plot holes filled is basically make him afraid of his own power with a hint of "I'm an elder who knows best". So his inaction, manipulation, and incompetence in alot of places are no longer plot holes
