In defense of some fanfic tropes:

Most of them are there to contribute to the self-indulgent wish fullfilment aspect of many fics. They are generally written and read by people who want to get lost in a fictional world they love without having the characters they are so invested in go through so many hardships. Lordships, super wands, life-debts, friendly goblins, trunks with a million compartments, they are mainly used to help situations that the characters wouldn't be able to solve quickly. It's relaxing to just sit back and read Harry speedrun the second war. It's not deep or meaningful, and it's not supposed to be. Powerful!Harry fics are where I go when I'm too stressed from real life and just want to see a character I like curbstomp people who are mean to him lmao
