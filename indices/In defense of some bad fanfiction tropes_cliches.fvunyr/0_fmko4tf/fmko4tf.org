One thing I don't like about fanon 'life debts' is the way characters announce that they owe someone a life debt in an overly formal and pretentious way. In canon life debts aren't necessarily acknowledged or even called 'life debts', but are still real in some mysterious magical way.

#+begin_quote
  "Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt... When one wizard saves another wizard's life, it creates a certain bond between them... and I'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter... This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry."

Much better than 'I, Peter of House Pettigrew, acknowledge my life debt to Harry of House Potter etc etc' or whatever.
