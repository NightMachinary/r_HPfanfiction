Your first paragraph sums up Pettigrew's character, for me. He's still a Gryffindor, still values chivalry and bravery and "good deeds". And that tiny little part of him must hate everything that he has done and become.

But likewise, that tiny little part of him probably sees his death, and the repayment of that "life debt" as a redemption.
