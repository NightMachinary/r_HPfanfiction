I think part of it comes down to why Pettigrew was sorted into Gryffindor. Deep down Peter /still/ wants to be like Sirius and James, still wants to embody bravery and loyalty. He believes that he owes something to Harry because of what happened in POA (and, I guess, Godric's Hollow) which is enough to cause the hesitancy (and Voldemort's silver hand does the rest).

Reading your quote there, maybe there's something a bit... I guess Narnian (reciting the deep magics) about it, but I've always seen it as more a "of course it's in your head, but why should that mean it's not real" type thing.

Actually, is it just me or is Dumbledore actually quite similar to Aslan?
