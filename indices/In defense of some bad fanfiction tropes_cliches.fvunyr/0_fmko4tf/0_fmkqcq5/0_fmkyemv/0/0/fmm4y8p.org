I've always thought the second. I think it's better that Pettigrew dies because he's a death eater who got the sweet magic hand he's so proud of from someone who can't trust his own shadow who wasn't worth betraying the friend who did trust him to save his life after all. He would have survived the life debt but for his /entire character/.

The magic from a few books ago finally got around to it just feels a bit unsatisfying in comparison.
