I've always wondered something:

- Did the life debt force the silver hand to kill Pettigrew?

- Or did the silver hand, a magical gift from Voldemort, detect betrayal in Pettigrew (or somehow "listened" to Harry's words and realized that Pettigrew was compromised by a life debt) and acted like a killswitch?
