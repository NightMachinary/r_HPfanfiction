Goblin Curse Breakers.

We know Gringotts employ Bill Weasley to go tomb raiding in Egypt (whose pyramids focused on life after death). It makes sense that they might have a team of curse breakers who know what horcruxes are and can cleanse Harry's scar. But when it's overdone it turns into goblin healers curing Harry of a decade's malnutrition by snapping their fingers and releasing his bound magic by tapping his forehead.

Bound Magical Core.

There's a lot of dramatic potential in this trope. Learning family secrets, being betrayed by authority figures, having magic be out of control and having to learn how to use it all over again. (Malfoy is bullying him, but his magic's only settings are Off and Murder. Shit, think fast.) But it's usually just a cheat code unlocking god mode with bonus bashing.
