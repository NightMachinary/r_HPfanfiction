I read it, and no, I don't think there is any HP/sci-fi fic with such good worldbuilding.

If you mean like it, as in Harry in space...

- linkffn(Browncoat, Green eyes)

HP/Firefly, pretty good

- linkffn(The Star Alliance)

also by RahXephon

Darth Marrs has a bunch of HP/Star Wars and HP/Star Trek crossovers. Most are entertaining, some are mediocre. My favorite is linkffn(7718942).

If you like Stargate SG-1 there's a good amount of crossovers with HP. Most suck, some are enjoyable. Almost all suffer from the SG-1 curse - a huge amount of lore leads into a lack of direction in the plot. One of the best in the bunch: linkffn(1995083)
