This is /way/ late, but I stumbled across this and wanted to make a comment in case anyone does the same.

That is an interesting article - but as someone who read through the Harry Potter books in French to start off, and as a child (reading 1-4 at age 8-9 at the time when they were the only books out), I kinda have to disagree with the way the paper's author makes authoritative statements.

For example, I still had a strong sense of bullying/racism/elitism in the French version - Malfoy was still an elitist, noble-focused guy. I still disliked him, and understood why Harry/Hermione/Ron did as well.

Another one is that, frankly, the English boarding school system /is/ strange to the French. Incorporating it into the magical world was a very smart decision by the translator IMO - having a footnote at the bottom explaining the british school system would have been fairly dry, and there are a lot of details that might come up from it that a british audience would instinctively understand - eg, how much of leeway they have. I find that having it part of the wizarding culture fit in well for me.

Other aspects, such as formality, didn't really stick out at all when reading them. It's not something I could truly explain - but it still felt like it was kids like me talking and interacting, and not necessarily from the 'standpoint of an adult'. Perhaps it's because most of the books I was reading were written formally anyways? I don't know for sure, just that 'vous' vs 'tu' wasn't a /huge/ deal. I definitely got the impression that Harry & co were great friends with Hagrid, for example, and not the typical student-teacher formal relationship.

There is an interesting point made there about the 'otherness' of the world - and I can see how fitting it in a fairy tale/emphasizing the 'other' in the magical culture might impact the reception of it. Some specific aspects don't exactly follow - eg, the brand names don't really matter, my family is much more likely to just say 'chocolate bar' than 'mars bar' or the specific brand of it for sweets. France also doesn't have a good equivalent for the multi-flavored beans to copy - there's simply no way to make it /not/ seem exotic and strange, and part of the appeal of Harry IMO is too render him relate-able to the reader. I do know that I had a strong sense of the magical world being something magical and fascinatingly strange - and perhaps losing a /bit/ of the way it fit into the world. But at the same time it would have been impossible to keep that same sense without either extensive footnotes explaining what was a part of British culture and /not/ the wizarding world, or extensively changing the setting to have it be in France, with French cultural assumptions.

Sorry for the necro of this :P
