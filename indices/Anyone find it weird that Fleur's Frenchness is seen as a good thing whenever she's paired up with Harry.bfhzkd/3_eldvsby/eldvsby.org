As I'm neither British or French I can't say it from a citizen's POV.

But historically the French-British animosity was largely reversed around the time of the Crimean war. and their bonds was strengthened throughout WW1&2. How else would there be an actual discussion about a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-British_Union][political union between the two countries?]]

Further it seems to me, as if the two countries attitude towards one another has been on the level of the Scandinavians. Lots of shit talking. Little actual animosity.

*But to answer the actual question:* As Achille-Talon said, the french are seen as a country/culture of romance, charm, beauty and finesse.
