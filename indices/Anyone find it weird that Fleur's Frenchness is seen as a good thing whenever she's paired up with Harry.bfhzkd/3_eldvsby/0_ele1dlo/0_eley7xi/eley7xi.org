Yeah it's largely political. But to me what you've said is not that different from Scandinavia. Both Norwegians and Danes find Swedens non-involvement in the war to be a bit of a disgrace. And there are Danes that want Scania back, Scanians that want to return to Denmark. Norwegians that want Bohuslen, Jamtland, and Herjedalen back. And at least some Jemtlanders and Herjedalingers that want back to Norway.

And there are Norwegians that complain about the loss of Iceland, Greenland and the Faeroe Islands to Denmark. Contradictory to common belief that loss was dictated by Denmark in their loss of Norway in the Kiel Treaty. Where Denmark noted it'd transfer the Kingdom of Norway, but not its dependencies. Instead of by simply the Kingdom of Denmark taking them over earlier.

So some resentment isn't unheard of, but by and large most people wouldn't care about it. Or at least most people that don't have the "lived trough it" resentment wouldn't. Though of course, with the exception of the WW2 resentment in Scandinavia it's centuries old. But so it is for the Brits and French.
