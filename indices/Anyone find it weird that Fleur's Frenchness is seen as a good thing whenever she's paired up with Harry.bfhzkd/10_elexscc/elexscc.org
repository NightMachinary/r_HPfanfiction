So here's my two pence on the subject.

Most British people hold some distain (even just jokingly) towards the French and the French seem to have it back. Throw in some political issues and the refusal to speak English by a lot of French people (and refusal to speak French by a lot of Brits ) and you get the real feelings between the two. That is until they sit down at a pub and have a pint.

Now I have the actual relationship between the two down let's go to why I think fanfics tend to not go with the reality.

Most fanfic authors are American, so unlike the Europeans, they aren't aware of this relationship. The closest thing they've probably seen to this is [[/r/HistoryMemes][r/HistoryMemes]]. I think this is probably the most likely but I think there's also another reason. JK herself. She both writes and shows them in her movies as basically sex ideals in GOF. All the British guys are drilling over them, Ron even mindlessly threw himself at Fluer. I do realize it's because she's a veela but it doesn't help the stereotype JK was building upon. The only time anyone French (other than Gabrielle who is only a child and Madam M who's a half giant) is Fluer in the last movie when the trio show up at Bill's.

So to conclude I think it's two reasons, one, they don't know, and two, it's JK's fault.
