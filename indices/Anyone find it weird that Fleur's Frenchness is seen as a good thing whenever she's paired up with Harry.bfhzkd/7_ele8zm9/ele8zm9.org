Because James obviously understand how lucky his son his to bring some amazing french blood in their rosbeef family.

More seriously, it depends of the people but a lot of French do joke about the British (to be fair, the French joke about the Belgium, the German, the Italian, the Swiss and the Spanish, the French is fair and mock everyone), I don't know if the feeling of playful joking is shared in UK but there is not "true" enmity with the British anymore (and last history placed them behind the German in who should be the enemy).

From what I understand, abroad the French can either be seen as dirty surrendering monkey or by desirable people with a sexy accent, I guess the opinion of people depends of what the author wants to say in his fic.
