Well a lot could be said about it. France is the country that historically has been the most present in major conflict in Europe (and so in the World) and won the most battles. Surrendering to the Nazis was a political decision because the leader (Marechal PÃ©tain) hated the Jews but a lot of French formed a Resistance not to mentions all the one that went to UK or Africa to fight under De Gaulle.

The reason about all the "surrendering coward" was because the US tried to humiliate France on the Internet after we refused to follow their coalition in Irak (you know the "I have a test tube, it's the proof they use illegal chemical weapons).

Almost 20 years later some people still repeat these arguments, (but considering the history knowledge of some Americans I saw, I guess they don't really know what happened in the wars).
