I'd love a site that had ratings based on reader's actual ratings of the story's quality, instead of just sorting by favorites on fanfiction.net, which is influenced by how popular the author is and becomes something of a popularity contest.

If you haven't yet, you should check out Archive of Our Own, which is much better in some ways than fanfiction.net. They have a tagging system that might help as inspiration.

Also, I think this sounds like a great idea! I don't really see the HP fandom dying anytime soon. The readers might change, but the fanfiction will still be there.

Plus, with that Fantastic Beasts movie coming out, a whole new influx of people will probably start wanting to write Newt Scamander fanfiction. :)
