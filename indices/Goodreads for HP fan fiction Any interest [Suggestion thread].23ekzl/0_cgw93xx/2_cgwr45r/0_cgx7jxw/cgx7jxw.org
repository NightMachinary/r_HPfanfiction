all of your statements can't be true at the same time. Obviously T/M het fics aren't dying, since I follow several fic lists which update every single day, weird ships that "no one can get their head around" included. I honestly want to say outside romione or harmony dramione is the biggest and most popular het otp. Can no one really wrap their head around narcissa/Lucius? I don't know, this post seems really personally upset/offended by something more than anything.
