Apparently it's complicated. Due to its non-commercial nature fanfic could be deemed fair use, especially parody/satirical fics. I don't know what the copyright status of a fair use derivative work is.

Also, some sites like FFN make it against their terms of use for third parties to copy content and have taken steps to prevent it.
