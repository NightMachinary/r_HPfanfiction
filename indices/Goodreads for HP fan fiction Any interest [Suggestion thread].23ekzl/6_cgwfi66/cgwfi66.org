#+end_quote

- 10-point rating system,
- a parser function for various websites to import story metadata,
- [[http://imgur.com/yLZNng0][Goodreads-like metadata]] with (preferably) additional subcategories for both HP-specific themes and TVTropes,

  - ability to search by these data.

- Goodreads-like bookshelves,
- ability to add an archived backup of the story, so it can be either downloaded directly from the website, or automatically uploaded to a 3rd party hosting (g.Docs, Dropbox, etc account, but in possession of the server and not the user).
- multiple-criteria search and sorting system---for instance so that sorting by both rating and word count, short stories that have very good ratings will not be displayed on the first page.
