The community will probably spike a little again with those /Beasts.../ movies coming out. And honestly... Rowling is doing the screenplays for those, and just released those "articles" by Ginny on Pottermore. I will be surprised as hell if Rowling doesn't do at least one more book after she clears her desk of current work a little.
