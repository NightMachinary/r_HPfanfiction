Yes to the 5-star reviews, yes to comments, yes to recommendations, and yes to Scryer-esque search system. Solid suggestions and thank you for the offer for help.

Maybe to DLP... I'll look into how easy/helpful it would be to scrape their data.

As per the issue of sustainability, you're right about the timing... it's certainly not ideal. Not many active readers compared to the golden days, and even fewer active writers.

What's going to make or break this site is the number of people who rate/review each fan fiction entry. I don't think there's enough of a community to support every entry on fanfiction.net, livejournal, etc... but we could probably get by on focusing our attention on 150 - 350 of the most well-known fan fics. If each of the entries in the catalog got at least 3 written reviews and 50 star reviews, I would consider the site a success.
