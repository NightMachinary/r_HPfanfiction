I don't know, it's been a few tough years. I'm working on a novel now and that's kinda taking all my energy away from fanfiction. I have an outline for the story to the very end, and it was supposed to be some 120k words.... Actually, after seeing this I went back and read some of the reviews and wow, people actually quite liked it. Maybe I'll reread it an manage to get back into it... thank you either way!
