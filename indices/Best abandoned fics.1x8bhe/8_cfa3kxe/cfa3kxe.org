Agreed with Trunacation about HP&TBWL, it's definitely on top in terms of fics I wish had been completed.

After that for me comes:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock][Culture Shock]], which was an amazing Harry Potter/Culture series crossover that Rustbyte abandoned (as he often did).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3741153/1/A-Fractured-Year][A Fractured Fate]], which was the third book in the "Antares saga", a full rewrite of the HP world, with the idea being that Bellatrix was cast out by the dark lord after it was found she couldn't have magical children. She survived a situation that was meant to kill her, and eventually named names for the ministry, got a pardon, and adopted a magical boy from an orphanage who turned out to be Harry. It sounds weird, but it was really well written, definitely one of the best rewrites out there. Too bad the author quit writing them.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379857/1/Criminal-Limit][Criminal Limit]], sequel to "Renegade Cause", the best Harry/Tonks fic out there (and one of the best HP fanfics around period).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6325846/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Heartlands-of-Time][Harry Potter And The Heartlands Of Time]], another sequel to one of the most epic fics in HP fanfiction. Joe is probably one of the best known FF writers out there, when he moved into publishing his own original fiction, I guess he gave up fanfiction. Such a shame.

God knows there's more, that's just off the top of my head. I'm sure if I was to look through my old bookmarks from 2007~ish, I'd find pages upon pages of them.
