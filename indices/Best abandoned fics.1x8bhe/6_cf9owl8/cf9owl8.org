This was the fic that helped convince me R/Hr could actually work out.

Sadly incomplete, but first 2 major plot arcs are done and well written. Canon pairings for H/G R/Hr. Romance is a plot element but not the only one, mostly deals with Harry struggling with how to go on post-war. Title is a reference to a Kipling poem about soldiers returning to civilian life after WWI. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127805][Shut and be a bud again]]
