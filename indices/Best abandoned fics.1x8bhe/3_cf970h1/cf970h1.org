I remember reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4563439/1/Ectomancer][Ectomancer]] by RustyRed a while ago and really enjoying it.

But my favorite abandoned fic has to be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3787073/1/More-Equal-Than-You-Know][More Equal Than You Know]] by The Obsidian Warlock. Cool interpretation of the magic system, awesome battles, and probably the best Dumbledore characterization I've ever seen.
