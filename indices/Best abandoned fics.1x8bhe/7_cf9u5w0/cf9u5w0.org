Ah man, there was one called "My Darling Caroline" [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5753663/1/My-Darling-Caroline]], it was a sequel to one of my fav fanfics, and it hasn't been updated in almost three years. It wasn't even that amazing but I'm still bummed out about it, to the point I wont read non-complete fics now!
