A few come to mind and I'd be hard pressed to choose among them:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived]] by The Santi. Law school ate the author.

For sheer epicness, perhaps Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] series, abandoned two chapters into the last book. She used to update every week or so, then nothing.

Nearly all the collected works of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/936968/nuhuh][Nuhuh]], though his Retsu's Folly in particular.

Similarly, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/386600/Deadwoodpecker][Deadwoodpecker]]'s works, particularly book three of her Backward With Purpose series and Yellow Submarine.
