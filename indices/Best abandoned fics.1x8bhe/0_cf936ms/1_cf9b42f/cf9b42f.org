Not dead yet. At least these author don't go full cocktease (There is Of Love And Bunnies over at the Power Rangers fandom. Great fic, but the 3 authors stopped updating. 2 years later, the main author output out another 2 chapters, then die again. Sub-author 1 disappeared from the net, Sub-author 2 wrote 1 chapter in her companion fic a year later, then disappear again. From the same author, The Prank War (HP fandom) isn't finished either. It stopped updating around when she dropped FF.net the first time.). DWP updated the first book with her FB detail though (Ella Sparky I think), anyone want to message her? If she isn't going to finish it, she could at least leave the plan of what she was going to do.
