Fair enough. I forgot JKR is constantly changing her background details since the seventh book was published. I should've gone back and made sure Sirius was still an Auror like she had said years ago (in his background, NOT the series, obviously).

All I'm saying is that, as for the night James and Lily died, I hold Sirius and Peter equally responsible. If not for the decisions both made, James and Lily would still be alive and in hiding. (Assuming they hadn't found a way to defeat Voldemort, which I doubt they would have.)
