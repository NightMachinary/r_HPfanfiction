True, Peter's a traitor. And if Sirius had done his civic duty as an Auror by becoming James's Secret Keeper (because Lord knows he was chosen for everything else), that night shouldn't have happened according to Sirius himself.

If he would've died than betrayed his friends, and he was positive it would've been the scenario that went down, then he should've been sure he'd stand up to the torture. If he wasn't sure it's because he knows deep down that he's a coward. That's all.
