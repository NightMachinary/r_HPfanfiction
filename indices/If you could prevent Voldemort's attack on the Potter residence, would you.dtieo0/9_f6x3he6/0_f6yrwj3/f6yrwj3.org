What Sirius did was his civic duty. He knew that there was a dangerous terrorist out there, so he went out to catch him. Not informing the authorities was a mistake, but hunting Pettigrew was not. Pettigrew was clearly a danger to others, so killing him would be self defence and prevention of a clear and present danger. You can't blame Sirius for getting illegally incarcerated for a decade, because worst case the truth SHOULD have come out at his trial.
