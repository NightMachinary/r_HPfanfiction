This is the classic “train with diverting tracks” argument about sacrificing the few to save the many. It's been implied and outright stated in the Harry Potter universe that a magical foil to Voldemort had to be created. He could've gone after Neville and his family, but was never going to (sans the fact that they were Order members with a baby born on July 31). He was always going to go after the blood foil to himself. That's the part of that night he should have seen the most: he himself created the only means to defeat his plans for a new Wizarding World.

I personally wouldn't stop it, because of this fact. But I still hold Sirius as responsible for what happened that night as Peter was, because what Sirius did was borderline cowardly.
