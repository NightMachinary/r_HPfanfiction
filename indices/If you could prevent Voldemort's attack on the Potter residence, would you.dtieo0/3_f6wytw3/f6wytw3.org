Yes, of course:

- I would ask them (or Sirius, or Dumbledore) to set a massive trap consisting of combined Muggle and Magical explosives, preferably adding some Basilisk venom in the mix.
- I might cause some collateral damages in the neighborhood, but I consider them acceptable in light of neutralizing a systemic threat like Voldemort for several years. Our own military was actually willing to risk far more civilians to take out far less important targets.
- Once the trap works and Voldemort's wraith is left howling for Albania, it's time to get that Wormtail hiding outside the Potter cottage, if he's not already killed by the trap itself.
- Next, prepare another ambush at Longbottoms. Present the heads of the Lestranges to the Wizengamot and Goblins should net their vault and the Cup. Present the head of Barty Jr will get Barty Sr removed from his post.
- After that, encourage the Order to launch full scale counterattack against Death Eaters. Divide Death Eaters among themselves, offer those opportunistic ones like the Malfoys to betray the hardliners. No locking up at Azkaban either, anyone with even one murder conviction gets pushed over the Veil.
- Pass legislations to seize Death Eater assets to compensate their victims. I mean this is some of the most basic form of justice, and it should absolutely be done!

I personally will never ever let Harry carry a part of Voldemort's soul!

I also know where each of Voldemort's Horcruxes is hidden. Once he is reduced to a wraith, he's already fucked up beyond any recognition. Once we got Barty Jr and the Lestranges, it would take less than 24 hours to send his soul to rot in hell forever!
