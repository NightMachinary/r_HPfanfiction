In fact, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), almost follows my battle plan to the letter.

--------------

There's absolutely no fucking need to repeat the canon timeline. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

Any time traveler who wants a repeat of that total cluster fuck is one big fucking coldblooded negligent shit head:

- There is absolutely no need to let the Potters die.
- There is absolutely no need to let the Longbottoms suffer.
- There is absolutely no need to let Harry have a piece from that sadistic genocidal maniac. It will be far easier to send that piece of shit to hell without worrying about Harry's status.
