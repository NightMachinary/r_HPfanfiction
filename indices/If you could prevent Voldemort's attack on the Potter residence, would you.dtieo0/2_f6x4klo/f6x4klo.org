I don't think I'd be able to keep that infomation to myself. If I did, I'd have to live with a lot of guilt. I mean, I know a child is going to lose his parents but I keep quiet erm for the greater good. But I'm rather curious how it would work if an OC really wanted to do more than that, like if they were planning on saving the Longbottoms and giving other death eaters what they deserve. And also how Harry would react upon learning that there's a person who knew what was going to happen and let it happen. But that's for those who would let the events unfold the way they did.
