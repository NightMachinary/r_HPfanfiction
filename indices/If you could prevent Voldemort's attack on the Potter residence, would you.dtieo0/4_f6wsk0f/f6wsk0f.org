Yes, because Voldemort should be pretty easy to defeat if you use the Battle of Hogwarts to judge his leadership abilities. A 12 year old Star Craft player has a better grasp of strategy than Voldemort, who ordered repeated frontal assaults on a fortified hilltop position across hundreds of yards of open ground. Same goes for Dumbledore if you look at his track record. The Order had capable fighters, just look at the end result of the DoM battle. One down and a few injured in return for almost a dozen Death Eaters. You'd only have to make sure that the Death Eaters can't return to Voldemort.

Hell, you could boobytrap the Potter house and blow Voldemort up with a few tons of plastic explosives as soon as he enters. Or maybe a little less if the Fidelius does not contain explosions. After that, destroy the Horcruxes and without anything left to anchor him to this world, he'd pass as soon as he has to leave whatever animal he was possessing in Albania.
