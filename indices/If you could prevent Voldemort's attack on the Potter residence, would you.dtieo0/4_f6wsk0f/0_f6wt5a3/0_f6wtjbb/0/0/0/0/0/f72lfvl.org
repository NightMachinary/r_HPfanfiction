It's not just dying for the general public though. It's dying while being given a genuine offer to leave and you won't be killed. Not something that would generally be offered

As an aside, it's why all the Neville!BWL fics are silly unless you invent some Death Eater who is important enough, who loves either Alice or Frank enough, and someone who can convince Lord Voldemort to try and spare him/her.

Or unless you arbitrarily change the magic involved. That works too.
