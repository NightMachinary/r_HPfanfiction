AK was the "death" spell. One shot, one kill. No magical shields could protect against it; the only defense is to block it with something or get out of the way.

Voldemort getting surprised by a defense that had never occurred before is not a mark against him - Black Swan events are notoriously hard to prepare for.

And who knows - maybe all of those other ways to kill Baby Harry would have been turned back on him as well. Hard to say since that level of defense had never occurred and quite possibly will never occur again.
