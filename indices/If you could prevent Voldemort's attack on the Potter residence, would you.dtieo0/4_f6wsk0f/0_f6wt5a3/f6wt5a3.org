To play Devil's Advocate - that is Voldemort after he spend a decade as a disembodied spirit. That's got to have a negative effect on one's sanity. And most of his horcruxes had been destroyed by that point which probably made him even more unhinged. I don't think you can use his performance (or lack thereof) at the Battle of Hogwarts as a judge of his abilities/intelligence before he got defeated by an infant.
