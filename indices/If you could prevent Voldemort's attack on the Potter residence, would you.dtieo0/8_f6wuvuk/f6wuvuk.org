I'd probably make a really hard decision to let events unfold as normal until after voldemort was defeated, at which point I'd attempt to insert myself into Harry's life as some sort of parental/guardian figure and ensure that he would grow up a well-balanced individual, even if I couldn't prevent him from going to the Dursley's. I'd also attempt to intervene before Sirius got himself framed by Pettigrew, though whether he'd listen to some random muggle a couple years younger than him is another story, and I'd most definitely try to keep the Longbottoms safe and sane. All else failing, I'd get in touch with Dumbledore, reveal my knowledge of Voldemort's horcruxes (which, depending on what you believe, he doesn't even suspect exist). Best case he believes me and gets a head start on dismantling Voldemort's immortality, worst case the idea is planted in his brain and he doesn't take as long as in canon to twig on to the fact that I was right and Voldemort is in fact using horcruxes to stay alive. Those would be my main goals, but depending on my state of arrival (am I taking over the life of someone else and therefore have resources, or am I penniless? Do I even realize I'm in the Potterverse? Am I still a muggle or do I have magic? Et cetera) I'd obviously have different immediate goals, such as not freezing to death in early-winter Europe. It's horrible to sacrifice Lily and James, but after Voldemort "dies" it becomes much easier to plan and there's a much clearer path forward. I just don't know enough about what happened before his defeat to be able to effectively strategise, predict and derail other paths he might take. I'm a firm believer in the butterfly effect and I'm more comfortable operating within parameters that I'm familiar with.
