I would do nothing to prevent it nor to prevent Sirius arrest to Azkaban that while illegal ( fundamental wizards rights ? ) or very deceptive ( Dumbledore manipulation of the martial laws ) was the result of Sirius own tomfoolery. Harry would not be who he is if he was educated differently. The only thing I would have done is warn Harry to think for himself, work with ambition , use his slytherin side and to not trust Albus to many names Dumbledore. I would even recommend that he declined Hogwarts for Durmstrang.
