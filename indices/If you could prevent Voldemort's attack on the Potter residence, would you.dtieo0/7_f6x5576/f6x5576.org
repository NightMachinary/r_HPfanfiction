I would not. While I'm not sure if it's canon or fanon, my headcanon has Voldemort winning at this point in time. Peter is still around as an active mole, and as long as Lily remains alive, Severus' loyalities are not firmly on the side of Light -- if Voldemort were to truly grant her sanctuary conditional on SS' loyalities, the Order would lose its spy, becoming a triple-agent (making its intelligence situation even worse).

If Voldemort decided to stop concerning himself with the Prophecy and on taking over the Ministry, I'd imagine that the Wizarding Britain would ultimately end up in Voldemort's hands, and Hogwarts becoming the last safe zone for the other side (because of Dumbledore), and you can't last forever that way -- especially not if Peter remains undiscovered.

This stance assumes lack of ability to change anything else -- no Horcrux knowledge, no changing the way the Order behaves, etc. Otherwise, the obvious change is to let the Godric's Hollow event become a trap.
