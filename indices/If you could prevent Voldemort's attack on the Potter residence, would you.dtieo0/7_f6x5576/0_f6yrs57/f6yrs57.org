But Voldemort's leadership abilities are questionable at best. Only the incompetence of the defenders prevented a complete destruction before his forces could reach the walls of Hogwarts. For example, the mandrakes are supposedly lethal to anyone who hears them. So you ought to be able to utterly annihilate all of Voldemort's forces with even just one of them if you time it right and manage surprise. Well, either that or Sprout was wrong.
