I think Slide does a pretty great job in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/Renaissance][Renaissance]] (which, btw, also contains a great in-character Ron).

For something completely different, there's also the sweet one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13258502/1/You-Only-You][You, Only You]] by Bowtruckles, who is very good at writing in-character Romione.

I also think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12919788/1/The-Cactus-and-the-Toad][The Cactus and the Toad]] captured Hermione really well, but she's not the main character in that fic.
