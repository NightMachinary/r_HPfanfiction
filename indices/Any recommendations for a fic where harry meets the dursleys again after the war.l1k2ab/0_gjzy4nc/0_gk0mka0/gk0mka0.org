Seconded - I absolutely love this fic. I believe the author (who occasionally hangs out on this sub too) has a few more of Harry's interactions with the Dursleys, but I'm not sure how actively she's been posting them to FFN. Take a look in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344409][this collection]] on AO3.
