Throughout Vekin87's Albus Potter series I recall seeing a few interactions between the Potters and the Dursleys. They are always awkward and Albus is always shocked that Dudley has two sons, the youngest one being quite scrawny and always being bullied by his older beefier brother. They are not major or significant plot points but Dudley and his family are quite supportive of Ginny when Harry gets into some serious trouble.
