- Linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute): battle-hardened Harry goes back to June 24th 1995 to "save himself" and defeat Voldemort in the span of 12 hours. Absolute thrill-ride.
- Linkffn(0800-Rent-a-Hero): dimension-hopping Harry tries to help out the dimension's fem!Harry after 5th year and the prophecy gets blabbed about.
- Linkffn(Deepest Reflections): third book in following "The Darkness Within," basically the two Harrys initially trade places before AU Harry joins up to help out canon-Harry in 5th year. Not as much a fan because of the authors history vis-a-vis A Shattered Prophecy.
