I guess if you squint at it hard enough, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry%5C_potter%5C_and%5C_the%5C_nightmares%5C_of%5C_futures%5C_past/index][https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry\_potter\_and\_the\_nightmares\_of\_futures\_past/index]] involves an older Harry asking a younger Harry's permission to fuse souls or something. But since they become the one character, it doesn't have any interaction between the two them bar the first time.

I remember another fic where Old!Harry travels back in time just as he's dying to leave a set of timed instructions for his younger self.
