As much as I hate to say it, most fics, not just Time-Travel fics, are just like this.

Plot is supposed to have a rising action, and characters are supposed to overcome challenges to achieve their final goal. So many fics just find some useful bit of magic or an item to overcome that challenge with no effort or plot. It's horrible writing.
