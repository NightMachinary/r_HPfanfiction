  Fucking Up the Time-Line: Luna knows, so why not just roll with it and go off script?

This... This is a bad thing?

Edit: I understand that time travel is an easy gimmick, but if you're going to use it then sticking to the same script is probably the worst thing I can imagine.

Also need help understanding how having (or knowing about) the Cloak, Map, Trunk and Room of Requirement and using them intelligently became a bad thing. Only thing I've got is that they're used often, but funnily enough there's a good reason for that.

How dare canon introduce useful things and then fic writers use them too? How dare they?!

Jesus.Fucking.Christ. Stay away from Worm fanfiction having competent characters might make you sad.
