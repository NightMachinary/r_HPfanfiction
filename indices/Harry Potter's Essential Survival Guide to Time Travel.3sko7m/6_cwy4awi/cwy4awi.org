Well, there are really three types of time-travels:

1. Only the memories and powers are sent back, inhabiting a younger body (preferably first year). Limitation: no time travel before birth, cannot take equipment along

2. Time turner travel, with all its limitations such as not changing major events, no meeting your counterparts, and risks to space-time continuum.

3. Dimensional travel to a parallel universe that runs a certain amount of years behind. This is the most flexible form of 'time travel', since they can do anything they deem fit.
