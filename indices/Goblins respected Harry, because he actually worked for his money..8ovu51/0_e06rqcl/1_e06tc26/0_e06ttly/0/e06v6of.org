Trust me, i've read good stories based around just that. Also If I read a multi-million word story about necromancy i'd probably remember it. The largest story to date that i've read is Legacy(Naruto story), and I definitely remember that years after reading it. The whole sex slave thing that I saw highlighted has definitely put me off it. Thanks for trying anyway, but this seems frankly like a horrible story. Especially since it's nearing 3+million words, and yet is only on the third book, with such horrible tropes to boot, yeah...nope.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.
