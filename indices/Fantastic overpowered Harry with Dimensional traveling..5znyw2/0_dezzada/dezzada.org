+Its alright+. It has potential, but is an unedited mess right now. Very sparse on the descriptive side. There are spots in it where I only wonder /where/ something plays. There are unexplained changes of scenery. I don't know who is in a scene until they open their mouths, ecetera ecetera. James and Sirius go investigating, suddenly they're back at St.Mungos and it goes on like that. I keep shaking my head at it.

Its also /really/ fast. Theres so much thrown into the few scenes we have, I barely wrapped my head around something when I get confronted with another thing. OCs are just thrown in there as if we are supposed to know who they are. Much is hinted at, nothing explained... The more I read it, the more i'm frustrated with it.

Also, linebreaks are a thing. Not using them is just asking for your readers to be confused.
