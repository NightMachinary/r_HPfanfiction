  Already has my vote for fic of the year.

So different are tastes, I guess. I haven't even finished it - I grew that frustrated with it. It lacks some very basic things, especially at the beginning. Staging is almost completely absent.

As I said, it has potential. But like this, it is not suspense or a constant question of what character will do that requires my patience. I need my patience for the absence of simple formatting and the very basics of "How to tell a story". If I don't know Where, When and Who then there is no scene. And this fic does this /a lot/.

Also... I'm not sure why I need to read an entire report about *every single scar* Harry wears on his body.
