Lots of crossovers suffer from these problems, sadly.

Another thing that often happens is that one franchise's gimmick is totally nerfed, removed, or explained using the other one. I see it all the time in Stargate crossovers, or that one time I looked up star trek crossovers.

A crossover in my mind should serve to collide both worlds and mishmash them into one muddled one, not thrust a single element into a new reference frame.

So for example, don't allow the Starfleet engineer to explain away magic as "phased curzeran energy", but don't make magic the end all be all to beat every UFP tech solution.
