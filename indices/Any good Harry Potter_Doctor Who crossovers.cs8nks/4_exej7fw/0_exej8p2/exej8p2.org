#+begin_quote
  In third year, Harry Potter has a near fatal accident with a time turner while trying to save his godfather. Now Harry's not quite human and is beginning to have memories that aren't his own. The Doctor is now searching for the young Time Lord that he mentally sensed with a far-fetched hope that he is not alone. TimeLord!Harry
