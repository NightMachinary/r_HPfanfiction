Well, I was only aware of the mostly fanon speculations that Dumbledore had set Harry up to be a martyr. I suppose I was asking for a truly good character who cares about those he has the misfortune of meeting, and not the vague notions of the greater good he grew up on. I suppose it's the mindset of the community? I mean, shouldn't it be strange to see cliches in fanfiction, specifically and only pertaining to that work of fiction? I try to think away from the pre-conceived notions of the community, though I suppose I rarely succeed in any true amounts.

Regardless, thank you for the recommendation, though I have seen it quite a few times on here for various other requests.
