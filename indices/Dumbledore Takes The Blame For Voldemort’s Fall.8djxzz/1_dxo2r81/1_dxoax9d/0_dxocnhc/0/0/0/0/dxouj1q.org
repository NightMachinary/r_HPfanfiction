  Dumbledore didn't do everything he could have
#+end_quote

It's really easy to forget the lens through which Dumbledore was working. He knew Harry was a Horcrux. The obvious solution would be to fix everything himself and then kill Harry and then kill Voldemort himself. He certainly had the power for it - we see him fight and make Voldemort run away like a scared little bitch repeatedly throughout the series.

The problem here, and perhaps Dumbledore's greatest weakness as a strategist against Voldemort, is his love for Harry. He viewed him as a grandchild, the family Dumbledore himself, so similarly to Voldemort and Harry, never had.

He lived his life by his ideals and the one I'm going to talk about, in particular, is one that he imparted onto Harry, "Do what is right, not what is easy."

Harry needed to track down and destroy the Horcruxes himself, not because only he could, but because he needed to know how insidious they were. He needed to know the toll they took on the environment around them. He needed to know, when he eventually found out that he himself was a horcrux, that he had to die. He needed to be prepared to sacrifice himself.

Not because manipulative!Dumbledore, but because Dumbledore knew that if Harry took that step on his own, sacrificed himself for the people around him, that Harry /himself would live/.

You can chalk that up to plot contriveness all you want, but the stepping stones for it were placed as far back, at least, as Goblet of Fire.

I urge you to re-read when Harry comes back from the graveyard and tells Dumbledore what happened. When Harry Potter tells Dumbledore that Voldemort used his blood in his rebirthing ritual, Harry, as our narrator, notices that Dumbledore gets a triumphant look.

But why would Dumbledore, upon hearing this news, be triumphant? Because /years and years/ of planning had come to fruition. Dumbledore /wanted/ Voldemort to be rebirthed using Harry's blood, because he knew, at that moment, that Harry would /once again/ survive the Killing Curse and be allowed to live after the Horcrux was removed.

But... Only if Voldemort /himself/ was the one to cast the killing curse.

Notice how Dumbledore worded his instructions to Snape on how to inform Harry of his being a horcrux. Only when Voldemort started keeping Nagini close to him (when Harry had destroyed the rest, or nearly the rest, of the horcruxes) and he INSISTED, SPECIFICALLY, to Snape, that /"Voldemort himself must be the one to cast the curse"/.

From /beyond the grave/ Dumbledore planned the method in which Harry would sacrifice himself, but only so that he would live.

Dumbledore probably could have saved more lives by taking a more direct approach in the fight against Voldemort, and yes, he didn't. But as a Father, I can't really say I blame him. I'm not sure any number of lives could ever stack up against the life of my son and I feel Dumbledore must have felt much the same way.

So, yes, could he have done more? Absolutely. Could he have done more by Harry Potter? I find it hard to believe that, knowing the kind of person Harry Potter had to be to ensure he got to live a life beyond Voldemort.
