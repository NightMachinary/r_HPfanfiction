Well, yes, you /could/ view Dumbledore as incompetent or manipulative. The reason that these people are in the minority, however, is because it's silly.

Dumbledore was not a perfect man, but he was clearly extremely intelligent and insightful. He orchestrated Voldemort's death a year in advance and from the grave, in a way that ensured Harry Potter, someone he felt extreme compassion and respect for, would survive the encounter.

Were there ways for the plan to go awry? Could it have failed? Sure, absolutely. But he did his best, and it worked.

Is Dumbledore manipulative? When he has to be. And never beyond that.
