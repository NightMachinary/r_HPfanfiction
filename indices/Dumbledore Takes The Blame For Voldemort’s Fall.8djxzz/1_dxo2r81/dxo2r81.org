It's become a persistent fanon idea that Dumbledore anointed Harry as the Boy Who Lived like something out of the Lion King. The fact is, Hagrid talks about a crowd surrounding the burning house - it's clearly a spectacle. It's also important to keep in mind that the Death Eaters realize their master died after going to the Potter house, and Harry is the only one left alive. In the opening scenes of SS, McGonagall asks Dumbledore to confirm the rumors, so the notion of Harry's survival, and the fact that they're calling him the Boy Who Lived spread on its own.

What's the point of this? Any fic where Dumbledore "takes the fall" would probably be contrived, and not very good, unless done very well.

This was a request, so I'll leave you with linkffn(What You Leave Behind). Things go to shit after Voldemort dies. The MoM isn't ecstatic about the Order of the Phoenix and their vigilante actions, and Albus loses a lot of clout, and is evemtually forced out of Britain.

Other than that, it has a well written talented Harry, best friend Cedric, and love interest Fleur. Oh, and bedlst Weasley twins as well. They're side characters so they don't get as much attention, but they're exactly what I expect young twins to be like.
