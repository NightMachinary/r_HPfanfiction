In my reading experience it varies from character to character

​

Ive found many writers like the idea of tall Harry who inherited the looks of both his parents. However ive read fics that have that but also have say Draco who is clearly modeled on Tom felton or Hermione looks like Emma Watson or goes through a mke over to become the Emma watson version

​

Its the same if they want to bash Ron..........he becomes like the dimwitted film version
