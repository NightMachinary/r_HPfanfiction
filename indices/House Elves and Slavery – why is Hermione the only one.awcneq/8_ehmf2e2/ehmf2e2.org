I really do find it frustrating in a fic when someone (either Super!Harry or Draco or some other pureblood) casually informs Hermione that the House Elves /need/ a bond or they will die/lose their magic/go insane and Hermione immediately gives up her belief that House Elves should be free.

Largely because this often goes hand in hand with the assumption that she did no research whatsoever after discovering the whole thing and that all it takes is one book which explains it and she'll completely change her mind.

It feels patronising.

Let's say it's true, surely there would be multiple theories on why the bond was so necessary and yet so apparently one sided (wizards aren't hurt or damaged by having House Elves and yet they can order a House Elf to iron their ears or shut their fingers in an oven). So having one book which apparently explains it all seems a little unlikely.
