A month wouldn't be enough to undertake a deep study of exactly why House Elves require a bond and how that bond works specifically.

But to discover that such a bond exists and is necessary, yeah two-three days is enough. Since it's unlikely to be a huge secret and is instead likely to be the first fact in any book mentioning House Elves.

If you knew nothing about Henry VIII and I told you he married six women, it might take you a month to deal with the nuances of each relationship and their impact on the politics of the time. But it would take you far less than that to learn that they were married one after the other not all at once, the order in which they were married and their causes of death.
