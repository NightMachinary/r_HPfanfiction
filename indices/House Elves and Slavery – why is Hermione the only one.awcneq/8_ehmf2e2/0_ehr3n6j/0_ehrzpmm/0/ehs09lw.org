First of all the libary is huge. Finding stuff would be hard. Secondly, that assumes that Hogwarts posses many books about House Elfs. Wizards don't pay much attention to them or care about their capabilities so the amount of writting on them would be minimal. Thirdly the books could very well be biased in the Wizards point of view. She could realize that and assume she is right because she perceives herself to have a moral high ground.

  If you knew nothing about Henry VIII and I told you he married six women, it might take you a month to deal with the nuances of each relationship and their impact on the politics of the time. But it would take you far less than that to learn that they were married one after the other not all at once, the order in which they were married and their causes of death.

If I used internet (full of many diffrent sources I could use which provides me an opportunity to develop my own opinion) it would take me a manner of minutes. If I went to a libary it would take a hell lot more. They might not even have books about him.
