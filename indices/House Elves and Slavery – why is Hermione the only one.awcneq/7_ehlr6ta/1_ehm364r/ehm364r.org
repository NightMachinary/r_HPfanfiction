Hermione did research the matter extensively in canon - it's stated so. In the Hogwarts Library, even. So, unless there's some huge conspiracy where people colluded to keep the true secret of the house elves from her, and no one, ever, told her, it's clear she's not wrong about elves. And, in canon, Dumbledore calls it slavery. Not a bond. Not a smybiotic relationship - slavery. Magically enforced. Further, Kreacher is forced into servitude against his will - twice. First Sirius, then Harry. Inherited like a piece of property; no bond mentioned at all.
