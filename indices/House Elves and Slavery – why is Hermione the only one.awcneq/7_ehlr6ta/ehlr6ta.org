I'm going to have to go with: There's more to the story that we never find out, and most people who find out about house elves get the whole story. We the reader don't though because our viewpoint characters into the issue are: Harry (underachieving everymen with blinders and motivation difficulties), and Hermione, who while brilliant, does tend to fall into the trap of "I'm smart and know better, everyone else is wrong."

Which means that Hermione probably WOULDN'T look further into the actual reasons/logic/history/whatever, because it's wrongness is so self-evident to her, and even is somebody told her, she'd be likely to dismiss it as wrong/biased/apologia. There's also the fact that we don't see many house elves being mistreated. Doby is the only one IIRC, and Doby is... well lets be honest, the guys kinda coocoo for cocopuffs. It very well might be that the nominal or average master/elf relationship is nothing like what we see between Malfoy/Doby. The only other one we see in any detail is Winky I think? But then, her punishment is to be given clothes and let go. To which she reacts rather badly, going into a depressive spiral. But... normal people that get used as a scape goat and fired/let go can and do do that too, so I don't think there's anything there.

I could easily see Mafoy cruelty and Doby crazyness feeding on each other, spiraling WAY out of bounds of what is normal.

Hell, all you need to do to turn Hermione from "Brilliant witch fighting for the downtrodden house elf" to "Dangerous Lunatic endangering lives" is have the master/elf bond providing something the elves need or strongly value. Maybe it's magic, maybe it's the act of cleaning, whatever. This kinda automatically takes them out of the slave category.

I dunno, there's just way too much stupidity in the house elf world building to really work with in any reasonable fashion. Lets not forget that: 1. Elves clean, wash, etc. 2. Elves are apparently immediately released if they touch an article of cloth. 3. It doesn't even need to be their masters cloths.

IIRC in cannon Hermione was hiding cloths in rooms to try and free the house elves? Or is that fanfiction? And they were actually scared of her for doing so? 1. I can't imagine Malfoy washes his own socks, he probably tosses them to the house elf to be washed and put away. 2. If Hermione really could free the house elves by hiding cloths for them to accidentally find and be released, you could start some fun shit by visiting wizard homes and handing out cloths to their elves... Or even just tossing your coat to one fully expecting it to be hung up.

At the very LEAST I would say that freeing a house elf requires 1. INTENT, and 2. BY their Master. Malfoy lacked one when he freed Doby, and Hermione wasn't the second for the Hogwarts elves. So it's all bullshit you can twist in any way you want.
