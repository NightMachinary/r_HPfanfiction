Hermione did hide clothes around Gryffindor tower. While I don't think it would actually work, according to Dobby the elf had to be presented clothes by his master, which I would assume require a teacher at least and maybe even require the headmaster as 'The Master'. Still, it pissed the Hogwarts elves off and they eventually stopped cleaning Gryffindor tower.

I agree INTENT by the MASTER is needed to free the elf in question. Imagine a wizard coming home and handing his cloak to his elf. Really? That's instant freedom? Personally I think Harry tricking Malfoy was pretty dodgy and only worked because Dobby was a weirdo and actually wanted freedom and used loophole abuse.
