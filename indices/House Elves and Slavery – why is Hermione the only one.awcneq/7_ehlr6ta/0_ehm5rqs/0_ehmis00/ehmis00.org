I think I saw one theory that Dobby was never actually free but was more of a runaway slave. I read it here [[http://www.redhen-publications.com/basilisk.html]]

  But I am no longer convinced that Dobby was ever properly free.

  Four years later he is still trying to throw himself in the fire when he speaks poorly of the Malfoys. Nor does he ever settle down to dish the dirt about their past activities. And, for that matter, how was he able to pop directly into the cellar of the manor in DHs. Don't you think the Malfoys (in common with everybody else) would have had some kind of Apparation barrier for Elves that were not theirs? I think that when Albus hired Dobby, Albus was fully aware that what he was doing was harboring and giving protection to a runaway slave.
