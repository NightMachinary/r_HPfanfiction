I think it's a combination of a) “that's how it's always been”, b) house elves being a legitimately other species who for all we know was made by wizards to be servants, and c) Hermione was pushing for freedom for everyone of a group who didn't want to be free even after seeing the effects on a freed elf, and d) What would happen to house elves after they are free? Would the owners pay them or kick them out? I think if it was something like “you can't abuse your house elf “or something like that it would be more effective outside of Hermione not being a good PR rep. After all making a huge blanket goal to free elves who don't want to be free couldn't be easy. Also I can't remember but do we see elves other than kreacher and Donny punishing themselves? If not then I could definitely see black and Malloy families and others like them forcing that in them.
