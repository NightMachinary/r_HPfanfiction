I always felt like canon really dropped the ball here, and the whole â€˜but house elves LIKE being slaves' thing makes my skin crawl--- because that line of reasoning was used as a justification for enslaving real people back in the day. Hermione's crusade might've been somewhat poorly thought-out, but the fact that wizards regularly make use of sentient beings and don't think twice about it, who work for no compensation and are magically compelled to punish themselves if they displease their masters, is easily one of the more disturbing aspects of the series. Her heart was in the right place.
