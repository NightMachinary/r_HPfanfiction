  Is there more in this than Hermione knows?
#+end_quote

I'm inclined to say yes.

Hermione "does research" for all of 2-3 days at most after they get back to Hogwarts, and then proclaims that it's slavery and starts on her group. She also attends classes and meals like normal during these days.

Not sure about you, but when I need to research a practice that spans centuries or millennia, I certainly won't be finished in 2-3 months, forget 2-3 days.

And gobbos and centaurs have different views of the world - they don't see morality or ownership, to take a couple of examples, the same way a human does - so it isn't a large leap to assume that house elves too have a different view of their enslavement compared to a human would. Centuries and/or millennia of service and bondage will eventually make a race more servile, especially when you have something like magic in the equation.

Hagrid, who most people agree is quite knowledgeable on magical creatures, says that they don't want emancipation.

It could be just another instance of Hermione being arrogant enough to think that no one in the past (like Albus, for example) has ever thought of this matter and kept quiet about it. She certainly has enough arrogant moments throughout the series to lend weight to this.
