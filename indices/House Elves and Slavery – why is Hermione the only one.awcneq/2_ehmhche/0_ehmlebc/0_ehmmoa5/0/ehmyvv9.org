  Now this is bullshit. Maybe he does in your fanfiction, but he does nothing of the sort in canon.

I suggest you read the books before you sprout fanon. Here's the direct quote by Dumbledore: "He was forced to do Sirius's bidding because Sirius was the last of the family to which he was enslaved."

Ron calls it enslavement as well. As do others. No one claims it's not slavery.

Yeah, as much as some fanboys hate it, Hermione's the one who in the right. House-elves are slaves. With all the evil that implies. Even if they want to serve, that doesn't mean they need to be slaves.
