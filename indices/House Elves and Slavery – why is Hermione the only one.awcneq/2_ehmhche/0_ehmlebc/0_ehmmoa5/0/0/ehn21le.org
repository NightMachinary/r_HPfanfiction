  I suggest you read the books before you sprout fanon

And /I/ suggest you take your own advice. Here's the actual passage. There's no mention of the word enslavement or any related words anywhere.

  "You see," Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, "if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited--"

  He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat's ears, and enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys' shag carpet and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory. Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, "What the hell is that?"

  "Kreacher," finished Dumbledore.

  "Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't, Kreacher won't!" croaked the house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long, gnarled feet and pulling his ears. "Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his new mistress, Kreacher won't go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won't, won't, won't --"

  "As you can see, Harry," said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher's continued croaks of "wont, won't, won't," "Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership."

  "I don't care," said Harry again, looking with disgust at the writhing, stamping house-elf. "I don't want him."

  "Won't, won't, won't, won't--"

  "You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?"

  "Won't, won't, won't, won't--"

  Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.

  "Give him an order," said Dumbledore. "If he has passed into your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress."

  "Won't, won't, won't, WON'T!"

  Kreacher's voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of nothing to say, except, "Kreacher, shut up!"

  It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke. He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent, but entirely silent, tantrum.

  "Well, that simplifies matters," said Dumbledore cheerfully. "It means that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher."

  "Do I--do I have to keep him with me?" Harry asked, aghast, as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.

  "Not if you don't want to," said Dumbledore. "If I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him."

  "Yeah," said Harry in relief, "yeah, I'll do that. Er--Kreacher--I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves."

  Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.

  "Good," said Dumbledore. "There is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make different arrangements--"

So yeah. You've been reading too much Hermione-wank shit, possibly of the Fanon-Hermione kind who can do no wrong.

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, as much as some fanboys hate it, Hermione's the one who in the right.
#+end_quote

"Hermione's the one in the right" and everyone else just has to be wrong ---- that's almost like you're channeling fanon-Hermione there. Hahahaha, what a joke.
