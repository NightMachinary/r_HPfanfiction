  If Hermione were wrong, someone would have told her

And Hagrid /does/ tell her to lay off. There you go, an actual professor telling her that her vision isn't the right one.

McGonagall might have done it - but she seems to be extremely distant from her students. She doesn't bother too much when actual students in her school are in danger from mythical monsters, dementors or Umbridge, so why would she care about Hermione's doings? Same goes for Albus.

Molly and Arthur, well, they don't have any house elves to speak of, and I think I recall Ron mentioning that Molly would have liked an elf at some point in the series. Might have been book 2 or 4.

It's literally only Hermione who gives a damn about this, and if you're of the opinion that everyone else is all for slavery...well, there's no point in replying really, because I'll never agree to that.

I've seen people make the "Hermione does research" argument - but that's a pathetically weak argument. I repeat, reading for a few hours in a school library about a practice that goes back centuries or even millennia is nowhere near enough to form a comprehensive conclusion. Only someone who's arrogant and/or ignorant AF can ever make a conclusion from such little effort.

It's like the equivalent of saying that you can write a thesis on the socioeconomic conditions of the Dhimmi in Islamic sultanates after reading a few books for a week, that's how ridiculous it is.

  Dumbledore too, when he explains how Harry inherited Kreacher.

Now /this/ is bullshit. Maybe he does in your fanfiction, but he does nothing of the sort in canon.

  It's a fucked-up evil system

What, a servile race? It's hardly the worst depiction of serviles that I've seen. You see far worse depictions in sci-fi every now then, where serviles are grown as a food source in addition to a labour source.
