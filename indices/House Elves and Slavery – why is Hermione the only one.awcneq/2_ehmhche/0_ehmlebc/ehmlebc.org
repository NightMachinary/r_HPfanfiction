That's bullshit. If Hermione were wrong, someone would have told her. McGonagall, Dumbledore, a prefect once the elves stopped cleaning Gryffindor tower, Molly, Arthur - someone would have told her "hey, it's not like that". SOmething would have been written in the books she found - in one of the best libraries of the magical world. But there isn't. There's nothing redeemable.

And everyone calls it enslavement. Dumbledore too, when he explains how Harry inherited Kreacher. It's a fucked-up evil system, and that of all the named elves, two want to leave their owners and suffer for it, and the other gets thrown away like a broken tool proves that as well.

That the slaves claim to want to be slaves is quite natural - for slaves who can be ordered to mutilate themselves as punishment, or on a whim.
