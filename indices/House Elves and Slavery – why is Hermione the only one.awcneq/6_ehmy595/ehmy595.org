Harry went the entirety of first year without knowing about the existence of elves while learning in a school with possibly the highest concentrated population of elves. Harry, after learning about house elves, still did not know there were elves at Hogwarts. It truthfully isn't until fourth year that Harry comes to realize that elves are critical to Hogwarts, and only then when Dobby reaches out to him first. And finally, it is only after Dobby reaches out to Harry that the â€˜brightest witch of her age' realizes that their how deeply their lives are impacted by elf labor and begin to do something about it.

Remove Dobby from the equation and you get an interesting situation where one of the most observant, inquisitive, and prone to investigation muggleborns never learns about house elves until Winky, and never learns about them at Hogwarts period.
