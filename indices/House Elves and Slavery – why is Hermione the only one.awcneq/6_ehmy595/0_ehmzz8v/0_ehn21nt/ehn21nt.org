Ron is a part of the magic culture that led to the enslavement of house elves. Seeing the frankly alarming reaction most elves have to being freed I don't anticipate a large abolitionist movement.

If you see the enslavement of house elves as wrong (which isn't hard to see) it still requires perspective. If you took survivors of Auschwitz and imediatly upon their liberation fed them a seven course meal, you would likely kill them.

It is highly reasonable that those that know about hourse elves dont care, and those that care cant do anything.

I would deeply encourage those thinking about the morality of house elf enslavement to consider this: house elves are sentient; house elves can make their own choices; given the choice between freedom and servitude house elves overwhelmingly choose servitude. I for one found it fascinating how JKR made it so clear that Hermione cared more for the idea of elves than actually cared to learn about elves. This girl practically lived for research, yet her S.P.E.W. Iniative wasn't reseaech or fact driven, nor was it supported by any of her victims.

Someone who has always breathed air, never encountered a fish, and saw a mermaid in the lake, might react poorly. A compasionate person might even â€˜rescue' the mermaid, taking her onto land and suffocating her. It takes more than good intentions to properly apply your morals to a foriegn world. It requires patience and understanding.
