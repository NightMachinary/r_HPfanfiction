That's a good point. I hardly know any people IRL who care that the products of fast fashion shops like H&M, sneaker companies like Nike, and cheap consumer electronics that make waffle irons and USB fans are assembled by underpaid third world workers.

On the same level as caring about house elf welfare, I doubt muggleborn students would care about where their potions ingredients come from. Things like unicorn hairs and boomslang skins can be harvested humanely, and the plant-based ones seem okay (if you don't question the mandrakes), and then you start to wonder where the ashwinder eggs and murtlap tentacles come from...

Well, the suppliers probably don't care about going Cruelty Free.
