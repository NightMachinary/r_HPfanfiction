It comes down to a question of how well the house elves manage to stay out of sight. Modern business practices that rely on exploitation of people and animals and the environment are only successful when they're obscured enough to avoid having to think about the production process.

The Weasley twins are the only students mentioned in canon besides the Golden Trio that know about the kitchens, right? And the house elves probably use all the other magic of Hogwarts (staircases, gargoyles,etc) to disguise their actions so they don't get bothered by the kids
