If other muggleborn students cared about elf rights, and it was included in the books, then they would be bloatier than they already are. The SPEW subplot is one of the most hated parts of the series, next to the Grawp subplot, and Lupin and Tonks' romance which came out of nowhere and was poorly developed enough that many readers questioned if Lupin even liked her.

On the other hand, Harry only learned about the existence of elves, and Hermione only knew about abused house elves, due to their exposure to Dobby and pureblood Death Eater families who kept them. Other muggleborns, for example Justin in Hufflepuff, might have been part of a majority muggleborn clique where this would never have been brought up, and they'd go on assuming that all the meals in the Great Hall were made by magic, without ever knowing any better.
