She can /try/ to educate them, but would they even listen to her? From Year 1, she has created the impression in her classmates of being an insufferable know-it-all, and the only reason why she has friends at all is because of the Troll incident. Without that bonding them together, Ron and Harry would have just ignored her for the rest of their school years together. Even by Year 4, she was selling badges and buttons for SPEW, and no one cared enough to join her club.

Realistically, an extended SPEW subplot with Hermione in-character would be a futile exercise of Hermione trying and failing to convince people she's right. She is not charismatic or socially astute enough to persuade people over to her side. Even with the D.A., people only joined because of Harry and his reputation.

From a writing perspective, I would hate it and skip it over re-reads. Perhaps it would have made sense from a story told from Hermione's PoV, but since it's in Harry's, he would end up ignoring it or not paying attention to it.
