Only, Hogwarts is treating their House Elves decently as far as we know. Say a few people go down to the kitchens to have a look, but all they see are happy house elves with no signs of abuse. Which disproves Hermione's claim of cruel and unfair treatment.

It's like you hear about starvation in North Korea but go to Pyongyang, where the rich live in relative luxury (they even have a McDonalds), so, therefore, the whole food situation cannot be bad.
