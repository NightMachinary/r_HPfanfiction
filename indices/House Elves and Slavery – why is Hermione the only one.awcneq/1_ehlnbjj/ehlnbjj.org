To me, it seems like a case of ingrained habit that has taken such a pervasive grasp on the Wizarding World. The overwhelming consensus is that the House Elves have always been servants and that will always be the case.

For example, imagine that an alien landed on Earth and opens communication with the general populace. For a few years, they are busy learning all about us, almost obsessively so. One day, without consulting any human, they suddenly announce that all dogs are slaves of humanity and they will be starting a movement to free the canines from their shackles.

That sounds pretty stupid, right? Dogs are not our slaves, they're our friends. We provide them food and shelter and they, in return, love us, hunt with us, defend us, entertain us, etc. Who is this alien to judge us when they never even bothered to ask humanity why we keep dogs as pets? In a nutshell, this is how Hermione is viewed by the Wizarding World.

Now I have to admit that the metaphor is not perfect. House Elves are sentient beings with their own desires and choices. Dogs are not sentient, as best as science can deduce. However, I believe this comparison still has some merit.
