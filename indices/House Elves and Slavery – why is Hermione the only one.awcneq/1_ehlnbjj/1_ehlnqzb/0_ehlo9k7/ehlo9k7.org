Hmm, so I did, misread the question as why do the wizards as a whole not do much about the House Elf issue.

In that case then, perhaps a combination of ignorance and apathy. The House Elves are not something that come up in regular, everyday conversation with Muggleborn. As someone else pointed out, it is probably fairly common they go their entire careers at Hogwarts not even realizing the elves do all the cooking and cleaning.

For the ones that do know, they probably do not care all that much about the situation. After all, how many elves besides Dobby seem to be angry about their status? It just is not a worthwhile fight in that case to those.
