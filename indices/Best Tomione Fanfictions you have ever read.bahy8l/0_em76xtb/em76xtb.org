[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/]] Probably this one linkffn(unsphere the stars by cocoartist). Title's a bit pretentious yeah, but the story is interesting in that neither Hermione nor Tom are forced by the author to change their core personality. They change of course because of their impact on each other (who doesn't change after being around someone who ends up really important in your life?) but their essence remains the same. Also how the author handles the time travel part as well as how horcruxes affected Tom (particularly his psyche) was really well-done.

It's a breath of fresh air after the countless fic where either Tom is made to be this supremely misunderstood, virtually harmless kitten, or where Hermione throws away all of her “troublesome” morals and joins the evil dark side.
