I may be new to this pairing as I just freshly discovered Tomione this year. That happened after I had recalled one remarked in this site about Voldemort being an icky pairing with Hermione while digging for more HP fanfics. It sparked the curiosity to know how would their dynamic work?

I discovered that was freaking explosive!

I am currently sticking with stories of Hermione paired with Tom Marvolo Riddle than his stunt as Lord Voldemort.

This one is my first fanfic of them that completely nailed my craving for their pairing.

â€¢ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13103526/1/Birds-of-a-Feather][Birds of A Feather]] by babylonsheep. Currently WIP. Childhood Friends AU. After reading this, I do think that this is a better intro course for anyone who is hesitating to read this pairing. Kind of mild level.

The rest of my list is what I recently read:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185107/1/Stepbrother][Stepbrother]] by cherrycup. Another WIP. Even if the author is crazy slow with the updates but also crazy good with showcasing the adventurous side of children and the magical world. There is also a pleasantly WTF moment with the sorting ceremony .

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13140902/1/A-journey-to-hell][A journey to hell]] by Perhentian.en. WIP. The author is more active in updating this story. This is straight up Hermione and Voldemort pairing with Voldemort wins!AU setting. It is dark and noooot so healthy. I find it interesting that Hermione started as totally clueless of the magical world until she got introduced to it the extreme way by Voldemort.

Currently I am going gaga over [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12020392/1/School-Days][School Days]] by Meowmers. Complete. Muggle!AU. Childhood friends turned lovers kind of thing. Technically, any Tomione works that is penned by Meowmers is crazy good (and check this author's [[https://meowmerson.tumblr.com/][tumblr]] for more one-shots) as the characterizations is spot on. Even the abandoned WIP works of this author is worth it.
