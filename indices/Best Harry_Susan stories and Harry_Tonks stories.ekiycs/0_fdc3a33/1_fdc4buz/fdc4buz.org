I feel like the "true form" thing should be the other way around if it exists at all. Rather than something which Harry asks for it ought to be something Tonks only chooses to show people she deeply trusts, maybe because she is embarrassed that she looks rather plain without her abilities.

That being said, I prefer the headcanon that the "base form" of a metamorph is a representation of their selves, which for Tonks means pink hair.
