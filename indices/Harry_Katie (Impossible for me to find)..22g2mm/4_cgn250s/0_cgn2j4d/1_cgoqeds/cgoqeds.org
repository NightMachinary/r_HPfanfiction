[[http://scryer.darklordpotter.net/][Here's]] a better way to search FF.net. My advice when looking for distinct pairings is just search the characters (not using using the romance tag, as many authors who write those kind of romances have them as subplots, and will use different tags). Start with stories with 100k+ words, and slowly work your way down the word count as you look for fics that fit your standards.
