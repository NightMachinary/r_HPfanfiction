Ugh, MK-ONE's work actually hurts my soul. Not only is his writing mediocre at best, but you're definitely right about his rehash of the same idea over and over again. In terms of fanfiction, he's definitely in the top 10%, but that really isn't saying much.

Honestly, once you've read one of his fics, you might as well just forget the rest of his stuff.
