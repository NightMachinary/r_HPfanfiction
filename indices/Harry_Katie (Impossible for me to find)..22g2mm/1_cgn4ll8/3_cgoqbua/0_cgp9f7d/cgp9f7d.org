  Honestly, once you've read one of his fics, you might as well just forget the rest of his stuff.

One could make the same argument with regards to most of HP fanfiction. :-)

I've not read all of MK-ONE's stories (I tend to avoid HP/GW). I recently reread [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7560048/1/From-the-Shadows][From the shadows]], and I think it decently written. Just keep in mind it is Super!Harry. A few days ago, I tried reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7927023/1/Half-Alive-Half-Dead][Half Alive Half Dead]] and it has its moments but isn't well written, and stopped after a few chapters. Next I tried [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8966727/1/Vengeance-from-the-grave][Vengeance from the grave]], and it is so poorly written I was contemplating asking him if it he allowed someone else use his account to post the story. Wanting to try a HP/KB, I decided to give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10015981/1/West-of-Here][West of Here]] a try. It is another Super!Harry, but (I think) it is well written, and I've followed it.
