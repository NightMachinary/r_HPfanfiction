If you can locate a copy of VINCET (and sequel) by nos tres reges, this is probably the best story I know of that pairing. (The trio of authors recently took down all their stories, but you might find it archived somewhere.)

I don't particularly care for the author (who has written a million words rehashing the same basic plot over and over), but MK-ONE's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10015981/1/West-of-Here][West of Here]] also claims to be HP/KB.
