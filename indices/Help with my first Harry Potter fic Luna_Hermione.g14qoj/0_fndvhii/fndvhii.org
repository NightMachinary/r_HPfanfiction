i completely lack the dedication and reliability to be a beta.

That said, as a ravenclaw, be careful about "she's out Ravenclawing the other wizards and witches in that house"

Ravenclaws are really not like that. Most of us don't really care about grades all that much. I'd, for example, "prefer to spend three days reading this really interesting book on wandlore than study for my charms owl. under the principle that "As long as i get better than a P it's all good"" and had a tendency to stay up all night reading, before falling asleep in class.

It's more likely, in fact, that hermione wouldn't be able to deal with a lot of ravenclaw's absolute disregard for schoolwork in deference to whatever their latest random interest is. and her constant preachyness about grades would grate on them.

Not saying i don't love hermione, I do, i just don't think the reasons she'd struggle in ravenclaw are quite the same as many think.

That said, if you can't find a beta feel free to send it to me and i'll do a chapter or two, I just tend to not be able to maintain a schedule for beta-ing over a long period :)
