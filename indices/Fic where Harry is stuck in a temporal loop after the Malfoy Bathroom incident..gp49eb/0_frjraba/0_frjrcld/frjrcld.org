  "Sectumsempra" changed everything. Caught in an unending loop of the day he tried the Prince's spell, Harry is able to learn more about Voldemort's Horcruxes and Draco's task. As he lives out the same day again and again, struggling to figure out why time is repeating, Harry discovers more within the walls of Hogwarts than he ever could have imagined.
