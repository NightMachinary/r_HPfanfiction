linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11456392/1/Proud]]) Petunia dies without telling Vernon about magic, so Vernon feels that it's his duty to provide a proper upbringing to Harry. Vernon's still a flawed individual, he still (internally) favors Dudley but tries not to show it and he is committed to having Harry develop into a good person. I liked this fic because Vernon still seemed very in character to his canon counterpart, but without the notion that his nephew was some kind of freak that needed his freakishness beat out of him.
