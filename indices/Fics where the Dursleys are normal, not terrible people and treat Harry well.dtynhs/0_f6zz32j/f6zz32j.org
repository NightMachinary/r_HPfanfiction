There's one called A Better Man (ff.net blocked at work. will link when i get home). It starts off at Vernon's funeral after he +dies of a heart attack+ is killed by a Death Eater (oops. Sorry) . At the end, Harry goes to speak to Petunia and Dudley, and says he wishes Vernon had been a better man (or something like that).\\
Incidentally, this awakens The Fates of Whatever HIgh Atop The Thing, and Vernon learns he gets a do over.

(don't worry. time travel ends here)

And thus it starts back over, with him making a conscious effort to introduce himself to his wife's sister and new husband at their wedding. When Harry ends up on their doorstep some years later, things go much better this time around.
