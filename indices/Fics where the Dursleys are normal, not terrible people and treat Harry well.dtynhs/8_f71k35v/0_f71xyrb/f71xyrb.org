You mean a very bashed Dumbledore? I've just read through the first chapters and it's really getting that bashing in there. Dumbledore blocking Dursleys from the magical world and extinguishing all the lights "out of petty spite"? That's not Dumbledore anymore.

The dialogue is also very Americanised. I want to learn more about this fic's world, but it's making it difficult. The prose can get very purple.
