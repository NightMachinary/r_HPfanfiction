Always start /in medias res/. If the meat of your story happens in 4th year, don't make me slog through 3 years of "things that happened slightly different than in canon". There are plenty of ways to inform the reader about important differences and being a bit circumspect about doling those out can even make the story more compelling, adding mystery: "Huh, Lily is still alive? Why? I wonder what else is different"
