Don't think I can be boxed in easily on this, although in general time skips should be used /appropriately/. I prefer the story to stick to the years that matter, and even then to the events that matter. One surprising fact is that the first three canon books are like less than 100K words combined. Large skips can be a bit jarring, however. I probably wouldn't skip an entire year...

Brevity and focus are much appreciated by me.
