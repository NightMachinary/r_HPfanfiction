It really depends. What is the story you're writing? If someone wants to write a story about a story about an AU 7th year and leaving Hogwarts to explore the wider world in uncertain times then that's what the person wants to write about. Starting from first years bogs the whole story down. You have to slog through stuff you don't want to write/read to get to the good stuff. The reader can often tell and if they stop reading before it gets to the good stuff then the good stuff that you care about is wasted. Chapters after chapter of filter bloat a good story and hold it back. That being said, if the story is about growing up then show me the growth don't tell me. If the focus is on how things that happen change the character then we need to see those things.
