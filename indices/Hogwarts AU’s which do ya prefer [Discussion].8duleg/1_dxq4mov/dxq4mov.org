I don't mind whether the story starts in First Year or skips years. If it's an AU, I want to read where things start to divert from cannon, whether that's First Year, before First Year or some other year or even after the whole battle. I already know what happens in cannon, if there's small details about the AU that are important but don't contribute to the main plot I wouldn't want to essentially re-read Harry Potter.

The best AU's, imo weave what we know, what's different about the authors AU seamlessly into (hopefully) a different plot or outcome to that of cannon.
