What would be even more interesting is if without Hermione there, Harry and Ron are better students - studying on their own, finding their own specialties, and not overshadowed by anyone in their House.

But even if they're not, I am kind of loving your take on the prompt. I like Hermione, and Harry/Hermione, but tbh all the Hermione-worship can be....a bit much.
