  Weasleys still won the lottery that year, and Sirius Black broke out. Without Crookshanks chasing away Wormtail, Sirius caught and killed Wormtail. Unable to clear his name, he went on the run, vowing to avenge Harry and his own suffering.

  Barty Jr broke free from his dad during the Quidditch World Cup. He went on the run, vowing to find his master and free his comrades from Azkaban.

And has absolutely nothing to do with events at all. As she's too young, she's not chosen to compete. She sits at the Ravenclaw table, makes a few friends, and has a nice school year year back in Britain before going back home.

Thank god they moved to France and away from all this pureblood supremacist nonsense.
