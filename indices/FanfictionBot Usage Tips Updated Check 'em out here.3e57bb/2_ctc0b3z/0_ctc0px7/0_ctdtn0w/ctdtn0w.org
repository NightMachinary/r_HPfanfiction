Sorry for the confusion. I had to look at this sub in my desktop browser to figure out the problem. I use iAlien as my reddit app for iphone. In the app, the title of the story is plain text -- no link and no indication that the link is even missing. The links to fanfiction.net go to the homepage of the site.
