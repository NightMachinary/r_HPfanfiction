Hi, thanks for your reply :-)

Unfortunettly old links take you only to the site with all works from hpfandom and as I said I don't even know what this works were only they id. And I think (I'm almost shure) that work imported to AO3 got new id on that site. And each link even with my ids takes you to notice about moving sites and that hpfandoms is merged with AO3.

Thanks for your help none the less.
