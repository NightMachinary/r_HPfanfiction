The first things that come to mind are:

1. Using silencing charms to reduce noise. Besides making things more pleasant, this is a health and communications issue in factories.
2. Using cooling charms to prevent generation/leakage of waste heat. This allows machinery to run longer with less deterioration, allows them to to be used in more locations, and so on.
3. Using strengthening methods to allow things to be built stronger and lighter with less material. This permits more aesthetics to be used in design, makes more efficient use of materials, and allows some things to be portable that would otherwise not be possible.
4. Potions or lubrication charms to reduce friction between moving parts. Significant for product lifetime by reducing wear and heat generation.
5. Shrinking charms to allow mechanical devices to be made smaller. Or perhaps use an engorgement charm on the raw materials, so that a finite will return the finished pieces to the smaller size. Portability and power requirements are improved with this.

You would presumably use rune work or shielding to prevent 'finites' (either errant or deliberate sabotage) from affecting vulnerable things.
