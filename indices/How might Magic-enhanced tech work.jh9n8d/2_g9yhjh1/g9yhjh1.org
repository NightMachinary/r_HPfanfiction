I mean, if Mr Weasley's car is any indication, it'd work very temperamentally, and you'd probably end up with a sort of Animistic Factory-Cities kind of feel. Magic and Tech combine weirdly, so you'd end up with tech with a lot of weird effects and qualities that probably would make working with it somewhat... harder than usual.

Could be fun though. Imagine a Factory where all the machines are sentient and you have to talk them into work in the morning. Or a car that acts like a puppy so you have to pet it before you can go to work. Though Warheads would probably have the most confusing identity crises ever. Or a lightbulb that only works in the dark (it thinks the sun is up, so it's light, so it doesn't need to be on). All the whimsical nonsense of Rowling Magic, but attached to tech instead.

Could definitely be fun. :)
