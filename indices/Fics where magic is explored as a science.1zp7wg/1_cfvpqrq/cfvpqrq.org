This is one of my favorite topics to explore! [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][One of my fics]] is inspired by this, tackling the bridge between magic and electricity, but I didn't go as in-depth about the science as I wanted to. Still, there are passages that might interest you (that I can pull out; it's a long otherwise unsciencey novel), generally gen, and a loving rather than mocking homage to Wizarding World quirks.

I see science-y fics pop up every so often, but they're either too focused on explanation vs story or abandoned quickly. The only thing I can find out of what I've saved is tangentially related--this [[http://thymoss.tumblr.com/post/71195783921/ad-astra-harry-potter-in-space-au-it-was][drabble]] on tumblr about Hermione and the magic of space flight.
