It means that you right a lot of exposition; you like to give a lot of details about things that no one cares/needs to know about at the time.

You even state this yourself at the end when she says "You'll learn more about the subject in Defense" (despite being the one to ask the question about the hex and curse in the first place for some odd reason).

Your writing is very melodramatic, "shall", wtf?
