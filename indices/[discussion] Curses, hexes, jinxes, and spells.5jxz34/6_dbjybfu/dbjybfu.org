  “Similarly can anyone tell me the difference between a hex and a curse?”

  Again Tamblin raised his hand when he saw no one else do so but McGonagall waited without calling on him. With a slight edge of impatience in her voice she eventually answered he own question for the class.

  “A curse is the name for harmful charms, while a hex is a harmful transfiguration. Hence 'Immobilus' is a charm that forces a person to stop moving, meanwhile 'Petrificus Totalus' is a transfiguration that causes temporary petrification. While both have the same result they work in very different ways.”

  A Hufflepuff boy in the front row raised his hand eagerly. McGonagall looked down over her glasses at him.

  “Yes?”

  “What about Jinxes, Professor?”

  Rather than see if anyone could answer, McGonagall immediately replied, “Jinxes may be either charms or transfigurations. It simply means a very minor hex or curse. The trip jinx for instance is a charm, and hence a curse, but because its effect is so minor it is generally called a jinx. I expect you shall learn much more on that subject in Defense Against the Dark Arts with Professor Quirrell. In this class, however, we will be concerned only with transfigurations, and you will find the topic worth every effort you make for it.”
