Before I begin, I would like to say that Dark Spells to me, just mean that they are usually done with a malicious context in mind, that does not necessarily mean that the spells are evil. (Example: Sectumsempra is essentially a Severing/Cutting Curse, but there is also a Severing/Cutting Charm, which means that it requires the same intent, and that the only thing that differs is the power of the spell). This basically means that Dark Magic doesn't really exist when you think about it (unless you count the Unforgivables which require a great amount of hate, or a desire to hurt/control).

Jinxes are Low-Level Dark Spells that are essentially charms with Dark Effects (Changing someone's Physical Appearance, Causing a Job to give someone misfortune, etc...) Even a Punching Jinx (if one existed) could just be seen as a localized Banishing Charm.

Hexes are Mid-Level Dark Spells that consist of Charms and Transfiguration (Bat-Bogey Hex essentially nigh-transfigures and animates, and the Stinging Hex applies the Physical effect of stinging).

Curses are Powerful Martial Magic Spells, due to how powerful they are their effects can last very long times, but they aren't as permanent as Hexes (people have recovered from Curses, but Hermione had to use Madame Pomfrey's Tooth Reducing device to get rid of the effect of a Hex).

Charms are very hard to describe, as their uses are highly dependent on what the user has in mind. In my head-canon, Agumenti, and Incendio can be edited with just a little imagination (that is why we see Harry having the ability to create a localized fire, and a puddle of water, while also being able to use both spells to create a stream/beam of fire/water). This is further proven in the last book when Harry shields the entirety of the people in the Great Hall with a simple Protego. But keep in mind that the power of the spell does not change, so that is why people will use more powerful fire spells in battle (like Fiendfyre, or Harry's Golden Flames) instead of just spamming incendio.

Transfiguration is for all intents and purposes like Alteration from The Elder Scrolls. It is the manipulating of reality to create things from thin air, or change things into something completely different. But unlike how the Elder Scrolls Series has destruction (The De-creation of things basically) we have vanishment.
