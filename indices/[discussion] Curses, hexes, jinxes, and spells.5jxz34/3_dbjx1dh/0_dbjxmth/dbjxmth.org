Sectumsempra was a lot more than a simple Severing charm. It also had a clause in it that stopped anyone from healing wounds caused by it if they didn't have the correct healing spell. Only Snape knew the spell and I doubt he shared it with anyone.

The fact that nobody could heal the wounds is what classified it as Dark Magic.
