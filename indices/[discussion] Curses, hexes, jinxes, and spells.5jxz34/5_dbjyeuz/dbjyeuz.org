Charms: Usually Light based. Varies from protective shields (Patronus Charm) to household spells. Any long term effects are positive and likely long-lasting (ex. Cheering Charms).

Jinxes: Offensive spells, no long term effects. They usually fade by themselves and cause embarassment at best (Jelly-Legs Jinx). Prank spells probably fall under this.

Hexes: Offensive spells, some long term effects. These usually need to be reversed by somebody else and might leave some minor physical or mental damage. Examples: Furnunculus, Densaugeo, and the Bat Bogey Hex.

Curses: Offensive spells, causes highly detrimental long term effects or death. Usually irreversible or reversible with irreversible aftermath. Curses include the Unforgiveables, Sectumsempra, and Confringo.
