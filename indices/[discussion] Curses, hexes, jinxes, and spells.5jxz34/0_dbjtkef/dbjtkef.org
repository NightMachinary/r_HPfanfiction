This is how i differentiate them in my own head and when I'm writing: I use spells as a broad terms to define all magic using a wand and saying a magical phrase. Curses, hexes, jinxes, etc are all spells.

Curses would be dark magic, and, again in my own mind so people may disagree, they tend to linger longer.

Hexes and jinxes are short term offensive dark spells such as the bat-bogey hexes or the jelly leg jinx.

I actually just looked this up on the HP Wiki and they agreed lol. Here's the link: [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Spell]]
