I tend to handle them oddly. Some spells can fit into multiple categories.

Jinx: Pretty much the troll spells of the wizarding world. Temporary spells that can have mischievous effects.

Hex: A lightweight Curse. Has no real lasting damage, but can be rather annoying and harmful.

Charm: Everyday spells for everyday life.

Curse: Spells that maim, kill, or permanently disfigure.
