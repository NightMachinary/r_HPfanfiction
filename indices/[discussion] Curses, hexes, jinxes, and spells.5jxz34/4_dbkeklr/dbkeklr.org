Curse - long term

Hex - Short term involving transfiguration / changing an objects form

Jinx - Short term involving charms / manipulating but not changing an object. Less difficult to treat than a hex, generally.

Spell - word combination said to power/fuel/help production of magic effect, often with wand.

In my headcanon anyway.
