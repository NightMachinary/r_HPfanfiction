I'm sorry to say every time I read a harry /fleur pairing . I imagine Bill Weasley on the warpath with an army of vengeful goblin and the Curse breaker being out for blood. Simply because I think Bill and Fleur are insanely happy together in cannon. But if Harry's relationship with Fleur happens before she meets Bill I can enjoy the fic.
