More of a happy cry than a sad one but there was a Harry/Narcissa fic where Harry has to go back in time to retrieve the cure for a disease that is devastating the ww that was destroyed in his 5th year from the DoM. They end up falling in love and having a kid but Narcissa has to marry lucius and have draco etc. She has to live through cannon basically. At some point after Dracos birth he goes back and sees narcissa and draco and the fic gets all sappy. Narcissa still loves him, draco grew up seeing him as a father and was mad because he saw young Harry as an obstacle between him and a full happy family, he reciprocates the familial feelings with draco, his and Narcissas baby was in a time stasis situation and they go back to where they left off happy ending the end. It's not a very long fic and it has pretty decent writing. I forgot the name but it's not a forgettable fic so it shouldn't be much trouble to find for those interested.
