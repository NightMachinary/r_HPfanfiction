Well, the story is quite weird.

Imagine for instance Bellatrix leading a group of SWAT-like soldiers(MTFs), in taking down a giant Garfield creature that force-feeds people lasagna.

SCP-3166, is worth checking out. Its unnerving, and a bit weird, but it involves a Garfield-looking monster that stalks people involved with bringing down the popularity of the comic strip. It manifests around people who are either critics of the franchise, or are responsible for it lessening in popularity.
