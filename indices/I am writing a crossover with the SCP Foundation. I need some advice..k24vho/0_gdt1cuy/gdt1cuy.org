I was recently thinking about writing some sort of SCP/fantasy crossover, actually. It's good to see that others are working on the same idea.

I think the Foundation would be very generous with their captives. In fact, part of me thinks that they wouldn't kidnap members at all, only willing participants (they have to deal with enough unruly and unwilling sentient anomalies as they do - it's not as if they have a lack of wizards to pick and choose from). If they're going to turn them into brainwashed soldiers, then they might negotiate to take out a few maximum-security prisoners from Azkaban and the like.

Despite the 'whatever it takes', the Foundation is quite willing to accommodate cooperative anomalies, after all. First one that came to mind was their treatment of [[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-085][SCP-085]]. Yes, training will be harsh and uncomfortable, but they'd try to shower the participants with amenities to make up for it, to keep them friendly to the Foundation.

I wonder what they'd do with other magical races. Centaurs, with their skill in divination, could be useful in some sort of think tank. Goblins are unnaturally good smiths. Fawkes and other phoenixes can basically cry [[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-500][SCP-500]] on command.
