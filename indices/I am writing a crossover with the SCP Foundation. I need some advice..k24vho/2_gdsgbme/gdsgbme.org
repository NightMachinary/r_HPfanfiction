This is something I've been looking forward to for ages.

- Very reluctant training from both sides, except for a select few who are very much into it. (Like how 507 wishes to join the foundation as a researcher. Think Arthur)

- Th trained wizard's are placed into different categories of MTF, with each having their own specialties (death eaters: combat, Tranmuters: infiltration, etc)

- Plot twist: they have Lockheart, he's in the amnestics division.

- As a part of a thing to help them get to working together, stage a containment breach of a few less dangerous anomalies. Think like SCP-5033, SCP-1027, anythind Euclid that wouldn't really pose to serious of a threat to a trained mtf squad, but to these uncooperative wizards, it's a life or death senario.

- Potential meta commentary via SCP-3059

- Exposure of animagus (Mcgonagal) to SCP-3270
