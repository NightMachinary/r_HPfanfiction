1. Arthur isn't one of the Wizards kidnapped, along with Molly. But I get what you mean. Maybe Hermione would be in that category.
2. Yeah, that was my original idea. But wizards other than the DE's know combat spells too.
3. No. The story takes place in 96, so Lockheart would be completely unable to function in the Foundation.
4. That's a good idea. Who would win: An exploding sheep and a living nervous system or: A bunch of newly-minted Magical Mobile Task Forces? 5: I don't think so, since in this universe, the books are real.
5. That would just change her into a cat permanently, like everyone else.
