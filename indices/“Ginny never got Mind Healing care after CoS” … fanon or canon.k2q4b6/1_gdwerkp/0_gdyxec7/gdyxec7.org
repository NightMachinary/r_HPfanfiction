Well damn. You're actually right. After knowing what Harry all went through and reading fanfictions about the character mayne we've collectively forgot how crazy/traumatic those experiences must've been for a kid. But again: Rowling just didn't adress the topic of therapy and dealing with trauma in her books. But at the same time I like the cannon :P because it makes him tenacious/tough as hell.
