Honestly? I really dont think she did, unless it was over the summer.

Consider Harry, who:

- was abused

- Killed his teacher at eleven

- almost died at twelve

-almost died AGAIN at thirteen

- watched someone else get killed in front of him at fourteen

- watched his godfather get killed at fifteen

- watched Dumbledore die at sixteen

lets not even get started on seventeen.

Sure, I doubt the Dursleys would have helped him much, but there wore many chances for him to get even considered for therapy, for even a check in.

unless the Weasleys put her in therapy over the summer, nothing happened
