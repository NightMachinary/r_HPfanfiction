That's all fanon.

Ginny's recovery isn't important to Harry's narrative. There's no need to bring it up even as a side-plot if it won't tie back to benefit the main narrative somehow later on.

To fit a "Ginny recovery plot" into a story, you need to have a narrative that would benefit from it -- otherwise you'll just bore or confuse your readers.
