Canonically, nothing is said about it. But as you know, JKR is bad with numbers. And lots of other things. Everything listed at Saint Mungo's floor list couldn't be it. You have creatures/items that can possess you. Creatures like the Wampus cat that use legilimency, and tons of other things not listed in there. Hell, those areas listed are most likely their most used wards since they are the most common injuries. They could have other wards that are referral/appointment only.

Not to mention their emergency intake area.

Toss in the stigma attached to mental illness? Mind healing is probably one of those things that they do have, but don't advertise in an open manner.

Also... Remember Ron? Didn't he get messed up in the head after the brain thingies? Yeah, there was probably mind healing there, but you know how Ron is. He would downplay it. Because he doesn't want to be seen as crazy. Or as a Dark Wizard, since he's a parselmouth. Because trying to mimic a /magical/ language to open a door three or four times in the timeframe they were gone is in the realm of impossible.
