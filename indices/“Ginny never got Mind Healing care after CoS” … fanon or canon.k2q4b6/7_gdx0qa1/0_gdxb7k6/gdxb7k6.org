I see no reason why that couldn't "be it". As it's clearly ordered by origin of injury, items that possess you go to the Artefacts ward, and creatures that possess you go to the Creatures ward.

You are approaching this by looking at an IRL hospital and just substituting magic "Healer" for "Doctor", and I just see no basis for that. For all we know, possession is conclusively repaired by applying a variant of the Cheering Charm once, which every halfway-competent wizard can do, after which you are right as rain. We don't even know whether the often-cited PTSD actually is a thing! It's perfectly possible wizards don't suffer from that, so now what? Arguing solely with "it's not mentioned, so it can be a thing" just leads nowhere, because you can always add an "... or not" and be just as correct.

As far as Ron goes: He was delirious /before/ entering the brain room due to a spell, and the treatment for the brain attack is:

  There were still deep welts on his forearms where the brain's tentacles had wrapped around him. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly's Oblivious Unction there seemed to have been some improvement.
