Ginny's purpose as a character was to be the surprise victim/perpetrator in book 2. She served no real purpose in book 3 or 4 so she had only a few appearances in these books.

In book 3 she's giggling with Molly and Hermione about love potions. She was on the train, where she nearly faints like Harry due to the dementors. She visits Harry in the hospital wing as well. Shes mentioned in passing in a few other scenes at Hogwarts.

Mind healing is fanon, and a mind healing subplot about a random side character wouldn't fit in the fantasy/mystery series. If you want to write a story about that, then write that story, but she never disapears in canon.
