I'd say Ginny, Luna, and Neville have about the same, but I agree with the overall sentiment. The 3 middle books are bloated as is, OotP in particular. However, I /do/ think JKR should've given Ginny a similar scene to the one Luna/Harry have at the end of OotP to develop the relationship more prior to HBP. Harry and Luna connect over death/lost parents in a way I wanted Ginny and Harry to connect over TMR.
