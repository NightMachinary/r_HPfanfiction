Meh, it's a children's and later YA series from a single character viewpoint. To shoehorn in a random sideplot of ginny bringing up to harry "mind healing" or other fanon stuff would break the flow for the next book's arc. The events of the previous books generally only matter in how they relate to Voldemort's return. The events of book 2 are eventually brought up again in book 5 at Grimmauld Place during Christmas, and her reaction to the dementors in book 3 imply it. These are both to reinforce current plotlines. Every scene in the books should develop the plot to some degree, in my opinion. Else you get something that just meanders around.

I'm not a huge fan of that article. It seems to want a 5 book Harry/Ginny romance subplot in the series, which I think is a bit stupid. ginny has enough character development to tell us what she's like and there's like 150,000 or more words of relationship development in Half Blood prince. Harry potter was solidly a children's/middle grade book through to book 3. Harry was infatuated with Cho in book 4 and 5, and then he develops a crush on Ginny in book 6. They're teenagers, there's nothing unrealistic about a teen quickly developing a crush.

Ginny has more character development than Fred, George, any of the rest of the Weasleys other than Ron, all of the other students other than Hermione, and arguably more than Neville.
