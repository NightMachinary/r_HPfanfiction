It would have been mentioned if she were actually gone gone, but that doesn't exclude the possibility she was seeing a mind healer the summer between her first and second year, or going to appointments once a week, or what have you. Still it seems strange not to mention it at all if it happened and it seems out of character for the wizarding world to consider such a thing.

If you want to include her getting therapy I think that is compatible with canon.
