Nobody is saying the concept doesn't make sense as something that could be part of the wizarding world in theory. Your question was fanon or canon. The answer is fanon. There's nothing in the books about Ginny getting mind healing or "mind healers" being distinct from healers in general /in the books/. Mind healers was a cool concept that fans came up with; it doesn't contradict anything and it became popular to put into fanfictions because, if wizarding therapy were to exist, what else would it be called? Just because something doesn't contradict canon, doesn't mean it is canon. Fanon can be interesting and complex.
