You really think that eleven year old girl who was ten months under the influence of brainwashing (using the Muggle terms), and Tom Riddle wouldn't be gentle with her, because she was to be disposed in the end anyway, is unaffected by the ordeal?

Concerning the evidence, there is only this dialogue (from OotP, chapter 23):

  “We wanted to talk to you, Harry,” said Ginny, “but as you've been hiding ever since we got back ---”

  “I didn't want anyone to talk to me,” said Harry, who was feeling more and more nettled.

  “Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said Ginny angrily, “seeing as you don't know anyone but me who's been possessed by You-Know-Who, and I can tell you how it feels.”

  Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him. Then he turned on the spot to face her.

  “I forgot,” he said.

  “Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.

I think the last sentence is one of the most brilliant lines in whole heptalogy (and which potential was completely ignored by JKR), because we all forgot what she was dealing with all these last years, but it certainly suggests that even couple of years after Ginny is still affected by whole ordeal. Perhaps not having flashbacks and nightmares all the time, but I would think she went through some PTSD drama before.
