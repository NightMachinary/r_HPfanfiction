Wizarding NHS should exist, right ?

Now, I'm not British so I don't know if NHS do cover therapy after a traumatic events like that.

If muggle NHS do not cover it, then maybe we could think that there is a WNHS, and with all the fucked up thing that happens in the wizarding worlds, that they decided that it was needed.
