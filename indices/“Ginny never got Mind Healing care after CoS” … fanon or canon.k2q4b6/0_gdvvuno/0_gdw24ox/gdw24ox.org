I don't think money is the issue that much. I know we Europeans are not trigger-happy stereotypical Americans in terms of litigation, but if Hogwarts has any legal duty to care for children who are for ten months out of a year in their care /in loco parentis/ (and they do ... which is why it spends horrible amount of money on maintaining small hospital on its premises), they are certainly liable for any Mind Healer costs for Ginny, because they completely dropped their ball on taking care of her. They would gladly pay anything to keep whole affair hushed up.
