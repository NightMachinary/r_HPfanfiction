We do, and the answer is no.

There are no "<bodypart> healers" at all. Healers are just called healers (if you don't count "Healer-in-Charge" and "Trainee Healer"), and the distinctions exists with the wards, which are ordered by the origin of the injury. As there are: Artefacts, Creatures, Magical Bugs, Potions and Plants, and Spells.

Outside of St Mungo's, there are no Healers. Madam Pomfrey is a matron ("nurse" in the AE versions), and during Quidditch matches there are "mediwizards", which presumably are the equivalent to paramedics.
