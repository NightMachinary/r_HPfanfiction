What we have to remember is that the books only really show Harry's perspective, and Ginny was basically out of the picture his entire 3rd year.

It's not unreasonable to think Ginny went to a therapist/mind-healer all throughout that year and a 13-year-old Harry just kinda glosses over it in his mind. Canon never states it either way.
