"Closed" is the same as "secure". Even in the 21st century, people suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's are often housed in locked wards. I myself once worked in a MCU (Memory Care Unit) at a nursing home. These people are kept in because they may not have the mental ability or memory to safely navigate an unsecured area; for example, Lockhart couldn't even remember his own name to start with, let alone that magic is supposed to be a secret or how to use the Floo safely.

In Ginny's case, she likely wouldn't be placed in a secure ward. She is not suffering from severe amnesia, nor is she suffering from an illness that causes loss of reasoning abilities or situational awareness (like the aforementioned Alzheimer's and dementia). Ginny, to our knowledge, never displays suicidal tendencies, which is the only other reason she might be on a secure ward for her own protection.

Tl;dr; St. Mungo's is humane by 21st century standards. Unlikely that Ginny would be locked up, as she isn't a threat to herself or others.

Edit; people with diminished capacity also need to be protected from cruel bastards who would take advantage of them. My MCU had very tight security procedures.
