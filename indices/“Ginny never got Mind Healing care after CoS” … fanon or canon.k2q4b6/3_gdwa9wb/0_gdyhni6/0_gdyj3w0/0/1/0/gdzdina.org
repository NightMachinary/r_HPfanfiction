I disagree. All three need protection from themselves and others. In order of mention;

Longbottoms. They need to be in a secure ward because both have extremely diminished mental capacity as well as poor physical condition. Neither Alice nor Frank would be able to fight off a physical, magical, or other kinds of assault (or even realize one was occurring).

Lockhart. He's more aware, but he has no memories before arriving at Saint Mungo's. He has no frame of reference for right and wrong; that's something that people are taught in childhood, of which he has no memory. He could commit a crime without realizing the act was illegal (Statute of Secrecy), or he could be taken advantage of by someone.

Bode. We agree here, enough said.

The world sucks. Such bad things occur even in real life. I can only imagine the terrifying and disgusting possibilities that magic creates in this context.
