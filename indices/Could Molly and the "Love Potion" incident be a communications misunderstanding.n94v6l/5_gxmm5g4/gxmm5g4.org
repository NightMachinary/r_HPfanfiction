Well there are various levels of love potion potency. Amortentia is said to be the most powerful but we don't know anything about the rest. Ron reacts like an idiot to an aged one but considering that, not only did he not rush to the girls bedroom to fuck Romilda, and likely the ageing aspect was not anticipated, the intent of it was more to make the guy act like an idiot rather than as a rape drug (which seems to be thematic to the WWW products). So, yeah, Molly might have made a love potion but it's never specifically mentioned as Amortentia. For what is worth she could have been dating a guy with a penile dysfunction and she wanted to help him out.
