That'd be a good retcon.

I don't think it is that, but it's a good retcon.

I think that Rowling meant it to be an actual love potion that Molly used on Arthur, AND that it's supposed to be funny. This is the same person who has the Wizarding World allow love potions to be sold, and had the girls giggling over it. It was "funny".

No, I don't think Molly's supposed to be evil. It's just another sign of Rowling REALLY not thinking through what she's writing.
