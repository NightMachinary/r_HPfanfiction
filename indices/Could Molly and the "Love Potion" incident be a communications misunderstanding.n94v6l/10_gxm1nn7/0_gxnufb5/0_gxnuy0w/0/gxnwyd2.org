Yes, it does sound bad, but as the post says, we don't even know the context. JK has written some suggestive stuff, to say the least (e.g. Aberforth's "inappropriate charms on a goat"), so she could very well be referencing a blue pill. I still think her own upbringing from the 60's / 70's (and the fact the books are from late 90's and early 2000's) influenced these plot choices, it's just that there is a thin line between what is backwards thinking and what is intended.
