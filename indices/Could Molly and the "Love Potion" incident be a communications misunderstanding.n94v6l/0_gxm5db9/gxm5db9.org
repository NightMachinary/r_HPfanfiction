The biggest problem with Molly Weasley and Love Potions is that everybody seems to remember something completely different than what actually is the canon:

#+begin_quote
  [Harry and Weasley boys] headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she'd made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly. (Chapter 5 of PoA, “The Dementor”)

That's it. There is nothing more on the topic. We don't know what kind of potion it was, we don't know if she ever used it (and certainly we don't know that she used it on Arthur), we don't know whether she was succesful in making it, we don't even know whether it was some fun concoction she made even before Hogwarts (note that “a young girl” doesn't feel like a Hogwarts-age teenager). We know almost nothing about it.
