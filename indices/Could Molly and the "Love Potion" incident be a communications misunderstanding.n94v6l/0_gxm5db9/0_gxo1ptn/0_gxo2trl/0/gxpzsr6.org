I read that fic ages ago and it's one of the most heart-rending things I've read in my entire life. It's so true to life- the author got the portrayal of eating disorders spot on. So many people think that EDs are a vanity thing but it's very commonly triggered by sexual assault. It's an incredible story of how rape can literally ruin someone's life in every way possible, from food to friends to academics. It made me cry multiple times but reading it is essential.
