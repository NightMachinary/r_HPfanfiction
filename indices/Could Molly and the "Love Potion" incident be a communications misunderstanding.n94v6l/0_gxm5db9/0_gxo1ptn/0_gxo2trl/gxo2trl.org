Yup. I think there are more versions of love potions. Yes, Amorentia is on the top as a rape drug, and it is quite horrible (see linkao3(14164617) for a rather horrific treatment of the matter) to something which Weasley brothers were selling (which I would expect could just persuade a girl to enjoy her date more or something of that kind) to some complete nonsense. I am a bloke so mysteries of young girls' play are still mostly a mystery to me (although, I have a daughter), but I know there are various silly girly games about whether she will find a boyfriend or not via kind-of-divination from flowers and such. Why shouldn't there be in the magical world something similarly silly for young girls?

And yes, that giggling feels more like “we are all idiots sometime” than Amorentia.
