Let's put it this way. If you cook meth, there's the possibility that you did it because you wanted to see if you could. However, odds are that you are either selling or taking your product.

Also consider the fundamental rule of writing. Only mention a gun if its going to be used. So the potion being mentioned implies that it was also used. Just look at HBP.
