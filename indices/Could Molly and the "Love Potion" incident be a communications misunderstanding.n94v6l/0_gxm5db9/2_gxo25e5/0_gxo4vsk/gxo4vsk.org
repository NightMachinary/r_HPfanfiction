Hard Disagree considering JK's writing style. Look at the other things JK Rowling litters around and never uses (which incidentally often make great Fan fiction when a writer picks them up.)

-the Accountant Second Cousin -Flying Lessons (mentioned once as part of the curriculum and never again, at all) -the fate of Florean Fortescue -students are allowed cats, toads or owls- why is Ron allowed a rat? Never discussed. (As a kid reading the first two books I genuinely expected that to come up, then I suspected maybe someone at Hogwarts was working with Pettigrew and hiding him from the relevant staff, but it came to nothing)

A few of these are throwaway jokes or devices used once and then once they have been used they are disregarded. I think the love potion story here is both, it explains what the girls were doing (listening to the story and not paying attention to Harry) and it works to show Hermione can interact with women and occasionally talk about silly, funny things instead of always bring intellectual.
