It didn't have to be the same potion. See above for my other comment: “A little girl” Molly Weasley could brew something silly, just to introduce to the idea of love potions present in the magical world, to be confronted later with Amorentia in the class of Professor Slughorn, and then really used for plot purposes against Ron.

BTW, just thinking about it: we actually don't know what Romilda Vane used. It was pretty awful, but it could be that Amorentia is even worse: really a rape drug in the style “spreading my legs, do it NOW!” like in linkao3(14164617) (all warnings against triggers and such fully apply, it is really a rather rough story).
