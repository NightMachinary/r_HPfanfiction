I think one thing that seriously taints the fandom's view of love potions is that the two times we know for a fact they were used, it was given deceitfully... once to the wrong person after aging amped it up and once with recurring dosing until the woman was pregnant.

Obviously that sort of use is not acceptable.

But consider consensual use, and not even just as a marital aide:

A bunch of 7th years, all legal adults by Wizarding Law, staying at the castle through their Easter Holiday studying for NEWTS but by Friday night they are burnt out and need to relax. Everyone goes up to an empty class room / a boys dorm if it's just within one house, drinking and dancing and letting off some steam, and at some point the best potions student pulls out a few bottles of mid-grade Love Potion.

"Who's up for spin the bottle?" (turns out the Muggle idea is a shoddy knock off)

Anyone who doesn't want to participate leaves or stays out of the way, and the rest get to have some fun without the pressure of figuring out who to ask.

And perhaps in the late 60's, a certain pair of redheads who everyone knew liked each other got 'matched' this way, resulting in a funny story for their daughter / future daughter-in-law.
