I think it's another example of either Wizarding Worlds screwed morals (or just ignorance of the implications) or Rowling's tendency of not thinking things trough.

Love potions are date rape drugs.

Even the ones in the twins shop. Creating artificial attraction for an hour or two? That's more then enough for such kind of crime. And with the "attraction" they felt before? It would be too easy for themselves and others to blame the victim. And with the 'behind the times' society they seem to have? An easy way to claim/snatch/whatever an more or less unwilling husband/wife. Or just to ruin reputations.
