Fanon and canon treat love potions differently.

There's /amortentia/, which is pretty much skeevy on its own given what we know about it. That is most definitely frowned upon, and it's more a /rape/ sort of thing (mind, free-will, et cetera).

But there are a lot of commercial and /weaker/ potions out there that are either easy to brew or are commercially sold (hell, even George and Fred sell them!). This is most likely what Molly was talking about, not some amortentia-type thing that enslaved her future husband (I'm honestly eye-rolling at this).

Weaker love potions, going from what I read in canon, are like giving someone you like chocolates or flowers -- it's treated the same way. It's to say you're showing interest in them.

You act like a dope for an hour or two over the one who slipped you it, and it likely wears off. And you get the biggest clue in your life, heh.

There's also a bit of gender bias there, I think -- it's likely seen as fine if a witch does it to a wizard, but not a wizard to a witch... just like how traditionally a man giving a woman flowers and chocolate is the norm.

If Harry were slipped a weak potion by, say, Katie Bell or Lavender Brown or (more realistically) a girl that he doesn't interact with all that much (maybe a lower year in his House or someone from Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff), his acting dopey for an hour would most likely have him amusing his friends and being ribbed for it... and they tell him after "she likes you, you dope! Are you interested in her? Ask her out!"

If Harry, in this example, acted on this after by asking her out, great! If she doesn't get him coming to her and not asking her out, she knows he's not interested.

However, I can't see Ron doing this to Hermione or vice-versa, for example, because of how close they are already/how much they interact already. Same deal with, say, Angelina and Fred (or was it George?) during their Hogwarts years.

It sounds bizarre, but that's the magical world for you.
