Given how Ron used what amounts to a 'pick-up artist' handbook to woo Hermione, I have no problem believing he'd consider a love potion. He was obviously aware that he treated her poorly, given how he relied on a 'how-to' manual to try and seduce her instead of taking an honest look at whether they were a good match (they aren't).
