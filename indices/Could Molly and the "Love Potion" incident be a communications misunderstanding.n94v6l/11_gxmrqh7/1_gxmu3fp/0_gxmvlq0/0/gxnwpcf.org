No see buddy what I think your forgetting is that ron is literally Satan you might just be remembering Canon wrong and might not have noticed but its obvious he's literally Satan and regularly tried to make sure harry tortured atleast 3 puppies and raped 3 babies per week /at least/ now I understand what you ron lovers are like always "forgetting" that time he said he wanted to love potion Hermione and rape her but the proof is in the books he is Satan and here's why

Book 1 he sacrifices himself in the chess game you wanna know why he knew getting hit by a stone object twice your size getting send flying into a wall and hitting your head wasn't that much an injury and he was obviously faking being unconscious he also had to get that voldermort fellow out of the way cant have other evildoers out there killing all the babies before him after all

Book 1 again making Hermione cry he set her up from the damn beginning he was playing 4d chess from the very beginning and onky one bo- sorry Lord can stop him Lord Hadrian Uchia Ebony Gryfindorr Black Malfoy Slytherin with all his lordship rings and the power of being a "friend of the goblin nation" only he an 11 year old who learned about magic 3 months ago was competent enough enough to beat it not the war veterans not dumbolddork or dumb old coger no it was Lord Hadrian Uchia Ebony Gryfindorr Black Malfoy Slytherin with all his lordship rings and the power of being a "friend of the goblin nation"

Book 2 that bitch ginny tried to love Potion him but with the power of his soul mate the godes- i mean Hermione he realized and was able to stop the bad weasley bitch

Book 3 ron clearly set up ctooshanks and scabber situation and was somehow involved in sirius being arrested

4 satanic ritual accomplished mortal form shed ron is now free to rein terror upon the world but Lord Hadrian Uchia Ebony Gryfindorr Black Malfoy Slytherin with all his lordship rings and the power of being a "friend if the goblin nation CAN stop him

5 rinse and repeat until book 7

6 now I know what you dumb ron lovers are gonna say "thats not what happened in Canon ron never ever did that and was a loyal friend" well your misremembering you filthy fanon readers
