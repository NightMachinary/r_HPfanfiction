Your inner-fanon is showing.

Ron was a dumbass teenage boy. Hermione was a dumbass teenage girl. Teenagers and young adults at that age are dumb when it comes to relationships. But they're still people, not tropey caricatures or pawns for die-hard shippers.

He wasn't trying to "seduce her"... he was trying to get her as his girlfriend. He was taking cues from the book to try and get her interested in him. Heck, if he didn't have the book, he'd likely have asked advice from his older brothers and would've done some dumb shit that the book would have likely paraphrased in some context.

We've all done shit like this as teens/young adults, much to our later embarrassment (some of the shit I did as a teen/guy in my early twenties makes me wince now on reminiscing).

But, personally? While I could see Ron taking dumbass cues from books or older wizards trying to advise him (e.g. his brothers again), I can't see him using a potion in the context of my original post because of the individual dynamic he and Hermione have.

If he didn't know her that well e.g. she was Harry's friend and not his instead of their being close friends together, then sure, he might have tried it.

Could it have worked? Yeah, it might have given Hermione a huge flag that Ron likes her like she does him deep down. But, it's also likely that her reaction as an /individual/ would like likely be anger, despite her apparent views on them (e.g. giggling while Molly was talking about her own shenanigans). Because it's /Hermione/, and not that girl in another class that you vaguely know and have no idea beyond "wow, she's pretty".

Ya gotta think of individual reactions and relationships then a cookie-cutter reaction for every character out there.

heck, I could see a younger Ginny trying this -- nothing insidious as in a typically shitty Indie-Harry story, but a young girl trying to get her crush to notice her with a harmless effect for an hour or two.
