I suppose you'd have to look at the Magical World as not being a purely British culture/society with adaptations but a subset//cousin/ of it (well, inbred cousin, I suppose) -- kinda like closely-related countries in Europe having similar but also different values.

I daresay we "muggles" have values they find just as strange.
