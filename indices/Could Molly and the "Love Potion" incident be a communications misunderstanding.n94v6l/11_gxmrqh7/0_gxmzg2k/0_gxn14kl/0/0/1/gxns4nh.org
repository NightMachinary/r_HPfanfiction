If you think about it, a lot of things are justified by how 'not serious' they are. Newt Scamander says it himself: "Your [Jacob's] skull is susceptible to breakage under immense force." Hermione's teeth grow fast because of a hex (or jinx?) and are reduced back to what she wished they looked like just as fast, when her dentist parents had never fixed them. The Stinging Jinx makes Harry's face swell, causes him pain and IIRC he can't see either, but it isn't a big deal - it probably that takes a couple hours to wear off and you go back to normal. The only instances Muggles get to look that bad is when we get a beating, for example, and it causes much more damage than looking bad. Hags literally eat children and the narration makes it sound like Harry could take one down at the age of twelve.

This is why quidditch is so brutal, for example. Not only do they have um... backwards principles, but also breaking a bone is almost like scraping your knee. Many physical injuries seem to be easily treatable with magic, even though we Muggles take months to heal. It's only natural their society looks barbaric sometimes. I suppose regular love potions work the same way, they aren't so frowned upon because it's like getting someone tipsy, not drugged. Granted, getting someone tipsy is wrong too, but that's when their backwards beliefs show. They just aren't thaaat backwards as they sound like.
