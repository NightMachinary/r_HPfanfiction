Yes, I'm obviously not saying impairing someone's judgement in any way to get together is right, but you mix their backward beliefs with the fact that magic often "turns" brutality (in our perspective) into mild injuries, and it looks like they are barbaric.

I think the best example is that when Filch began working as caretaker, he still was allowed to hang misbehaving students by their ankles as punishment. That's the wizarding equivalent of hitting a student with a ruler. It is wrong indeed, but it isn't as wild as it sounds like when your body is more resistant and you have access to quick and effective ways to heal big injuries.

And you have to take in consideration what they intend to do with a love potion. Wizards could easily rob anyone just by apparating into someone else's house. Not only do they /not/ do it, but they also choose to knock on the door even when they just want to pay a visit. They could stun and rape each other too, but the Stunning Spell seems to only be used in combat. They could literally set people on fire with a spell, but it seems like they only use Incendio to cook and light up a lamp.

A love potion could be a way of making your crush say cheesy stuff to you or act all silly and in love around you. Maybe they intend on getting a kiss too, which is beyond wrong, of course, but not every love potion is used with the intent to rape. Maybe all regular love potions do is making you confess your "feelings" for the other person, maybe it varies according to how much potion you use. The possibilities are endless.
