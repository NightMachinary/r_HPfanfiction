Don't forget when Neville's Uncle Algie accidentally dropped him out of a window and he bounced -- I daresay if he hadn't, they'd have been able to treat any injuries with a wave of the wand or a quick potion.

Also, Neville falling from his broom from the height of a small building? Broken wrist because he landed wrong. Probably a quick sip of skelegrow or something to fix it, and he'd be back in class in an hour.
