The Wizarding World is a bit barbaric in some areas by our standards, yeah. IIRC a lot of values actually seem familiar to what life was like back in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially Azkaban (except the soul-eating demons part) Prison's conditions being much like how our and American prisons were like back then.
