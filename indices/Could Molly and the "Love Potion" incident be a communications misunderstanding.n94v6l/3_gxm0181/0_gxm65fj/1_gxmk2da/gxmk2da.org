It's been years since I've read the books so I'm not sure of the canon. It just seems like every Molly I've come across lately has been EvilPotionMistress!Molly. That can be fun when you're in the mood but sometimes I wish the fanon had gone in a different direction.

Also, poor Ron, they'll still be telling that story when he has grandkids.
