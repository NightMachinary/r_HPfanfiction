If I recall correctly, the book's text just says it's a story about Arthur and a love potion, not a love potion specifically administered by Molly, right?

After all, from a certain point of view "Romilda Vane tried to dose Harry with a love potion, but Ron stole and ate all the cauldron cakes she'd put it in all at once so he overdosed on the potion and Madame Pomphrey had to treat him for priapism while he was screaming deliriously about how he needed his 'Sweet Rommiekins' because he dwells in darkness without her" is Ginny telling a story about Harry and a love potion.
