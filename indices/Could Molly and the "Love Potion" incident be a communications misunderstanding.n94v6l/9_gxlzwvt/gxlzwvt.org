That's almost exactly what I imagined when I wrote a fic to deal with the problematic nature of love potions in the HP universe. In my headcanon, there is a whole array of love potions, lust potions, and bedroom aids, /and/ they are all legal when consensual but it's a criminal offense to give a noncon dose. I've got Hermione on board with them as an intimacy aid, right up until her boyfriend doses her /without telling her/. It makes sense in that context of Harry's perspective having a slight misunderstanding of Molly's real meaning and Hermione's ability to read between the lines. Ron would be similarly positioned as a daft teen boy, seeing Molly and Hermione were giggling over the possibilities and so Ron takes it a step too far. The rest of the fic involves her spending her potions apprenticeship working on a universal theory of love potions and antidotes.

From the final chapter:

  It was the day before Valentine's. They had spent their lab time yesterday brewing her new love potion antidote, anticipating the holiday shitshow. Juveniles were not subject to criminal charges for love potions, but a mere warning and a cleared record when they came of age. While in theory this protected minors from being punished too harshly for stupid mistakes, the reality was that most adult offenders had experienced giving or receiving a love potion as a minor. There had to be a better way to prevent the non-consensual use of love potions.

If you want all the potions technobabble, and don't mind a little Ron-bashing in my post-war HEA for SSHG, then I shall shameless promo [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28292328/chapters/69327945][Fridays I'm In Love]].
