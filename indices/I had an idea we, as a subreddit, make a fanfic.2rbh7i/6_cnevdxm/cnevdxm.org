This sounds like a great way to give the shipping wars another go.

Those guys in Gryffindor Tower were doxing people all the way back in 2002. I wonder what kind of hijinks we can get up to this time?

I use a TW account because this fandom is able to hold grudges and remember feuds in ways that others can only dream of doing.

OP, I really admire your ambition; normally it would be a wonderful idea. Unfortunately, many of the underlying values that make people choose their ships are too different to work together. E.G., I'm not big on forgiving bigots, so any mention of reformed!Draco would cause me to lose interest.
