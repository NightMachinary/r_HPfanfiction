My idea for a start. If anyone wants to actually write this, or build on the outline, they are welcome to do so, provided my username gets attached to it somewhere. I would be willing to contribute further to the development of the story.

    :END:
Draco Malfoy time-travels back to 1st year, arriving shortly after his confrontation with Ron and Harry. He immediately turns back to make amends. Unfortunately, his attempts at seduction (target should be unclear - should include clues pointing towards Harry, Ron, and Ron's sister) go poorly. Harry and Ron's views of him have changed from "Git" to "Seriously creepy" by the time he leaves.

As the first years wait for the sorting ceremony, Draco Malfoy attempts to put the moves on Hermione. Whether he is attempting to seduce her, or merely trying to use her as a way to get close to Harry, Ron, or Ginny is unclear. Professor Mcgonagall's ill-timed entrance leaves her less than pleased. He is ordered to report to the Headmaster's office immediately after his sorting.

The sorting hat begins cackling madly as soon as it's placed on Malfoy's head, and doesn't stop. Dumbledore banishes it to his office and announces that the rest of the first years will be sorted once it has recovered. He conjures another table for them in the meantime.

After the feast, Malfoy is escorted to the Headmaster's office. Dumbledore uses legilimency on Draco while he is distracted by the still-cackling sorting hat. Whether Dumbledore is an evil manipulator using a child to find information on a political opponent or a concerned adult trying to figure out what sort of home situation could provide an 11 year old with some of the terms he used while speaking to Hermione is not made clear, though readers will no doubt decide one way or another. The point is rather moot, as the memories of the future he finds in Draco's head drive him insane. No one notices the difference.

Harry Potter and Ron Weasley devote the next week to dodging Malfoy as best they can while still getting to classes. This quickly becomes the talk of the school. After Draco corners them in the Great Hall and begins giving renditions of the Weird Sister's greatest hits, the twins take pity on them and give Harry the Marauder's map.

(A 7th-year muggleborn writes down the lyrics and uses a pensieve to learn the tunes of the songs Malfoy sings. After some modifications, she sings and records the songs over the course of the next year while working at Madam Malkins. Butterflies result a few books later on)

Unfortunately, they can't avoid him during classes. Malfoy instigates a reproduction of the Remembrall incident during their first flying lesson. From-memory recreations are often unreliable, and context has a lot of effect on meaning, which is probably why a high-speed Malfoy-after-Potter broom chase results when Malfoy tells Harry to "Come and get it or it'll get you." Suggestive broom movements may have been involved. A skillful feint by Harry results in Malfoy smashing through Dumbledore's window, and landing in a rather suggestive position (whether this was deliberate or accidental is not made clear). The next day, Rita Skeeter publishes photos in the Daily Prophet.

Lucius Malfoy arrives a week later, ostensibly for a Board of Governor's inspection of the school. He congratulates Harry for showing up "That good-for-nothing son of mine." The fact that a rat was impaled on his cane is largely ignored amidst the hubbub. An owl named Pigwidgeon is gifted to the Weasley's the next day.

The staff notice that the sorting hat's cackles are now varying considerably in frequency. They sort the remaining first years based on the rate it laughs while placed upon a student's head. Draco Malfoy alone is not sorted with this method, as "It might prove permanently damaging to the Founder's relic to place it on your head again." Honestly, no one at Hogwarts doubts that he belongs in Slytherin, which is where he goes. His father visits the school again to complain, saying that his son is a "Born Hufflepuff."

Harry, now in Gryffindor (along with Ron, Hermione, and unspecified other characters, so our options are open for the rest of the series/book), and his friends relax considerably now that they have a Malfoy-free section of castle. Of course, that changes a bit in October, when Professor Quirrel announces the presence of a troll in the castle, with the usual theatrics. Harry, Ron, and Hermione return to the common room to wait in safet - just kidding. Draco Malfoy kidnaps them at wandpoint, throws them in the 3rd floor corridor, and tells them to "Do their thing." Quirrel finds Malfoy in the corridor, but is interrupted by Snape before attempting anything. Snape begins to suspect the trio of trying to steal the stone. The trio blames Malfoy. Malfoy points out that Quirrel's behavior is most suspicious - fainting and then running up here? Quirrel questions Snape's involvement. Dumbledore suggests they settle everything with a nice game of Parcheesi. Snape begins discreet inquiries at St Mungo's mental health department.

Christmas rolls around, with brief mentions of the intervening classes and Trio bonding. Harry receives the Invisibility Cloak and the Elder Wand from an anonymous benefactor, along with an apology "For not providing the complete 3-piece set." Lucius Malfoy sends the diary of someone called "T. M. Riddle" with a hole burnt through the middle, along with the diary of Lily Potter nee Evans and the animagus notes of James Potter, both without the hole.

At some point in the following months, the Trio (read: Hermione) find out about the stone by extrapolating from comments made by someone (probably Malfoy) during the Halloween incident.

Not long after Christmas, the Hogwarts Board of Governors votes unanimously to begin construction on the "James Potter Memorial Center for the Study of Nordic Draconic Life." (Mostly intended as a one-off joke, but why not run with it and make it a plot point later on?)

In mid-May, Dumbledore announces that he will be leaving the castle for the next 5 weeks to do research on "International variations in citrus-based candy," adding that "I won't be returning here at all, and definitely won't be checking on the third floor corridor."

Two weeks later, the Trio are kidnapped from Gryffindor Tower. Draco explains that Voldemort is trying to capture the Philosopher's stone, they are the only ones who can stop him, and shoves them through the door.

After getting through the obstacles (like cannon, but funnier), they confront Quirrel. As he lifts his wand to curse Harry, a stunner strikes him from behind, cast by none other than Lucius Malfoy. Lucius reveals that he is, in fact, a time-traveling body-swapped Sirius Black, and that the real Lucius Malfoy is currently in an Azkaban cell, in Sirius's body. He apologizes for not being able to prove his innocence and adopt Harry, saying that he "Accidentally killed all the evidence." They leave, Sirius informing them that "No dark wizard could steal the stone with how Dumbledore's enchanted this mirror."

--------------

Book two opens with "Sirius Black" escaping from Azkaban, Harry adopting a dog, Lucius Malfoy's house elf scaring the Dursley's into treating Harry well, and a Diagon Ally shopping trip, with assistance provided by Harry's unusually intelligent new dog.

--------------

Each book adds a trope or two, and a great deal of humor, to the end of the preceding book. The first involves time-travel and body-swapping, with a bit of shipping parody thrown in. The second one involves shopping trips, goblins, and animaguses (recurring scene: Harry's new dog trying to get access to James and Sirius's old journals in order to read the "untransforming" notes). Knockturn Ally dealers start selling a miracle cure for all ailments. Harry gets a trunk.

I'm not too sure about later books (actually, I'm not sure about the "plot" for the 2nd yet), but we could just keep adding in tropes and bouncing everything together. Lucius and Sirius start swapping bodies uncontrollably, perhaps? There's potential there.

Harry acquires the last Hallow at some point during the series, making him the Master of Death. The series climax is an archetypal battle between life and death, as Malfoy is revealed to have walked through the traps behind the Trio and stolen the Philosopher's stone in first year (insane!Dumbledore wasn't as careful with the protections as cannon Dumbledore), using the elixir to create and control a criminal "Empire of Life." By this point, nobody really cares about Voldemort, who will have been eliminated in a suitably humorous fashion.
