*The Screams Series*, linkffn(3548714;3568551;3662838;3789046;3792581;3887744): truly horrific story

*Spectrum*, linkffn(9561455): another Hermione turned to psycho killer fic.

--------------

While the above fics featured heroes turning into psychos, the following stories had them turning into brutal revolutionaries after repeated betrayals by the Ministry:

*Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, linkffn(10595005), has Hermione and Harry overthrowing the Ministry after Wizengamot passed a tyrannical marriage law. They proceeded to systematically execute everyone who aided and supported Voldemort and the marriage law. Most of the Wizengamot and the Ministry was wiped out as the result, and foreign pureblood regimes were seething to get back at them.

*The Sum of Their Parts*, linkffn(11858167), is similar since the Ministry was still catering to Voldemort purebloods and trying to pass discriminatory laws. The Trio and their friends were getting progressively darker. What started as vigilante justice against remaining Death Eaters eventually morphed into systematic terror after they seized the power.
