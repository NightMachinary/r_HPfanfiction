To be honest, I think it's the only non-prequel story worth telling in HP at this point. In the face of the 21st century and all its surveillance and social networking, the magical world could never stay hidden. That inevitability, combined with some moral revulsion over how the magical world hoards possibly the most valuable resources and knowledge of mankind, would create an anti-Statute faction as reliably as the fall of the Statute itself.
