I have to say that Muggleborns are not necessarily pro Muggles, especially if they had bad experiences in the Muggle world. On the other hand, those growing up in the Muggle world tend to not have this pureblood arrogance and often look for solutions the Muggle way, such as Harry in the Books.

I have this plot idea for some time, in which a Muggleborn decided that enough persecution was enough, and that the existing magical establishment had to be destroyed, with the help of Muggles. Once the magical competition was gone, he could in turn rule over Muggles and push whatever agenda he had in mind.

This Dark Lord officially began this career on September 1st, 1998. Through the application of magic, mostly memory charms, he has built one of the world's most dominant corporation by 2018, with direct access to many world leaders. In addition, he had thousands of Muggleborns dissatisfied with Magical world under his command, bound to him by both magical contracts and Muggle legal means.

In 2022, he felt finally ready to make his opening move. His minions smuggled a thermonuclear device to the site of the Quidditch World Cup and detonated it during its final. Up to 20% of world's magical population were killed instantly. At same time, Muggle governments under his influence moved against all strategic magical sites in their countries, aided by Wizards under his direct command.

Harry, Ginny, Ron, and most of their clan perished in that attack. Hermione and Albus Potter, who didn't like Quidditch, survived and had to carry on the fight. Many Wizards in his employ were appalled by this atrocity and planning to rebel, despite his restrictive magical contracts. Muggles also dawned upon what was happening, and resistance was forming. Meanwhile, surviving Wizards were now faced with difficult choices how to continue in this dangerous new world.
