Just want to point out that while Voldemort and Grindelwald certainly did some bad things, its never stated that they were the only dark wizards/witches to rise to prominence, merely they were the most dangerous or "evil" (JKR word choice there) of all time.

The trouble with history is that when you already know the ending, everything looks obvious at the beginning. "How could people not try to stamp out these dark wizards? They were clearly up to no good before they became major political figures." This is shooting an arrow and painting a bulls-eye around it.

All of the canonical examples of dark wizards, from Voldemort down, do not start off with them enacting a plan to become emperor of the wizarding kind or overthrowing the status quo. Indeed, they appear to start from very small uses of dark magic or experimentation, mainly for some much narrower end. Pettigrew became a dark wizard mainly to preserve himself, and it spiraled from their. Grindelwald experimented with magic until he broke social taboos and/or laws and was ostracized. Riddle held a rather large problem with his thanophobia, so sought a way to make himself immortal.

Any story about a pro-muggle dark wizard rising to power would need to start them in a similar vein. Example, a muggle-born is disenchanted when he discovers he cannot affect any change in the wizarding government without either wealth or status (read: fame). In response, he makes liberal use of mind manipulation (Obliviation, Imperious, etc.) in the muggle world to accrue huge sums of money, which he exchanges for wizard currency. This would give him huge pull in the government, but now that he has already done all that, why stop there? In the immediate post-Deathly Hallows world, the most obvious would be a backlash against prominent members of the government who retained there jobs during the takeover by the Death Eaters. That being said, an idea somewhat similar was done in The Aurors linkffn(The Aurors).

Honestly though, of the trio Hermione has by far the most potential for this. People often mistake her as a by the book follow the rules character, which is not entirely untrue. What they miss is the nature of her personality. Harry has always held some mistrust of authority (Dumbledore aside), so he followed rules when based on his own morality and opinions. While this is problematic in the short term, it means he has personal rules he refuses to break. Hermione has almost the opposite perspective: she follows the rules because she was told it was right. But when her trust in authority wanes, she becomes incredibly vindictive or outright dangerous. When your idea of right and wrong is built on the word of authority figures and books? What happens when it all comes apart at the seams? What happens when you begin to doubt everything you believed? Is it wrong to use dark magic? Is it wrong to manipulate or bribe people?
