In my stories, Grindelwald was like that - he pushed for an "All wizards are equal (and superiour to muggles)" agenda, which appealed to many muggleborns who were discriminated against. After his defeat, there was a backlash against muggleborns, though - since Grindelwald was a dark lord and used the dark arts and cruel, evil means to achieve his goals.
