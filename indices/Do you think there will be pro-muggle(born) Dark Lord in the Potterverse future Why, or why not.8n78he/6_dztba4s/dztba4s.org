I /think/ it's Harry Potter And The Prince Of Slytherin, but there's a throwaway line about how 'Dark Lord' is a political label, and shortly after the war Abraxas Malfoy declared a pro-muggleborn politician a Dark Lord and scraped up enough support for himself as Light Lord in opposition. Said politician, not having nearly enough minions to carry off the Dark Lord role, promptly scarpered and is now an official in the Australian Magical Government, causing embarrassment at international summits.
