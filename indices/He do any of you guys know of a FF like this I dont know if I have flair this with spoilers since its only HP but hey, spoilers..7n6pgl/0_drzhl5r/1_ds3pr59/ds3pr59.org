It may have been done but it has not been done well. Dark Harry threads are on here around once a week and every time I see them none of the Fics are something I would call "great". We don't have the definitive fic or even a few great ones. As much as it is annoying to see edgy dark harry stories, which plague us at every turn, there is a need for well written ones.
