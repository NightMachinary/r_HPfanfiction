Depends on length. I'm still quite sensitive to shoddy writing. But I find I really enjoy novel length (even in real fiction I just prefer longer stories) because I like detail and situations being fleshed out. But ultra long is almost never good.

There are a handful of 200k+ fics that I really enjoy but most are 75-150k.
