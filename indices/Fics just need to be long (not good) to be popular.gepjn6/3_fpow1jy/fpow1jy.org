One of the most important factors in a story's popularity is the frequency/regularity of posting. This is partly down to the sheer volume of fics Harry Potter has. If you're not in the first few pages of a given sorted view, you'll probably not be found by casual readers.

Regular updates helps by simple dint of bumping the story to the top of the most recent updates list. Once you have that following, it gets easier to grow it as the favourites and follows become a self fulfilling prophecy.

It's very hard for one shots to make it big in Harry Potter.
