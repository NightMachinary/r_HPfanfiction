To that I say that, for me at least, that depends more so on the quality of the fic. Don't get me wrong, brevity can definitely be a virtue. Part of the reason Sanitize hits so hard is that we only get, well, /snapshots/ into people's lives rather than full chapters centered on them.

 

On the other hand, if it's a fic I'm rather enjoying things like "bloated" or "too long" are terms that don't really exist. (Though there are definitely fics that could at least be separated into different "books" by year). For me, more great content is more great content. Give me 25k words on the history of the owner of the cafe that the main character frequents (presuming those 25k are as high quality as everything else) There are certain works of fiction, and rarer fanfiction, where I would all but kill for a history textbook of the world/setting. Or, to put it another way, if Lord of the Rings were my cup of tea I'd be the sort to dive into the Silmarillion.

 

I understand not everyone enjoys literature that way and more enjoys the plot or other things that extra exposition, flashbacks and sidetracking impedes. (And I will note that some longfics like Prince of Slytherin, /do/ separate things into books even if it's all one fic posted in one place)

 

As far as length being a "mark of quality" I think part of that is due to the nature of fanfic itself. Given how much of fic is abandoned and incomplete, seeing something that the author made a significant time/effort commitment to is heartening (and encourages the thought that it's less likely to end up abandoned and unfinished) Also, even more than "normal" literature, fanfic is escapist. And when looking for an escape, a fic being able to take you away for days/weeks at a time due to sheer size does have an attractive quality that smaller fics, even if more powerful in their impact, do not.
