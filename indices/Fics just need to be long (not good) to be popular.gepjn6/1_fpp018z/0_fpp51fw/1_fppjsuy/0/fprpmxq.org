I think it depends a bit on the style you're going for, TBH. Conciseness is good, but it's not universal.

Eg, I quite enjoy authors who will meander and go off on asides. Like some of the older French authors often do that - Jules Verne will spend a couple of pages detailing step by step how his protagonists create nitroglycerin from scratch, Victor Hugo will spend page after page on the history of the sewers of Paris, etc. Those asides - or meandering acts - are not strictly necessary to the plot, but adding them in still /adds/ to the work, for those who like that stylistic choice.

Fanfiction can definitely benefit from conciseness, or at the least a better outline of what would happen in future chapters - but I don't think that conciseness is that /only/ way to have good writing. Just depends on the style!

(Edit: for instance, one author I've enjoyed a number of fics by is AngelaStarCat. One of her fics, 'Ruthless', is very much concise compared to the others - and yet, that conciseness makes it less memorable, with fewer moments for the fic to 'breathe' and have character interactions in a way that sinks in a bit more, if that makes sense)
