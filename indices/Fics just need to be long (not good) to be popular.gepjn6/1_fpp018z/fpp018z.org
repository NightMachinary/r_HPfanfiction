A lot of people seem to see how long a fic is as a mark of quality. It's frequently mentioned as a positive when recommending fics like the prince of Slytherin, a marauder's plan and the sacrifices arc.

I like a long fic, but honestly brevity is a virtue. When a fic takes a million words to get to third year it's just bloated in my opinion. There's probably a lot of unnecessary padding that an editor would cut.
