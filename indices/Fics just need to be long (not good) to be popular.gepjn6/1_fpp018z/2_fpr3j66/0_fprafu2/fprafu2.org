I didn't read far into that one; the "claiming family magic" thing and Regulus leaving a letter that explained everything seemed a bit off, along with the Dumbledore-bashing. But to each his own.

If you're interested in a long Sirius-centric story that I do very much like, there's linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). It's not about "Lord Black", it's about Padfoot. The premise is that he escapes from prison with accidental magic when Harry is eight, doesn't have any leads on Peter, so instead he checks on Harry and finds that he's unhappy. So Padfoot offers to take him - while still on the run, and now everyone including Remus and Dumbledore thinks that he's kidnapped Harry. Watching him do his flawed but sincere best to raise James' son, and watching young Harry blossom in the care of someone who actually wants him, is really sweet. And there's no one better to tell Harry stories about his parents.
