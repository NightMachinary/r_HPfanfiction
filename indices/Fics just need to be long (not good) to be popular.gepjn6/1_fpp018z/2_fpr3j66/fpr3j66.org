Speaking of A Marauder's Plan, I started reading it recently, and I am... underwhelmed? I'm on chapter 23, and I'm still waiting for it to get good. Does it get better later on?

It's pretty well-written, it's just that Sirius is basically a Gary Stu at this point, Dumbledore is ridiculously dumbed down, Ron bashing is clearly on the horizon, and everything is going way too smoothly. And the author has been making amateur mistakes such as describing people's clothing in detail. That alone almost made me give up on the story, but I keep expecting it to get better.

Am I wasting my time?
