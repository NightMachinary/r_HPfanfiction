Honestly I'd rather get invested in a story and have it occupy me over the course of several days rather than pick something up for just a few hours and then be done and have to spend time finding something else. The more time I'm looking, the less time I'm reading. My average reading speed is somewhere in the 450-500 WPM range, so a 100k fic will still take up less than 4 hours of my time.
