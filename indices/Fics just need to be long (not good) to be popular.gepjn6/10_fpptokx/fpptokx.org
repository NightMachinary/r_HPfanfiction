Long form story telling is hard and a fic might genuinely be good if you only read it a chapter a week instead of binging it all at once. The dificulty also makes it to where even if youre fic is garbage if its long enough no one will really call you on it and if your ability improves with time/posts/chapters then you can be considered recomended and good with literal garbage begenings. A good example of this I believe is basilik born if Im remembering the fics name correctly, its a good fic eventually but the first dozen chapters are terrible and troupey.

So yes, but there are reasons why and the harry potter fandom had enough fic saturation to actually have fics proving it to be possible to make bad fics good which only spured on others to what we have today.
