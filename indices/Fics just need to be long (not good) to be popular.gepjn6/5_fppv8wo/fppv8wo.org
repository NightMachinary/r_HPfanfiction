I remember the heyday of HP fanfic between GOF and OOTP. At the time you had to set the filter at ffnet to fics that were at least 10k words, otherwise you would be swamped with utter drivel. Fics that were nothing but authors notes riddled with grammar and spelling errors and writing that made your brain bleed. It was that bad. Yes, you missed out on a few good one-shots this way, but it was the only way to find fics that were actually worth reading.

Fictionalley was a saving grace bc the FA team insisted upon proper grammer, spellchecking and upon something resembling a plot or your fic would not get uploaded. Almost all the fics under 10k that I liked I found on FA at the time.

Nevertheless the damage was already done, the trend to sort ffnet by the length of fic and weed out anything under 10k or later 20k persisted.

Add in the fact that longer fics get more opportunities to be seen through updates and it is a perfect storm.
