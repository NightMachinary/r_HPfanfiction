Seconded. There was a long fic (can't remember exactly how long, but it's pretty famous and probably the top recommendation for this shop) I first read when I was 15-ish and thought it was utter brilliance. Went back to read it several years a later and couldn't get past two chapters due to clumsy writing, lazy world building, and too-fast pacing that made the character development feel ridiculous.
