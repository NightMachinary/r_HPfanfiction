I think, particularly the older ones, were read by younger people with (often!) lower standards of literature, or by people who were happy to overlook errors in favour of their favourite tropes/a long read. A couple of my friends specifically sought out badly written fics for a good laugh and since it met what they wanted, reviewed it well. Then, the more these fics got rec'd the higher up they became on most rated/reviewed lists and so on.

I'd say I was genuinely astounded by what passes for well written in the minds on some people, but I've had the misfortune of stumbling upon stuff I once loved. It drives the fear into my heart when recommending stuff to other people.

As for the stuff I wrote, well - suffice to say that I have entirely different accounts so that I need never be associated with it. (Not that my fic was ever popular, just bad.)
