Yes and no. A fic can be shitty and long. However, a longer fic can also mean that an author spent more time on it, meaning taking the whole writing thing more seriously.

I think, in general, on average, longer fics are typically of higher quality. This is obviously not always true, but still. There is also the fact that many people want to read longer fics not strictly because they're of a higher quality, but because they want more story to go through than, say, a 5-chapter 20k-word fic would have.

Personally when I am looking for something specific, I typically filter out shorter fics. Not because I think longer fics are automatically better (even if I do think the average is better), but because I want a longer story to get invested in. However, if a fic is too long without anything happen, I get tired of it and stop reading partway through.
