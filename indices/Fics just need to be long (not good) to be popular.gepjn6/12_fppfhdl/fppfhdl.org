I've found that the frequency of updates boosts the reader count to ridiculous levels, and I know this from 2 now deleted works of mine. The first of which racked up about 100 favourites on ffn.net, and it was pure garbage, barely edited, with no pacing. But the one that I'd like to expand on in the future ended up with about 15 favourites, because it was posted at a rate of about a chapter every 2 weeks, as opposed to every 3 days or so
