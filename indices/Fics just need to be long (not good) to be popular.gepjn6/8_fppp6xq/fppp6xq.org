I've also had a large number of fics that I've really liked in the beginning, I've favorites and followed.... And then they devolve into utter shit that I'm far too lazy to remove from the favorite/follow list. Unfortunately this means my email gets a bunch of notifications with fictions that I have no intention of ever reading again. One day I'll go and clean things up.

I get loving the longer fics, they provide a longer escape, but quality is still important
