well not necessarily i was scrolling through updated cuz im procrastinating for finals and theres tons that are long as shit and no one interacts with. like i saw one near 200k words with 40 fav/follows and 10 comments, ive no idea how that person keeps going tbh. that has got to be demoralizing as hell but i applaud them for their dedication and

However, in a general sense i agree which i why i tend not to use the search by favorites cuz as long as the writing is absolute dogshit a long running story will get more attention than something that is higher quality but posted in larger less frequent samples. it is also that fact that older stories that are quite out of date for current reading standards are up at the top because they've just had more time to acquire the likes.
