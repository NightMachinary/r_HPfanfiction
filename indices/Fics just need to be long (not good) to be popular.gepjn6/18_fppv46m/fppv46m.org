I think this also depends on your definition of good quality. Does quality depend on grammatical aspects and the syntax? Does quality depend on how characters act compared to canon? Is quality dependent on which tropes, pairings, and general personal preferences?

For example, I have had a few really lengthy fics recommended to me (told they were very good) but I didn't like them because of the pairings. But, my subjective view of the story doesn't mean it wasn't well written.
