Most fics are badly written - but I think the longer ones that are popular also hit some areas that a good chunk of people like reading (eg, super powerful Harry). It doesn't matter if it's poorly written - or at least, that /I/ don't like the writing - it still scratches that itch for some people.

The advantage of a longer work is that, if you enjoy it, there's a lot more behind it. And since in fanfiction, it's often about the characters - having a more stretched out period for more interactions is nice.

One-shots have the disadvantage, at least for me, of leaving me hanging a lot of the time. There are some great one-shots out there - but every time, they kind of leave me wanting some more, if the character interpretation are interesting enough.
