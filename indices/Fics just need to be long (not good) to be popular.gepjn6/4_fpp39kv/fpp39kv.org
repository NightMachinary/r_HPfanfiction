I don't think this is necessarily the case. A lot of fanfic in other fandoms has a tradition of drabbles, short romance oneshots, etc. You can find that in HP, but there's also been a very long tradition of writing actual novels to match (or try to better) the books.

Obviously, the more updates someone posts, the more opportunities they get to earn reviews. There are plenty of oneshots like linkffn(Cauterize) that are very popular. It's hard to build a following around a oneshot though.

That said, you have a point that there are quite a few extremely long fics with a lot of reviews and favorites that really aren't very good, either for just bad writing or complete lack of structure.
