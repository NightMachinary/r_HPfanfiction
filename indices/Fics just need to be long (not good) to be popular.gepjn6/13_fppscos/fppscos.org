My favourite part of reading long fics is actually watching the author grow as a writer. Usually, the writing starts off as quite average and then, then it just blossoms. They don't become a god of writing, but after writing however many words, most people learn something.

Just saying, the first two parts od Prince of Slytherin are pretty average, the last (most recent) part though, is very good.
