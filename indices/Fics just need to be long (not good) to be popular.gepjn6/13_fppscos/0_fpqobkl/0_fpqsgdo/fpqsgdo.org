Usually, to be honest, I read the first couple of chapters. An author with a good plot, for me, can /ususally/ trump writing.

If the first couple of chapters don't do it, I skip to the middle. The prince of slytherin looked good, so that is what I did. That is actually where I started. After writing 500k words, I don't know if there is any way someone can become anything but a good author.

My Immortal notwithstanding.
