I've always felt the same way as well. I haven't been able to enjoy /so many/ classic fics in the fandom because I felt they were always so long-drawn-out and repetitive. It really does feel like quantity over quality (which I do get to a degree, since fics that are updated more appear more often in readers' "feed"). There are some good fics and good authors that have relatively overlooked works because they don't write long fics.

Personally, even as a fast reader, I am hardly ever able to stomach fics with a word count 120k+.

And thank you for making this post. It's nice to know I'm not alone in feeling this way.
