I think it depends what you're after.

Back when I was first digging into fanfics, length was an important variable because I wanted something that would keep me occupied for a while.

When I see people asking for long fics, I feel like that's what's going on. They want to find something that they (a) like and (b) don't have to let go of quickly.

Now... I have things I should be doing and haven't done at all so short is good.
