Yes and no.

Yes, because some longer fics are a complete retelling of the books with having either a butterfly effect, or a perspective change which alters how the story happens completely. At their core is the original books, and they're insanely long so covering them in under 200,000 words is an absolute achievement. Philosopher's Stone alone is 90,000 words, so widdling all 8 books down without feeling rushed is a feat in itself. Longfics can be brilliant and incredibly well written, so that's where the popularity stems from for a large portion.

No, because some stories are new concepts like marriage law fics, or stories that have less of a focus on fantasy and are more about the romantic pairing. Those really have no right to be so long, the average length of a romance novel is about 60,000-80,000 words.A lot of those stories WAY over 200,000 words, and very plot-light, so I can see your point of quantity vs. quality.

There's so many other factors to consider when talking about the popularity of a story, too. It really varies from story to story.
