I'm going to point to my favourite part of [[/u/SilverCookieDust]]'s post in a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3qutjw/unusual_bits_of_fanon_you_like/][similar thread]].

  The Marauder era was the last generation of children allowed to do magic at home before turning seventeen. This is in very large part due to Voldemort recruiting underage wizards (Regulus was taken when he was only 16) so the Ministry banned underage magic to make youngsters less desirable. (As for canon-compatibility: Petunia mentions Lily coming home and turning tea cups into rats, and Sirius used Permanent Sticking Charms in his bedroom at Grimmauld Place, which he left at the age of sixteen.)
