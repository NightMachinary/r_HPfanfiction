Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't it stated in the books that the ministry can't detect who did magic, just where it was done. So underage wizards living in a magical home can do magic and no one will know it was them? Just like Harry got blamed for Dobby's magic... it would explain why Sirius could use magic at home and at the same time make the rule useless when it came to Voldemort recruiting underage wizards.

I do realize it still doesn't explain how Lily could do magic at home, since she was muggle-born.
