The "there was a war" thing wasn't literal, it was a reversal of your assertion that there was a war and the wizards lost.

The point is that there wasn't a war because there didn't need to be. Wizards don't work in that way. Wizards don't /need/ a war to gain control of Muggles - they can be in control of Muggles without any Muggle ever realising.

  Its well within the realm of possibilities that this rearranged phone call got some heads rolling, if, lets say, MI5 got wind of it later on.

Except we know it didn't. Recall that the HBP chapter in question was from the Muggle Prime Minister's point of view, and we know that said PM mentally agreed with Fudge when Fudge said he wouldn't ever mention the existence of wizards to anyone.

With regards to your other points, you're thinking too much like a Muggle. What do wizards actually want? Territory and natural resources mean nothing to wizards. Those are Muggle concerns. It seems to me that what wizards want more than anything else is to be left alone by Muggles and to be free to practice magic as they like. The Statute of Secrecy achieves that perfectly, especially when combined by the clear level of influence magical governments have over Muggle ones.

I think we know a lot more about canon than you think we do. Especially with Pottermore etc (canon is not subjective - it's a pretty well defined concept referring to authoritative published works. Pottermore is published, therefore it is canon).
