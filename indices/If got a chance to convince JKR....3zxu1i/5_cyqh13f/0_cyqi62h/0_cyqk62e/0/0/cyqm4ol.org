  practice magic as they like

  The Statute of Secrecy achieves that perfectly

As much as I agree with the point that there doesn't need to be a history of war, this is just not true. The Statute of Secrecy is extremely limiting to wizards and a breach of it takes herculean efforts to right again. As a matter of fact, the wizarding world, or better, its secrecy builds on two psychological phenomenons. Muggles who witness magic will go to all kinds of lengths to include the seen into their known facts of the world, since I do not believe that Obliviators can catch every single witness, every time. On the other hand people like the PM keep silent out of fear to lose face.

I agree on much you say, but I will stand to the point that in theory, you could destroy any and all assumptions of both of us by simply furthering the depth of worldbuilding in these matters. I've read amazing explanations for both cases in fanfiction.

To the point of canon, while there are definitions, its not well defined by any means the moment you disregard Urban Dictionary. Questions like what happens if you publish using a new medium, hang over the concept. Medium having rather complex topics like accessibility, status and importance of information within it. Many, and I count myself among them, feel that canon is defined by the original work and everything within the same line of medium. In the case of Harry Potter, that means the books and only those. Then you have the question of the authority of the author. When does something cease to be within the authors authority and when does it begin to be subject of many influences? The rest delves deep into media-theory, but the point stands that canon is, while not completely subjective, definitely a flexible definition. I myself stand to the opinion that canon is the line of work within the same medium from first to last part because after it, knowledge begins to become fragmented and less accessible. I would take the bet that given a simple poll of "who were James Potters parents" a majority of average fanfiction readers would write "Charlus and Dorea Potter", which is false, as Pottermore (and the wikia, finally) tells us (to emphasize the point of authority over information).

Anyway, thanks for the discussion up until the point. Works better than coffee in the morning to wake the grey matter up.
