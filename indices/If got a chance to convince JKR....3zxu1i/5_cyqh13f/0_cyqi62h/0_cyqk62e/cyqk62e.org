The point of the thread was to name something we'd like to see in canon that is (in my case sometimes) fanon. Its a lot like vampires in HP, for example. We know close to nothing beyond the surface since the worldbuilding just stops there. Everything we dig up are merely indications to a point. In my case, or the case of many, the names, actions and demeanor of wizarding institutions, positions and culture indicate a defeated, or at least inferior position.

Its well within the realm of possibilities that this rearranged phone call got some heads rolling, if, lets say, MI5 got wind of it later on.

Also, I'm pretty sure Rowling never mentioned a war between muggles and wizards. If so, then please tell me in which book. There are some mentions of conflicts in Pottermore, mostly the Witch Hunts, but that site is already non-canon for some (me included). However, even if there was, and I think thats a rather heavy weight argument, if wizards truly won, why are /they/ hiding? If there was a war, then the muggles were enemies. Why are there still muggles if the wizards survived? Why not get rid of the thread or enslave them? Why is the Vatican still standing? The tools are there in your grasp. Winning a war and then giving up on your territory, privileges and control does not sound like something a winner would do. It sounds more like North Korean "Communism won"-propaganda.

What if Bagshot didn't really write "A history of magic" but a propaganda piece supporting wizard superiority? What if Ralston Potter was an allie of the muggles and pushed the Statute to cripple wizarding culture once and for all with the shackles of secrecy?

Or, lets turn this thing completely around. What if the ICW is the true power behind the world? What if the Loge 322, the Rothschilds and the Freemasons are but tools to control the muggles and keep them in check? What if religion and culture are just there to keep the eyes of muggles away from wizard kind?

Anyway, as I said, we could debate and argue all we want, in the end you could take whatever you like and explain away the stuff that contradicts it with minutes worth of worldbuilding. Canon just lacks the hard facts and the necessary depth in these things..
