I thought my condensed mockery of JK's PC-crowd pandering behavior was much funnier than the stupid pun. Using buzzwords like transpositive and other PC terminology would indeed be the correct way to pander Mpreg towards JK. Harriet Potter, the proud trans pre op boy who lived, performing the best real world equivalent of mpregging. The tumblr people would explode twitter with #Pregboy and #BuyHarryPotterProductsBecauseItsSoooProgressive #FantasticalBeasts
