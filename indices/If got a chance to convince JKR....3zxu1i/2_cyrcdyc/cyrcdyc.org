That the reason the Marauder's Map did not detect Peter Pettigrew before the events of Prisoner of Azkaban was because Peter lost himself to being a rat and thus the map did not detect him as a human, and after Sirius's escape he was too self-conscious to be able to do that anymore.

Also, that the discrepancy between the value of the Galleon and what we'd think it should be worth is because the Galleon itself is worth its value in gold but the wizards are still behind the times and using the old Pound for the exchange, one that has the value of a pound of silver. And the coins themselves are charmed or whatever the goblin equivalent of it is so that muggles do not see the coin as anything more than a metal cap or a standard none-to-low--value coin that is merely gold-like in colour, stopping anyone who had ever considered selling it for its worth in gold to the muggles.
