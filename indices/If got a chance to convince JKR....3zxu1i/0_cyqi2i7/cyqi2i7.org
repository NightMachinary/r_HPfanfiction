I'd probably try to sort out the wizarding population numbers and fix it to ~10,000 and have everything JKR wrote work with that number.

The most obvious way this would show is probably through the Aurors (assuming a post-Hogwarts HP fic would focus on Harry as an Auror). With a small wizarding population there shouldn't be many Aurors at all - like, maybe 10 of them.

Alternatively:

Arthur Weasley has an old wizarding spaceship mixed in with all the junk in his shed. In the 1500s it was fashionable for wizards to holiday on the moon, but soon enough wizards got bored of the idea. Why go into space when the Earth is so much more interesting? And if you want to study space, you can do that just as well from Earth as from the Moon. The idea of space travel is thus considered rather old-fashioned and archaic by wizards.
