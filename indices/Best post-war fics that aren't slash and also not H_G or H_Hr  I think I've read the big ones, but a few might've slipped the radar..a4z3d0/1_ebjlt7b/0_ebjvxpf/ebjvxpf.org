My problem with Harry/Ginny is its either canon-like, which is shit and boring, or way too OOC to me. I like Ginny as a side character, or as an ex-wife/gf that isn't that tropey shit of jealousy and potion-mistress crap. There are a few that I enjoyed, mostly fics where Harry and Ginny either never met in school, or when he's not the BWL, which is rare. But I think it mostly comes down to her canon personality. She's too prone to anger to my taste. About your suggestion, even if it isn't Hermione-centric, I'm assuming she's a MC, so idk. How is her personality there? PTSD, war veteran mind-set, or is it angsty-filled drama?
