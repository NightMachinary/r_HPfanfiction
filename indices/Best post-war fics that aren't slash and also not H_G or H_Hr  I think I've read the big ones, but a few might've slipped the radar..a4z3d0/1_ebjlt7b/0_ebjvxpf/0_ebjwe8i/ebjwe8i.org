Yeah, she is a main in the story.

There is quite a bit of drama, and Hermione and Ron take turns being the caregiver for each other.

Hermione's main concerns in the story are taking care of Ron after Fred died (while grieving herself), searching for her parents (and the guilt that comes with it), and dealing with the her trauma after being tortured.

It's not overly heavy with PTSD/veteran themes, focusing more on grief, family and love, which are big themes in canon as well.

I find most Harry/Ginny fics boring too, but they are definitely only in the background here, and are absent after Ron and Hermione leave for Australia.
