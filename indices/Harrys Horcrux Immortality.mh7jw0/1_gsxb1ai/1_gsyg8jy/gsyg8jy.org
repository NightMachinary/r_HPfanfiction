Going off of Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel in the DoM, the killing curse can cause physical damage to objects though. I had to check my copy and see, but Dumbledore blocks it with stuff several times.

1. Golden wizard statue - bounced off harmlessly
2. One armed centaur statue - burst into millions of pieces
3. Fawkes - died and got reborn

I don't know why it didn't break the first statue and only the second. So, maybe it can break a horcrux?
