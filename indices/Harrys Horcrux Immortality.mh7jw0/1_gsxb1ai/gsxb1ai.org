As explained in DH, Horcruxes are not almost indestructible because they are Horcruxes. Their resilience comes from the fact that Dark Wizards first enchant a "suitable container" (by adding all the protections they can think of) before putting their soul inside. Since Harry doesn't have any of this protections, he is just as durable as any other wizard (as show by all the injuries he suffer throughout the series), and could be killed by the same things as them.

Also, it is a personal opinion, but I don't think the Killing Curse would work on a "normal" Horcrux. It worked on Harry because he was "alive", and it would probably also have worked on Nagini, but since the other are not truly "alive", and the Killing Curse would not be able to break their container, I don't think it would work.

And, if anything else than Voldemort had killed Harry, I think he would just have died normaly, and the Horcruxe with him. Dumbledore whole plan in DH with Harry sacrifice was not there to destroy the Horcrux, but to give Harry a chance to survive the experience (though I kinda like the idea of a dead Harry being possessed by the Scarcrux).

PS : I can't remember the name, but I remember seeing a fic that plays with this idea, with a child Harry that discovers he is kinda immortal and makes experiences about it.
