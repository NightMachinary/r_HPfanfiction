Set in the third book, with a tactfully done low-level H/Hr ship. A good little mystery, with the Mirror playing a key role.

A crossover with Dr Who. A Weeping Angel manages to find its way, via Harry's boggart, into Hogwarts. Good fun, effectively captures the feeling of a Dr Who episode in terms of pacing and plot.
