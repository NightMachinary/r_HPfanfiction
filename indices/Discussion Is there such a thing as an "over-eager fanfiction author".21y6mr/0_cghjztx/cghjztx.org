It makes you prolific, which makes those of us posting at 1 chapter or story per season look like lazy turtles. If the reviewer was trying to calm you down without giving you something else to do with your focus - like spelling and grammar checks - it's probably because you're making him/her feel bad.

Post as you feel ready. If you're getting a lot of Beta offers because your readership is wincing at the lack of edits, accept a few and see if they help.
