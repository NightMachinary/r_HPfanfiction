She hasn't done much yet in The Prince of Slytherin, but she was revealed to be a secret agent (arguably a spoiler, but I don't think it'd ruin anything since I can't think of any events that occur prior to its reveal that are directly related to it) so she'll definitely be more competent and involved than in canon
