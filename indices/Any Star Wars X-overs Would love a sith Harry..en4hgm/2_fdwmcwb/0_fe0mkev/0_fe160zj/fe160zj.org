Slowly getting sequel to Senju Naruto written. Currently only on chapter 7, need at least 12 before publishing (to ensure regular posting schedule).

And thanks for the compliment.

:D

Edit - if you enjoyed my Institute Saga, check out TWWNN's Last Son series ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3228742/1/The-Last-Son-Book-One-Gatherings][Book 1]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3310696/1/The-Last-Son-Book-Two-Reckonings][Book 2]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4009890/1/The-Last-Son-Book-Three-Changes][Book 3]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8462837/1/The-Last-Son-Book-Four-Destinies][Book 4]]). It's got more characters, a better plot, longer chapters and is, IMHO, just written better.
