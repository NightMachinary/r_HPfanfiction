Now that's an interesting thing to think about- why they spoil Dudley. I don't just think it's an only child thing. I've always thought a lot of parents spoil their kids because they're lazy, or because they're so narcissistic that they see themselves in their kids and so can't see the bad. For me, I think that it's a little strange that they treated Harry so badly, because they are all about appearances. Even though Petunia hate Lily, i think it would have been somewhat logical for her to decide to adapt him to THEIR way of life and fitting in, putting Harry and Dudley on more equal footing, for the sake of appearances if nothing else.
