I really like linkffn(The Divide by Beedle), which centers on twin OC girls that are Hugo Weasley's age. Though it is set during their first few years at Hogwarts, there's not much focus on the actual schooling. It does feature several canon characters, but it's really about the OCs, and there's a bunch of fun worldbuilding and traveling to a few interesting places.
