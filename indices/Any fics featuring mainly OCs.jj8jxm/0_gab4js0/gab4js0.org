I'm gonna recommend two, one is my favourite fic at the moment and the other one is actually mine and it actually adheres to your criteria better!

My own fic contains two OCs, it's an AU and you could say they are co-protagonist with Harry, Sirius and Remus. There also no romance between OC and Canon characters.\\

And the other one is a personal favourite, although the OC is technically an existing character, Amy Benson, it explores the years in which Tom went to school. It's very well made and it has the worldbuilding you might like!\\
