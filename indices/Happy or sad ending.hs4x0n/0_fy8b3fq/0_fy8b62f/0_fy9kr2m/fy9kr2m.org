I read angst with a happy ending, but if a fic is depressing with no payoff I skip it. Pure fluff is too boring to read for longer than a one shot, just like pure angst for the sake of suffering is too dark. I do consume other media with sadder/bittersweet endings but fanfiction is a happy place. Not sure how popular my viewpoint is though.

Some authors do alternate endings so you could always write both? I've seen it done on ao3 anyway.
