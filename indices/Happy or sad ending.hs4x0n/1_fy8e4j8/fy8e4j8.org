In my opinion... I'd say it depends on your genre, and it depends on what, artistically, it means for that character to die.

You mentioned in another comment that your story is already an angst-like genre, so that's good. As for the second point, you really just have to consider the pros and cons from a story standpoint. Is that death going to mean something? Will that death inspire change in the story/characters? Is that death going to support a central theme of your work? Is it logically feasible for that character to survive that situation, or is it going to read as contrived if you let them survive?

Conversely, if that character lives, will they meaningfully contribute to the message you're trying to convey? Will they influence the story/characters by staying alive? Will they reinforce ideas you have previously introduced?

In my opinion, /nobody/ likes when a main character dies. But moments of tragedy become poignant when they have lasting impact both in universe and out. So it's a matter of artistic integrity and a matter of priorities: would you rather preserve the message of your story as you think it should be told, or would you rather make your audience happy?

I can't really tell you which one to choose - neither is objectively wrong or right. You don't owe your audience a happy ending when it comes to your own work of art, and there's equally nothing wrong with wanting to preserve the original essence of your story as you first wrote it. But it just depends on your preference with how you want to engage with your audience, and, if it comes down to it, what will leave you with the fewest regrets.
