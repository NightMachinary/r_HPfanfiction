I prefer the happy ending. Especially in romance centric fixes which is what I usually read. Plus I really love for an epilogue that shows harry/? and what happened after the ending ie sending their kids off to hogwarts like in the books or just the couple getting married,find out their pregnant, having the kid and the family getting together knowing who ended up together all that jazz
