I recommend you consider checking out the collected works of [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/stories.php?psid=473][St. Margarets]]. She has several novel-length stories that are largely canon-compliant (though extend the canon world delightfully) as well as a number of shorter stories. All are of very high quality (for fanfiction).
