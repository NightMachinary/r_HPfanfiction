Yeah that's what I'm talking about. However, skimming quickly through it, it doesn't really look like there is a single bigger story to it although he does have a few stories with a lot of chapters, I'll probably read those then maybe later read the other stuff.\\
I'm most definitely looking for longer stories not just a single chapter.\\
Edit: Can you download the stories in PDF format or something from that website?
