He [[https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#safe=off&q=northumbrian+harry+potter][cross-posts]] to archiveofourown.org, harrypotterfanfiction.com, thequidditchpitch.org, mugglenet and his own livejournal

I'd say start with [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1623053][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]] and then, once you're hooked like it's opium, explore the smaller but complete and related stories.
