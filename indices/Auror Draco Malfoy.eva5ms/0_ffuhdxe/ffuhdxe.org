It's pretty much just your standard 'letting off the war criminal because he's pretty' Draco in leather pants tripe. He's usually an auror because Harry is an auror and the only reason for those two to get close enough to bang is proximity.

If I had to come up with an actual explanation, I'd go with the Malfoy name being ruined by their genocidal bastard-hood and their political positions being lost, then him taking the Auror position as a show of 'I'm doing my part for the community!' that he hates in private but praises in public - politics and all that.
