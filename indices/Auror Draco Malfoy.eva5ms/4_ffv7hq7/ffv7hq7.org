In my opinion its quite possible. I mean he was child who idealized his father too much and believed everything what he told him . And he was in the war before understanding what it mean for his future and for him. He was quite mess in fifth year and later didn't have a way out.

So after war it would be understandable that he want be better and do something for himself.

And we cannot forgot that Harry was auror too. Of course he will follow "scarhead" only for possibility to piss him of. :D
