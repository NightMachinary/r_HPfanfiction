It truthfully depends on how much the ministry is changed after the war. if it is the same as before with all the bigotry and corruption I can definitley see him being an Auror as it would also help him raise the malfoy rep if he is shown to be putting "bad guys" away

if it has changed then I dont see it happening because of the shit he pulled during the war even if he got off he still took the dark mark and has shown that he isn't going to do the right thing if it conflicts with his personal loyalties
