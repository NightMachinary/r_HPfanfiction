I agree that people change. However people don't do complete 180 either. I'm not saying he can't be a good person - I do believe he will turn for the better!

What we know of his character from the books I find it unlikely. It is not a job that garners any real respect from high society, it is unlikely to be very well salaried job, carries huge risks for death and injury, requires dedication to helping other people, would undoubtedly bring him in conflict with family and social circles he is part of.

Also I've read a story where he wasn't an Auror, but worked as a consultant and aided them in various cases. I think that idea worked very well.
