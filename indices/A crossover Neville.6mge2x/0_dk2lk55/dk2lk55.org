There was an excellent and pretty long one where Neville and Augusta are both transported to LOTR middle earth, each in a different place. Neville went on purpose to go a-heroing (with Dumbledore's help I think) but Augusta is sent there too by mistake because of some blunder of Neville's.

I think I recall Augusta threatening an orc to act as her guide (after ordering him to take a thorough bath in the river because he stank), because she supposed that Neville was also in middle earth and wanted to find him. Neville was either in Rohan or Gondor.

I think it was removed from fanfiction.net, but if anyone has a link to it in some other site I'd love to read it again! It was one of the best crossovers out there, and Neville and Augusta are never used in most fics.
