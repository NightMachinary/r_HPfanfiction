There is the fanfic where Harry is raised by Deadpool and an accident with a wand caused Neville to be transported to Asgard where he is trained by the gods. ffnet(Thinking in Little Green Boxes) This is mostly a side gag though. Not sure if that is what you´ve been looking for. There is also The Long Game by inwardtransience, where he´s also quite badass but again he is a side character ffnet(The Long Game)
