Also thank any moderator who didn't want a second thread on this topic.. even though I was talking about a totally different thing. This was not an update thread, it was a discussion thread... Goddamn it... I got only 1 response from someone who actually had some criticism about the story, due to it's slow update speed. Why was it so bad to have 2 different threads, which had 2 different goals?
