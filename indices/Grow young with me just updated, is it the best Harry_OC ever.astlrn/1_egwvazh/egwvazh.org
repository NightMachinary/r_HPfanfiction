If I'm going to be completely honest, it's a difficult fic for the reason that it takes awhile to update. I really get it though, life gets n the way, writersblock may occur and it simply takes time to keep up the quality.

That said, it's difficult to keep following the story because of the gaps in updating gets me out of it; I usually have to reread acouple of chapters ebery time to remember where the story was.

However I'm still really glad that it's updated and hopefully soonI'll have the time to get invested again and maybe reread it from the beginning
