Yeah, I get what you mean. I had to reread the story 3 times, due to the slow updates, before I remembered what happened and didn't have to reread it every time. Still, I genuinely believe it's worth it. The characterisation is on point. Literally every single person has a personality, even Ron has one, which is super difficult and very rare in Post-Hogwarts fics, in fics in general to be honest.
