I generally make the same two assumptions as your title but not the rest.

I usually assume fanfics writers are female except for the aforementioned harem fics, blow-by-blow battle scenes or play-by-play sport scenes. If the fic contains those, I'm going to lean male. And skim them until the actual story starts back up, because they almost never add anything that couldn't be summarized in one paragraph (basically, who's dead and who's badly injured, both of which could be covered in a post-battle/game scene).
