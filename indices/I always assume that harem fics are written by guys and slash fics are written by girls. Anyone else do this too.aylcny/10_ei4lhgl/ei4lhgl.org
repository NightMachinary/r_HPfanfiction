Badly written slash: teenage girl. Badly written harem: teenage boy.

Stories that involve a lot of physical affection, not of a sexual kind: grandparents or housewives.

Stories that describe Harry the eleven year old: parents/grandparents.

Extremely competent teachers: real life Teachers.

It's a whole lot easier for me to not judge on stereotypes though.
