As a male writer, who does Harems but tries to actually make them meaninful relationships... I'm torn here.

But I want to point out what I notice, that not everyone mentions.

Harry is not really seen interacting with many boys his age, other than Ron. He lives with Neville, Dean, and Seamus for most of a year and barely talks to them. Even Neville who joined him the DoM debacle doesn't get much screen time.

What we do see is Harry interacting with Hermione a lot, Ginny to an extent. Mentions of Angelina, Alicia and Katie. Luna, Cho, etc etc etc.

Harry has (seemingly) a bad time with guys his own age, probably due to his interactions with Dudley. He connects more with women, having been somewhat immasculated and emotionally starved his whole life. He has more female friends mentioned throughout the books than male friends.

So Harry having a lot of deep conversations with women, showing emotion more than a normal teen boy, etc etc etc... I think it all makes sense. So even as a male writer, even in a non harem situation...it just makes sense to me that he is surrounded by women; and those women are all probably interested in being his significant other (and have a better chance actually being his friends first).

But I am not a typical guy I guess. I try to balance my fics to be smutty with explosions, but plenty of actual characterization and relationships and fluff.
