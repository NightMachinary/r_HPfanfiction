I have my own stereotype-based assumptions, but they're more about style than specifics of plot. Fics which are mostly about wizards shooting big loads of spells out of their wands are, I assume, written by males. Fics which are mostly about characters sighing longingly at each other from across the room are, I assume, written by females.

My favorite fics are the ones in which I can't tell the author's gender, since they're stories that don't fit into these boring, narrow stereotypes.
