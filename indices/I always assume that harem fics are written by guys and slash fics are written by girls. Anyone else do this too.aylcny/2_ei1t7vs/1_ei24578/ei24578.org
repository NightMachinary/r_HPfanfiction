Yes, I agree, at least on the first two (I haven't read enough fics with main H/G to form an opinion there). Ron and Ginny bashing is mostly contained to indie/super Harry genre (which is mostly male), Harry/Hermione (which has a lot of guys write) and, in case of Ron, some Dramione and Slytherin Harry fics.

Now, I rarely see Ron bashed in slash, for example, which has predominantly female writers, and Ginny-bashing trend died long ago there. Unless Ron interferes with the ship, female writers tend to portray him positively, while some guys are happy to throw him under the bus in emo-Harry powerwanks.
