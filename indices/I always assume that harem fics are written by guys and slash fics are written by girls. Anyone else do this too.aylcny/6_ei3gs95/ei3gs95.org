I usually just assume everything is written by women. I was introduced to Harry Potter fanfiction through HPFF and their forums, which seemed to skew female.

But generelly, now that I've been introduced to this subreddit and seen how popular Harry-centric fics are, I tend to assume Harry-centric fics are more likely to be written by men, because they seem to be MUCH more popular here than in any other Harry Potter fanfiction forum I've lurked in (through trends come and go a lot too).
