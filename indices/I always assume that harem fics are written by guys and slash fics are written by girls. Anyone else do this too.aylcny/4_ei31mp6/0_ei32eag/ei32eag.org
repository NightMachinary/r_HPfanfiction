Tonks is the one character where I get a strong male/female vibe, at least if romance is touched on at all.

A female writer will almost always have an incident in her past where she had a boyfriend who was into her because he could ask her to morph out his fantasies and it left her feeling a bit unseen/used. So she chose her romances more carefully going forward.

A male writer will not--- she'll be 100% cool with everything morphing entails and never had a negative experience with being objectified. Because she's so cool and laid back she can't have feelings about being objectified.
