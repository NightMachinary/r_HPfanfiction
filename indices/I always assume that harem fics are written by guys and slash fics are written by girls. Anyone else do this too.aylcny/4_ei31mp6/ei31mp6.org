I generally assume that Harry/Tonks is written by a male writer if the story is at all light and fluffy.

Ditto Harry/Fleur if it's not got a lot of set up.

I mean, it's one thing if it's set ten years out of Hogwarts or something, but when Harry's a teenager, the age gap renders it both improbable and skeevy. It takes effort to get them into the same story. Most people don't bother unless they really want to imagine them in a sexual situation.
