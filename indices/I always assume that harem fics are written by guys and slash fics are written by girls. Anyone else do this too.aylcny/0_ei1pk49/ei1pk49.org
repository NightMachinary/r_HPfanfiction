Honestly I tend to assume that most fic is written by women until proven otherwise - in every survey of fandom I've ever seen, women pretty dramatically outnumber men. I can see where you're coming from with "harem fics are probably by guys, slash fics by girls" bit, but I'm curious as to what lead to the rest of your assumptions. (And for the record, I'm a woman who likes Ginny, Ron, and Harry/Ginny and doesn't much like Snape or Harry/Hermione.)
