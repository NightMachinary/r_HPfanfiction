A [[http://centrumlumina.tumblr.com/post/62816996032/gender][survey of AO3 users]] found that 80% identified as female, and a [[http://ffnresearch.blogspot.com/2011/03/fan-fiction-demographics-in-2010-age.html][survey of FFN]] found that 78% of members were female. Neither of these are specific to the HP fandom, but I don't see any reason for the HP fandom to be significantly more male than average.

Also, doesn't Reddit in general skew male?
