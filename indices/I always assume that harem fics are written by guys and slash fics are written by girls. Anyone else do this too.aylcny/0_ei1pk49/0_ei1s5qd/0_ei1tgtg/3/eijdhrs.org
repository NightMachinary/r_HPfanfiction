I think this is more keeping the tone set by canon, and thus a gender-neutral thing. I agree tat if you see a fic which has a Rambo-style protagonist killing his enemies, it's almost always written by a guy, but just keeping with canon's tone doesn't lean towards any particular gender.

Granted, JKR is a woman, so make of that what you will ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
