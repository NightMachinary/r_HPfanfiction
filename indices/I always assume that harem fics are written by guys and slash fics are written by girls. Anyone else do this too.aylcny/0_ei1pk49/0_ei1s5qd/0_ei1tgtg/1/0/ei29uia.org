I disagree. The way I see it, the difference is where you grew up.

In peaceful countries, killing is taboo. Being merciful is expected (and possible). It's different growing up in war - you know that sometimes, you have you kill in order to survive (or protect your loved ones).

I'm female, from the Middle East and my boyfriend is Male from central Europe. I wouldn't be the one to avoid killing if necessary...
