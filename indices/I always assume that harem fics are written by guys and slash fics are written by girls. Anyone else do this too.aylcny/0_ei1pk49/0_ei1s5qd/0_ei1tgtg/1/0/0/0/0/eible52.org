While I think anecdotal evidence is a dangerous debate tactic due to how easily it can lead people astray, I happen to agree with much of your core point nonetheless.

There is an undeniable link between gender and predisposition towards unnecessary violence. However that is not to say that women are weak or incapable of violence by any means.

I agree with you, in that I think environment is a better predictor of tendency toward violence than gender is. Necessity breeds a great many things in people of either gender, including the ability to fight or to kill or to be callous regarding the deaths of others. (I think “A song of Ice and Fire” and “Game of Thrones” depict this really well: there are differences between the genders but both genders are capable of violence in various forms.)

What the other commenter said was not chauvinistic (defined as: “feeling or displaying aggressive or exaggerated patriotism; displaying excessive or prejudiced support for one's own cause, group, or sex”) in any way. The other commenter was polite and logical in their response which criticized your use of exclusively anecdotal evidence.
