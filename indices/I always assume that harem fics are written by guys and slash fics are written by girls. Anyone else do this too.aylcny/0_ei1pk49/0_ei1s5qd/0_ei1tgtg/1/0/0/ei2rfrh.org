While your point is true, it's also true that the female gender is far less disposed toward violence and especially killing. There is a very good reason why 90% of the prison population and up to 94% of violent criminals are male.

You use your own example to prove that you are more violent than males from central Europe. But this sample size is rather small (exactly 1) and could be easily explained away by individual variance. Furthermore, have you looked at men from Middle East and compared their attitude with yours?
