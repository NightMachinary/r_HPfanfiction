  What the other commenter said was not chauvinistic (defined as: “feeling or displaying aggressive or exaggerated patriotism; displaying excessive or prejudiced support for one's own cause, group, or sex”) in any way. The other commenter was polite and logical in their response which criticized your use of exclusively anecdotal evidence.

Then I apologise, as I wrote, that exact opinion/ sentence is currently being used in my country as a way of oppressing women, so I see it as aggressive and might've overreacted. While I do think it's a sexist comment (for us the difference between sexism and chauvinism is that chauvinism is solely against women), I did not mean to attack nor insult.
