What about those fics where the good guys never use any kind of lethal spells while the bad guys just do whatever? You know, the ones where dark stuff and unforgiveables like the Imperius and Cruciatus are tossed around like candy by the bad guys, while the good guys use tripping jinxes and jelly legs nonsense?

Is that more a female author kind of thing, or just plain bad writing?
