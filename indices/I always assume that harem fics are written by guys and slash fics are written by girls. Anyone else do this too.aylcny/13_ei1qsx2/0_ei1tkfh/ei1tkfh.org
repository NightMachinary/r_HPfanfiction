/Lemon scene = male Reasoning: men see sex as more neccessary than women/

Yeah, big fricking no on this one. Seriously, come over to slash fandom and try to make that stick. Almost everything I write has graphic sex. Almost everything I've bookmarked as favorites contains explicit sex written by women. Fanfiction is a fucking /boon/ to women who want to write sex scenes that cater to their kinks. I realize reddit and journal fandom rarely overlap, but from the beginning, HP fandom on LiveJournal and Dreamwidth - which was huge in its day and was 95% women - embraced "the internet is for porn" idea with glee.

Sorry, but this assumption not only doesn't fly for me, it needs to be buried with a stake through its heart.

/Multiple women fight over main character. = female/

This may be a thing in het fic, I don't know, because I'm picky about the het fic I read in fandom, so my sample size is too small. But I haven't come across it. It's the sort of stereotyping that would throw me out of a fic the moment I got a whiff of it.

Also, I notice that when you type "main character," you default to MC = male, which isn't a given. Presumably it's a reflection of your reading tastes, but not all main characters in fic are Harry Potter.
