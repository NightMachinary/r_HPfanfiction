Well, sex scenes can be good or bad, depending on the writer's skill, but I don't think the quality of the sex scene necessarily points to whether the writer is male or female. Random lemons are simply poor craftsmanship. Of course, if the writer is young and inexperienced at both sex and storytelling, ignorance about How Bodies Work can be a dead giveaway. Ditto fixations on body parts, since a lot of men have rather distinctive ways of describing women's bodies - although plenty of women (again, in slash fandom) will go into lengthy descriptions of dicks and (male) asses purely for pleasure.

I've always assumed that women who write het fic dwell lovingly on the sex scenes, because most of the women writers I hang out with prefer NC-17 fic. I know Snape/Hermione writers do (I don't read it, but I have fandom friends who ship them), and in one of my non-HP fandoms, my preferred het ship gets a decent amount of smut despite not being terribly popular.

Re: fighting over a love interest = female writer. I suspect those writers are young. This is an adolescent concept of relationships. Also relevant: most of the fics I read focus on the adults in canon, not the teenagers. And 50% of them have someone besides Harry as the main character. So I think it's a case of "HP fandom is so huge it's impossible to generalize based on your own corner of personal preference."
