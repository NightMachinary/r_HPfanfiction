“I object! This thing isn't a male thing. I, a male, do it!”

No-one's claiming that ‘rape as a weapon of war' isn't a thing. It's very much a thing. It's even probable that the Death Eaters do rape- it was implied by the treatment of the campsite owner's wife at the Quidditch World Cup.

It's just men tend to write about it as horrible thing people do.

Women tend to write about it as a horrible thing to have done to you.

YMMV.
