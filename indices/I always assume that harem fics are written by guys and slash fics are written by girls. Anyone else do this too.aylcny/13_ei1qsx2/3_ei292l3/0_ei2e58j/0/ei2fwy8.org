Perhaps, but OP's reasoning is

#+begin_quote
  Or on the flip side rape being used as the generic "bad guy is bad and doing the worst thing possible" way of showing who the antagonist is. = female
#+end_quote

which sums up what I am doing pretty well. Although not the "worst possible thing", since there are way worse things you can do since the dark arts seem to be "1001 ways to make someone suffer as long and painfully as possible".
