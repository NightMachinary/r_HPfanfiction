  I'd like to object to the rape bit. I'm a guy and tend to include it whenever Death Eater atrocities come up.

I'd say that there's a difference between using it to show atrocities and using it for the sake of plot. The latter (which includes rape attempts as well) makes for a rather shitty device.
