I'd like to object to the rape bit. I'm a guy and tend to include it whenever Death Eater atrocities come up. While I wouldn't say that it's the worst thing you can do with magic, making a father rape his own daughter with the Imperius after the Death Eaters took turns is pretty bad. But that's exactly the shit which happens if you have unshackled warriors with a belief in racial superiority. The prime example would be Japan in the Asian Mainland theater 1937-45, but the Eastern Front is also ripe with examples on both sides.
