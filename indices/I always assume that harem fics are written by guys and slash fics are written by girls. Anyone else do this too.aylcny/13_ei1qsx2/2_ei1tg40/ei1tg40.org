Another telltalle is if the writer doesn't seem to actually ever talk with a male/female friend. It's so grating each time a character act like a caricature written by an alien, or when adults who supposed to know better (Snape managed to be a double-agent for years, he definitely understood women, McGonagall isn't some virgin hidden from men all her life, she definitely get what teenage boys are thinking) act like they're pre-teen who believe the opposite sex have cooties.
