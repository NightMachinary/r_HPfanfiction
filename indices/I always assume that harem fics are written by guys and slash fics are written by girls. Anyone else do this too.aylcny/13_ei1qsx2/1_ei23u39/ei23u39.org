“Lemon scene=male”.

Generally the opposite, actually. And we really need to differentiate between straight and queer or trans men here.

Straight men to write a male protagonist as an object of sexual interest to the women around him, tend to write him having a lot of sex and with the option to have more. But they don't tend to write the sex itself.

Also:

Graphic torture scene of antagonist= male.

Graphic torture scene of protagonist= female.

“ Or on the flip side rape being used as the generic "bad guy is bad and doing the worst thing possible" way of showing who the antagonist is. = female”

George R. R. Martin would like a word with you. This is actually a really male thing. Women tend to use rape as a trauma inducing tool for their characters or as part of a rape/dub con fantasy fics. They think about the effect on the person raped, not the perception of the rapist. Most women can't help but relate with the victim.
