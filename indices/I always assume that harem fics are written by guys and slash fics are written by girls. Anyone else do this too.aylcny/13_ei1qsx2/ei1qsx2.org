Disclaimer, I'm on mobile and tired so this probably isn't formatted perfectly or grammatically correct the full way through.

Oh yeah, I feel you can tell a fair bit of the time. Some more you missed, qnd these aren't neccesarily limited to just HP fanfiction.

Main character always reassuring women around him about inane things. IE yes you're pretty enough, you shouldn't listen to them. = Female

Reasoning: fanfiction is an actualization of fantasies more often than not. Men don't worry about reassurances, women do.

Main character hyper against rape from a young age despite never having anyone around him be raped or raped himself. Or on the flip side rape being used as the generic "bad guy is bad and doing the worst thing possible" way of showing who the antagonist is. = female

Reasoning: While I doubt many men would say they condone rape if asked, its just not something we think about. It's not somerhing we're going to write into a character trait simply because we don't have to ever worry about it and will never think it neccessary to put in.

Women flock to main character and just become a harem. =male

Multiple women fight over main character. = female

Reasoning: The last two make sense as two sides of the same coin, men just want to see the end result but women see the "fighting for love" thing as a part of romance.

Overuse of the word pervert. = female

Reasoning: I literally don't think any of my freinds have ever thought of something as perverted. Either hot or wrong or anywhere in between. But perverted isn't an adjective we'd use.

Descriptions of characters that even remotely include bust size for anyone other than the MC. = male

Reasoning: if its done for the MC its swlf actualization on how you'd like to look. If done for others its self gratification on the ideal women you'd like to see.

Main character starting family or saying he always dream of doing so. = female

Reasoning: not something men really think of until they already have one

You know, its at this point writing this and thinking it through that I realize how many more indicators I notice point towards female than male.

Complaining about ron's table manners. =soft tell leaning towards female

Reasoning: men really don't care most of the time, but some do

Graphic torture scene = male

Reasoning: this ones just a gut feeling

Lemon scene = male

Reasoning: men see sex as more neccessary than women

... I actually kinda wanna make a list now as I read all Fanfiction to see how many general tells I can come up with.
