Since that's another one I haven't encountered in the wild, I'd have to see the specific fics for context. It could certainly be a young woman writing for maximum emotional self-indulgence and laying the OOC behavior on thick because ridiculous excess of feeling is fun for them (in fiction). I tend to lump stuff like that under emotional kink - something that trumps characterization and plot for the writer and is the real point of the scene or even the whole story. Really new writers usually don't realize they're writing kink; older writers who have been in fandom for a while will actually set out to write it deliberately, with creativity and flair - which is great if you happen to share their kink. If you don't, it's better to shrug and back-click unless you trust the writer.
