Are you saying male characters aren't overly dramatic? Eh.

Now, you may have a certain kind of melodrama in mind that strikes you as OOC (weeping at the drop of a hat, for example - something most women don't do, either), but male characters - especially in media favored by fandom - run around being angsty, belligerent, flamboyantly noble, long-suffering, etc. all the time. Male villains in particular tend to grandstand and act out emotionally.
