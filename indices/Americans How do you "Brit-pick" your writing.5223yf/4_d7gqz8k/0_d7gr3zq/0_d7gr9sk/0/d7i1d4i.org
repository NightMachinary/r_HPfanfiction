In Australia there is a peculiar mix of American/British English. One of my friends went to the UK to teach PE (Brits still with me - PE = sport) at a posh high school school. The kids all had their trousers on over their running shorts, so she (19 yo, blonde Australian at the time) said "come on boys get your pants off"

She is still embarrassed about it 30 years later.
