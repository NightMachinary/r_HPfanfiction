I have an American-British dictionary which I have read and now occasionally skim through for a refresher. It doesn't have every little difference in it, and even if it did, I don't have it memorized, so I still make mistakes, but it definitely helps, at least with the major stuff.

The other thing is, once I'm in 'Brit mode', I try to stay as locked in it as possible while I'm writing that chapter, even if I'm writing somewhere else, like Reddit. This possibly makes me look pretentious to people who know I'm American and I throw out a 'favourite', but it really helps me make fewer mistakes if I'm not switching back and forth all the time.

Edit: Autocorrect :P
