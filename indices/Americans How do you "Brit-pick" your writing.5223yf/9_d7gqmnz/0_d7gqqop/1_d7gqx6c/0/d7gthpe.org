I actually like 'goddamn' or 'dammit/damn it'.

It's such a childish swearword that it fits many characters. An eleven year old dropping the f-bomb constantly is rather annoying. Yes, kids swear, but normally it's something else instead of fuck.

My favourite swear word is bastard. It can just fit and it's a longer word, making it more intimidating. :D!

As for usage in fics. I don't mind it. It's kinda like using 'hate'. It's a very expressive word and it can get you into what the character feels. But a character that swears every second word is just an annoyance.
