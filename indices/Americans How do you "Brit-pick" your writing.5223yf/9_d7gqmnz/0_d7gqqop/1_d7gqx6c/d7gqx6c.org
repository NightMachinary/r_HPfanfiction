Good thing, cause my fic makes good use of that M rating. Sure, there's bloodys, and buggers, and at least a few gits, but fucks are all over the place. Question: as far as swearing goes --- do you use goddamn often? Cause it's kinda my favorite swear word (yes, I have a favorite curse, don't judge) and I've used it in my fic.
