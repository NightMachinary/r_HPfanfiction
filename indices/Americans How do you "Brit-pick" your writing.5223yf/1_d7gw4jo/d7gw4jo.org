I'm neither British nor American, and I don't really care about phrase choices or words difference like chips/crisps, pudding/dessert etc. But what I always hate, when its clearly American culture represented, especially with muggle-world centric stories. Like, no, it's not how schools work in England. No, you don't need car at 16, it's not that necessary. No, you don't use dollars in UK... A little bit research please?..
