I don't beat myself up over it too much, like I won't spell it as honour, flavour, colour, arse, etc. But I will call it Philosopher's Stone rather than Sorcerer's Stone, and I'll use words like bin rather than dumpster. My only real exposure is from watching Top Gear about a million times, which is better than nothing I guess, but hardly all-consuming.
