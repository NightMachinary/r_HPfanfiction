Don't forget that while some fanfics expand this so that all magical (or /highly/ magical) locations repel electronics, canon is much less definitive. It's specifically /at Hogwarts/ that modern technology doesn't work; as far as we know you could set up a computer shop in the middle of Diagon Alley if you wanted to.

And a certain Flying Ford Anglia stands as a living example that magic /can indeed/ have an enhancing effect on Muggle machines even when not specifically enchanted. (i.e. the car is enchanted to fly and become invisible, but this expands to it gaining sentience after spending some time in the highly magical Forbidden Forest.)
