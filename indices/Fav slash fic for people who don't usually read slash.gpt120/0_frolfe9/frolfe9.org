Romance bores me most of time, so I like more plot filled stuff with any potential shipping as a back burner, so these will probably be things you like.

So, linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15809817][One to Speak, Another to Hear]] by seventymilestobabylon) is a really good one because the Remus/Sirius aspects are a great character/dynamic study more than anything else.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/809346][leave no stone unturned (a series of standalones)]] has some fantastic fics with a mix of stuff in it. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13281801][The Age of Lies]] by TheDivineComedian) is probably my favorite in it. Remus/Sirius isn't a huge feature.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366][face death in the hope]] by LullabyKnell) is technically a romance but it's so slowburn it's almost nonexistent.
