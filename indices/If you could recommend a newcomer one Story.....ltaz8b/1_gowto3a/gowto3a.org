1. Something by Northumbrian ... well written, canonical, pretty close in style to JKR. Most likely “Tales of the Battle” linkao3(1615616), that looks like a good start.
2. There are some others, mostly post-war stories, they feel like a good continuation for somebody who finished reading the books. “[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=245803][Harry Potter and the Summer After the War by Mrs_Granger]]”, linkao3(1615616), or something of that sort.
