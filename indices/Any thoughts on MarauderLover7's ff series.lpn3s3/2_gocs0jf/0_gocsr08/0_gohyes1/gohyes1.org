Have you really? I love that fic and I've been looking for good parental Sirius fics since then... Have you tried it? How does it compare? I think I tried the Innocent series a while back since I've heard so much about it, and as you said, the size appealed to me as well. But it didn't really work for me if I remember right. But I might revisit it.
