Well, I'm 13 chapters in, and so far I must say that the beginning and the foundation of the Marauder's Plan was stronger/better than those of the Innocent. However, that doesn't mean that I don't enjoy reading it; the writing is good, the characters aren't OOC , the premise is interesting. What I like the most about the Innocent is that the author is capable of intertwinining canon elements with original ideas in a clever way, resulting in a captivating and twisted plot. I definitely suggest you to give it a go, but be aware that it's indeed slow paced, despite the great time gap it has to catch up on (the story starts ~2 years before PS)
