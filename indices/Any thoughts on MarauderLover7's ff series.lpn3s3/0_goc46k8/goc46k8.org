So, it is generally good. There's no bashing or bizarre author appealish stuff that people often complain about, it has lots of interesting plots, the characters are pretty well realized and reasonably similar to their canon counterparts iirc

It's just kinda slow. I keep coming back to it every so often, getting burned out and dropping it.
