Which fic is that?

I probably read it and never even noticed. But in general, as long as the writing is good and I am enjoying a fic the formatting doesn't really matter or register to me at all. I do generally stop reading for the smallest things, but it's usually in regards to how certain characters are written, the plot, the writing style or the dialogue. I do tend to get annoyed with fics that have lots and lots of boring flashbacks in italics every 2 paragraphs, but that's less formatting issue and more of an issue of the writing and plot.
