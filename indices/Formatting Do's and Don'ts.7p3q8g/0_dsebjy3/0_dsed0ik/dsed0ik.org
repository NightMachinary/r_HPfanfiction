I agree, there's this one fantabulous story on FF.net, it's extremely well-written, in-character Snape-Mentors-Harry fic, it's one of my favorites but FF itself messed up the formatting to make alot of things bold and italicized, but I am glad I read it because it's easily my favorite fanfic of all time.
