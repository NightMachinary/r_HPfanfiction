I don't get some of these pet peeves at all. Using page breaks? Using italics? I mean, those two are part of writing a story. A lot of writers use them. /Professional/ writers use them. JK Rowling uses them. If you're dropping a story because page breaks or italics are being used, you're basically dropping 90% of stories out there for no real reason. And a lot of them are good stories too.
