I disagree. For my story "No longer alone" I changed the Black family tree so that it would fit the plot. Now I can either post an AN which explains the changes or get a shitton of reviews of people saying that I got things wrong because in canon Bellatrix is the oldest Black sister, not Andi. Or the area where I put the Tonks home. Because I had no data how that place looked in the 90s I had to make do with Google Maps/Stree View and the Kent habitat survey from 2012.

There's no way you can say certain things in the story. Just how can you make it clear that you are making AU changes at this point and instead of bad research?

  "I know Rowling said that Bellatrix is my older sister but secretly she was born 16 months after me."

That is far worse than a short AN at the end of the fic.
