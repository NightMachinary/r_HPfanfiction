In an original work you make the canon in fanfiction, you build an AU. If there are conflicts between your world and the original works then people get confused. You do not want that. ANs are at the end of the chapter. You can skip them without disturbing the reading flow. They are meant as a help for people who seek clarification, not tell additional information.

As an author, I want to tell stories. If no one listens (reads them) because there's a lot of bad reviews you lose your audience and end up talking to no one. And I want constructive feedback, not 10 reviews saying I got something wrong when I intended that change.
