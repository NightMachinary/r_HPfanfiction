There are still ways a for a good writer to weave them into the story, fanfiction is in no way different to real fiction such that if a reliable narrator such as Adi says shes older the audience should accept it as fact. A load of pedantic reviewers correcting an AU story,in my mind is not a valid reason to ruin the flow of a story.
