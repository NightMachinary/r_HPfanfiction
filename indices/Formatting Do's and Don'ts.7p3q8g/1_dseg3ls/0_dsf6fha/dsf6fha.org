Dont even bother with authors notes, if something from the fic needs explaining then put it in the fic otherwise its not a good fic. Answering reviews is a nice thing to do but thats what PMs are for, replying to them in the fic just strikes as showing off that you got reviews. Personal stuff goes in the Bio. 1 authors note at the very start of the fix and another at the very end should be by far enough for any fic.
