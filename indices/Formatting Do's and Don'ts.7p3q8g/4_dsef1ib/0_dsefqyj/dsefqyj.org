Yes! I get annoyed with it as well, especially when the author does it unintentionally, but upon seeing it after its posted you'd think they'd edit it wouldn't you? it shows a lack of care not to. But thats just my opinion.

Yeah I don't like the use of bold in narrative it is kind of cheap, I feel anyway, like when someone bolds AVADA KEDAVRA for emphasis, like a descriptive word could have been used, like:

His voice, dripping with disdain yet ice cold, shouted out venomously, "Avada Kedavra!"

You get the point through without relying on bold.
