Personally I kinda hate it when people turn on the italics/bold and DONT TURN THEM OFF AFTER THE RELEVANT SECTIONS! I mean really? Is it that hard to press the button again?

But I personally use italics for emphasis, thoughts and Parseltongue mostly. Don't use bold that often for the narrative, just for Authors Notes and general formatting-ey things like titles sometimes.
