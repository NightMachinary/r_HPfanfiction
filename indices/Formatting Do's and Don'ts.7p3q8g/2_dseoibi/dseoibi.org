Since no one has addressed it yet:

I wouldn't use italics for a pensieve memory. Usually when I see italics for something like a dream sequence, I assume the author/narrator is trying to convey that something is wrong on a fundamental level without spending a bunch of words that will bog the scene down. A pensieve doesn't have that effect, so it doesn't make sense to use formatting.

Generally speaking, formatting should be used to express something that's either impossible or extremely unwieldy to do in text. Quoting a character's internal monologue is by far the most common example, though I'm sure there are others. However, if a reader isn't paying enough attention to recognize that a character is yelling without bold text or in a pensieve memory without a wall of italics, that's on them and not on the writer.

On top of all that, in long stretches of italics and bold can be annoying to read and also draw the eye toward them before the reader actually gets there.

And a bit about author's notes: If the reader needs to know something, it should be in the story. For authors that have discussions with readers about the story, there are other places to do that. Fanfiction sometimes requires a preface to talk about what the story is and isn't regarding canon, character speculation, and other considerations, but it's a necessary evil and subsequent author's notes are completely avoidable.
