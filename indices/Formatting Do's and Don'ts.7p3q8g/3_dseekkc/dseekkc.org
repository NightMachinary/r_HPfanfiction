I'd say pick whatever you want, but be consistent. In my writing, I use italics to indicate a character's internal thoughts and I've used italics for flashbacks. In the case where the main prose is italicized, internal thoughts are non-italicized.

I use *** to indicate when things are going to change (character POV or mini-chapter break), but I recently found out that ff.net takes those out, so I use the horizontal line tool as a replacement.

For other things, I refer to the Chicago Manual of style. I have it in print, but I believe there is an online reference these days. Make sure to pay attention to your punctuation and quotation marks as well. For example:

"HARRY POTTER! DIDYA PUT YER NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FYAH!?" is correct.

"HARRY POTTER! DIDYA PUT YER NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FYAH"!? is not.
