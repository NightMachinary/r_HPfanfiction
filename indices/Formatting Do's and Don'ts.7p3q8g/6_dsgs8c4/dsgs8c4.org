While it wouldn't bother me to read a story where pensive memories are italicised, I don't think it is necessary. JKR didn't do it in canon, her writing conveyed clearly what was happening, and personally, this is the way I would try to do it too. If it is well written and obvious, I wouldn't let isolated complaints bother me. It's impossible to satisfy every reader, so you should do what you feel comfortable with. Of course, there is also valid criticism, and if a reader tells you it's unclear, it might be a good idea to go through the scene again, to see where they are coming from and if you can improve your writing to make it clearer.
