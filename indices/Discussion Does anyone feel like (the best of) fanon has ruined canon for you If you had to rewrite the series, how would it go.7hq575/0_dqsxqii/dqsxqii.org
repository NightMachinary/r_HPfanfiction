Bluntly, your sorting is wrong. If you are focusing on rewriting the series, you need to take each character as they are, not how they were in the series. The Harry in your description is as close to a Ravenclaw or slytherin harry potter i have ever seen. Why not put him in ravenclaw?

And Hermione from how you describe her, would be in slytherin.
