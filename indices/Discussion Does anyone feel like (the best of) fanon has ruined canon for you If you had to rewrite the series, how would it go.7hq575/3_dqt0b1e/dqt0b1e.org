Ruined canon? Only in the way that highlights some of canon's shortfallings (terrible with numbers, no explanation to how magic actually works, demonizing an entire house, etc) but I have yet to actually read a story I like more than canon as a whole.

Your idea just reads like a generic fixit attempt with heavyhanded plotting using the author's foreknowledge. You're changing things, but everything is still the same, so what's the point?
