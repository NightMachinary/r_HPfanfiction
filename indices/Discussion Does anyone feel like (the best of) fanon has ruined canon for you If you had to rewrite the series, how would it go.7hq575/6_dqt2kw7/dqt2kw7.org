Number one resonates a lot with me. In general, I think the entire HP series does a bad job with representing mental health/depicting trauma, especially on young children and teenagers. The closest thing we get is Sirius' drinking problem after Azkaban, and even that is sort of stereotypical. I don't know, of course everything is from Harry's POV so we really don't know what's going on with characters like Ginny, Remus (who had his entire life just ripped out of his hands at five years old, like that's horrible), Hermione, even Ron in Philosopher's Stone when he gets into that chess match is horrible (I mean the kid is 11). But you're right totally right about Harry and the abuse he faced, constant shitting on his parents.
