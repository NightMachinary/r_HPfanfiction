If I were to write it, Harry would have a personality and an active interest in what happens around him.

The Dursleys wouldn't be abusive. At worst, they would be deeply upset by Harry's use of magic, but they would have a way to contact Dumbledore, and he would end up taking Harry away and raising him himself. He'd have prepared Harry as a combatant.

Voldemort would have a list of honest grievances with Magical Britain and a plan of how to address them. If death were his primary fear, he'd have made his horcruxes, lived a normal life, and faked his death and an heir. My version would want a better future for the nation enough to risk death.

Either there's a much bigger thing about "the hat sorts you according to the virtue you need to cultivate" or Hermione goes to Ravenclaw and Neville to Hufflepuff.

Snape actually teaches. He's crabby and not very good at teaching, but he seems to have caught on that you have to explain things to people and even explain the reasoning behind some of it.

Either that or all the teachers are terrible. Like McGonagall starts with human transfiguration on the first day, and the first spell at Charms is colloquially known as Fiendfyre's little brother. One of the more common detentions is to dig out more mass grave for dead students, and teachers commonly single out students for crud. I saw at least one fic like that. Don't think I'd want to publish it myself, but it would make the story in general a lot more consistent.
