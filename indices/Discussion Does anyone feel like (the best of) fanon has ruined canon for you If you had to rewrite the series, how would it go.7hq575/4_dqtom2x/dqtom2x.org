This may be an unpopular opinion but I hate book 7 so much. I feel like it's Harry Potter and the great camping trip and didn't satisfy me at all. Also, I refuse to acknowledge the epilogue.

I really wonder why fidelius wasn't explored to hide Harry away while they researched possible horcrux hiding places. It would have also been great to have seen more of what was happening at hogwarts during the death eater reign.
