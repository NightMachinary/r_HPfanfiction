  I really wonder why fidelius wasn't explored to hide Harry away while they researched possible horcrux hiding places. It would have also been great to have seen more of what was happening at hogwarts during the death eater reign.

Remember the heroes had to suffer so readers will feel more for them!

They had to forget all simple solutions and become so stupid as to hang a Horcrux around their necks.
