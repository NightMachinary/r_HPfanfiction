How to fix book 7 and convey the right messages:

- Hermione takes the Death Eater inside Grimmauld Place and wipes his mind/let Kreacher kill him (Voldemort betrayed Regulus, Death Eaters are working for Voldemort, Kreacher can avenge his master)

- Ditch Ron due to the Horcrux or not, I don't care.

- Seeing as their hunt is getting nowhere and the Ministry is literally building concentration camps the duo/trio gathers evidence.

- A pregnant Tonks turns up in Grimmauld Place since her husband ran off once more, ignoring the whole "in good and in bad times" of his marital vow (she knows the secret and it is not that hard to guess where Harry is hiding)

- The group takes the evidence to the ICW after leaving England on a plane, train or ship.

- Some ICW members are reminded of the Holocaust and actually do something about Voldemort using Hitler's playbook. If you want to add a certain irony have the German Empire/Prussia/Austria/whatever the magical equivalent of Germany is called lead these efforts.

- An anti-Voldemort Coalition invades Britain with a force of thousands, liberate the camps, cleanse the Ministry and face Voldemort

- Outnumbered at least 1000:1 Voldemort is eventually overwhelmed and either taken alive and strapped into magical restraints or simply executed.

- Harry can search for the remaining Horcruxes without worrying about all Death Eaters.

- Thorough cleanup of Britain, a Dark Mark earns you a lifetime behind bars, no exceptions.

- After "Teddy" is born make Harry the godfather and let him take care of the boy without killing off his mother (Lupin is out of the picture by now).

- Harry does not name children after the guys who made his life hell. Snape leaked the prophecy that got his parents killed and only turned due to an honestly creepy obsession with a married woman, Dumbledore left him at the Dursleys even though he knew of the abuse ("10 dark years") and did nothing to ensure the Death Eaters faced justice after the first war.

- As for pairings, I don't care at all as long as it is not canon pairings. Hermione/Tonks and Harry/Moonboy makes more sense for all I know.
