I mean, I don't like him, but we don't need to turn him into a Death Eater in disguise or a rapist to avoid Ron/Hermione. Common sense is all that's needed. In this plot it would make sense for him to leave so that Harry and Hermione have nothing keeping them in Britain but it could still work with Ron in the picture.
