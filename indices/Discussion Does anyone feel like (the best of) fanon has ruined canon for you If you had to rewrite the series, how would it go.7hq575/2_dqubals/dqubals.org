The bigest mistake in the Harry Potter books was the prophecy saying that Harry would be Voldemorts equal. Because Harry never lived up to the hype.

There is also the fact that the first villains we meet the Dursleys win in the end because Harry becomes infected with there obsession with being "Normal".
