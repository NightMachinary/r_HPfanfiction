The first thing I would change is to remake Voldemort. I don't care for that typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain that has been done ad nauseam these days. I would make him a complex person with some great personal virtues, but unfortunately found himself on the wrong side of history.

The next thing I would change is Dumbledore. He should no longer be that dumbed down plot device who only showed up in last chapter to sort out things. He would be that machiavellian puppet master who fought on the right side of history, and he would do lots of heavy lifting and maneuvering himself.

I would also get rid of the entire Roald-Dahlesque Dursley scheme. It made no sense to dump the hope of your nation into an abusive home, and the chance of getting your next deranged dark lord was just too high. Buying reader sympathy by letting heroes growing up in abusive household is way overused IMO.

--------------

Here, I'm basically continuing with the theory I've been proposing for some time: the Books were a test and PR campaign undertaken by the British Ministry of Magic. Its original goal was to identify Muggles' response to the concept of Magic. Needless to say, the results vastly exceeded its most optimistic expectation. Not only were the great majority of Muggles happy with Magic, but those involved in this campaign made billions in profit off those gullible Muggles.

While key outcomes in the Books were not altered, actual details of that conflict greatly differed. As often the case in history, winners were highly praised, and losers mercilessly bashed.

--------------

Following this theory, the 'real' Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul (although he did perform several dark rituals to increase his magical power).

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World (one major point of the conflict was the governing structure of Magical Britain. Voldemort favored the traditional oligarchy in which 'Old Families' called the shots, while Dumbledore wanted to turn MoM into a centralized modern government. The boiling point was reached when Dumbledore tried to pass a law that slapped enormous inheritance tax as a mean to weaken the 'Old Families'.)

Tom Riddle had been teaching DADA from 1957 to 1968 when he resigned the post in protest. The war began in earnest when MoM tried to arrest him for his almost militant opposition to the Inheritance Tax in 1971. From then on, he adopted the mantle 'Lord Voldemort' as he completed a very important power boosting ritual.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership. He was also very protective of his loyal members, and went to great length to extract retributions for their sufferings.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore in a decisive engagement, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Magical Britain, and silenced most critics. The Trio, almost or exceeding the political skills of Octavian (the most famous case of a trio of teenagers seizing power), eventually earned legitimacy by improving the lives of most wizards and witches in Britain.

--------------

I'm indeed taking a page from the Roman history, in which the teenage trio Octavian/Agrippa/Maecenas (perhaps the only instance in our history) overthrew the government against heavy odds and established a lasting new order. Dumbledore and Harry would have a similar relationship as Caesar and Octavian. But of course, history would never repeat in the same way.
