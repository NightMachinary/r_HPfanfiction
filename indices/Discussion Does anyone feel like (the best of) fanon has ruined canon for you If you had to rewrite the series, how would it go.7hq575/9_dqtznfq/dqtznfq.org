Personally, my biggest issue with canon is Voldemort, more specifically the ideology he spouts to recruit people. So, he needs an ideological cause to gather followers. You might assume his was pureblood supremacy, but that literally cannot work.

After WWII you didn't have a bunch of nazis continuing to act like the nazis they were, chances are they were scared of what angry people, who had fought their ideology tooth and nail, would do to them. The purebloods who followed Voldemort would have made it very clear they were not racists, else they opened themselves up to retaliation.

In canon Draco commonly insults Hermione by calling her a mudblood, he clearly fears no retaliation nor does he receive any. If pureblood supremacy was the primary cause, chances are in book 2 Draco would have had his shit kicked in by someone who remembered losing family members to Voldemort after he publicly calls Hermione a mudblood in front of two quidditch teams.

So I really doubt their cause was pureblood supremacy, and we don't really know enough to come up with a clear cause that would get a few thousand people to fight for you in the wizarding world. But I can tell you that Rowling's idea is total bullshit, she didn't think it out.
