As a reader, I usually only review once I'm done reading, I don't generally chapter-by-chapter a thing, and I'm really not good at knowing how to offer helpful criticism so I try to be positive and encouraging.

I don't generally bother reading reviews for others' work unless I have a specific thing to say and want to see if it's already been said.

As a writer, of course I appreciate reviews, especially now that I've started getting some with actual theories on the story's direction, or critiques on my writing style. Even if they're not /as/ helpful, I certainly won't turn my nose up at 'Nice chapter more pls' type ones, because even that means they took the time to write even that much (which, honestly, is a lot more effort than I usually put in when reading.)
