I rarely pay attention to the reviews as a reader. The exceptions actually apply to ongoing stories rather that completed stories that I want to gauge the quality of. Either there's a very big reveal or cliffhanger in an ongoing story, and I want to see other people's reactions; or I feel like the story is going off the rails, and I want to see if other people feel the same way before offering constructive criticism of my own.

As an author, definitely, at least if there's anything substantive. If the review just say "More please", that's really annoying. Even if it's just "Great!" that's almost as annoying. But there have been several occasions when reviewers caught me going off the rails, and I was able to go back and fix it early.
