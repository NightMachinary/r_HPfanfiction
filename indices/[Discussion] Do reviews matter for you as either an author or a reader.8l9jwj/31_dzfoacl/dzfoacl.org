I read a few chapters of the story and then read the reviews to decide whether the upcoming story is decent or not. But I also don't leave everything to the reviews. For example, things like sentence formation,vocabulary,character interactions,cliches etc., determine how much I like it.

And also, A small problem with reviews is that most of them won't know a good story even if they watched it come out of their a**. If you put some terrible 3rd rate sex in it, everyone will call it a great chapter.
