The content of reviews does not matter much to me, except reviews from specific people whose views I respect (Newcomb and Sesc spring to mind). However, the existence of reviews is an important psychological aid to maintaining writing momentum for me. On more than one occassion, I have been inspired to go write because I have received a review, even if the content of that review was "meh".
