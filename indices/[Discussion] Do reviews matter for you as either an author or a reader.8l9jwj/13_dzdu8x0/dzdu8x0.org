It depends. For me as a reader I read reviews for unfinished work. I like to have idea about the quality of the fic. Or if I've started the fic and it's going in a weird direction I'll check out the reviews. Otherwise after I've finished the complete work I'll go back and look at the reviews.

I personally don't review stories unless I've been really moved. Or I'll review if I feel the work is really good but doesn't have a lot of reviews. If I'm on A03 I'll leave a kudos after I finish.
