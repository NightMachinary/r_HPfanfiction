Reviews definitely matter to me as a writer person. Too often I'll post something and it's like it's going into a great black void where nothing is ever heard from again. I like to know if I'm doing something right or wrong and I also love to see if I've made someone think.

I love it when people leave comments about crazy ideas they have about my characters or where my story is going. In my stories, Harry and Ginny have a cat that sort of adopted them like cats do and I've had a few readers convinced that the cat is a secret Animagus. Nope, he's just a cat, but I made you think it, didn't I?

If you read something of mine, let me know what you loved, what you hated and what you thought was "Meh". I promise I won't get salty about it.
