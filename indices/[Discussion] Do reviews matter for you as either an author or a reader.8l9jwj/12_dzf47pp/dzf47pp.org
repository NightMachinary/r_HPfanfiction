From a writerly perspective, I like reviews because they somewhat prove I'm not screaming into the void. Anything I upload, I'm doing so because I think people might like reading it -- if I get the feeling that's not happening, there's no point in the words leaving my gdrive. The reviews themselves... I rarely get anything constructive. But I like when readers speculate or even try and convince me to write down a certain path. It means they're engaged enough to care on some level.

As a reader, in the past I very rarely reviewed, and if I did, it was for the latest chapter. At their heart these reviews were an "update pls" lol. Nowadays I try and review every fic I read. Usually just some gushy encouraging words. I save the effort of dishing real hard constructive criticism for those who come to me specifically for it.
