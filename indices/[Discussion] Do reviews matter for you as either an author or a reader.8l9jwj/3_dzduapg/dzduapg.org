As an author, I generally enjoy most reviews even if they aren't much beyond 'Nice update'. It is a bit irritating to see 'update pls' three times, but well, it boosts my review count, so I'm not mad about it. Of course, it's always lovely when readers care to leave more than one sentence reviews about what they liked about the story, or leave a review about how a certain scene or chapter made them laugh, etc. The reviews that actually hold substance always make my day.

As a reader, I rarely check reviews unless I want to see if an opinion I have is shared by others. I always fear spoilers when I check reviews. I don't really leave much reviews either; when I do, I've usually either followed the author/story for a while and thus, am actually invested in it, or the story was so good I just had to.
