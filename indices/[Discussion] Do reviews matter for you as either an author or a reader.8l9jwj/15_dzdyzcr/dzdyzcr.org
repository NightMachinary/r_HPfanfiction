As an author, reviews keep me motivated to continue writing. I do enjoy critical reviews provided they accurately critique my writing. When reviewers are either impatient about seeing how a new development progresses or misstate what was written, it sticks in my craw. Sometimes the misunderstanding is the fault of my writing, but not always.

That said, I don't take a lack of substantive criticism to be a death knell against stories I'm interested in. I check the reviews briefly just to gauge if there are annoying developments later (harems, prolonged OOCness, melodrama). FF (and fanfiction sites in general) isn't the best place for substantive criticism.
