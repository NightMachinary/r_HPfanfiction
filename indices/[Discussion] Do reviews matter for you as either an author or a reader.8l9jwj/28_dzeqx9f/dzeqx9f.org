As an author, i'm Not afraid to say I really like that notification. It means someone read what I wrote. I don't like people who review every chapter though that era tiring.

As a reader, I often leave reviews to encourage people to continue/finish unfinished work. It's helped me in the past and I have received thanks for it sometimes as well, kickstarting stories where the author gave up. In the first Hope Potter fanfic (I think by shinimagirl or something) I left a long review when she went completely off the rails in thb last couple of chapters, introducing a load of Green god characters nobody cared about and leaving everyone who'd been part of the first 50 chapters behind. It was as a huge shame and I tried to explain what had been great about the story and how frustrating it was for a second story to get shoehorned into the first. She's taken everybody's criticism onboard and now started a new fic, Serpent Tongue instead.

Generally my reviews are a paragraph at most though
