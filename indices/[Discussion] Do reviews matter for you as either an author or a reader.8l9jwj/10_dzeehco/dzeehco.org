As a reader? No. I glanced through reviews a few times and saw a lot of:

#+begin_quote
  [Reader Foo] [Chapter 3] Awkesome! I cant believe that Harry did that!!

  [Reader Foo] [Chapter 4] Oh no! How are they going to get out of this one?

  [Reader Foo] [Chapter 5] That was AWESOME!

  [Reader Foo] [Chapter 6] Snap is soooo mean!

  [Reader Foo] [Chapter 7] WOW! Harry with the Sharingan is OP!!

And this didn't have any relationship to the quality of the story.

This does me no good, and I'd rather not get spoilers.

As a writer? No. Reviews make me significantly less likely to update. Even positive reviews. So I set up email filters, and I'll never be bothered by them again. If you encounter a story I wrote and want to review, go for it; it's no skin off my nose.
