Reviews rank somewhere below pulling your favorite unit in a gatcha but above getting a team kill on my favorite game for me. I constantly check for new reviews, and I even like the ones that are simple "write moar plz" in the darkest part of my heart. When I get a really good review I am tempted to show it to everyone I know because someone liked what I wrote. I have a review addiction, and that's a problem. It's why I always try and leave a review if I read something so someone else can get that beautiful high.

Of course, now I just write terrible SI stories and niche warcraft crossovers no one likes so I'm either in recovery or just a really stupid addict.
