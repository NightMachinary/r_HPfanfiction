As an author, not really. Very few people have anything useful to say. I'm grateful when someone points out grammar mistakes, but less grateful when someone suggests the story should be Harry/Draco for literally no reason at all. And the ones just going "thanks" are pretty much just spam. Occasionally I get people PMing me to talk about the story, but without wanting to share 30k words of notes, it makes discussing it hard at times without it just being straight up spoilers of the next chapter.

As a reader, I've tried my best to give useful, constructed reviews, but I've learned that it really doesn't matter. If an author really wants to write in his super magical trunk made of 7 different exotic woods and containing 49 different rooms, nothing I say will change that. Most authors are content with meaningless reviews as long as it raises their review count. Though, I will say, the authors who get super defensive about their shitty stories are more entertaining than the stories themselves.
