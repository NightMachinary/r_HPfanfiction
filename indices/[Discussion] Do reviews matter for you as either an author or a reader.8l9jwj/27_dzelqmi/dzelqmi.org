As a reader? Not really. A well-written summary is more important. Doesn't have to be fancy, just grammatically correct with an intriguing concept. That combined with what characters are involved is how I decide to read a fic.

I also tend to look at bookmarks on AO3 (I never read anything on ff.net). If a writer I like has bookmarks, I'll sift through them. Rec lists are also nice.

Sometimes a very long fic will have many reviews, but when I open it, I can tell it's just because it's been going on long enough to pull reviews over time. It's not always an indication that the fic is genuinely good.

As a writer, I can't get enough of positive reviews. They're incredibly gratifying. Critique isn't something I'm looking for on some wank fic I wrote on my day off, but I'm not mad about them either.
