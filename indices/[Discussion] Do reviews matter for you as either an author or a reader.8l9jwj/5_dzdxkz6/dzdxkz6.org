I appreciate all reviews, good and bad. Recently, a reader left a review that said:

"This story is so dry an confusing it's not funny. What he'll is going on. Of course that answer will not come In the end and even then the answer will not be plan."

To me, readers leaving a review is a type of free support and shows that they're responding to my story, even if sometimes it's in a negative way. So to fully answer your question, I do like reviews and keep them all (I know some authors delete "Guest" reviews). I don't much care if reviews are one-liners or full, block paragraphs.
