I love leaving reviews, but sometimes I am not sure what to say and it is not the fault of the story, so I will leave a one liner or two just letting them know I'm still around and enjoying the story. I do like to leave con-crit sometimes, but I've been bad at knowing when I've gone over the line and coming off harsh or rude because I have a personality/neurological disorder and am a blunt person without meaning to be.

When looking for something to read I will look at the reviews on chapter one, because I hate being spoiled. I don't judge the fic based on the reviews, because some great fics go unread, or some will get hit by trolls.

Another thing that might make me not read a story has nothing to do with reviews, but if the title has bad grammar(some don't have punctuation and I guess they do it as artistic style, but it throws me off), or the tags like this "I know this sucks, but I just had to write it, don't kill me."
