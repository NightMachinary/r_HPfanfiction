As a writer, only if you're actually going to give concrit. I don't want to hear how much you love my fic, because it'll only lower my opinion of you, and I don't want to hear that it sucks, because I already know. Either provide feedback or don't post. As a reader, no. Popularity, I find, is a /terrible/ measure of quality, especially in the world of fanfiction. Most people have shit taste. FFN readers /especially/ have shit taste. The website, i find, has a very hugbox culture, and I've been flamed repeatedly in the past for providing honest and helpful concrit which describes both what the author is doing well, and what they are not.
