I usually leave critical reviews.. not specifically to be negative but after telling the author I enjoyed the story what help is it if I don't say that there are things that could be better. Sometimes I'm not objective and it can come out worse than it sounds. For example, I was reading a HP and SW crossover where Harry basically figured out a way for immortality by taking different cloned bodies of himself. This guy is almost 90 years old mentally and has both Jedi and Sith training. When he gets back to earth the author uses Snape as an excuse for his poor potions marks. We've just read almost 18 chapters of describing Harry's character being able to focus on stuff that'll make him more powerful or knowledgeable, without giving up because "bad teacher". The author DM'ed me and said not to leave negative reviews... I don't understand that kind of thinking but there you go.
