  If all or almost all reviews are just one sentence praises of the author, then the story also doesn't contain anything noteworthy

It depends. If the story is complete, then yes. But if it is still updating? Taken from my own stories, sometimes you have a filler chapter because you don't want to skip two months of character development, which is important but not very exciting. And you are not getting many reviews for those, unless you include Ron or Hermione (and then they all say "Fuck "Worse than Hitler" Granger!" for some reason, despite it being a positive portrayal of her).
