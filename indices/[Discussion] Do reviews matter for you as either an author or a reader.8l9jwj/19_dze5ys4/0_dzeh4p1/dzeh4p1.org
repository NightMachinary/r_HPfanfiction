Even if it's still updating, absence of meaningful reviews means that there isn't anything meaningful in already written chapters.

I think even filler chapters should show something. Another side of character interactions, traits that aren't shown in the plot chapters, etc.

If inside a chapter equals blank page, I think it's better to remove it at all. I noticed that too many fanfiction stories can be easily cut half or more without losing anything.
