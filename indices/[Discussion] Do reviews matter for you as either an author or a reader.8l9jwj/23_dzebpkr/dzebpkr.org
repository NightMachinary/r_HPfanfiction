As a reader, I tend not to be too bothered about reviews unless it's a story I've been following for a while. Then it's more like chatting with other readers in the comments.

As a writer, even the one word reviews mean someone took the time to login and write it. They felt strong enough about the story to do it and that means the world. We have a handful of people who do a couple of paragraphs most of the time and it's always something we're grateful for, because often it contains questions about the world building or how we see the character so we get the chance to give some writer commentary or do a little bit of meta in the comments. These can lead to new ideas and new things we want to address. So reviews are basically an engaging with the reader tool to see what's working, what's not and talk about some of the thoughts that go into the decisions we make.
