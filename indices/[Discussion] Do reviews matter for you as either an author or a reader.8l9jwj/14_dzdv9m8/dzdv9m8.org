On the few stories I've written, I welcome anything. Even one word.

As a reader, I tend to read reviews only if I'm starting to have doubts about reading further into a story. You know the sort of thing - you're 10 chapters into a 50 chapter story and while it started well, everything has got a bit bogged down. If I find some detailed reviews for later on then I might keep going. If there are several that talk about giving up or how they wish the pace would pick up or something similar, then I might not bother. I obviously don't want to ruin the story through spoilers but sometimes I'd rather pick up one or two of those than waste hours reading an ultimately useless story.
