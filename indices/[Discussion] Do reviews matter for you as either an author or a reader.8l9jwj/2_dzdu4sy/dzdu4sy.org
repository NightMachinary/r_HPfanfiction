  If all or almost all reviews are just one sentence praises of the author, then the story also doesn't contain anything noteworthy. It can't attract a reader who cares enough to leave a significant review for others.

I agree. There's a certain type of "gushing" review that dominates some stories.

  If the critique is objective and points to plot holes, inconsistencies and other flaws, it means that the story really has them and I'll be disappointed with them too. If such reviews are repeated through several chapters, it shows that the author lives in the world of his/her story and doesn't really care about anything else.

Eh, sometimes that's a good thing. At least it tells me that the author is attempting to have an actual plot. Even hugely popular and cultural influential stories have plot-holes (this is the subreddit for Harry Potter fanfiction, so I won't have to go into the HP plot-holes). If someone cares enough about a story to think it through and point out plot-holes they are already quite invested and that's a good thing. In stories that I don't like I don't get far enough to even care about plot-holes... in the tier-list of shitness plot-holes are much lower than bad grammar or other types of "bad writing". But maybe I'm just projecting and other people don't have the same priorities.

  What are reviews for you?
#+end_quote

You already said a lot about reading reviews... I like /writing/ reviews. Sometimes it might come across as harsh, but I have always enjoyed critiquing stuff and sometimes it results in a good dialogue with the author. It's not rare for me to leave "critical" reviews on a fic that I quite enjoyed, but I'm trying hard not forgetting to mention the good stuff too.
