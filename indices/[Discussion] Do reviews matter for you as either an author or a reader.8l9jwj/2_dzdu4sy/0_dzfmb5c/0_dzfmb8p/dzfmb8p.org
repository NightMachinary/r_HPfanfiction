*Lobaev Sniper Rifle*

The Lobaev sniper rifle is a rifle line of custom-built bolt-action sniper rifles manufactured at the now defunct small, private company named "Tsar-Cannon Ltd" (ООО Царь-Пушка), which produced benchrest equipment and long-range, sniper and mountain hunting rifles in Tarusa, Russia. The Lobaev rifles are based on a single-shot bolt-action designed for benchrest shooting by Vladislav Lobaev. The chambering, barrel, stock, ammunition feeding method and other rifle characteristics are determined by the clients' preferences. With an accuracy of 0.3-0.2 MOA, the Lobaev SVL is claimed as the most accurate sniper rifle in the world.
