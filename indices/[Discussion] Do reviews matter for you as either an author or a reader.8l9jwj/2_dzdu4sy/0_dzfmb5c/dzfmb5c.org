  sometimes that's a good thing. At least it tells me that the author is attempting to have an actual plot.

When several people wonder "WTF?" about the plot and/or heroes actions and their questions aren't addressed in the next chapters, it shows that the author doesn't even attempt to do a reality check. He or she is too fixated on the story to admit its flaws.

Sometimes the absence of common sense can be forgiven to some degree. But often authors totally reject it for the sake of the plot. Like introduction of non magical weapons -- such thing immediately kills HP world, because even Voldemort couldn't do anything against a headshot from something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobaev_Sniper_Rifle]]
