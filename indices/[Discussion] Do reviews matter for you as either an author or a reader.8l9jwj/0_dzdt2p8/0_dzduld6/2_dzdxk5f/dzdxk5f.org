Is it a correct statement if an author didn't mentioned it in the story summary?

By default I assume that every publishing (even just in Internet) author wants reviews both positive and negative.

If an author has issues with negative reviews, he or she isn't worthy to read, because he/she doesn't care about his readers. The only important thing for such author is himself/herself.
