  By default I assume that every publishing (even just in Internet) author wants reviews both positive and negative.

This is a thing I assume as well. If you're posting to an archive that has an embedded function for leaving feedback, then I'm going to think you're open to feedback. If you want to just write for yourself, that's what places like Tumblr are for where you can control the feedback options.
