Never said the latter part.\\
If you don't want people commenting on your story don't let people read it.\\
If you let people read it /expect/ comments and don't come crying when you don't like what they say.\\
If you can't keep from sharing your literary ejaculations but want to keep your fingers in your ears going "lalala, can't hear you" do it where a response function is not available. Make your own website or shit. But don't complain when you stumble over people discussing your works elsewhere. You wanted people to read it, deal with them having an opinion on it.

But usually it comes down to writers wanting as many people as possible to read their crap, and for that it needs to be in a popular, heavily frequented place. Which usually contains some form of user interaction.
