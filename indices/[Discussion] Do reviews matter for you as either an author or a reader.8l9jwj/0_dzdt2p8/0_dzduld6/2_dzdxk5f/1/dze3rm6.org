  If an author has issues with negative reviews, he or she isn't worthy to read, because he/she doesn't care about his readers. The only important thing for such author is himself/herself.

I think people write for a lot of different reasons. If we were talking about original fiction I would agree with you. I personally don't mind constructive criticism but I'm not every author.

Some people are writing for fun. Other people write because they might be going through something. They may care about growing as a writer they may not. I wouldn't say that someone isn't worth reading or doesn't care about their readers because they're not open to negative or constructive criticism.
