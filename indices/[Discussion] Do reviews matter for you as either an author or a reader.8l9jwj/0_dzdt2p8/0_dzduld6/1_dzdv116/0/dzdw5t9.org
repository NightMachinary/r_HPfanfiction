Enthusiastic fun fics where the author is having fun are great to read. Even if the writing is not great the story and drama usually keep me reading. I call in the Fifty Shades Affect, lol.

I use the sandwich technique if I leave criticism. I always hope that it doesn't discourage the writer too much.
