Whenever I do leave criticism I always highlight what is done well as much, if not more than any areas of improvement.

I've also left the occasional one in fics with lower quality, but where the enthusiasm and fun behind it is really clear :) the enjoyment of the author carries the story despite its flaws in those odd cases, and I always leave them a thank you message when I come across them x
