I don't leave 100% negative reviews... okay I did leave one on Harry Crow. If a story is so bad that I can't find anything to say about it, I generally stop reading early enough that there's no point saying why.

On the other hand, I think it's helpful to point out things that I don't think worked as well as the things that did. As long as criticism is done politely and constructively it can be useful. If it's just "I hate Hermione", which was the full text of one review I saw recently, then there's not much point to it.
