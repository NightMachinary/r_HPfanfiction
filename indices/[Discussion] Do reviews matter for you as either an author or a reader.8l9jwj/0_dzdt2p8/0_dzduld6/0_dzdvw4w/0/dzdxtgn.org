  I don't leave 100% negative reviews...

I agree with this. A good review should contain some positive things to encourage the author to continue writing.

But sometimes it's becoming harder and harder to do it, when in each new chapter the writing style is the same as in previous, but the plot itself brings more and more holes and inconsistencies.

In such cases I usually stop repeating the same positive things and it leaves just negative feedback about newly introduced things :-(
