I do not review as often as I should :( a lot of my reading is done through the ffn mobile app, often offline, while either travelling or winding down to sleep (I don't like to get notifications when I'm about to go to bed). Also, a mental holdover from my school days is that reviews are written at the end of a story, and a lot of the things I read are unfinished. Consequently, for me to write a review it usually has to either be:

- so good that it makes me pause before starting something new, so I can write between stories.
- leave lingering thoughts or something incredibly memorable that I wish to comment on
- something that makes me want to send a message of support to the author (usually either arguing against unwarranted negative reviews, constructive criticism and encouragement, etc)
- good luck and timing. Sometimes I just feel like it, and have a keyboard available, and have time.

I very rarely leave negative reviews... I suspect I've only written one or two ever. The one I remember vividly was for a story which was fun crack with some cool ideas I hadn't seen before, but no particularly special writing... until about 5 chapters from the end, when it suddenly introduced blatant Islamophobic commentary jarringly into the story. I was displeased.
