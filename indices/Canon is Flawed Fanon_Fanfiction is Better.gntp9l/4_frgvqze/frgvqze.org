First, it's a lot easier to edit than to write. Basically, all fanfiction authors are editing JKR's works. She did all the heavy lifting of creating this universe that we love to nitpick to death and tweak to our own ends.

Second, there is a lot of really crappy fanfic out there. I don't think you can support a blanket statement that it's better.
