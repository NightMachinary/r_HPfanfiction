I fundamentally disagree, as that is what a story is supposed to do. You, as the author, are supposed to do all of those things in an adequate fashion.

Canon (or JKR specifically) had all the time she wanted to layout the groundwork for her worldbuilding and character arcs. She chose to leave things dangling or unexplored and as such the story is as it is.

Yes, fanfiction is supposed build on a ready made foundation (and to a degree I can understand what you mean about them being different) but when you look at some bad fics and see stuff like an actual magic system, explorations of the locations they have made or JKR did you can see the difference.

The Harry Potter world, as given to us by canon, is bare bones. Given very little in the way of exploration or depth as the characters are seemingly uninterested and the story decides to keep them unimportant. JKR gave basic ideas that fanfiction authors have had to flesh out themselves (even JKR had to add more meat to them in subsequent/additional content over the years to actually flesh out her world).

Again, I understand your perspective, but I disagree as when compared to how far fanfiction authors have gone with the basic principles given in canon, she didn't give them a lot to work with.
