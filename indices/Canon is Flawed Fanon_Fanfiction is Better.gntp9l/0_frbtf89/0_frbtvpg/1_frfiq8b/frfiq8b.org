Yes, a story is supposed to flesh out everything to the needed degree, but a) that requires quite a lot of time and effort to do, which means that fanfiction has a big head start when a lot of the world building is already done, and b) canon is typically constrained by what can be commercially published, while fanfiction is not. If a fanfic takes a long time to explore a concept, its reader base may shrink; but an original novel that meanders will probably never be accepted by a publishing house at all.
