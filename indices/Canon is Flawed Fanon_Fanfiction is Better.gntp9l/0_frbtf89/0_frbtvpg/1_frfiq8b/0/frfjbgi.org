Meandering is not the same as taking a long time to explore a concept.

Meaningless/excessive exposition will, undoubtedly, lead to a lack of interest in many, which arguably effects fanfiction and new authors equally. As it is a sign of poor writing that will make readers automatically check out of the story. I can understand the idea behind your point (comes back to the "sandbox" argument from before) as it is effected by pre-establish popularity that may lead readers to just endure the meandering and keep reading, but that same principle can apply to new books (or even sequels of original works) as many push through the "bad stuff" to get to the good part.

Meandering in stories isn't, to me, any different an issue in scale or importance if you are writing a fanfiction or an original work, as the readers will hate it regardless.

I've made my point about HP specific worldbuilding multiple times in this thread, so look back if you'd like to see my perspective on it.
