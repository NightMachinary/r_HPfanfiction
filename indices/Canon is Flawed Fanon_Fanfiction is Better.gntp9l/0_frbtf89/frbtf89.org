Canon by nature doesn't have time to build a world, lay the groundwork, move plot along /and/ explore all of the nuances of every single character/element introduced. It would be an editing nightmare. Fanfiction allows further exploration because people can choose what interests them and run with that. Most writers of fanfic don't have to deal with building entire worlds from scratch, which gives them time to execute their ideas well. (Not saying there isn't world building involved, but definitely not to the extent JKR had to do).

I agree that some concepts are done extremely well in fanfic and I also prefer some interpretations over canon, but don't think it's possible to generalize and say one is better. The two are totally different beasts
