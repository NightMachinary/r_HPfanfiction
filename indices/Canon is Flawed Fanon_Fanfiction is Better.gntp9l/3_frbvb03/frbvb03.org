Fanfiction does some things better. I like reading digressions into magical theory, and different magic systems, and canon has barely any of that, while fanfiction explores it quite a bit. But for overall quality of writing, especially dialogue, canon is better than any fanfiction, and leagues better than the vast majority of fics.
