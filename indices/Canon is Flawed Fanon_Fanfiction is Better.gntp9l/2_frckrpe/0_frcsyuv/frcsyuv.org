I'm gonna butcher my response to someone else in this thread to the "sandbox" argument, as I don't entirely disagree. It is a lot easier, from a reader and writers perspective, to use pre-established material than to build from scratch. HOWEVER, I think JKR did a remarkably simplistic and barebones approach to her world, her characters and the storyline in general that has facilitated some incredibly in depth, nuanced and intriguing ideas, plotlines and concepts that are (effectively) entirely beholden to the authors who came up with them as JKR gave them so little to work with. Again, I agree it is harder to come up with something new than it is to work off pre-established material: but a lot of the fanfics I think of when making this argument could just change some names around and publish their works as their own individual stories and it would be well within their rights to their popularity afterwards.

To segue, although I understand the sentiment behind your Stan Lee anecdote (and think the show's over???) I point to the fact that that was still rife with it's own starting out problems that JKR/Stan Lee would have had to deal with too. Yes they are benefitting from utilising pre-established material with a pre-established fanbase (which, in a way, JKR did with fans of fantasy, just to a differing degree to fanfiction authors) authors still have to: come up with the 'unique' premise of their story, establish their plot, establish how they are going etc. They are still telling a story, with all the trappings that come with it, the beginning stage is just a bit different.
