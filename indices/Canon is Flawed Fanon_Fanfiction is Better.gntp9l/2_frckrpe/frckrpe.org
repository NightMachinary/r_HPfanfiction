LOVE your take, hahaha, this is fun to think about.

I don't think it is a fair comparison. First off, fanfics 'play in the sandbox' that the OG author created. I have read fanfics that I enjoyed much more than I did the real HP series, but those authors just piggybacked off the characters, environments, settings, and world that JKR thought up. It's much harder to be the one creating all those things, instead of just cherrypicking the things you like and improving the things you don't.

Secondly, fanfic authors have a leg up and are allowed to be lazy (not meant as an insult, specifically; after all, I am a fanfic author!). By that, I mean besides not having to do all the worldbuilding I mentioned above, fanfiction also comes with a built-in audience. There are almost 1 MILLION HP fanfics on [[https://FanFiction.net][FanFiction.net]]. That's a huge number of writers/readers, that are *already interested* in your subject material!! Now, I know that interest doesn't translate to enjoyment - golly, there are tons of ships/fics/tropes that I won't touch with a 10-foot pole - but you have a fanbase waiting for new content. Its the difference between being Stan Lee, and being one of the guys writing for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (is that still on the air? I don't like comic book stuff). So, again, fanfiction has a leg up over 'normal' authors.

Finally, and here's where I agree with you, JKR was a shit-awful YA author. Her plots were full of deus ex machinas, tired tropes, and dissatisfying conclusions. Character development in the later books was a total afterthought (Ginny might have been perfect for Harry in JKR's mind, but came out of left field in her writing. "monster in the chest" indeed....). What JKR *excelled at*, though, was children's stories. Books 1, 2, 3 were outstanding writing! She did such a great job of making you love and root for the Trio when they were little kids. I would hold up her first 3 books as being as tremendous and realistic as any fantasy story aimed at children could be. It's just that she did not have the same talent and ability to write for YA/adults, and that comes through clear as day in books 5-7 and all of her subsequent works.

That's my response, what do you think? Thanks for bringing this up, didn't realize I had so much to say!
