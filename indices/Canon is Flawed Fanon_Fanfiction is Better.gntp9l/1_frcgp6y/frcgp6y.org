Canon was targeted at little kids up to young teens. As such it wasn't as detailed as what older teens or adults would prefer. It also went long enough that the little kids grew up into adults and could have kids of their own.

When you look back at canon with adult eyes you can see the plot holes that were there or the areas of magic that were barely fleshed out. Fanon on the other hand is targeted towards older teens and adults. And it is often focused on correcting those plot holes or fleshing out those areas that canon barely addressed. As such fanon often feels/seems more complete.

In terms of writing quality, a lot of fanon is poorly written (especially from a technical/mechanics viewpoint). It may do a better job fleshing out certain things than canon did but it was written specifically to do that and for many cases an older audience. There are certain fanon authors that are very good and should pursue a writing career (i'll leave that discussion alone as it truly is an eye of the beholder assessment).

Canon gives us the bare bones framework which due to the plot holes and areas barely addressed provides flexibility for fanon authors to pursue any story line they desire and still shoehorn themselves into being "a Harry Potter story".

Some of their efforts I have truly enjoyed others were not my "cup of tea" (coffee drinker by the way üòÅ). But I am truly glad and appreciative that the fanon authors chose to write their stories and share them with the rest of us.
