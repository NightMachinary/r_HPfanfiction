Yep, I think you nailed it. Fanfiction has a very long history in the literary world, so I am not dismissing it whatsoever, but from just a story-construction standpoint, a lot of it is pretty terrible (my own is included in that statement, btw). The really great pieces usually are by authors who write 1-2 then begin publishing their own work, and more power to them.

For HP specifically, we're all just creatively playing with the toys that JKR thought up and created. I've never written anything with the scope that she accomplished in creating the HP universe. You said it perfectly when you said that fanfics can specifically appeal to certain audiences. Totally different ballgame than trying to claw out a fanbase from nothing.
