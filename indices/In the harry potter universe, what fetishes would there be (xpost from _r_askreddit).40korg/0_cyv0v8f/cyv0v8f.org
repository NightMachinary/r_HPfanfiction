Do you want the obvious answers, the intelligent answers or the fucking crazy answers to that question?

Examples:

Obvious: polyjuice potion

Intelligent: With more than one sapient species in play and the existence of animating charms that can be used on humanoid forms, magic's the progenitor of rule 34 in the hp 'verse, beating the Internet out by several thousand years. Unfortunately, it's also the progenitor of the Eternal September concept.

Fucking crazy: Dark magic has spells that induce feelings of euphoria in their casters. It could very well be that Dark Wizards took to abducting people so that they had a convenient foreplay target handy rather than due to any Dark Ritual needs. In other words, when you see or hear Riddle /crucio/ing the shit out of someone, it's more than likely he's getting his rocks off while he's doing it. Same goes for Bellatrix too...

And that's just the Unforgiveables, which come across as the most basic of Dark Spells in any Dark Wizard's arsenal. One of them gets shortened to AK, for crying out loud!

Imagine the degree of ecstacy some of the higher-level nasty stuff could possibly induce to encourage the Dark Wizards to keep casting them.
