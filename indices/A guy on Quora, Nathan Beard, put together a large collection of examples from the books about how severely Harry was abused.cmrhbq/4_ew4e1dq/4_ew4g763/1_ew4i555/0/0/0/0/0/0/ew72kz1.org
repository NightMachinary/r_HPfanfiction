1. If the protection truly worked, there was no need for Harry to die since the soul shard should not have attached itself to him.

2. Either the Basilisk venom or the Phoenix tears should have cleansed it, further removing the need for Harry to die

3. You could have killed Voldemort, removed the other Horcruxes and then done a Ghostbuster on the wraith (or simply locked him somewhere he cannot get out), again removing the need for Harry to die and therefore Dumbledore's dubious protection.

4. At various points, Dumbledore fails to actually hinder Voldemort. But no, let's just have some nebulous protection do all the work...

5. Voldemort should not have been able to get Harry to the graveyard through the canon plot if Dumbledore was competent, again making the protection a questionable choice.

6. Dumbledore could foresee that Voldemort would resurrect himself with that ritual, take Harry's blood and eventually hit Harry with an AK? Really? So why rely on that protection instead of removing his father's bones and then going back to point 3.

I could go on quite a bit on why the protection scheme was stupid and Dumbledore was either utterly incompetent or malicious, in which case he was still stupid since a Machiavellian Dumbledore would simply kill Harry once he realises that the boy was a Horcrux.
