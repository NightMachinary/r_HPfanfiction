The blood protections, their purpose, who they protected Harry from, and the role it played in keeping Harry alive was explained from the 1st book to the last. There's not one change in the explaination. The Imperius Curse was explained in the books and was consistent. The rumors about Harry were mentioned at least twice in the books.

Calling the blood protection dubious when we see it protect Harry from Voldemort in book 1, Dumbledore feeling triumph over Voldemort using Harry's blood in GOF, and Dumbledore explaining it in DH is a failure in comprehension. Not a writing failure.

I only just started going over her interviews, which actually create plotholes, I only just got onto Pottermore. I understood all this from the books.

There are a bunch of plot holes /in the books/. This thread doesn't mention any of them
