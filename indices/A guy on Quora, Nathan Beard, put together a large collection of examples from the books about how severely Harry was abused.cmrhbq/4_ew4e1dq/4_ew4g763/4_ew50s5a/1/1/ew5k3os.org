There's no proof that the wards on the house did anything at all. We never hear of anyone making any attempt to bypass them to know that they even work. At the end of OoTP when Dumbledore is justifying his treatment of Harry he mentions that Harry made it to Hogwarts safe but he doesn't reference any specific threat that ever occurred and that was the moment to do so as he was trying to convince Harry that he had done the right thing. If he could have said, you had to be with the Dursley's because on three occasions the wards there saved you from these people, he absolutely would have, as it would have made his point far better than empty platitudes about doing what he felt was best.

And as for it being not just the wards that kept Harry alive but his personal protection, both disappeared at the start of the 7th book when Harry turned 17 so it certainly wasn't what saved Harry in DH. And there is no guarantee that Harry would have been killed at the end of the first book without it either. Dumbledore was on his way and Quirrell was trying to get the stone off Harry. We don't know how things would have played out but it's likely Harry only needed a little more time before Dumbledore came to the rescue.

Also we know that the protection was tied to the wards and if one failed the other would too. But that is only because Dumbledore used the existing protection to create the wards. Lily's protection was originally on Harry. There's the possibility that had Dumbledore not interfered in the protection in order to use it to power the wards it would have just remained with Harry and he'd still have been protected.

Beyond that, even if we assume Harry absolutely had to be with the Dursley's to be safe, it doesn't mean that Dumbledore is not responsible for Harry's treatment there just because there was â€˜no other way'. One letter addressed to the cupboard under the stairs is enough to convince the Dursley's that they are being monitored by Wizards and move Harry to a proper bedroom. All Dumbledore needed to do during those 10 years was make it clear that they were being watched and their treatment of Harry would have improved. They would never have loved him but at least he might have been guaranteed food and an actual room to live in.
