  Umbridge led the "racial purge Committee" and probably has more blood on her hands than Voldemort.

Yes but my point is that she wasn't sending Dementors in support of Vodemort. I suppose she's Rowling's way of showing how everyday evil can be even worse in it's way than the big bad villain.

  But the entire scene is one giant plothole and a "The Fast and the Furious" car chase would probably have worked better, so maybe it's for the best if we don't dig too deep.

Agreed, it's obvious that she wrote it with the movie adaptation firmly in mind. It's a cool scene in the movie but is a stupid plan and makes little sense.
