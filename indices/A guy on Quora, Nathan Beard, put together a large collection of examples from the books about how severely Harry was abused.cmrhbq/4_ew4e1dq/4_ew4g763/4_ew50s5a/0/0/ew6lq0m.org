Umbridge led the "racial purge Committee" and probably has more blood on her hands than Voldemort.

The reality wrapping is out of the question since Voldemort makes a plan to attack Harry while he is still covered by the protection in DH, and that plan calls for an immediate attack upon leaving. But the entire scene is one giant plothole and a "The Fast and the Furious" car chase would probably have worked better, so maybe it's for the best if we don't dig too deep.

And Ted Tonks did a moronic camping trip instead of either staying at the impenetrable house or simply taking a plane to Madrid, Munich or Helsinki. He is Muggleborn, he ought to know that shit.
