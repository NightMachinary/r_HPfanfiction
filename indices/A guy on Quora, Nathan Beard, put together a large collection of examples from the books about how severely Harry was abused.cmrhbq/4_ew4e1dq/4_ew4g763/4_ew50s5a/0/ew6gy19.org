Then why did Ted Tonks die if his house was so impenetrable?

It's clear that many readers and fanfic authors imagine the blood protection as a Death Eater impenetrable force field surrounding 4 Privet Drive when that is never specified in the books. It could also be a reality warping spell similar to the Fidelius that makes it so that Voldemort and all those who support him simply never conceive of a plan to attack Harry Potter in or around his home. Or that whenever they attempt a plan to do so, they experience incredibly bad luck that forces them to stop this plan.

Umbridge herself was not a Voldemort supporter, she was "just" a disgusting racist and climber who thought that sending Dementors after Harry would help her/Fudge's career.
