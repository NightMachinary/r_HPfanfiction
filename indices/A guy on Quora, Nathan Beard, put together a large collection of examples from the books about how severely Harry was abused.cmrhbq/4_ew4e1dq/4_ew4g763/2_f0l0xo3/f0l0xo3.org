Okay. Question. How do they work? Because I find completely absurd that a magical protection based on a mother's sacrifice for her son relies more on the fact that her blood shares DNA with her sister's to "properly" function, and it isn't simply attached to Harry wherever he goes, because guess who has Lily's blood too? Sacrifice. Should not it be fuelled by the same feeling then? Why would it be attached to a place? It obviously doesn't protect' s him beyond being "untraceable" and inmune to Riddle specifically. Because he goes to school, he is beaten by bullies, he is emotionally abused and neglected. Do you believe, truly, he consider that house "home"? In the family sense? Really, explain it to me, how does the blood protection does work that will justify the life Harry had.
