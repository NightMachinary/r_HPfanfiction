  Harry needed to stay there for the blood protection to work
#+end_quote

The effectiveness of the so called blood protections is very dubious considering that Harry doesn't sit in the house all day and also considering the events with the Dementors. They also didn't do him any good protecting him from his evil relatives.

Additionally there's plenty of ways to magically hide and protect someone besides these blood protections (which again, aren't even that good... the only indication that they are useful is that Harry is still alive, which is just as well explained by Death Eater stupidity).

Furthermore, even if one were to accept the dubious claim that there's no other way to protect Harry (or that the blood protections are good at all), that doesn't mean that Harry has to remain there helpless and unmentored for 11 years. Usually here the Dumbledore apologia starts to boil down to him being either incompetent (can't do anything against hateful muggles) or senile (forgot about Harry or too busy).
