Dumbledore did threaten Petunia with the Howler in OoTP. He could have cowed them into submission, he just didn't want to.

Honestly he could have just gotten some of the "Old crowd" to dress up as child services agents and come and do surprise inspections to keep the Dursleys on their toes. They didn't have to love Harry, just give him three square meals a day and a decent room to sleep.
