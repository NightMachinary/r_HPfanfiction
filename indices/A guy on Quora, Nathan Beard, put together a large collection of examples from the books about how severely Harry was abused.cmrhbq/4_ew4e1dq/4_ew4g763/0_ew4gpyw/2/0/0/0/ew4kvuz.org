Yeah but actually no. Dumbledore didn't leave him completely unattended at the Dursleys, there was that old squib woman don't recall her english name.

And Petunia needed to take him in willingly. The Dursleys hated magical people something fierce, had Dumbly and co been insistent toward them to monitor their treatment of young Harry there was a risk that they would just give up custody of him.

Dumbledore did what he had to do.
