  Why would the head DMLE need Lucius' help for that? Clearly he didn't need it in the books and Lucius himself isn't this stupid.

That's not the point. He's corruptible and so is almost every other ministry worker we encounter. Just open your eyes and look: Arthur Weasley works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts department and he has a flying car, one that's freely accessible to minors! And he's literally some of the best the MoM has to offer. How are we even having this debate?! Finding a ministry worker with integrity is like a unicorn.

  The text in the suggests the only way to get rid of the Imperius Curse is for the victim to throw it off or for the caster to die. It worked because they all believed Voldemort was dead.

How does Voldemort dying prove that Lucius Malfoy was imperiused?! So, they are all stupid then? That's fine... clearly not a good place to store sensitive information among the mentally challenged. (To be very clear, I don't believe this. I don't think even Wizards can be that stupid. Malfoy clearly payed them off to get free).
