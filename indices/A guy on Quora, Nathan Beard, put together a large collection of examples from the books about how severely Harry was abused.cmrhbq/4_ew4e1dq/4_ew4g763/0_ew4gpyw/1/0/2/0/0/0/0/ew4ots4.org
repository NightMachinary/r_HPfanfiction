  Lucius Malfoy were running free

What does this have to do with high level ministry worker telling him where Harry is?

  Crouch rescuing his Death Eater son from Azkaban

Why would Crouch Sr. Tell Lucius or any other Death Eater where Harry Potter is? Nothing in what we learn about him suggests that.

Rookwood is in Azkaban from 1981 to 1996. MacNair is killing beasts. Nothing suggests Yaxley was a ministry worker until 1997.
