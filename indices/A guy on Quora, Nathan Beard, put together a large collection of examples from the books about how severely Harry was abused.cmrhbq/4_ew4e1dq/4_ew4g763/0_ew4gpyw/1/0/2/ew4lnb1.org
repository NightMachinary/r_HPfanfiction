  So, why are the blood protections so important then? Harry is most in danger by people like Lucius Malfoy or other Death Eaters seeking revenge. Not Voldemort. Voldemort isn't even alive for the first 4 Books!

Only Dumbledore and Ministry workers would know where Harry is exactly. Why would any of them give Lucius Malfoy or his ilk his location?
