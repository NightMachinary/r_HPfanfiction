  Also Fudge didn't become minister until 1990.

Fudge isn't the only corrupt person in the ministry. It has been corrupt and incompetent for decades, considering people like Lucius Malfoy were running free, Crouch rescuing his Death Eater son from Azkaban, etc. Death Eaters like Rookwood, MacNair and Yaxley worked there and that doesn't even include sympathisers or other bigots (Umbridge). A bunch of school children can literally just waltz inside and penetrate into the deepest part of their most secret departments... it's a complete joke. Any semi motivated Death Eater should be able to do it.

Nothing in relationship to the Ministry of Magic could possibly be considered reliable or information kept there secure in any way.

  You should go back and read the books. The fanon is mighty strong here

I clearly have no idea what you are talking about. You could be charitable and explain yourself... or you could gloat I guess?
