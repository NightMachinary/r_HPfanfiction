  Why would Crouch Sr. Tell Lucius or any other Death Eater where Harry Potter is?

Hey Old Crouchyboy, tell me where Harry Potter is and in return I'll free your son from Azkaban. Like this for example!

Most of these people are /corrupt/... that's the point.

  Rookwood is in Azkaban from 1981 to 1996. MacNair is killing beasts. Nothing suggests Yaxley was a ministry worker until 1997.

The ministry happily embraces Death Eaters. These people aren't at all subtle about their leaninings. Neither is Malfoy, who is on the Board of Governors for Hogwarts and obviously holds lots of sway in the ministry. This isn't really up for debate.

We should make a list, I think the amount of Ministry characters that are either incompetent, evil, or both is probably larger than those not fitting any of those criteria. Who do we even have on the "good" side? Amelia Bones... maybe? Though most of that is fanon... Tonks, I guess? Help me, I'm grasping at straws here. We even have good guys like Arthur who are completely pants (and corrupt) at their job.
