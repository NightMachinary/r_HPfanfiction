There's literally one identified death eater still working at the ministry and he kills animals. Also Fudge didn't become minister until 1990.

  Uhm yeah, OOTP. That doesn't account for all the years prior. Unless you want to raise a conspiracy theory that I've never heard before: That Dumbledore had secretly been hiring aurors to protect Privet Drive for 14 years or so

You should go back and read the books. The fanon is mighty strong here
