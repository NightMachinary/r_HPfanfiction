Why would the head of the DMLE need Lucius' help for that? Clearly he didn't need it in the books and Lucius himself isn't this stupid.

#+begin_quote
  He got off with "I was imperiused" which is a completely ridiculous defense since literally anyone could use it for any crime and obviously the ministry won't usually accept it (or their legal system would be entirely broken. I assume this unbeatable "imperius defense" would quickly gain popularity among criminals).

The text in the books suggests the only way to get rid of the Imperius Curse is for the victim to throw it off or for the caster to die. It worked because they all believed Voldemort was dead. As such a common criminal can't use that defense...

Again, I suggest you back and read the books.
