  That's not the point. He's corruptible and so is almost every other ministry worker we encounter. Just open your eyes and look: Arthur Weasley works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts department and he has a flying car, one that's freely accessible to minors! And he's literally some of the best the MoM has to offer. How are we even having this debate?! Finding a ministry worker with integrity is like a unicorn.

What does any of this have to do with giving up Harry Potter's location? Stay on topic.

  How does Voldemort dying prove that Lucius Malfoy was imperiused?! So, they are all stupid then?

Voldemort and his Death Eaters were Imperiusing everyone and there's no way to prove Lucius wasn't under the Imperius Curse /because/ the only way to stop the Imperius Curse is by the death of the caster or throwing it off.

Magic isn't infallible. "The other side has magic, too" should've covered this.

Holy shit, dude, you are quite literally arguing things explained and demonstrated in the books.
