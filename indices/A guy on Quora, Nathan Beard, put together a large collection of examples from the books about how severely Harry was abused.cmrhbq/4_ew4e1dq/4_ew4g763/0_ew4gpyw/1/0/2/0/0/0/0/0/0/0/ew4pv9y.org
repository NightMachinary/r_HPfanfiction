  After Fudge became Minister in 1990.

He got off with "I was imperiused" which is a completely ridiculous defense since literally anyone could use it for any crime and obviously the ministry won't usually accept it (or their legal system would be entirely broken. I assume this unbeatable "imperius defense" would quickly gain popularity among criminals). Therefore he held sway (monetary or through status) earlier than Fudge.

Or are you going with the "Wizards are just retarded" line of apologia and they just accepted "I was imperiused" for no other reason than stupidity? This suits me well, since my whole point is that the Ministry can not be relied upon. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt by assuming that they are all corrupt instead of taking the short bus to school.
