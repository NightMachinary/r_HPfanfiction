I have this thing, this big plot hole in CS. How, a smart - because truly, to be where he is, he has to be - politician like Lucius doesn't find super strange that his elf, who by all accounts has never met Harry, is so bloody protective of him? Why, does Harry, the brat, tricked him into freeing his elf? It would at least make me curious in his position once I calmed down from the anger and humiliation. How, did Lucius Malfoy didn't discovered then the elf loophole to wards? And even if the wards can read intent, how hard is to trick, to manipulate an elf? A borrowed elf even, to kidnap Harry for a "surprise party"? Just a thought.
