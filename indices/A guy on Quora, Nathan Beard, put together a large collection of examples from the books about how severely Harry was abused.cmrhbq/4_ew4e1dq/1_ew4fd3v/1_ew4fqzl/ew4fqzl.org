I doubt she did when she wrote it or she would have written it differently. Her clumsly attempts to reconcile Dumbledore's actions with his characters (most prominent in Book 5) are evidence of this. She just wanted her benevolent old Grandfather magical mentor and the poor abused boy ripped out of his old world, thrust into the new. She had a similar problem with Severus Snape, where she had this tragic hero archetype in mind and just failed to pull it off.

There's plenty of these situations in the later books where JKR goes out of her way to explain herself through her characters' voices "You see, it all makes sense because..." and I can't imagine any author doing it this way if they had thought of the implications beforehand.
