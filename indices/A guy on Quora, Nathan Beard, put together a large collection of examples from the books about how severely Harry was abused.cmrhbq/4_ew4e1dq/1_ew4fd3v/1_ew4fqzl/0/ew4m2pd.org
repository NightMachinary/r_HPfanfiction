Snape is a tragic hero. He's also a bad person. Those two don't contradict each other (though they often go hand in hand in fiction) and Rowling never tried to make him out to have been a paragon of virtue. He was a petty, bitter person who didn't value his life much and so was willing to sacrifice it to defeat the murderer of the woman he loved - not to save the world, and not because of idealism.

Similarly, Dumbledore was never meant to be a paragon of virtue. He's not the manipulative old man bash fics portray him as, he didn't set Harry up to face Voldy in the mirror room at the end of PS. But he did knowingly let Harry suffer, and feels guilty for that even in the early books.
