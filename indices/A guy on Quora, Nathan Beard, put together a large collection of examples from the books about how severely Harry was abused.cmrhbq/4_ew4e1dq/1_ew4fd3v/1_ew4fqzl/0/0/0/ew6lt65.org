I think they mean hero in the Greek sense, not in the modern sense.

A Hero in the Greek sense is a person of special strength, courage, and ability. This is something that Snape definitely was, as he managed to spy on Voldemort for Dumbledore without being caught. However, they don't have to be good people, and often weren't.

Snape is a Tragic Hero in the sense that he got so lost in his bitterness and hate that he became the thing he hated most: a bully.
