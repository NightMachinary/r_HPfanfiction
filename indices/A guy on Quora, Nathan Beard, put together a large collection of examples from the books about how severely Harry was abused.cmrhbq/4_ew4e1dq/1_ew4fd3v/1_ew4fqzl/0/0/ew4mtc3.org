  Snape is a tragic hero
#+end_quote

I probably shouldn't have mentioned Snape, because I can certainly see a bit more of a point here as opposed to Dumbledore (Dumbledore as a 'failed' character is more clear cut to me).

The term "tragic hero" is probably very subjective, but I wouldn't call Snape any kind of hero. I'm not saying this crude comparison is exactly the same, but would you call a school shooter who regrets it and starts giving CPR to one of his victims (while leaving all the others to die) a hero? Probably not. And this is somewhat the same way I see Snape. What he does is barely enough to make up for the pain and suffering he and his precious Dark Lord (people tend to forget that he joined Voldemort willingly and only objected when it was his teenage crush that was supposed to be murdered) brought upon the world. Elevating him to a hero is vile (to my moral compass... I acknowledge that some people look at it differently). I'm not even sure that he even balances the scales. "Oh great, you are trying to make up for the other piece of shit that you are, how great. No. Wait. That's literally the least you could do you garbage person!"
