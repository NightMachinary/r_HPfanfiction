How does any of this reflect badly on Rowling as an author? Her books have various evil acts in them, including child abuse. That doesn't mean they're bad books, or don't make sense.

Part of the beauty of the books is the way they teach that we can't trust “good guys” to do the right thing all the time. Just about all of her characters, even ones who seem mostly good, seriously fuck things up at some point. This makes perfect sense because real people fuck up like that too. This is an important lesson that everyone should learn, not to blindly trust people just because they give a good first impression.
