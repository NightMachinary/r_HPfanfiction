Not everyone is affected by abuse the same way or to the same degree. Harry is shown to be somewhat affected by his upbringing.

- He is not outgoing, he doesn't have many close friends aside from Ron and Hermione. He is the most popular child in the wizarding world, and yet his social circle only really expands in 4th and 5th year. I imagine a Harry raised by Sirius would be the Cedric Diggory of his year.

- He doesn't trust adults (and authority in general), and prefers to keep things secret from them in ways that often end up badly for him. It doesn't help that the few times he tries to reach out to adults he's often rebuked or ignored.

I'd expect him to be more affected, but to say this has no effect on him is wrong.
