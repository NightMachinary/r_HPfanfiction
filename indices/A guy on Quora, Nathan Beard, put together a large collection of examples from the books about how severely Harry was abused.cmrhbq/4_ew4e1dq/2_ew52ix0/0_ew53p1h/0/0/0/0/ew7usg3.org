Harry's shown to get along with most of the people in Gryffindor, interacts with the Quidditch team, and forms a deep enough bond with the DA that they hex Malfoy and Co. for him on the train at the end of OotP. If we went around exploring every single conversation and relationship that Harry has, each book would be a few thousand pages. Rowling chooses interactions and and events that move her various plots forward.

Adults is a mixed bag. Harry trusts Dumbledore, he listens to Dumbledore. He also trusts Sirius and Lupin, expressing fears and feelings to each in different turns. Realistically, the only time he was rebuked from getting help was in Sorcerer's Stone, and that was a device to make sure that Harry went down the trap door.
