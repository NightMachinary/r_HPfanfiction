  Did we read the same books? There are plenty of times Harry doesn't act normal and well-adjusted.

What are you talking about? He's completely normal, he immediately makes friends at Hogwarts, is outgoing, not afraid of adults (he even gives them lip and challenges them), comfortable sleeping with a bunch of strangers in a dorm, no panic attacks while locked-in or restrained, literally anything else that Harry says or does. This is not even remotely close how a kid that has been living in a cupboard would act. At all.

Not that I desperately want to read about incredibly angsty and asocial Harry with PTSD, but it's part of the deal if you want your protagonist have such a shit upbringing.
