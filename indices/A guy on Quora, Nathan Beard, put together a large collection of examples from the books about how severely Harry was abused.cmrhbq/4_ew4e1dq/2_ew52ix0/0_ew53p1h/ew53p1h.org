  How does any of this reflect badly on Rowling as an author? Her books have various evil acts in them, including child abuse. That doesn't mean they're bad books, or don't make sense.

I disagree. We are clearly not meant to think too much about the child abuse. It's not like Rowling with the intent of exploring the subject. It's just a plot device, so that we can have a young hero ripped out of his world, who doesn't have many ties with his old one and happily embraces the new. This is why it's in the book, not because Rowling wanted to show the evils of child abuse. It's even more blatant considering how perfectly normal and well-adjusted Harry acts in almost all instances (you'll have to go to fanfics to see a Harry that's a bit more authentic in regards to his background).

Just imagine if Harry had been a normal kid with a more or less normal upbringing: Rowling would constantly have to address and involve Harry's guardians who are worried about their kid into the stories, wanting to remove him from Hogwarts, Harry would have been homesick and not appreciated Hogwarts as much, etc.

It's like you defending the fantasy cliche about the hometown of the hero being burned down by orcs and his parents murdered and saying "well, it's important to show the evils of parent-murdering-orcs", that's not bad writing. Sure... fine. It's still cheap and dumb writing though and no one would seriously argue that some kind of point about the ethics of warfare is being made by the author (besides the surface level of orcs = bad, poor orphan boy = good)?! It's just a lazy way to get the story going.
