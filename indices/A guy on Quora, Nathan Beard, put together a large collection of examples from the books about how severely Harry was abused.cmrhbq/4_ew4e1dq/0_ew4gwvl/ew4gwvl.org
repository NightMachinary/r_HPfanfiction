Wasn't that the entire point?

Like, I think its fanon that the Wizarding World is a wonderful world. A /lot/ of what Rowling puts into the HP books is a scathing critique of elements of her own society, British society, with its different rules for different classes, corrupt and manipulative media, jobs for the boys and money used to open doors, and extending to things like bigotry having a blind eye turned to it when its not politically expedient.

Just because a character is on the side of the angels and is perceived as good by other characters does not mean necessarily we are to read them as a perfect character. That's almost surface level in Deathly Hallows rather than subtext.
