  Just because a character is on the side of the angels and is perceived as good by other characters does not mean necessarily we are to read them as a perfect character.

No you definitely have a point, but this is part of the "backpedaling" I've been talking about in another comment. JKR acknowledges some of the problems she created in the later books, but only at the barest minimum level, so that people can say "see it all makes sense".

But lets be more concrete, maybe you can explain it to me in a way that makes sense for the first time ever: Lets assume for a second that the favorite bashing theories (Dumbledore left Harry downtrodden and abused so that Harry would look up to him and to better manipulate Harry...) are untrue. How does it make even a lick of sense that Harry is just left to his own devices for 10 years by Dumbledore, with a Dumbledore who knows about the prophecy, knows about Voldemort's likely survival and knows that Harry most likely would have to face Voldemort or his followers in battle? Why would he do this if he isn't evil, incompetent or senile? Who would just dump prophecy boy with Wizard hating muggles and not look after him on a weekly basis (by proxy if necessary)?

Just to pre-empt: Don't give me that "normal childhood" bullcrap. That's both incompetent and senile. Clearly Harry didn't have a normal childhood and obviously having a normal childhood is not preferable over being alive (which Dumbledore seems to acknowledge... blablabla blood protections, it's necessary, but hey, on the other hand you have to remain innocent and pure when it suits my reasoning).
