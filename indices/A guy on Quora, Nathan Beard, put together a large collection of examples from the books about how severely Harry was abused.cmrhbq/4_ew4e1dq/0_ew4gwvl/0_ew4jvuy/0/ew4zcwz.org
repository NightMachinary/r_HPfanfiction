...didn't you just explain in Your earlier post that JK was a flawed author, and sometimes when you think about it what she wrote makes no fucking sense?

So, my answer is it doesn't make any sense whatsoever and it was an unfortunate implication left as a result of JK being a less than perfect author.

So the result is people arguing over the spirit of what the text was trying to convey and what the actual word of the text conveyed to those who deigned to think on it.
