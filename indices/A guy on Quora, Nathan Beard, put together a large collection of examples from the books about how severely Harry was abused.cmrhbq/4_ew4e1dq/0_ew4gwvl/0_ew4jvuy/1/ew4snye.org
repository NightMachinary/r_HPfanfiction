Simple, there's a good reason that children can't have a wand and learn magic before they turn 11 (not sure what, doesn't truly matter) so even if he wanted to he couldn't train Harry to fight, not to mention that he doesn't think Harry needs to be trained.\\
The prophecy is fate, noone but Harry can kill Voldemort and noone but Voldemort can kill Harry and they will face each other one day, therefore Harry's safety is all but guaranteed. His mother's protection, which requires that he live with his only relatives, will defend him from Voldemort (and is likely what Dumbledore expects to finally slay him, not superior dueling ability) and his followers as long as he's there. He still moves Mrs. Figg into the area, and unless she says there's a problem he has no reason to pay extra attention.\\
He then comes to school, does admirably when he faces Voldemort, the protection proving its worth, showing that keeping it active is clearly the key to his victory. I personally think the Mirror would have kept the stone safe indefinitely if Harry hadn't been there, and if not then certainly lasted long enough for Dumbledore to face the intruder (something clearly tipped him off so that he returned). So while getting the boy his letter had been a problem, it's clear the current path is the right one and Harry himself is healthy enough (Pomphrey certainly examined him enough times).\\
The protection is perhaps less effective after Voldemort returns, but the house should still be the safest place (the death eaters never do manage to get past it's protection after all, they're forced to wait until it runs out), add in the realisation that Voldemort can likely see through Harry's eyes, perhaps even possess him or read his mind and it seems best to keep him away from the Order and what they know, lest it leak to Voldemort. He's moved when the dementors attack, this might even call into question the safety of Privet Drive, but then at the end of the year we learn that it wasn't Voldemort or his followers, which explains why the protection failed, along with Mundungus being an idiot (but when you're slandered by the government you can't be picky, and at least he can be trusted not to betray them).\\
Then 6th year comes and suddenly we're on a time limit, that cursed ring somehow got Dumbledore, he doesn't know where the other Horcruxes would be, only that the locations matter to Tom, so he teaches Harry everything he knows about the man, in the hopes Harry will be able to do some investigating of his own, the rest of his time is spent searching and investigating in person whenever he's not needed at the ministry or Hogwarts. Then he dies.
