  Simple, there's a good reason that children can't have a wand and learn magic before they turn 11 (not sure what, doesn't truly matter) so even if he wanted to he couldn't train Harry to fight, not to mention that he doesn't think Harry needs to be trained.

I can understand why you'd immediately jump to the "turn Harry into a warrior soldier" (like the other poster) conclusion, but that's truly not what I'm thinking of. Having Harry being a well adjusted kid, who experienced love, knows about the sacrifice of his parents, a kid who has friends and knows about who he is is a universally good thing. At least if you put all your bets on this kid.

  therefore Harry's safety is all but guaranteed

This literal interpretation is nonsense and I doubt very much Dumbledore believes in it. In fact I think Dumbledore makes it very clear that the prophecy is only significant because Voldemort believes in its inevitability.

Outside of what Dumbledore believes the Prophecy giving Harry some kind of invulnerability from anyone besides Voldemort just turns most of the books into a big joke. Dementors? No big deal! Last minute rescue by Fawkes? Completely unnecessary... etc.

but... Harry leaves the House regularly. Why would they attack the house? That's stupid. Just stab/AK/whatever him in the back while he's getting chased by Dudley through the streets.
