  Canon is very clear that Harry deliberately has a shitty childhood and adolescence deliberately to isolate him and leave him ripe to be manipulated into becoming a martyr for the wizarding world, for the greater good, to have low self-worth and sacrifice himself willingly for those who showed him kindness. DH and the books up to it lay that out quite plainly not even in the subtext. It's a big plot point.

I don't think most people would agree with this. Most argue that Harry's circumstances are just incidental (like him having to stay in an abusive household to be protected).

What you are arguing is considered fanon Dumbledore bashing by most people.
