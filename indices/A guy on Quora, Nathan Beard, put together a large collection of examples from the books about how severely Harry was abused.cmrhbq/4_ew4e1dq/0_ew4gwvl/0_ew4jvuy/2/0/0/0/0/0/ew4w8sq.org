  Harry, too, never quite understands what has been done to him. That's a tragedy in its own way.

I agree, but this kind of character catharsis was not wanted by JKR. She wanted the innocent and sacrificial jesus figure and went with that all the way.

In my opinion the least Dumbledore could have done is tell Harry everything, see whether that changes him and if it does just obliviate the crap out of him. At least that would have forced Dumbledore to take some moral responsibilities for his actions. But I guess that would have been "evil"?
