Then honestly I think many people have been taken in by their own positive memories and belief that Dumbledore was a gentle man who could do no wrong, which is ironically something that the wizarding world were fools to believe and a key theme and plot element of Deathly Hallows. Very clever writing by Rowling tbh!

Just like wizards - and Muggles - readers are ignoring the evidence in favour of believing a more positive fantasy that doesn't come to grips with the harsh reality. Harry, too, never quite understands what has been done to him. That's a tragedy in its own way.
