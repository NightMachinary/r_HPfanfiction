I'm afraid I don't follow the crux of your comment. Are you talking about canon or fanon?

Canon is very clear that Harry deliberately has a shitty childhood and adolescence deliberately to isolate him and leave him ripe to be manipulated into becoming a martyr for the wizarding world, for the greater good, to have low self-worth and sacrifice himself willingly for those who showed him kindness. DH and the books up to it lay that out quite plainly not even in the subtext. It's a big plot point.

I'm not sure where assuming that that is untrue is coming from. I certainly don't when it's right there. I can appreciate why an AU would like to not, but that's a whole different issue.
