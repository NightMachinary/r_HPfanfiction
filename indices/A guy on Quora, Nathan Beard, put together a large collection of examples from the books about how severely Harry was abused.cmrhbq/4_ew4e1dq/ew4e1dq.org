None of this would be in any way contentious, but many people are very deeply ideologically invested in the idea that Rowling is a wonderful author that can do no wrong. If you can't accept the fact that there's many parts of HP that are terribly written and make no sense, you will be almost incapable of accepting that Harry has been abused, because suddenly a lot of the supposedly good guys don't look so good anymore: Yet this makes no sense, since a good writer wouldn't write things that make no sense and they wouldn't want their paragons of virtue to look like gigantic assholes.

So instead of realizing that JKR fucked up and didn't think many things through at all they have to jump through all kinds of hoops to explain away what's clearly written in the books.

If it weren't for this kind of cognitive dissonance I doubt I'd have to explain to people that Harry was abused and that Dumbledore is a bastard for putting him there (and I'm convinced that 99% of people would agree if I removed these situations from the context of HP, yet somehow when we are talking about HP child abuse and neglect are some kind of grey moral issue and people aren't responsible at all for their charges who they place with abusers).
