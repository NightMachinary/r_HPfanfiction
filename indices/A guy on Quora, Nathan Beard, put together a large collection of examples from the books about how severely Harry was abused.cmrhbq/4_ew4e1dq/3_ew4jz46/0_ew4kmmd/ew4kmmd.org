It's possible. Book 7 definitely was the point that unraveled the books for me, but I didn't even question a lot of things prior to that ("Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!").

I think it's a common (psychological?) phenomenon to go along with a lot of things unquestioningly until a breaking point is reached.

It's a decent question though, why DH wasn't /that/ for some people. The flight of the seven Potters certainly did me in.
