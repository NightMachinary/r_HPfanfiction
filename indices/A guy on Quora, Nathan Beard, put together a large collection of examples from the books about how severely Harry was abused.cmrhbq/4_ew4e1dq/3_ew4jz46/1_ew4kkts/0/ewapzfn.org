I like the Deathly Hallows as items. I don't actually remember what happened in the book, though I remember enjoying it, realizing how much it was wanking over Snape and Dumbledore, hating it, liking it again, and then feeling extremely confused and annoyed that Harry married the fangirl who barely interacted with him outside of moments where she was a fourth wheel to the Golden Trio. I'm pretty sure Harry and Luna shared more 1 on 1 time them Harry and Ginny.

I'll ship Harry with just about any girl, but Ginny honestly stumps me. I can't think of any reason for them to be together except that she's Ron's sister.

My current favorite pairing with Harry is Daphne, because I don't remember them ever interacting in canon and it amuses me, or Tsukino Usagi, which is from this crackfic where Sailor Moon's ghost starts following him around and a drug addicted and senile Dumbledore wanted to get Harry M-preg by Snape to unlock the live powers to defeat Voldemort. It's ridiculous.

That got kinda off on a tangent, but meh.

TL;DR DH = Fun Mythical Weaponry; HP shouldn't have tossed them away. Ginny is just wtf; crackships are also fun to am extent.
