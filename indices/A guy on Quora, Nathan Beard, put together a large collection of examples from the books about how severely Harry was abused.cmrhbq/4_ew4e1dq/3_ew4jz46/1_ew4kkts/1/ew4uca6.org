I think it's great! I'm unsure why people didn't like it to be honest. It's between that and OOTP for my favourite of the entire series.

Of course, it lifts out from being a whimsical teenage school mystery story, but that's a strength rather than a weakness in my opinion. I can understand disappointment if that was what certain readers hoped from it.
