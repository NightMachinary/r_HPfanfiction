Of course not, and I said as much. I was only taking issue with the argument the original post was making, not the conclusions that were reached or the evidence that was presented. The story grows with Harry, so it makes sense that the way he perceives the world in the first book is that of a child. Since all but like 2 chapters in the whole book are told from Harry's point of view, everything is filtered by his way of looking at the world.

The OP treats the hyperbolic thoughts and words of a 10 year old as objective truth, even going so far as to ignore the idiomatic use certain threats and treat them as though Harry wouldn't know to interpret them as such, despite him being shown to be a clever child. Many children of abuse tend to be clever, because spotting the difference between bluster and impending violence is a means of survival.
