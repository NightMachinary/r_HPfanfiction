My biggest issue with this guy's thesis, which I largely agree with, is that he never seems to acknowledge that the books are told from Harry's point of view. We're seeing the world through the eyes of a kid who's seen some shit, but who is still human. Pretty much every kid has, at some point, said "My mom/dad/adult would kill me!" It's not necessarily an indication of habitual abuse or a real fear for their lives, but totally normal hyperbole. Harry's words, those cases, shouldn't necessarily be taken as literal without additional context, however there is plenty of evidence in the text that he suffered severe physical and emotional abuse at the hands of the Dursleys.

If you wanna give a shit about authorial intent, it's clear that when Rowling wrote the first book, she was going for a more fantastical children's story than what she ended up with in the end. Something like Matilda, with adults doing over the top violence to children, and the kids getting one over on them in the end. That level of violence is out of place in the story that Harry Potter became, and the transition between the two was...not smooth.
