I disagree that the phrase, since it's common vernacular, is a red flag in individual cases without additional context. The issues that cause these phrases to continue to linger is baked deep into american culture, and it seeps up in things like this all the time. The language we use, the way we view the world, the fact that we still believe in things like possession by right of conquest and that the majority of our funds goes to funding a military that is far beyond any reasonable need. Every one of these things contributes to this culture of violence.

Not every "I'm gonna kick your ass for that" is an actual threat of violence. It's not an indicator that the speaker will enact violence, and nor that they are the target of violence. It's an indication that they were raised in a culture of violence that sees blowing someone's head off as totally fine, but tits are taboo.

This is why context matters. If spoken by a tearful 4 year old, it's an immediate cause for alarm. If spoken by an adult who forgot to water her mom's plants while she was out of town, or a teenager when they backed mom's new car into the mailbox, it's probably hyperbole.
