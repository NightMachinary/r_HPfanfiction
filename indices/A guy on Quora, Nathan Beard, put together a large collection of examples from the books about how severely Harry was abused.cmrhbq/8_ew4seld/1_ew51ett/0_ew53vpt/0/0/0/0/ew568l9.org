No, it's a common idiom because our society presents violence as an expected retaliation for everything. You're completely ignoring the fact that in real life, this is literally a way that that phrase is used even when nobody is being abused.

From [[https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/I%27m+going+to+kill]] (one) is going to kill (someone)

One will be extremely, belligerently angry with someone (though not with an actual intent to kill them). Mom is going to kill you if she finds out you broke her antique vase!
