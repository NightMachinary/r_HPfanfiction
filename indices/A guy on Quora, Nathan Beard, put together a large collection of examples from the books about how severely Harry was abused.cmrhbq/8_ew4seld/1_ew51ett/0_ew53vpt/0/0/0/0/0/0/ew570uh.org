Can you quote the part where I said no one is being abused? You keep referencing it, but I've stated several times that not only is abuse common, it's clearly something that Harry suffered at the hands of the Dursleys based on the text.

I never argued that abused didn't happen. I argued that the original poster's argument had some flaws, which it does, regardless of whether I agree with his conclusions or not. I'm coming at this as a mother of 5 healthy happy kiddos who holds a degree in english lit.
