You said that this phrase isn't a sign of abuse. I'm sorry I don't have the link, but I read an article by an American whose family moved to, I think, Sweden when he was a kid. So this American kid is hanging out with Swedish kids, and at some point says some normal American thing like “My parents will kill me if I do x” and the Swedish kids were like “wtf?”

Pretty soon, social workers came to visit his family to talk about the “abuse,” and all of them, even the kid, were like, “Ha, this is just a silly misunderstanding. That's just a phrase. We just discipline our kids the normal way,” and the social workers were like, “The normal way?” and when they got details, said, “That's abuse. That's illegal here.” After some parenting classes, the American parents learned a more Swedish parenting style that doesn't involve violence or death threats.

The adult writing this marveled that he'd been sending up this big red flag without even realizing it. He'd accepted the American culture of violence so blindly, he hadn't even realized how messed up it is.
