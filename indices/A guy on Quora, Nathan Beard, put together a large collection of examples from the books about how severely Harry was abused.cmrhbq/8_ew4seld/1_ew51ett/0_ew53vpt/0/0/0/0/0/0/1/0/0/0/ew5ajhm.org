If you're asking if I agree that "(mom/dad/boss/teacher) is going to kill (me/you/us/them)" should be universally considered a red flag, I don't, and my previous response explained why.

Your unsourced Swedish example further illustrates why context matters. A swedish social worker is likely not steeped in American culture, and is likely less familiar with American idiom. A decent american social worker is more likely to be familiar with the phrase and the common ways that its used.
