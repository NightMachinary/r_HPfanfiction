I never said my parents would kill me. My kids have never said their parents would kill them. If this is a common phrase, that shows how common child abuse is, not that kids exaggerate.

If wives commonly said, “My husband would kill me” that would be a sign of domestic abuse, no? Family members threatening each other with violence, even death, is not healthy.
