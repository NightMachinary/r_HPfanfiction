This. This is why, I just can't, can't forgive Albus Dumbledore's character. You can give me all the fucking explanations for why that house was his best shot in '81. It wasn't in '91 when a letter was addressed to a cupboard, or in '92 when there were bars on his window- and you can tell me how adults thought it was just Fred and George being them, trying to avoid punishment from taking the car - he ask to not be sent back. He is taught that only magical danger matters. That his state of mind doesn't. That his health is minimal concern. He may not think this consciously, but unconsciously? This is the 17 yo who spite having finally people who loved him and cared for him, accepted to kill himself. Because magic, the world, everyone was more important than him.
