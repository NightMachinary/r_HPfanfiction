  The frying pan incident where Petunia tries to hit Harry with a frying pan. We are given no indication that she swing this pan with all her might and aimed to uppercut him with the pan.

Yeah, no. The exact quote is

#+begin_quote
  he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan.
#+end_quote

What do we learn from this sentence. Petunia 'aims' her blow specifically at Harry's head. The strike is 'heavy' which means she may well have been putting quite some strength behind it. The frying pan in question is soapy, Petunia's hand are likely also soapy, she could have easily lost control of it and it could have slipped out of her hands.

Harry is noted multiple times to have great reflexes, especially given the position he plays in Quidditch which basically requires them. His ability to dodge is therefore likely to be higher than the average person's. Not including the fact that he likely began to react as soon as she turned, rather than mid-swing, because of previous experience. Harry comments in HBP that 'long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible'.
