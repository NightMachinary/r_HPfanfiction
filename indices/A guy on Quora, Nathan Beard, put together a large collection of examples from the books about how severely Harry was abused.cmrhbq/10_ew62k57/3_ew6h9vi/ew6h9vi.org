Hate to pop the bubble here but neglect is an objective form of abuse. Withholding food is sometimes a harsh punishment dished out but the abuse comes in the fact that they did it so often when we clearly see that harry did not deserve such a punishment.

With the frying pan, you could do a bit of a test here, go to the kitchen and lightly bop yourself on the head with one, should you? No, of course not, getting bopped with any sort of metal object freaking hurts. Frying pans are different than belts obviously, belts ,when used, inflict pain, pans cause physical injury.

With Dudley and the dursleys I think you should just read the linked post from OP they highlight the reality of the situation pretty well. That's pretty much all the explaining needed there.

That being said "x is a child, children exaggerate" is probably the absolute worst thing you can say when confronted with the possibility that a child is being abused. An important thing to ask yourself is "what age would a child need to be before I WOULD believe them when they say they're being beaten to a pulp".

Finally with dumbledore. There's more options out there than tell a baby "a terrorist is after him and he's the only one who can kill said terrorist" and sending him to a home filled with the "worst sort of muggles". I dont blame dumbledore for not knowing what hellhole he put harry in, the guy clearly trusted the woman he put in charge of watching over him so if anything it's her fault Harry's life was absolute shit for over a decade. doesn't change the fact that harry was abused either way.
