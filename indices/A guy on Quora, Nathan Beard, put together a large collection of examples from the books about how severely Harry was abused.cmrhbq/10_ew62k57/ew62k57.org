I always get downvoted on these threads due to the fact that my opinion is the complete opposite of everyone else and it causes issues.

Harry was not abused, per se. I do believe he was neglected, though. He was not â€˜starved', but he was not given the right amount of food for a growing boy. There is nothing to indicate that all he got was a piece of stale bread and some soup each day. The only time we see food withheld is when he does something wrong, which is a very common punishment.

There are two points that are used as a case of abuse.

1. Frying pan incident

The frying pan incident where Petunia tries to hit Harry with a frying pan. We are given no indication that she swing this pan with all her might and aimed to uppercut him with the pan. He managed to dodge the pan, which proves that it was going a speed that allowed him to actively react to. For all we know, she swung it at the back of his head with little force in an attempt to bump him with it. You know, much like people do when they slap the back of someone's head.

Also, the book was set in the late 80s and early 90s. I am certain a lot of kids were hit with the belt or other household objects. I mean, my mum was often hit by whatever her mother had in her hand.

1. Dudley.

This one is grasping at straws.

However, the series is seen through the eyes of a child and children exaggerate. He was not beaten to a pulp as he still spoke back to the Durley's, still had fun, and was still mischievous. Sure, maybe he was a little bit, it is nothing like the average fanfic portrays for a cheap gimmick and weak backstory.

As for Dumbledore, this just amuses me because what else could he do? He wanted to give Harry a regular life without having to worry about having a raving murderer after you. Imagine telling him and then watching as the boy grew up scared and afraid. Also, he is not the only person to put a child with their family, even if it is a bad thing to do.
