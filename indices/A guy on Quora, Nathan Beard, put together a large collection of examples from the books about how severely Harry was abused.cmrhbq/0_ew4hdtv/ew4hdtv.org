One of the main reasons that I fell in love with the Harry Potter series is because of the abuse, I identified directly with it. I spent several years in a similar environment, I was locked in a closet, I had no bed, I had been handcuffed to a radiator at night, I was denied food for days at a time as punishment. I was force to dig a ditch around our house so my step father could fix the leaking basement, had to sleep in said basement until the job was complete. etc etc, I remained in this situation until I was 8 and the state came and took me from it. I know what abuse is and Harry was definitely abused. In regards to the justification of being denied food only a couple of days, This is a horrible thing for anyone to go through, much less a child. The matters of Harry's abuse is only compounded by the fact that Dudley was treated so well to the point of spoiling. There are signs of physical abuse as well, but they are mostly in the form of Dudley and his crew "Harry Hunting." Vernon and Petunia encouraged the behavior even going so far as to telly Dudley to hit him with the Smelting's Stick.

I can understand why most people shy away from characterizing Harry's treatment as abuse, because it makes people uncomfortable. People who haven't been through it don't understand it and most can't identify anything but extreme abuse as abuse.

I don't think it needs to be said but, I say let everyone enjoy Harry Potter in terms that they enjoy it in and stop criticizing them for not enjoying it the way you do.
