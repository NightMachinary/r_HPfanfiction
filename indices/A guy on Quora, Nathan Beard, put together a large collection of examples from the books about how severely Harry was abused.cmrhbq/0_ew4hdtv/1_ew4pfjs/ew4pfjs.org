  I don't think it needs to be said but, I say let everyone enjoy Harry Potter in terms that they enjoy it in and stop criticizing them for not enjoying it the way you do.

I agree with everything else you've said but this, especially in cases where people use excuse of "children's book" and their enjoyment of the story to downplay child abuse. I feel like I have to call people out in these cases.

The stories we tell ourselves, that we read, shape who we are and how we look at the world. I have not faced it personally IRL but I will not excuse child abuse of any sort nor will I ever allow others to do so without challenge. Nor should you.
