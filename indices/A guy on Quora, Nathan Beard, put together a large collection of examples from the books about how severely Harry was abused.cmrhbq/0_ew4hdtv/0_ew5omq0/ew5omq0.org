I understand and get that it's abuse, what I fucking hate is how the books just have people saying it's no big deal. I really do think that it was ignored or treated as no deal. That's why I love Manipulative or Neglectful Dumbledore fan fics. It provides a reason for such actions, and doesn't paint outright neglect as a minor thing.
