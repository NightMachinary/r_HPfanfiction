I don't know.... this guy's reading of the books comes across as a little biased. He infers a lot of things from offhand remarks made by the characters and then calls it "proof." I'm sorry, but Vernon saying that he SHOULD have beaten Harry, or THREATENING to beat Harry, or Vernon just "being the sort of person who WOULD hit Harry," is NOT proof that Vernon beat Harry on a regular basis. There's a lot of "if this character said/did this, then OBVIOUSLY they must also have done THIS, which means they were ALWAYS doing it."

I definitely see how emotionally invested he is in this, which I get... I mean, child abuse is a serious topic, and I think he mentions having been abused as a child himself. So it's not like I don't understand where he's coming from. But I think he's kind of making the common mistake of having drawn the conclusion first and then deliberately reading the text in a way that supports his conclusion while ignoring the parts of the text that don't.

I checked his FFN profile, and the profile is largely dedicated to a long rant about how Ron and Hermione don't work as a couple because doofus comic-relief sidekick Ron isn't WORTHY of the awesomeness that is Hermione... including a mind-boggling misreading of that infamous JKR interview where he somehow draws the conclusion that Ron/Hermione is "NOT really canon (but the author's OWN A.U.)" because... actually I'm a little unclear about that. I think because JKR said in the interview that Harry and Hermione COULD have been a thing, this guy has decided that Harry/Hermione is canon and Ron/Hermione is an AU that she wrote and published instead of the actual canon because... reasons? I have no idea.

This guy's certainly got some creative interpretations of the text, I'll give him that. Wouldn't take his word as gospel though.

For what it's worth: I don't think Harry was ever beaten severely. He might have got a clip around the ears, or picked up and hauled into his cupboard/room... which is bad ENOUGH, mind you, but Vernon just strikes me as the sort of person who's a lot more roar than bite. He'd be far more likely to THREATEN Harry than actually DO anything.

This doesn't mean Harry wasn't abused, but I think most of it was emotional abuse and neglect, not physical. The Dursleys were so obsessed with appearing "normal" that I don't think they'd do anything that would leave visible marks. What would the neighbours think?!
