We seem to ignore the fact that the series was initially written for preteens. Basically, adults and responsible adult interference in Harry's adventures was unwanted by that age group - even Molly is presented as more of a caricature of an uber busy but loving stay at home mom rather than as an actual responsible adult. By the time JKR realized she needed to start writing for an older audience, we were already half-way through the series and addressing the abuse and lack of reaction from Hogwarts staff would have required a whole lot of explanation and derailed the whole plot. So she tried to make excuses for why it wasn't addressed or pretend that it wasn't that bad.
