There is a difference between corporal punishment and not feeding your kid for days at a time or making them live in a cupboard when you have two extra rooms (Dudley's extra and the guest room). My mom used to slap my hands whenever I reached for small objects (I had a habit of swallowing pretty colored things including buttons and pills) but she gave her friend strongly worded advice when she noticed hand shaped bruises on their kid. It's assumed that magic can fix physical harm - broken bone, bruises, etc. - so I can see where corporal punishment is not a child safety issue. However, being locked up for days and not able to contact anyone would be a safety issue, especially in the case of Harry who has a lot of enemies. As well, from the way love is studies in the DoM and how magic is based on emotions, magicals probably had an earlier understanding of the impact of abuse and neglect on social, emotional and mental development and wellfare.
