Also I am certainly not an authority on abuse and I wouldn't know if what the Dursley's did to Dudley was abuse but I don't think anyone can deny that they fucked his life up too. It would be very difficult for him to be a functioning member of society.

He asks for (and gets) a second TV only because he does not want to make the walk from the kitchen to another room. He has two bedrooms for eleven years. He is taught that it is right for him to hit people with a stick to get what he wants. All his worst habits are enabled and all intervention (such as with his grades and his weight) are denied. That's insane.
