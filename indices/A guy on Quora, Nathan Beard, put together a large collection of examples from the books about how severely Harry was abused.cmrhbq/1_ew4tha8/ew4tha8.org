A lot of this is because the focus of the series completely changes in the middle of the book. At the start of the series it is an archetypical children's fantasy novel with elements of boarding school stories and mystery stories. You have a lot of the common archetypes of these stories such as the bully, the wise old man, incompetent adults, the idea of the journey etc. Are the Dursley's really that different from, for example, the Wormwoods in Matilda? Just like the Wormwoods the Dursley's are cartoonish villains with highly exaggerated features. We're supposed to be disgusted by them but also laugh at them a little bit.

The series changes somewhere between Cedric's death and 'I must not tell lies'. It becomes less of fun adventures and a payoff at the end. Part of this is also because Rowling is not as subtle (though probably just as effective given Umbridge) with her satire. The tone of the series changes and suddenly you have a more mature perspective of the anxieties of the Dursley's. They want to kick him out not just because they hate him but because they're legitimately terrified for their lives.

So judging by how the series ends it is totally correct to say that Harry was abused. I think it is CoS when Harry pranks Dudley pretending to do magic and 'narrowly dodges a frying pan' and then is given an insane list of chores to do. But with the change in tone in the series the Dursley's change too. They're still horrible but by book five it is nearly always for a reason and not for the sake of it.

It is not wrong to change the focus of your story especially if you had no idea it would blow up and receive the scrutiny it would. Rowling's strength is characters. Personally it is fascinating to see how the characters respond to this change in tone as well (even if this change is in my opinion unrealistic in the clusterfuck that is hbp).
