Great link! I wonder if some of this is lost in translation as it goes to America too. (Do Americans have cupboards under the stairs?) For example, I know exactly what the cupboard under the stairs Rowling would have had in mind would look like, because I'm familiar with British homes - and so would have been her original intended readerbase, so she might not have thought to add exact details at any point.

(For reference it would be about the space of a standing wardrobe, or perhaps a little more, maybe 3-4 feet wide, perhaps 1-2 feet deep, and with a slanted roof that would top out at maybe 5 or 6 feet tall depending on where under the stairs it was located.)
