If he needed Harry to not have any self-esteem, then that failed spectacularly. Harry had self-esteem out the wazoo, and certainly did not think of himself as worthless. Hell, he could be an arrogant little bastard who often took his friends' unconditional support for granted. Right from the first book he snarks and backtalks and makes jokes, and he just gets cheekier and snarkier over the course of the years. This isn't an oppressed kid whose self-worth has been destroyed.

Dumbledore's goal wasn't to turn Harry into a soldier, it was to keep him alive. Harry was marked for death the moment he got that scar; all Dumbledore's machinations were ultimately a desperate gamble to ensure that Harry would somehow escape his inevitable fate and not have to die anyway.

There are plenty of things to criticise Dumbledore for, but at least keep to things he ACTUALLY did instead of going all Rita Skeeter on us.
