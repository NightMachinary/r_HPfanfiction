A bit of a different angle than yours, but I'm actually really biased towards my headcanon that the reason Horcruxes are seen so rarely isn't because they are obscure. I actually headcanon it that pretty much any Pureblood family or any person that takes an interest in obscure and 'dark' magics recognizes the name instantly. But the reason they are so rare is that in order to make one you need to have some mental peculiarities that are insanely rare in a person. Like believing your own life is the only one that is worth anything, and maintaining that belief constantly or else the Horcrux falls apart. Not feeling emotions (the way a psycopath does not), and stuff like that. Things that would normally be tackled really early on by parents and mended at least enough to make a Horcrux impossible.

TL;DR: Horcruxes aren't obscure at all, it's just that Tom and Herpo were among the very few that had the right combo of mental problems to make creating one possible.
