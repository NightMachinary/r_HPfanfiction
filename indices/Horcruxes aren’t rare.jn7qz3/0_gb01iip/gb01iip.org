Well then Hogwarts turns into a hunger games sort of arena and hopefully when you attempt to murder someone for the process of making a horcrux, you pray they don't already have one and are willing to make a second. Also, taking into account the theories that making a horcrux involves necrophilia or cannibalism, I would think that the school punishes rather harshly being caught outside your dorms after curfew and Filch is righteously entitled to requesting the return of the punishment by whipping only for having to clean all that mess alone on a daily basis. All in all, I am grateful I never received a Hogwarts acceptance letter in your world.
