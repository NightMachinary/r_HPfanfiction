Yes. True, but commas can be used differently. The way I use it is different, and the example you used is seperate to how I use it. I use it at the end to say goodbye, while the example you have is a form of addressing someone, not saying farewell.

When you end letters, the way I use it is a very well known, and used way of ending written documents, but I have seen what you're talking about, and the way you describe is one used quite often in America, but where I live, the way I end it is the more commonly used one. What I think we have here is just a difference in culture maybe.

Thanks, Warryn.
