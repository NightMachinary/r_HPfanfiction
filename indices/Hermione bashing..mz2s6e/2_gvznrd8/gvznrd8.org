Short but (un)sweet: Broken by StarsandSunkissed linkffn(13318530) Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19323346][on AO3]].

The main story is slash in this one: The Games They Play by DebsTheSlytherinSnapeFan linkffn(11321032) Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4167129][on AO3]].

She's an object of ridicule in For the Right Price by Hi Pot in Noose (sequel in progress). The other students literally scream and run away when they see her. linkffn(9894129) Also [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2337458][on AO3]].

Do Not Meddle in the Affairs of Wizards by Corwalch, she won't keep her nose out of Harry's business and he extracts a price for it. linkffn(4816968)

Simple Words by JackPotr (one-shot). linkffn(9990409) The same author has another story called Too Late to Apologize that I thought would fit, but it turns out I remembered it as harsher than it is: she gets forgiven in that one (although she doesn't get Harry).
