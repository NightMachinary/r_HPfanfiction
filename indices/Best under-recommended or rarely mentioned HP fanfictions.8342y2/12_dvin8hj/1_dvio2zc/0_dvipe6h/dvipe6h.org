Oh it's amazing! There's this spell basically holding Hogwarts apart from the rest of the world, and the puzzle is how to get it fixed without destroying Hogwarts and their entire reality, and then there's this horse that just ... appears! And so Harry, Luna, and Draco end up looking after the horse. There is some crack, and it does drag a little at places, and GODDAMN Harry is a clueless teen when it comes to romance, but it's wonderful. I'd recommend reading the first chapter - it's all in mostly the same style, apart from a truly hilarious chapter told from the horse's POV, so if you like the first chap then definitely keep reading! There is the old 'first chapter is actually from way later in the story' thing - but do feel free to skip it if you dislike those; it gets retold in due time.
