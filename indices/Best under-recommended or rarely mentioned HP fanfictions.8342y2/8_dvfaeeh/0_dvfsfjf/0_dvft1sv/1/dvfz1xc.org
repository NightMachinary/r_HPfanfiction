Out of curiosity, do have any more to recommend like FILFY teacher? I am familiar with High School DxD, and a guilty pleasure of mine as it pertains to fan fiction is teacher/student oriented relationships but with HP its hard to satisfy since like 99% of them are Hermione/Snape and not Harry Potter character based.

Edit: Read the opening 2 chapters. Enjoyed them for the most part.

I also love HP fanfics that have a powerful but mysterious Harry whom those around him struggle to figure out. The opening of this seems to fit that perfectly.
