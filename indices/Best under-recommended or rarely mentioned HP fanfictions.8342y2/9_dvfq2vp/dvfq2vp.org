The best (and longest) fic I ever read was Bullseye by Ohyeah100, it's an ongoing rewrite of the series from Astoria Greengrass's point of view. The timeline and events are the same, but Harry and the gang take a backseat and only pop in here and there, while Astoria deals with interhouse politics, family drama, societal expectations, gamblings with goblins, and now that Astoria is getting a bit older we're starting to see romance. It is amazingly written and even though it's enormous (almost 600k last I checked), the plot never gets slow and is excellent for long days with nothing to do

I don't really know how to link but here it is I think
