Into the Fold- linkao3(147439) is an amazing first war Snape fic. It covers pretty much everything, from Hogwarts to when he becomes a Death Eater and when he finally defects. It treats Snape as the morally grey personality that he is: equally vile and heartbreaking.

Romance of the Age- linkao3(638325)- Another first war fic. Amazing, clever satire of the Marauders' generation.

[[https://gilpins-tales.livejournal.com/9875.html][The Measure Of A Man]]- A very good James Potter character fic. It shows how he changed from a bully to the man Lily fell in love with.

The Lions of Gryffindor- linkffn(7421306)- 7th year at Hogwarts from Neville's point of view. It also has flashbacks to Frank and Alice. Much better than DAYD in my opinion.

Hogwarts, to welcome you home- linkao3(8125531)- You'll like this if you enjoy a bit of fluff and the idea of Harry being a professor.

Carry That Weight (A Long Time)- linkao3(14673145)- A very different kind of Severitus. It's post-war with Snape surviving. Since Harry's an adult and Voldemort's out of the picture, there's no power imbalance and it's a more mature take on the trope.

St Mungo's Grim Reaper- linkffn(8910296)- Haunting first war character portrait of Snape. It's before his defection so you get to see Snape in all his repulsive Death Eater glory, but it still elicits some sympathy.

you'll go the same way- linkao3(7811107)- The only Draco redemption fic I've liked. Draco goes back in time and destroys Horcruxes with Narcissa's help.
