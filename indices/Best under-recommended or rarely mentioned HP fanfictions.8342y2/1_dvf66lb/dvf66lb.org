If you don't mind going old-school (like, 2002), I absolutely love [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=188&chapno=1][Midnight Musings]] and its sequel, [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=189&chapno=1][The Test of Time.]] Post-war, H/G, R/H, Draco's a shit, Ron is actively trying to better himself, and introduced a spunky young female auror before Tonks was written, but because it was written pre-OotP Ginny is still on the shy-and-sweet side, if that's a deal breaker for you.

It may not be high literature, but I consider it comfort food.
