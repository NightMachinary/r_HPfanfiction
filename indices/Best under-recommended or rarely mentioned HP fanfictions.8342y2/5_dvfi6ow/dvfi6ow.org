Definitely linkffn(Daphne Greengrass, Side Character). It's ongoing and updates slowly, but even if the topic isn't your cup of tea, the writing style imo is really, really good. It's subtle and doesn't tell you everything (so it's essentially the opposite of most ff), and does a great job of character building. Currently my favourite ongoing fic.

linkffn(With Malice Aforethought) is also well written and I remember that I greatly enjoyed it, but can't remember why :S

linkffn(8287773) is a very cute one shot with very cute Daphne. When people ask for a 'non-Ice-Queen' Daphne, this is the story I always think of (unfortunately they usually want a Harry/Daphne pairing and this is Theo/Daphne).
