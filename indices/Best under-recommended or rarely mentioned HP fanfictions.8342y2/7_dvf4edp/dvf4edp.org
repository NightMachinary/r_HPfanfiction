[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]] does have Harry/Hermione/Ron, but the romance isn't a huge part of the story at all, the plot is the main focus of this fic and it is well worth the read. I haven't seen any other fic with a plotline even remotely similar to this one, and I throughly enjoyed it.
