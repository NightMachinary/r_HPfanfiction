I don't know any fics with this theme, but I think your analysis of both Dumbledore and Draco is incorrect.

Just a few ideas:

- Dumbledore was ambitious. Draco? Not so much. Dumbledore, at Draco's age, was leagues more talented, capable, and ambitious.

- Dumbledore sought power. Draco was born /into/ power.

- Dumbledore wished to rule over muggles for personal reasons (see: Ariana). Draco wants to rule over muggles because he believes his blood is superior.

- Dumbledore joined Grindelwald in a quest for the Hallows. For personal reasons. (see: Ariana, relationship with Grindelwald)

- Dumbledore - "For the Greater Good". Malfoy - "For the Malfoy's Good". Very different.

And perhaps the most significant difference -

- Dumbledore was an intellectual from a young age. Malfoy is the type to loathe even the concept of being one.

So, they are very, /very/ different people, with only a vague and slight resemblance in actions, and completely different intentions.

Truly, I don't think there is any student we know of that Dumbledore would feel comfortable mentoring. Hermione, perhaps, has the mental aptitude, +but her naivete and trust over her cunning and lack of ambition+ probably stop that from happening.

I believe Dumbledore felt pity for Draco's situation, and genuinely wanted to help Draco out of his dilemma - not because he thought he saw a part of himself in Draco, but rather, because Draco's situation was horrible and one that should never, ever be imposed on a child.
