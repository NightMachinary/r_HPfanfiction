  Yep, she's solidly in McGonagall's bailiwick.

/Are/ there decent fics that feature Hermione being mentored by McGonagall, where it has actual consequences on what Hermione can do and how she does it? Like, say, Hermione getting an animagus form (registered of course) or when she has to fight, she fights like a Transfiguration practitioner, conjuring obstacles and hazards, animating objects to attack the enemy, etc..
