  So, they are very, very different people, with only a vague and slight resemblance in actions, and completely different intentions.

Well, yes. They are very different. I just meant there is a similarity in the sense that they have both gone down a wrong path and regretted it.

  I believe Dumbledore felt pity for Draco's situation, and genuinely wanted to help Draco out of his dilemma - not because he thought he saw a part of himself in Draco, but rather, because Draco's situation was horrible and one that should never, ever be imposed on a child.

I totally agree with you in canon, I just think it could be interesting to see an AU where Dumbledore has a kind of empathy for Draco's situation, and it leads to a gradual change in their relationship.
