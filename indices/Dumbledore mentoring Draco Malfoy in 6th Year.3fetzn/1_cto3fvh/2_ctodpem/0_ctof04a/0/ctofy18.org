Oh, I agree with you that Draco and Dumbledore are dissimilar, and as I said, it is a different sort of ambition. But I think he DOES go looking for more power when his father is thrown into prison. He was desperate to become a Death Eater to re-establish his family in Voldemort's eyes and gain esteem for himself (being too foolish to realize what he was getting himself into and that Voldemort had no intention of him succeeding).

And even if wanting to be the best is something that every DE wants, I don't see how ambition being common among that group makes it any less ambition. I mean, most of them are Slytherins, it makes sense that most of them are very ambitious.

Yes, he does regret it later, once he gets a cold dose of reality and realizes what it all means, but he still felt that way at the time.

I'm basing the comments on Draco's academic interest later life on Pottermore/quotes from JKR, not the books. In the books themselves, I don't really see a lot of evidence one way or the other. Your interpretation is not necessarily WRONG, but you were presenting it as if it was canonical fact, and I think that's not accurate.

But despite these few quibbles, it seems we mostly agree on Draco's character after all!

Regarding Hermione, I did assume you were basing it on the later years since the thread was originally talking about 6th year.
