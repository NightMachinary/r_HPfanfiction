I agree on Hermione, except for one part - her idealistic nature often gets in her own way and in the way of pragmatism (see: S.P.E.W.).

Her actions in the fifth book are rather ruthless, which is around the same time she balances her idealism with pragmatism very well. I suppose I was looking Hermione from the first two-three books, rather than her actions over the whole series.

However, I do think Draco is not nearly ambitious enough. Cunning? Very, when he wants to be. But ambitious? Not really. He was born into power, he has it at his beck and call ("my father!"), and when his father is thrown into prison, he doesn't go looking for more.

Wanting to be the best are something that every DE was going for (maybe even Peter), and the whole DE-thing was something he seemed to regret. He certainly wasn't sorted into Slytherin for his family name, but still, he doesn't have the personal ambition required. If he has any ambition, it seems to focus on being better than Harry, and perhaps a bit of politics (Inquisitorial Squad) - not much else.

Hogwarts-Draco /really/ didn't seem the type to pursue academics and books. However, it has been quite a bit of time since I've read canon, so I might be wrong.

People can certainly change throughout their years at Hogwarts. On the topic of students apprenticing Dumbledore, I was looking at younger years more (in terms of personality) - and it only makes sense that kids in their early teens aren't mature enough to be considered for mentorship.

And if anything, Draco is more loyal to his family than he is ambitious for power - very unlike Dumbledore.
