  Yeah, I'd have to agree with [[/u/turbinicarpus]]. Hermione is very ambitious. I'm genuinely not sure where somebody would get the idea that she isn't.
#+end_quote

Fanfic by writers of all genders who feel the need to reduce her to damsel in distress (sometimes literally) for a rescue romance (or worse); fanfic by writers who seek to elevate other characters by degrading hers --- often so that their protagonist could condescendingly school her on the facts of life; and fanfic where her sole purpose of existence is to facilitate the protagonist doing great things, so that her life could probably revolve around (usually) his.

  If she wasn't a Muggleborn and wasn't so idealistic, Hermione would have done very well in Slytherin.

It really depends on exactly how social dynamics work inside Slytherin, I think. Hermione is not as fragile as fanon makes her out to be [1]. To turn around the infamous line used to motivate the AuthorityWorshipper!Hermione fanon ("Killed --- or, worse, expelled."), Hermione considered leaving Hogwarts a fate worse then death. She'd stick around, and she'd show them all, unless the whole darned House (including years above hers) made a concerted effort to make her drop out --- and Snape didn't put the kibosh on anything too overt, since he /is/ kinda sorta responsible for the physical safety of his students.

  If you're calling her overly trusting because when she was very young, she was inclined to trust teachers (Snape, Lockhart, etc.), well, she was a little kid and that's probably the way she was raised.
#+end_quote

Bad examples, IMO: she set Snape on fire about three months after starting Hogwarts. /Harry/ didn't get to set a teacher on fire until more than five months later. :P As for Lockhart, not her finest moment, no, but it /was/ her first crush. Still better than the Chest Monster.

  Actually, I'm surprised at someone saying Draco is unambitious as well. I don't think that is true at all. Just look at his behavior in HBP (bragging, wanting to be the best DE, not wanting Snape to "steal his thunder"), plus he is of course ambitious to be on the Quidditch team, etc. etc. I don't think he shares the same sort of ambition as Dumbledore or Hermione, but he was sorted into Slytherin for a reason and it's not just his family name.

I think that most Slytherins we learn anything about --- like Draco and Slughorn --- tend to have very small-time ambitions. Draco is into self-aggrandizement, into being praised and into being fawned over, but ask him if he wants to be Minister of Magic, and he'll probably tell you that it's too much like work; and Slughorn seeks creature comforts and getting to rub elbows with celebrities and accomplished people. (It's telling that he used a dose of Felix Felicis to just have a nice day.)

Voldemort seems to be an exception in that sense. (Snape, we don't really know what he wanted out of life when he put on the Sorting Hat, and most of his decisions by the time we see them were forced by circumstances.)

All in all, I wonder if there's a pattern: purebloods from traditionally Slytherin families Sorted Slytherin tend be so to assume their proper place in society as successors of their parents; but halfbloods and Muggleborns Sorted Slytherin tend to be Sorted there because they actually have potential for greatness, and will either achieve it or crash and burn (or both, like Snape).

[1] Many people are misled by the events preceding the Troll Incident, but it's paramount to notice that /Ron was not bullying Hermione/, but rather expressing frustration at what he perceived as hectoring by her, and Hermione knew that he was not bullying her.
