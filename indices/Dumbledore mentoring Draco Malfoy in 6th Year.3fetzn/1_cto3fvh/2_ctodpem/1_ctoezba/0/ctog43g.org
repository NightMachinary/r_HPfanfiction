  All in all, I wonder if there's a pattern: purebloods from traditionally Slytherin families Sorted Slytherin tend be so to assume their proper place in society as successors of their parents; but halfbloods and Muggleborns Sorted Slytherin tend to be Sorted there because they actually have potential for greatness, and will either achieve it or crash and burn (or both, like Snape).

This is actually a really great point. I think there could be a couple of reasons for this. Perhaps halfbloods and Muggleborns who could fit into Slytherin tend to be sorted elsewhere if there's an equally good option, so the ones that end up in Slytherin are the ones who express Slytherin traits particularly strongly. But also the purebloods from the old families already have a lot of power and social status. Their ambitions are pettier simply because they don't NEED to be anything else. They're already pretty much where they want to be. Both Tom Riddle and Snape were starting from a much lower position. And then, of course, you could imagine they'd have to go that much farther to prove themselves to their fellow Slytherins.

And good point about 11-year-old Hermione setting a teacher on fire. She was still a bit more trusting towards the teachers in general than Ron and Harry, though, I think. Being inclined to not think teachers are murderers not being the same thing as worshiping authority!
