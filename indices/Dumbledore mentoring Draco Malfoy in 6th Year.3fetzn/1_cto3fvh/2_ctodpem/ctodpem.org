Yeah, I'd have to agree with [[/u/turbinicarpus]]. Hermione is very ambitious. I'm genuinely not sure where somebody would get the idea that she isn't.

She's also not particularly naive or trusting. If anything, she's rather ruthless. Remember this is the girl who (secretly) put a permanent curse on a piece of paper she then had schoolchildren sign, including some as young as 12! I would also definitely say that is "cunning" behavior. Many of her other actions can be described as cunning as well - leading Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest, for example. If she wasn't a Muggleborn and wasn't so idealistic, Hermione would have done very well in Slytherin.

If you're calling her overly trusting because when she was very young, she was inclined to trust teachers (Snape, Lockhart, etc.), well, she was a little kid and that's probably the way she was raised. She grew out of it pretty fast, certainly by HBP. Or maybe she's being called naive because of her idealistic nature? Well, I don't think the two go hand-in-hand at all. You can be idealistic and also pragmatic. Hermione wants to fight for a better world, but she doesn't have any illusions that the world is already a good place - that's why she needs to fight for a better world!

Actually, I'm surprised at someone saying Draco is unambitious as well. I don't think that is true at all. Just look at his behavior in HBP (bragging, wanting to be the best DE, not wanting Snape to "steal his thunder"), plus he is of course ambitious to be on the Quidditch team, etc. etc. I don't think he shares the same sort of ambition as Dumbledore or Hermione, but he was sorted into Slytherin for a reason and it's not just his family name.

EDIT: Also, why do you say Draco hates the concept of being an intellectual? I don't think he IS an intellectual, but I don't remember him saying anything to imply what you're claiming. He becomes a sort of researcher later in life, collecting obscure academic books and studying them. That doesn't really seem like the behavior of an anti-intellectual to me.
