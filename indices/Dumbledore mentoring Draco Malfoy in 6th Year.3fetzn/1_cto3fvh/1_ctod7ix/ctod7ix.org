  Dumbledore joined Grindelwald in a quest for the Hallows.

I'm pretty sure that wanting to abolish the Statute of Secrecy and have Wizards rule over Muggles was somewhere in there, too.

  Hermione, perhaps, has the mental aptitude, but her naivete and trust over her cunning and lack of ambition probably stop that from happening.

That's a rather fanon-tainted view, IMO. She did have a lot of ambition, but it was Gryffindor-ambition rather than Slytherin-ambition: ambition to Change The World --- whether the world wants it or not --- rather than ambition to obtain personal and/or social power (and comforts) for oneself and one's own; and in that, she actually has more in common with young Dumbledore who was, you might recall, motivated and Sorted similarly. I am not sure what "trust over her cunning" is about, but in terms of naiveté, she's no more naive than any other named character in her year, and this sort of thing is something that is a mentor's job to fix.

There are good arguments for the proposition that in terms of finding a successor for Dumbledore, it was slim pickings in the entering years of 1991±2; but of the ones we know, Hermione is probably the least bad candidate, though Cedric is another good one.
