  Eh. You either obliviate someone or you don't. Either the charm works correctly or it doesn't. I don't think there is much of a middle ground.

I'm not sure canon backs you up on this. Lockhart is said to be especially good at Obliviation. If there aren't different levels of talent at it, why would this be repeated multiple times? In addition, we know that Crouch actually DID do a sloppy job on Bertha... thus why she was having (unrelated) memory problems even before she disappeared.

And Voldemort noticed inconsistencies in her story while he was already interrogating/torturing her to get information, to be fair. And it might not be so much "inconsistencies" as her admitting she doesn't remember, or him noticing that she suddenly can't remember anything (see above about people noticing her general memory problems), while Peter probably knows that she didn't used to have such problems with memory.

But it's okay that you don't like the idea, and I'm not trying to talk you into liking it! Personally, there's a ton of ideas that I don't like and don't find to mesh well with my ideas on canon.
