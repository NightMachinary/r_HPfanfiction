  I don't find it difficult to believe that Dumbledore and Snape are simply better at Obliviation than Crouch mid-panic.

Eh. You either obliviate someone or you don't. Either the charm works correctly or it doesn't. I don't think there is much of a middle ground.

  For another, in the case of Bertha Jorkins, Voldemort was already questioning her - he was LOOKING for something like that.
#+end_quote

He probably noticed inconsistencies in her story. I find it hard to believe he wouldn't do the same in Draco's case, especially since the obliviations would span months in his case.

#+begin_quote
  We've also been told that Draco is better at Occlumency than Harry.
#+end_quote

Hardly much of a compliment.

  Snape wasn't the only DE who hid his intentions, either. We don't know that Regulus was as good at Occlumency as Snape, either, and he wasn't much older than Draco.
#+end_quote

Hmmm. No. Regulus never had to hide his intentions from Voldemort. He didn't meet Voldemort even once after he decided to betray him. He turned on Voldemort instantaneously after he tried to kill Kreacher, and thus didn't need occlumency.

  I'm not saying it's something that would/should have happened in canon, but I've seen MANY far more outlandish fic ideas than this.
#+end_quote

Fair enough. I just don't particularly like the idea, I guess.
