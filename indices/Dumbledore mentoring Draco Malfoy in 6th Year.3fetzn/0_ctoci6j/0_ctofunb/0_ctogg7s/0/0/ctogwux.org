I think there's plenty of room for suspension of disbelief there. For one thing, I don't find it difficult to believe that Dumbledore and Snape are simply better at Obliviation than Crouch mid-panic. Both of them, and especially Dumbledore, are unusually knowledgable and talented wizards, and they'd have time to do it right, versus having to do it on the spot. For another, in the case of Bertha Jorkins, Voldemort was already questioning her - he was LOOKING for something like that. He wouldn't really have any reason to suspect Draco of such a thing. We've also been told that Draco is better at Occlumency than Harry. I really doubt he's as good as Snape, who was able to successfully hide his intentions from Voldemort, but you know, Snape wasn't the only DE who hid his intentions, either. We don't know that Regulus was as good at Occlumency as Snape, either, and he wasn't much older than Draco.

I'm not saying it's something that would/should have happened in canon, but I've seen MANY far more outlandish fic ideas than this.
