Is there anything in canon to support your claim that Voldemort found the memory charm faulty? Or that powerful memory charms are more easily detected? Because Voldemort never says anything about this. She was acting weird before she left becasue of the 'too powerful' memory charm, so the power of the memory charm is given as the reason no one bothered to look for Bertha rather than something that helped Voldemort detect the charm.
