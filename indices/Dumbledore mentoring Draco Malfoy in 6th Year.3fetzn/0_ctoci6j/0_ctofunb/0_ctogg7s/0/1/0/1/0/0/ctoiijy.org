Unless Pottermore posts excerpts from Obliviator's Manual, I don't think the question can be resolved either way. Canon is consistent with the proposition that Memory Charms are /always/ detectable, and it's consistent with the proposition that they can be hidden. (For that matter, does one get harder to detect as more time passes since it was cast? Does size and scope matter? What about Forgetfulness Potions and False Memory Charms? After all, all Dumbledore and Snape really want is information on what Draco is planning in the next week or two, so that they could ensure that nobody gets hurt.)
