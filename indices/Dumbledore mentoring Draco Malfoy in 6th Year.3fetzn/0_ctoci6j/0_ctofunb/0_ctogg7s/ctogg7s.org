  Yeah, no. That would have get Draco killed instantly. His Occlumency would be no match for the Dark Lord's Legilimency. If he didn't go back to Voldemort, his parents would have been killed, and that defeats the point of Draco helping Dumbledore.

He'd only have to go back for Christmas, right? Dumbledore and Snape could probably just move the relevant memories to the Pensieve and Obliviate him. In the meantime, they could ensure that his plans didn't hurt anyone else.

  Huh? Are you talking about the cursed necklace? Because Hermione didn't do anything......

You're right. For some reason, I thought that Hermione stabilized Kate while Harry ran to get help. I just looked the scene up, and that does not appear to be the case. I stand corrected, and will edit my post accordingly.

(I guess I have my own Hermione-related fanon to clean out.)
