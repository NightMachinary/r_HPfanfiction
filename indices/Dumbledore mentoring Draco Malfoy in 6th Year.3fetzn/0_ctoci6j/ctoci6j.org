I've wanted to see an AU where Dumbledore and Snape are a bit more proactive in making sure that Draco doesn't become an actual, rather than merely attempted murderer +--- because there won't always be a Hermione around the next time he uses an Unforgivable curse to smuggle an instantly deadly Dark Artifact into Hogwarts+.

In particular, grab him out of bed in the middle of the night, drag him up to Dumbledore's office, and have Dumbledore politely explain, in his inimitable grandfatherly fashion, that Draco is working for /him/ now, with Snape glowering in the background, and the only way to save his parents is to do precisely what Dumbledore asks...

*Edit:* Apparently, Hermione stabilizing Katie while Harry ran to get help was fanon. Thanks to [[/u/PsychoGeek]] for pointing it out.
