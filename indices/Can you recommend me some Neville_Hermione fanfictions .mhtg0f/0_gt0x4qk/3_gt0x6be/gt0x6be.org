  The Golden Trio, along with the rest of the magical community is healing from the aftermath of the war. Ron is angry. Hermione is jumpy. Harry is just trying leave it all behind. This all culminates in Hermione clinging to Hogwarts for comfort. She's not alone however and the young witch finds friendship, comfort, and even love within the walls of the castle she helped rebuild.

  Neville Longbottom took in a deep, satisfying breath and looked down at his feet. His new shoes broke up the yellow warning lines at the edge of the platform, but he didn't move back. The pristine brogues made the mottled, old paint on the ground look worse and Neville wondered if he had ever looked better than any place he was before, but he still didn't move. He couldn't.

  It shouldn't be this good. More than any other thought, that was the one that kept drifting to the forefront of Hermione's mind. The sentence lit up behind her eyes like a blinking neon sign and washed out all the other noise in a scream of day-glow pink.

  Hermione has been revising for the N.E.W.T.S, so she's been forgetting a few important things: 1) Sleep is necessary for human function, and 2) People care about her, namely Neville Longbottom, and 3) Tea fixes everything.

#+begin_quote
  He gave her the peppermint because of her toothpaste: muggle, minty, aromatic in a way that magical cleansing charms couldn't quite achieve. He never noticed it when they were in school, never got close enough to breathe the same air. But when she'd visited him in the Hogwarts greenhouses, several years later, closer to thirty than to twenty, she'd leaned over his shoulder, watching as he harvested dittany for her healing potions. A crop blight meant supply shortages at St. Mungo's, and being the extraordinary healer and problem solver that she was, she'd sought him out to assist.The mint surprised him, so he said something. Perfume? he'd asked.Her cheeks colored as she leaned away. Toothpaste, she'd said. A Muggle habit.

  Neville's finally back from his research trip to the Arctic, so Hermione pops by for a quick cuppa and a catchup.Things do not go quite to plan.Featuring: a twist on the sex pollen plot device; Neville Longbottom's pureness and lack thereof; friends, or the people you most want to murder; implied workplace prejudices; the Chudley Cannons; digressions on textiles; an uncanny dog; another twist; and, a Hallowe'en party.
