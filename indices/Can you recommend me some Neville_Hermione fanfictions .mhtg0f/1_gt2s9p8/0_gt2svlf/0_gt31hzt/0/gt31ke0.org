  When Charlie Weasley takes Hermione Granger to visit the recovering Gringott's dragon, something sparks. Years later, after disaster strikes her long engagement, she finds herself in Romania in search of dragon-care lore, manipulated by a mad old witch, and discovering that Charlie in his element is much more than a spark. Soft, sweet, snuggly, and fluffy. HEA. Complete

  It was a law everyone had expected to pass, just not in this format. Hermione needs to find a husband ASAP but unfortunately all the decent pureblooded men have already posted banns... well all the ones in England anyway.

  The end of the world has come. Millions dead, magic waning, Hermione Granger and Charlie Weasley are the last people left in Britain---left to pick up the pieces of their once great civilization. Why were they spared? Who is responsible for the death of a nation? These are the mysteries left as a legacy for two lost and lonely people.

  When 14-year-old Hermione Granger discovers the possibility of having a soulmate in a book in the Hogwarts Library, she vows to herself she'll one day find hers. The only issue is your soulmate is said to have matching birthmarks and well...hers is in a very, very interesting place. Now at 23 and working in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, she's sent to Romania to investigate a newly discovered dragon species. Much to her surprise, Hermione finds more than just a scaly beast as she works alongside Charlie Weasley.*Written for Hermione's Nook Rarepair Soulmate FicFest*Prompt: You have matching birthmarks, in very, very interesting places... ;)

  "That'll be a great morning conversation. How am I? Swell--Dolohov's curse is back, let me just grab some bangers and pop over to Pomphrey and settle into my deathbed. Don't forget I look dreadful in black and I'd prefer a bouquet of wildflowers."Scratch that, just set me on fire and send me out to sea in some twisted Viking funeral.""You're a bloody ray of sunshine, you know that? Fucking hell."--- Or rather the soulbond AU no one really needed, but it's here anyway.
