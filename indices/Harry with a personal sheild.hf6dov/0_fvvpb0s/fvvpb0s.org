I believe I have read a fic or two that may fit your request so I'll look for it. If it's the one I'm thinking of at one point Harry is at the ministry and has an official duel with Lucius Malfoy in a dueling "pit". Malfoy uses the Killing Curse and Lily's image surrounds Harry and reflects the Curse back to Malfoy.

If that isn't it there's another fic where Harry learned to maintain a permanent shield around himself.
