I think the DA being badass in Voldemort controlled Hogwarts would've been a good way to flesh out Ginny's character. She'd totally be Neville's lieutenant, irritated as she is by Harry's insistance on leaving her behind to go of on adventures. In fact, I've seen a few fics, mostly Drarry, where she and Neville get together because of that and it's written pretty well.
