Viktor Krum as well. He's 18 at the beginning of GoF during the summer, technically the same age as a college freshman, and he dates a 15 year old girl, who is technically a high school freshman. That's super creepy.

Then he was going to hit on Ginny at Bill and Fleur's wedding, at the age of 21, despite her being weeks shy of 16! He has a thing for 15 year olds...

It seriously makes me question Hermione's judgement in romance since she "snogged" him. "Oh, I'm so mature, and he's so shy." It's disgusting.
