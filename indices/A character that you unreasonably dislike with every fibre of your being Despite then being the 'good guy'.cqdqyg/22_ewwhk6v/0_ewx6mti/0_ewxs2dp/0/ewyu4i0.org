Dumbledore was so far in the closet even Skeeter doesn't bring it up in her book. Grindelwald literally just became gay like six months ago because JK simply will not shut up. Before that, especially during the Dumbledore gay reveal, it was /heavily/ implied Dumbledore just pined hard after Grindelwald. There's also no non-straight relationships in or around Harry's year, a majority of a century after the fact. They literally /all/ get married, pretty much right out of school, and have babies. There's also no mention of any other character being non-straight at any point in the series whatsoever. Really, if you're hard up on the idea of the death of the author, Dumbledore just didn't want to kill a good friend and there's /no/ mention of anybody not being straight.

There's also no mention of any kind of sex. None of the main characters to anything but make out, and the closet implications were Fleur and Davies at the Yule Ball (though considering they were only half concealed if they were fucking Harry and Ron had a rather blasé react to seeing them). There /should/ have been sex happening, it's a bunch of teens living together. But there wasn't, and it wasn't really even implied.

It's really not a stretch to say they're behind modern times in relationship as well as everything else. I also have always had an issue with equating Krum to a ‘college freshman' when he clearly goes to the same level of school as Hermione. Not that a senior dating a freshman is a great scenario, but it's a helluva lot better than a freshman dating a college student.
