It's a kids book. You can't look too deeply into the lack of adult actions being expressed, because that's a different type of book. Hell, even Molly and Arthur did some late night stuff. Do you think anyone is going to right out and say it? The scene at the beginning of the Deathly Hallows was supposed to mimic "a going away present" that a soldier's girlfriend or spouse would give. Just because they don't use technology correctly does not make them socially different, as they have had technological equivalents.

Skeeter wrote it and lied quite a bit in the book herself. She's not exactly the paragon for journalistic integrity or research.

People having babies right out of school didn't happen the second time around and has only been explicitly stated for 2 couples. Molly and Arthur, and James and Lily, and a couple of years waited at that for children.

He's older than any 7th year. He might not have the education for it, but he's also has a lot of public experience as a sports star. If anything that makes it worse. He's 18, going on 19 by the end of the year.
