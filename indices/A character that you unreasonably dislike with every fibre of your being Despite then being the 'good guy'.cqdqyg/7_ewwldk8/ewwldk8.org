Luna Lovegood, she is the most uninteresting and overrated character to read about especially when the author goes on an "obligatory" chapter of Harry fighting her bullies or when the breaks the fourth wall because she is super wise.

Remus, normally he doesn't bring anything to the story but showing care to Harry and calling in a pup, and let's not forget that he also almost abandoned his wife and kid in DH.
