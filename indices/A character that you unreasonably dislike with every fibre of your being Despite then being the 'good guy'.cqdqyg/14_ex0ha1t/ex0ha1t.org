I wouldn't every fiber but these characters I just dislike

Hermione: she's vastly overrated and is actually a pretty mean person when you think about it. Granted she has her moments

Ron: no I don't dislike him because of books 4 and 7, I just never got into him

Most of the Weasleys: I only really like Percy and Arthur

Tonks: she just seemed so unnecessary and, like Ginny, seemed like she was created as a love interest only

Sirius and Lupin: so overrated and people already wrote reasons that I agree with
