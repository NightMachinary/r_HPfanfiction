I didnt dislike Lilly and James but ya...that did get tiresome. And I also am not the biggest fan of canon Tonks and Remus. I think they can be done well they just werent.

My character is Molly I wouldnt say I hate her but I do wish non bashing fics would call out her actions more have her learn a lesson grow as a person all those things she didnt get to do in canon.
