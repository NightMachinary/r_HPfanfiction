I can't say I've seen them done well in fanon either. Have you? Because even in fanfics, Remus is the evil guy for not agreeing to be with her, even fanfic authors call him an idiot while if someone mentions something Tonks did in that fic that wasn't very mature, they are far more sympathetic. Funny because many of them claim to be feminists, so apparently that means making a man into a devil. But then again, Rowling let's her women get away with all sorts of things, so those young girls just copy her.
