To be honest I don't really look for it in fanon. Usually its in the background when I come across it. I mean pushing your feelings on to someone who doesnt want to accept them even if they might want to later and just don't now thats still not ok. If the genders were swapped people might be more against this which is a huge double standard and as someone who is feminist id say thats not exactly a feminist thing to support that since feminism is about achieving equality .

But honestly I doubt it has anything to do with feminism people in general don't always like being critical of their favs and its harder to be if the narrative gives them a pass. Tonks is a fan fav and the narrative gives a pass to her. I think it pretty much boils down to that. You want your fav to be in the right and thats it.
