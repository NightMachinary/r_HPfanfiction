Remus Lupin...he's such a wimp and He's downright blind. He's all about Dumbledore this, Dumbledore that. It just makes me sick.

I hated James, too. But more than James I hate Sirius Black. He was completely blind to the Dursley family and signs that harry showed from their “loving care”. In order of Phoenix, he just sat around and moaned about being there. It's not like Dumbledore had chained him up! He was just too weak to disobey Dumbledore.

Edit: No idea why I've got 5 downvotes. Imagine your parents being someone who doesn't dare to disagree with your headmaster, who btw, wants to get you killed for the greater good.
