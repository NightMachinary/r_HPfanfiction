  what the hell did Ron really do wrong here. To the extent to get called a Bully?
#+end_quote

Yeah, nothing wrong /whatsoever/ with 'It's no wonder no one can stand her' and 'She must've noticed she's got no friends.' Something he says (even while being 'slightly uncomfortable' as you so helpfully pointed out) *right after he saw he just made a girl cry*.

  Hermione singled out a kid when the whole class was not performing well.

The were directly sitting next to each other. She didn't yell across the room to some meek and struggling kid like you seem to want to portray this as. She corrected the person literally yelling next to her that he was doing it wrong.

I also absolutely adore the bold highlights on things that are pro-Ron as if that's all that you should be paying attention to here. Directly after Hermione 'snaps' at him, Ron /snarls/ back. Not to mention, if you want to make 'snapping' such a terrible thing, that's precisely what Ron does to Harry when he has the gall a short while later to say they have to find the girl Ron made cry since because of that she could be in mortal danger. And directly after Ron looks /slightly/ uncomfortable at, again, making a girl cry, he doubles down on be a complete tool. But yeah, it's definitely poor ickle Ronnikins that's the real victim here. It's not that he was causing a scene next to somebody with a mutual dislike, she corrects him, he says bullshit, she shows him she's right, he gets all pissy, then attacks her character in the middle of a crowded hallway and shows only the 'slightest' of remorse about deeply upsetting her before continuing to say nasty things about her. No, it's all excused because poor Ron was vulnerable.

This is /precisely/ what I'm talking about when I say criticizing Ron is a useless endeavor here. The amount of doublethink required to come out of a situation where one person comes out of it spending the entire day in the bathroom sobbing after saying one short sentence and somehow /they're/ the bad guy is so remarkably absurd I really don't have the words for it.

Don't bother.
