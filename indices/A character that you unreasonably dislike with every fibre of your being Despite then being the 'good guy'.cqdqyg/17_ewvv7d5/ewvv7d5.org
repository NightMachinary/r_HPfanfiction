Ron. I'm not sure is this place fell in love with him because of righteous indignation at how he was portrayed in the movies or what, but man god be with you if you say anything against him here. Dude is a jealous, disloyal, meanspirited prick. He drops Harry like it's nothing twice, once when they're literally fighting a goddamn war. He agrees to go on a date with Hermione, then turns around and sticks his tongue down Lavender's throat because his sister was a meanie pants to her. His bullying is the reason Hermione spent all day crying in the bathroom when she should have been killed by the troll. He's lazy, abuses power, has horrid table manners, only true interest is sports, and has a short fuse and a vicious temper. Seriously, book Ron is a couple roids away from being every meathead stereotype you could think of.

All that being said, I actually don't dislike Ron all that much. His negative are generally mitigated by his positives. But I hate the way how his many flaws are handwaved away here. And in the novel, honestly. Don't even get me started on how terrible the Ron/Hermione pairing is.
