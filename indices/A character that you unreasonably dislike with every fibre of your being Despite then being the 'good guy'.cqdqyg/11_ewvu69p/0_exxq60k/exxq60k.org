Telling Harry that he was a Horcrux and that only by dying could this Horcrux be destroyed is very far from "raising him for the slaughter" (even if it's assumed, contrary to the evidence, that Dumbledore knew from the beginning or that he hoped that Harry could yet survive).

As for Harry's living conditions, I doubt that they told her that Harry was living in a cupboard. It would be obvious that the Dursleys did not like Harry, but they don't strike me as the type who would want outsiders to know that they're abusing him. Of course arguably Dumbledore should have acted upon such information.
