Let's get crucified together! I cannot stand Tonks. It was bad enough in canon. But now I even can't read fics where this pairing is explored. And oh Remus should be so grateful she wants to be with him because she is so wonderful and admirable. And her tactlessness is apparently supposed to be charming. But then again, girls in their 20s love her, so it's partly a matter of age, maybe. But their idea of romance is unsettling.
