Probably Snape. At the end he was still a Bully.

Lupin. Too noting and of course the reasons mentioned here.

Ginny. Just too perfect and JKR just tried too hard with her. She was made to be Harry's gf and it showed. Also JKR took girl power too far. Seriously, Ginny gets rewarded for attacking another student? For annoying her?

Hermione at some instances. Mostly to do with her fans though. Hate when they try to portray her as an angel.

Molly at some instances. I'm sure she tried hard, but she could have done better with raising her children without letting them grow insecure and other shit like that. But i guess I can't judge her seeing as I can only imagine how much work 7 children would be.

Dumbledore at some instances. Reasons are obvious.

Fred and George in some occasions. They just seem to try too hard and too much of a pain to hang around with.
