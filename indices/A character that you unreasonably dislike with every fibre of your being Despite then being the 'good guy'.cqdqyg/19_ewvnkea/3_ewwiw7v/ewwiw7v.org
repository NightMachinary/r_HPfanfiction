We're talking about a magical world here. Luna's 'insanity' could very well have some kind of rational reason. My favourite theory is that she's very good at reading emotions and mindsets and such, and it manifests in her mind as different creatures. For example, the wrackspurts are linked with confusion, and nargles are linked with stealing things, so that might be vindictiveness. Luna is a very interesting character who can play major roles in fanfiction.
