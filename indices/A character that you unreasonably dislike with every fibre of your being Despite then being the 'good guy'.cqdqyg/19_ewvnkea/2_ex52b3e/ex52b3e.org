Regarding Luna, if you look at the things she says sideways, everything she says or is printed in the Quibbler is in fact true. The creatures she talks about might or might not exist, but JKR obviously had a lot of fun speaking truth encoded in gibberish via the Lovegoods.

I think she's very brave and kind, and grew up with a father who, while loving, is too much in his own head. People often deal with trauma by distancing themselves from the world, especially children, and being weird in a non-malicious fashion isn't actually a character flaw.
