Luna could be a sweetheart of a character if someone just talked to her in a fic. You don't even need mind healers, just a person with a sympathetic ear.

Hermione is an intelligent, if tactless character in canon. She gets classified as borderline genius by Rowling, and in book 2 you see that with her solving the mystery of what the monster is (with a little help from Harry). She's not however smart to the degree you see in fanfics, as she never actually innovates anything.

Snape, the twins, the Marauders, Crouch Jr, Bellatrix (by extension of her defeat Molly), McGonagall, Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindelwald, among others are shown to have magical talent that blatantly surpasses her at the same age, through various forms of canon. She only got 10 OWLs compared to 12 quite a few other characters did. She's top of her class, but she's not even a once in a decade talent.

Mind her talent isn't why I dislike reading her in fanfics. Make her as talented as you want, although if you treat her like she's the next Dumbledore with no basis at all, well I'll have an issue. It's how she treats everyone else.
