I totally agree with you on disliking Luna. In the books I found her weird but didn't really care because she was a relatively minor character. But there are so many fics where she is made into a seer or they make her into a major character and it's just completely stupid. The prime example for that would be linkffn(For Love of Magic by Noodlehammer). I think that fics that want to be realistic should show Harry taking pity on her and sending her to a mind healer because she is clearly not right in the mind because of childhood trauma. Luna is very overrated.

I also can't read a fic where Hermione is praised to the heavens so I guess that means I unreasonably dislike her according to a far too great part of this community.

And I dislike Molly Weasley because she is a bitch that tries to replace Lily and is very rude to Sirius.
