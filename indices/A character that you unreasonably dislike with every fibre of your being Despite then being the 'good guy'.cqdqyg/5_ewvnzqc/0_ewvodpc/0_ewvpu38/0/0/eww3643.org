I always thought her treatment of Sirius in order of the phoenix was over the top and that her treatment of fleur was abysmal. That love potion story needs to be expanded by Rowling, so I'll hold off on judgement there.

But I understand her feelings on the children being involved with order business. She didn't want them hurt. However, they did need more than the bare minimum information.
