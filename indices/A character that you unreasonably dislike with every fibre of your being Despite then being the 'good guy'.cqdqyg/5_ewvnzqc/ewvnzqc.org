Not with every fiber, but I really dislike these popular characters:

Remus Lupin: this guy has a history of running from uncomfortable realities, understandable for me, but I don't like this behavior at all.

Minerva McGonagall: grossly overrated in the fandom for several cool quotes, but hasn't done anything substantial until the very end. Literally speaking, she's one of those typical useless adults in children's literature.

Molly Weasley: at least she's bashed a lot in the fandom, but among the mainstream fans, she's usually praised a great deal. This person always thinks she knows best, even though she's nowhere competent enough to make the right decision. She's my least favorite Weasley by a wide margin.
