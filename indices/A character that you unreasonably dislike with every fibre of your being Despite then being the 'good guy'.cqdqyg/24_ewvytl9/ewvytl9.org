For HP: The Weasleys as a family unit. Individually they're ok but as a whole they just devour screen time. SIRIUS WAS MEANT TO BE HARRY'S FAMILY FUCK YOU JK!

Bonus, for Worm: Danny Herbert. The character is as useless as a quarter-inch dildo. Probably giving him an eighth of an inch too much credit too.
