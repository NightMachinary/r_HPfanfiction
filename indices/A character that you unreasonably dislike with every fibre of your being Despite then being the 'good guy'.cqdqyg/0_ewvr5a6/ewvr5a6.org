I definitely agree with you that's it's annoying when people attribute every one of Harry's traits to his parents. It's especially prevalent in authors that also write James/Lily or “marauder's era” fics. I think it's fine to mention some similarities, but I really prefer when Harry gets to be his own person.

It doesn't make me dislike James and Lily as characters though, just get annoyed with the authors.
