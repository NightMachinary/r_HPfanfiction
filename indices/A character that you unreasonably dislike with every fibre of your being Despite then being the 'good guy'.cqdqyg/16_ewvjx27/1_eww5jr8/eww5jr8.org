I do respectfully disagree about Slughorn, although I do see where you're coming from. I saw it more as him commenting on the fact she wasn't raised around magic.

Andromeda is a non-entity who looks like Bellatrix Lestrange. I like her as a good, ambitious healer. Anything more is meh.

Augusta is a bitch. Forcing a legacy wand on her grandson, despite Ollivander saying only a matched wand will work perfectly. The remembrall is unintentionally cruel too.

There's a sinyk fic where she's bashed, and it's probably the only worthwhile thing to read in it.
