Agree on Slughorn and Augusta, but we don't get enough of Andromeda in the books to hate her. From what little we do get of her she seems pretty cool; she turned her back on her family's racist views to be with the person she loved, even though it meant she was disowned, was one of the only Blacks to be kind to Sirius, was good with healing spells, and raised her grandson after losing the rest of her family in a matter of months.
