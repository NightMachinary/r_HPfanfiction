Hagrid seems to be a very nice man who genuinely cares about kids

But

He /hates/ the Slytherin kids, is very prejudiced, hurt a child to get revenge on his father (Dudley) , tries to wave away a bully's abuse of power (Snape) as something that's not a big deal/the victim should just keep his head down and be better...

Also his obsession with dangerous animals around small children is so fucking dangerous... Like I'm actually surprised that no kids have been eaten by his fucking pet spider

No, I don't particularly like him either
