I agree with all 3 and want to add that I think, professionally, Lupin was the best.

He wanted to kill death eaters and was very knowledgeable.

But man he really was a coward.

Hermione's moments which bothered me the most were book 5 and book 6, when she scarred a girl for life, not as. preventative measure, but a vindictive one. That jinx didn't stop her from talking, Umbridge didn't, a fucking mirror did. Then there was her blatantly cheating by confunding McLaggen. A pompous guy, sure, but not evil.
