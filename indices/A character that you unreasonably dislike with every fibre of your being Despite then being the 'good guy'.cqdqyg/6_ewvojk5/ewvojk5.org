Hermione Granger. She's overbearing in the books, but few called the SI out on her shit. Not once could she not crow about being right, but when she's wrong Harry doesn't gloat. She does it in other books, but HBP sets my teeth on edge. Harry mentions /wanting/ to say something to Ron and Hermione about Malfoy, but holds his tongue. 2-3 chapters later, Hermione is telling him how right she was about the potion's book.

Remus Lupin. Top 10 coward. My biggest gripe isn't even him trying to walk out on his wife and unborn kid. It was that time he was too big of a bitch to mention to Dumbledore that Sirius was an animagus. Imagine if Sirius was actually a mass murderer.

Molly Weasley. Pretty gullible for what a 40+ yr old? Her lack of support for Fred and George's dream always stuck with me. She's overbearing as well and my headcanon is that is why Bill and Charlie went to Egypt and Romania. Was almost the MIL from hell, too.

Edit:

Fucking Hagrid and I can't even explain why.
