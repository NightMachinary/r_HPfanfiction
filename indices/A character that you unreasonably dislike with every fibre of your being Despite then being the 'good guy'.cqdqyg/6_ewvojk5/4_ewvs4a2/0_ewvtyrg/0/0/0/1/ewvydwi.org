What's more likely, that G&J is a barely viable business on the edge of poverty or that it's a normal, functioning business like all the others we have named?

Only if your mother doesn't understand what you want to do and how irrelevant grades are.

Poor is irrelevant, and blood traitors only matters to the minority of pureblood bigots. They're still a recognisable, light aligned, pureblood family.

No, they absolutely ARE. If they were the useless wasters you describe them as, 1000 galleons wouldn't have done anything but give them money to piss away. 3 brand new inventions that work well and are genuinely viable products, invented by age 16? That's not the behaviour of someone without ability.

You assume they needed all 1000 galleons to start the business. I doubt that. Especially since they'd managed as students from a poor family to develop and test multiple products.

They clearly had ability and viability. The only thing Harry gave them was money, therefore the only way they could plausibly have failed was without his money, indicating that the money was the only obstacle.

Are there any characters you actually have positive opinions of? We've had two conversations on this sub now, both consisting of you taking the most negative, least benefit-of-the-doubt stance on a character/characters instead of accepting that they might have had some positive qualities.
