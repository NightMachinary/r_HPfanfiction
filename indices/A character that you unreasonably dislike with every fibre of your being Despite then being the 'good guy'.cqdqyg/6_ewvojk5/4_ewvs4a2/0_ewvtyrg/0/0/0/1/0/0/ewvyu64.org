Fred and George were not wasters. Wasters don't invent brand new products as teenagers, test them, and then develop a viable plan for building a brand, customer base and reputation beginning with owl-orders and expanding to a premises, coupled with aggressive marketing all while still under 18. Wasters who get given 1000 galleons don't turn it into a successful business, they piss it up the wall.
