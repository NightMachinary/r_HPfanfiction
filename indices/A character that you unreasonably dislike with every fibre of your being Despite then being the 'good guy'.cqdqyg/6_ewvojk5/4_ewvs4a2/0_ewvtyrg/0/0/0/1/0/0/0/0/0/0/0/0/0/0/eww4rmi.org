They were fucking 16 and they had invented multiple effective and high quality products, put them through testing and made them ready for sale, in their spare time, with next to no budget. How you can dismiss that is beyond me.

They don't need to sell to build a base. They built a reputation and developed a ready made base for when they started selling.

The method of getting the money is irrelevant - they had it, and that meant their plans were more legitimate

They had consistently put their brand name out there, and constantly demonstrated their products while advertising that they would be selling them, developing marketing language to talk about them etc.

It's absurdly myopic to dismiss their achievements and focus exclusively on the narrow arena of academic success which they explicitly didn't care about.

All of the seeds of the post school success were sown in school, and they could not have achieved it without a huge drive and talent even while they were only 15 or so.

Again: how many 16 year olds design, create and test multiple products, begin marketing them, and actually plan to start a business on graduation, while having sufficient start up capital to make that work? Not many. And the ones that do, usually have parents who at least respect that level of work.

I am suggesting that the fact they did stuff no normal 16 year old would do, and were successful as a result, indicates talent and that their mother should have maybe entertained the idea that they might have a chance. I'm not saying they should have sold the Burrow to buy Fred and George a lab, just that Molly should have understood by HBP that they had an actual, viable plan and the talent to carry it out because...they did.

I think I've said all that needs to be said, and I have no desire to repeat myself so I think I'll leave it here.
