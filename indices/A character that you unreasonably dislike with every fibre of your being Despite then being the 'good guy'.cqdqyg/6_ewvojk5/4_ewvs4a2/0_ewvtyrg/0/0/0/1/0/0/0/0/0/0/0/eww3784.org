I don't know how you've read everything said to you ITT and got to that point. It's like you're deliberately twisting everything you can that OP and the books say and arguing something totally different. For example;

#+begin_quote
  Molly was already encouraging them into the Ministry, so that makes your point null and void.
#+end_quote

OP was clearly saying that you can't work whilst still in school.

#+begin_quote
  Begun (IIRC) their owl-order business.
#+end_quote

You don't.

#+begin_quote
  I don't know where your bizarre hate for Fred and George comes from, but your utter refusal to give them any credit is strange and illogical.
#+end_quote

Nothing I read suggests hate for Fred and George, it's just them from Molly's POV and it's pretty valid.
