I get the point. You are desperate to defend Molly, even if that means totally dismissing every positive quality Fred and George possess.

You seem to think that if I say "Molly wasn't supportive enough, and didn't give Fred and George enough credit, given that the shop was actually a decent idea and they were planning fairly effectively for it. Although, I understand that she'd be unlikely to approach them from a neutral stance given their rebellious nature as kids, and that they probably wouldn't have done a good job of convincing her." (Which is basically my first comment on this thread), then I must be arguing that she's an evil character who didn't recognise a blooming genius when it lived in her house.

What is it with this sub and being black and white? Is it not possible that Molly Weasley might have been flawed and not a perfect parent?
