We absolutely DO know their products are innovative, from the reactions of all the other characters. Don't be silly.

And we don't need to know anything other than that Gambol and Japes exists and does enough business to get by. Which we do.

They needed start up capital, and given their successful development of multiple products before receiving it, and intentions at that point to finish their schooling, I think it's unreasonable to claim they would never have had enough to open a shop or develop a stock to sell.

They had several viable products, the entire Skiving Snackbox line alongside Canary Creams. They also had Extendable Ears and their fireworks, and portable swamp, very soon after suggesting that at least the plans were already there when they received the start up funds.

Their grades are 100% irrelevant. They would be self employed, and in a field that is ungraded in traditional education and they are demonstrably good at.

The Weasleys have a perfectly fine reputation. They are known as decent, pureblood, and not tainted by any associations with the Death Eaters. The worst anyone says about their reputation is that they're poor, an irrelevance for the business. Fabian and Gideon, IIRC, are described either in the books or by word of god, as being pranksters themselves so I extrapolated from that to assume others around at the time would remember them much like Fred and George, but either way they're not a hugely important part of my argument.

16 year olds who have a deep and fervent passion for one thing and have had plans to do it for a career since a young age are absolutely capable of sober market analysis and a good business plan.

Your argument entirely hinges on your assuming that without Harry's money, Fred and George would have been totally unable to do anything. This is ridiculous, given that they had a good business plan and were at the time they received the money still planning on finishing their NEWTs and would thus have been easily able to save start-up capital given their talents, intelligence and drive.

Oh and here's the kicker: even after they HAD that start up money, Molly still didn't support them even though that was the only possible obstacle to their success.
