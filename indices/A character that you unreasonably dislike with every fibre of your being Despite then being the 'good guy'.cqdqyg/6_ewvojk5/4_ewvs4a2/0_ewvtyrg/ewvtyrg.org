There are literally hundreds of joke shops, and thousands of shops that at least partially sell joke or prank products. Plus, the Wizarding World's economy functions very differently to ours.

First, pranks seem to be much more of a thing in JK's Wizarding Britain than IRL, where I've never seen them past a very young age. Possibly because magic allows for much better pranks, possibly for other cultural reasons.

Second, the Wizarding Economy is tiny and everyone knows everyone. With Fred and George's reputations, and the Weasley reputation more broadly, plus the fact that they can easily sell to literally every kid in Wizard Britain via one hub street and Hogwarts, they have a fairly good customer base and easy access to it.

Third, we already know of one other successful magical joke shop (Gambol and Japes), which indicates that the market is there and it's a viable business.

Fourth, the Weasley's products are extremely innovative and high quality, so much so that they accidentally end up creating genuinely useful military/law enforcement tools - extendable ears and shield hats most notably. This indicates they have good odds of capturing some or all of Gambol and Japes' existing market share by being the newcomers with new ideas - a tried and tested mechanism for a new business to disrupt a market.

Fifth, the small size of the Wizarding Economy, plus the ability of magic to replace money for a lot of purposes, ensures that the Weasleys don't need to become wealthy, just to support themselves, a much simpler task than one might assume.

Overall, it's a market we know is reasonably sized and interested in the product, with only one direct competitor who can't compete on anything but name recognition and established reputation (a benefit that is limited by the contrasting reputation of Fred, George, Fabian, Gideon and the Weasleys more generally). There are only two main avenues to sell via, Diagon Alley and Hogwarts via owl-order (maybe Hogsmeade too) and so not much money or effort needs to go into infrastructure or maintaining a presence - they can invest every penny into one single store.

While it may not be the easiest route to financial stability, I think that it is actually perfectly reasonable for Fred and George to view the shop as a legitimate and well thought out business venture, and that a sober market analysis and look at their business plan (which was solid - building a product collection and customer base via testing at Hogwarts, starting via owl-order to further build brand recognition and loyalty, aggressive marketing even in war time etc) would reveal that making a success of it was well within the ability and motivation of the Twins.

Admittedly, it's certainly more risky than Molly's preferred low level Ministry route, and she would be unlikely to look at the twins' plans with that sort of sober, neutral eye given their rebellious and unserious nature (made worse by the fact the Twins would be unlikely to bother explaining and demonstrating their maturity via a detailed economic analysis and presentation, instead preferring to make jokes and ignore their mum's worries).

Still, I don't think it's totally fair to say that Molly was 100% legitimate in her approach, given that not only did the Twins succeed, but that in my view it was reasonably likely that they would do so from the outset. I think she was too overbearing and confused controlling her kids for supporting them, not realising that sometimes good parenting involves allowing your kids to make mistakes or take risks, and supporting them in that rather than trying to warn them away from all dangers.
