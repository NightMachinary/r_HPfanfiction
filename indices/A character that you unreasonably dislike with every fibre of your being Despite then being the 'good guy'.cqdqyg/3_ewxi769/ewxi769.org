I found Colin Creevey to be annoying, boring, and borderline creepy with the whole stalking Harry thing, and was not sad when he died.

I don't like Slughorn at all, he's openly racist (“I was shocked a talented student was muggleborn” 🤮) and plays favorites with students. I also think his popularity in the fandom is just people desperate to prove #notallSlytherins and he is the only somewhat significant Slytherin character that is never a death eater or sympathizer at any point. If someone like Andromeda Tonks got actual screen time there wouldn't be nearly as much “sLuGhOrN iS a GoOd SLyThEriN” nonsense.
