Well if it were up to me I'd have no perks or achievements or dungeons; instead of making a gamer! fic which benefits the MC it would be a deconstruction of the gamer! genre where the system itself is the most limiting aspect towards the development rather than being a cheat.

Like ;

Quest: Learn the levitation spell

Requirements: the ability to cast maintain and manipulate the levitation spell for a duration of 15 min

Reward: Mastery of the levitation spell

EXP: 50

â€‹

So instead of making things effortless, the game itself brings the life from NORMALinto VERY HARD

And Ironically by struggling through the game MC eventually becomes a better wizard than the most (If not the best) but do not realize this till much later because while most people only learn to 'do' anything while MC is forced to master them but the difference is not visible without an in detpth test.

ALSO 'Invite to party' WTF? It's like less gamer fic and more everybody is gamer in the end fics...

Ah, that exhausted my brains(And fingers). I'm out.
