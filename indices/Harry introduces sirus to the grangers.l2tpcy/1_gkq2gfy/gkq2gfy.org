Can you think of any other scene that stands out? Special non-canon wand cores, using a pensieve at the grangers (though that is somewhat common as well), Harry and or Hermione animagus forms etc.

For instance, i download all the stories I read. A simple search on the words Dan and Emma within 5 words of each other returns over 200 stories. So the more unique the scene (like Harry Thestral animagus) the easier it is to find the requested fic (if I've read it).
