Let's seeeeeee... looking at both FFN and AO3, discarding the comment strings on AO3 that's mostly me having a chat with the reviewers, adding up the total number of reviews, and diviting it between the chapters of the story...

... the average number of reviews per chapter of my story, "Holly Potter and the Witching World" is...

...five.

Well, that's all right then.
