Ongoing five I get like make 1 if I'm lucky my ongoing fic Magpie barely got its first review after a month and 4 chapters. It also depends on the subject, I write a lot of OC stuff with lesser characters. Stuff that's been up longer gets a few more. I've actually had most success with my Once Upon a Time stuff in FF
