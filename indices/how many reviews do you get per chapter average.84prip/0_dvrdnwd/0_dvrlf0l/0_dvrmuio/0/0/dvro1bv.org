No. He isn't. Letters is awful. It's nowhere near as good, technically speaking as Vitam Paramus or Limpieza De Sangre. It's pandering bullshit with no real plot, conflict, or any real redeeming qualities.

Letters is nothing more than a gigantic flashing sign of my own failure as a writer. It's hallow, heartless, predictable and far too safe. It just shows that I didn't really even have a good idea yet. The F1 motif is horrendously poorly executed and the writing on the first five chapters is down right bad and, frankly, doesn't get much better.
