Are you talking about the one where harry has to fight voldemort by the veil after being dosed with a minute amount of draught of living death, draco helps him beat volemort by shielding his mind. The second chapter ends with harry making out with ginny at bill and fleur's wedding. Also umbridge makes the aurors try to "peacefully" settle problems with death eaters before getting torn by werewolves at a gathering?
