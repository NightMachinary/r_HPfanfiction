If you don't mind an alternate take on Ron, I very much like the Weasley Girl series. The premise is simple: In this universe, Ron is a girl. Fem!Ron, with the imaginitive name "Veronica," is hotheaded and sarcastic like her male counterpart, but being the first-born daughter in the family means she has slightly different hang-ups and priorities than a sixth-born son would have. linkao3(6130632; 3721921; 3793561)
