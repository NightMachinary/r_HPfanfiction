Unfortunately, despite it being something I enjoy, there are precious few that are well done, and even less that are finished. I have a bunch on my "to read" list but so far the only ones I can suggest for now are (and some are not finished):

Harry Potter and the Rejected Path: linkffn(6375811)

Effects and Side Effects linkffn(4606270)

Im Still Here linkffn(9704180)

There are also 2 that came recommended, both are actually called "The Harem War" but I have yet to read them and one is much better then the other supposedly, although I have forgotten which one I was told was better LOL:

The Harem War linkffn(5639518)

The Harem War linkffn(11035814)

Hopefully that gets you started. I generally read more Time Travel, Darker Harry, and Powerful Harry, then Harem ones, so I am likely not the best source for good material despite the fact they intrigue me.
