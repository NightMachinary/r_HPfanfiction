I am a sucker for the following styles, and all the tropes they contain (assuming we are using the looser definition of tropes).

*Time Travel* - Theres just something so fun about the idea of redoing it all over again but with foreknowledge, especially because I dont like how Harry's cannon life panned out anyway.

*Super Power* - A guilty pleasure that I cant help but love because of the potential to use it to explore magic and the world of HP in general due to the power increase.

*Grey Harry* - Its just too fun seeing a colder and more interesting and independent side to Harry where its not strait light/dark.

*Harems/Group Pairings* - This is one where I cant help but love, and yet, I am particular. Mainly because I want a story where each character is an interesting study in itself. In other words, not just Harry and a bunch of sex slaves. No I enjoy when the Harem has a reason or purpose and each character has depth, and good plot.
