I prefer canon compliant fics because the original series is what I fell in love with and want to read more of what happens with those characters, whether it is through stories with different POVs, like Not From Others ;) or stories that pick up after the battle of Hogwarts. We know only certain things about Harry and the others post-battle, like their occupations, families, and whether they all went back to school. That leaves a lot of potential plots that can be created by the author without going against canon. For example, we have no idea what exactly happened right after the battle with the romantic pairings. Did both Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione start dating immediately after? Did they break up at any point? How did the trauma of the previous 7 years affect their abilities to maintain healthy relationships.

I've started to read and enjoy fics where things don't go very smoothly for Harry and Ginny right away and they have to find their way back together while still pursuing their careers. I find this very intriguing, and it doesn't go against canon at all.

But I do get a bit frustrated when writers generally stick to canon except change one seemingly inconsequential thing. Not sure why, but I guess it takes me out of the story a little bit.
