It only really upsets me when it makes no sense. Like, I was reading a fic where Sirius raises Hermione undercover as his pureblood daughter and she becomes a Slytherin, and while we're supposed to be following her and there is some initial sop to her secretly helping Harry, after a while it just settles into Harry managing exactly the same Stations with basically the same outcomes without her. Which implies that Hermione achieved nothing in solving those issues in canon, and had no impact on Harry's life.
