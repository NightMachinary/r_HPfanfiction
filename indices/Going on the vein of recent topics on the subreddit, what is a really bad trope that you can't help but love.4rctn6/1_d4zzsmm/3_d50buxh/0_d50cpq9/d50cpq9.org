Yeah but... None of those really appeal to me. Sorry! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm sure they'd be very good.

Edit: No need to downvote. It's all about personal taste. I'm sure stories like this are well written, but there are very few times I can read AU, and it's usually for non-canon pairings, not scenarios. It's just personal preference, and I don't mean to offend anyone.
