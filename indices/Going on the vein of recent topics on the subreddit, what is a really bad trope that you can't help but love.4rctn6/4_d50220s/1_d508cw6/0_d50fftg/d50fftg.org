I really love A Black Comedy by Nonjon - linkffn(3401052)

It's a bit more than just a lordship fic; Harry goes through the veil to another dimension where he and Sirius died when he was a baby. He finds his own Sirius there, and the two of them as Lord Blacks cause havoc and mayhem in the wizengamot (and elsewhere).

The bit that for me works really well is that Harry is convinced the system of lordships is stupid, and proceeds to demonstrate exactly how stupid to convince the wizengamot to get with the times and fix the system.
