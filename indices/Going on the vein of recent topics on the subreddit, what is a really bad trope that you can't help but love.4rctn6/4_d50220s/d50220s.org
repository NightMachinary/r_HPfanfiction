I don't believe that Lordship fics are automatically bad, it's just that the ^{vast} majority of them are crap.

I'm a bit of a sucker for marriage law/contract (they're the same damn thing, just slightly different setups) fics.

While I can't say I like them, I think magical cores have potential if they aren't treated like DBZ power levels (which were dropped from DBZ because they were stupid).

Though they are virtually always bad, I lately have felt drawn to James and Lily come back to life fics.

*tl;dr* It's not the trope itself, it's the execution.
