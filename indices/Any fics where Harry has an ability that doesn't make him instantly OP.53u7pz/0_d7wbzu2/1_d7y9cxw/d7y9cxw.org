I just started Emerald Trance.... and I am disappointed. A lot of similar things happening I can understand, but the whole Umbridge situation is annoying. Harry who has learned to watch his mouth for several years is still getting in trouble for snapping. It kind of ruins the premise a bit for me.

Edit) I redact my comment.
