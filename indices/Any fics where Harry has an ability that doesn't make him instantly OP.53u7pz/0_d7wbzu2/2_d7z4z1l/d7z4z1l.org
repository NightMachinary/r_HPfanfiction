I just finished this fanfiction, and I have to say.... it is very well written, but absolutely a nightmare in execution. The Emerald Trance is a perfect power, that Harry easily controls, never gets tired when using, and is consistent. Except for one portion of the story it is a mary sue power.

I had some serious issues with how close the author follows cannon as well, I get that the general layout is the same, but in the end I feel like he just rewrote the entire story with a less enjoyable Harry Potter.
