  he was still directly responsible for too much death and destruction to ever be absolved of his actions

We're talking about redemption, not absolution.

  For the vast majority of his experience at Hogwarts, he was surrounded by the likes of Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Hagrid.

No, for the vast majority of his experience at Hogwarts he was surrounded by other Slytherin students, at least most of whom were raised like him. Even Harry only interacted with Dumbledore occasionally and he was special. He would've interacted with McGonagall and Hagrid only in their respective classes.

  Katie Bell spent six months recovering at St. Mungo's. Ron would have died without Harry's quick thinking. Doesn't sound half-hearted to me.

And in neither case did his attempt get anywhere near accomplishing his actual task - killing Dumbledore. Nor were they likely to.

  I'm reminded of Sirius' response to Peter, when he whinged about being in a similar situation:

This is a terrible comparison. Peter actually was surrounded by people with a better moral framework.

This kind of black and white thinking is what frustrates me so much about this topic. People are not inherently good or evil. Yeah, Draco did bad shit, and I'm not saying he should just be absolved of it. But I argue that based on how he was raised and the environment he was in you can't expect him to have acted in any other way, to suddenly have a complete personality change and decide out of nowhere that what he's doing is wrong and he won't do it anymore, damn the consequences. That doesn't mean he can't change in the future. He's now seen the utter failure of that belief system he was raised with. A redemption story is at least a plausible way for his character to develop in the future.
