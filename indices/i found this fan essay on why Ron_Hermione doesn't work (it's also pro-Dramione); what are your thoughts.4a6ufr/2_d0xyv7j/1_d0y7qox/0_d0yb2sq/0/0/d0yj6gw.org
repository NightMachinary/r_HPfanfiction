  No, for the vast majority of his experience at Hogwarts he was surrounded by other Slytherin students, at least most of whom were raised like him.
#+end_quote

Harry is able to discount the inane opinions of the student body during CS and GoF. Why can't Draco do the same with the prejudices in Slytherin?

#+begin_quote
  He would've interacted with McGonagall and Hagrid only in their respective classes.
#+end_quote

And yet Harry's occasional and brief interactions with both of these individuals (and Dumbledore) was often enough to put him back on track whenever he occasionally went astray. Draco chose not to make use of these resources.

  And in neither case did his attempt get anywhere near accomplishing his actual task - killing Dumbledore. Nor were they likely to.
#+end_quote

I don't see any evidence that these ineffectual assassination attempts were anything other than genuine efforts to do TMR's bidding. Maybe I'm not picking up what you're putting down, but I don't see how Draco's failure to kill Dumbledore excuses his attacks on Katie Bell and Ron.

  This is a terrible comparison. Peter actually was surrounded by people with a better moral framework.
#+end_quote

I chose that example because both Peter and Draco had the option to refuse to do TMR's bidding and die doing what was morally praiseworthy, but chose not to do so. This comparison had nothing to do with their wildly disparate support structures.

  People are not inherently good or evil.

In real life I absolutely agree and I can empathise with your frustration about the monochrome attitudes that often bleed into character discussions. Literary characters in YA fiction, though, /are/ frequently paragons of virtue or irredeemable villains.

#+begin_quote
  But I argue that based on how he was raised and the environment he was in you can't expect him to have acted in any other way, to suddenly have a complete personality change and decide out of nowhere that what he's doing is wrong and he won't do it anymore, damn the consequences.
#+end_quote

Harry saw right through the Dursleys, so there's a precedent. Vernon and Petunia treated him quite poorly, so that likely aided his decision to spurn their values system, but the fact remains that Harry was able to settle on his own moral framework independent of his parental figures.

I think this boils down to a fundamental disagreement over the level of Draco's agency throughout the series. I think he had quite a bit, but set the stage for his future problems through his own bad decisions. You seem to be arguing that lacked the ability to affect any changes in his environment. If that's the case, I doubt we'll find any common ground, but I thank you for the interesting conversation anyway.
