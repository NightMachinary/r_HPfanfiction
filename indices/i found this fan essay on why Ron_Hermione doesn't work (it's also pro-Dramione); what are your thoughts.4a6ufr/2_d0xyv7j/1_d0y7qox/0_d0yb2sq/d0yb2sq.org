  And also Draco is not a "thoroughly despicable villain". Voldemort is that. Bellatrix.

This seems a bit disingenuous. "If you aren't a Dark Lord or his sadistic lieutenant, then your heart must not be in it." Surely Draco's actions have painted him as an unrepentant bigot. It's true that Draco didn't harm /as many/ people as TMR or Bellatrix, but he was still directly responsible for too much death and destruction to ever be absolved of his actions.

  One's values don't appear ex nihilo.

He also doesn't exist in a vacuum. There were /plenty/ of other influences throughout the series that could have helped him to develop a more mature values system if only he'd been open to alternate points of view. He saw Lucius and Narcissa for only three months of the year, which I'd think would greatly diminish their contribution. For the vast majority of his experience at Hogwarts, he was surrounded by the likes of Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Hagrid. He had plenty of opportunities to ditch his bigotry but chose not to do so.

  His attempts to kill Dumbledore were half-assed, indirect methods that seemed designed more to look like he was making an effort than to actually succeed.

Katie Bell spent six months recovering at St. Mungo's. Ron would have died without Harry's quick thinking. Doesn't sound half-hearted to me.

  I don't know how you can reasonably expect anything else from someone in his position.

I'm reminded of Sirius' response to Peter, when he whinged about being in a similar situation:

  "What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has ever existed?" said Black, with a terrible fury on his face. "Only innocent lives, Peter!"
