Some people /do/ like redemption stories. And also Draco is not a "thoroughly despicable villain". Voldemort is that. Bellatrix. And, hell, people seem to have less of an issue with Bellatrix pairings than they do with Draco. Draco was a bratty kid who was raised to believe he was better than everyone else. To expect him to have risen above that and adopted a better moral framework while still a teenager surrounded by people reinforcing the original one is /ridiculous/. One's values don't appear ex nihilo. They're the product of your environment and experiences (and biology to an extent).

We also know that when it came down to it he couldn't actually bring himself to kill or to betray Harry to Voldemort. His attempts to kill Dumbledore were half-assed, indirect methods that seemed designed more to look like he was making an effort than to actually succeed. The fact that they were just as likely to harm someone other than the target (and did) is not exactly laudable, nor was allowing the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, but I don't know how you can reasonably expect anything else from someone in his position.

There's a good chance his experiences in the war would have shaken his belief system. Overall he seems like an ideal candidate for a redemption story. That story /is/ Draco developing a values system of his own.
