It's from tumblr.com, so it was everything I thought it would be: tiny font, questionable grammar, and atrocious word flow. For example:

#+begin_quote
  ^{But,} ^{as} ^{I} ^{discussed} ^{earlier,} ^{their} ^{chance} ^{was} ^{unlikely} ^{to} ^{make} ^{it.}
#+end_quote

Bonus disparaging of canon relationships with Newspeak buzzword:

#+begin_quote
  But in terms of the Romione dynamic, it's *problematic.*
#+end_quote

Hrrk.

The author then goes on to confuse flighty concepts such as 'good' and 'bad' in a series where it was quite clear who was evil and who wasn't 90% of the time:

#+begin_quote
  [JKR] offers [Draco] no redemption, and even the fact that his family didn't have to serve in Azkaban is tainted by the fact that JKR wanted to further this concept of Harry being amazing and good, rather than to really give the Malfoys some absolution of guilt).
#+end_quote

Even JKR's 'everyone gets redeemed' philosophy isn't enough for some fans. They want absolution. Quick, I need an old priest and a young priest.

The author also attempts to lessen the impact of the Malfoys' bigotry and places the crux of Draco's belief system at Lucius's feet:

#+begin_quote
  But it's important to remember that those aren't Draco's beliefs. They are his father's, and Voldemort's, and Snape's.
#+end_quote

In a moment of rhetorical clarity, the author attempts to anticipate the most likely objection to their argument:

#+begin_quote
  [Draco] didn't know to challenge his elders simply because that's not the way he was raised. I doubt Lucius Malfoy taught his son to “question everything” or ask “why?”. No way. Draco was told to sit down, shut up, listen, and do as we say. Or else.
#+end_quote

The author was forced to strip all agency away from Draco in the process of defending his actions. How revoltingly boring: a character without a values system of their own.

Sorry for the often sarcastic rant, but I strongly dislike redemption stories for thoroughly despicable villains. +Tom Felton+ Draco is one of the most popular characters in the fandom, so I understand that people defend him, but for the life of me I can't figure out /why./
