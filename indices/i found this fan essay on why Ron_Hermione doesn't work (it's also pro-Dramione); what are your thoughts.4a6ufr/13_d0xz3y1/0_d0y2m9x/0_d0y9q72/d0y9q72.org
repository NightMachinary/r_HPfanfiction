The problem is that for anybody but a pair of immature teenagers love isn't enough to build a lasting relationship on. Ron and Hermione expect very different things out of a partner and following each other's expectation instead of their own course would leave either miserable.

Ron can't and won't push himself to succeed nor support her own aspirations to the level she needs. He just doesn't have the drive. And Hermione won't be a second Molly Weasley for him. There's little space for compromise between them.

If fanfic authors and readers weren't so obsessed with "ever after", the "one true love" that has to be found while still in school and absolutely never conceding an inch to the epilogue we could have so many lovely stories featuring their relationship imploding and they finding someone new with a more mature outlook.
