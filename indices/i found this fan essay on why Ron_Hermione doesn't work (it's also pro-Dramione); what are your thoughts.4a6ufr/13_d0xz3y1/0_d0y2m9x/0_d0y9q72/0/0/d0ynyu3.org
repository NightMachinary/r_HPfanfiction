There's a difference between enjoying the jokes of a friend for the occasional hour or two and living with an incessant jokester. And Ron doing better was instead of not doing his homework at all or getting somebody else to do it for him he did it with minimal effort at the last minute. That's still far below Hermione's acceptable minimum.

Same even a relaxed Hermione is far more intense.

What do you think their home life will be. They will turn into a volatile twisted mirror image of Arthur and Molly's relationship but where Arthur is able to let Molly's incessant pushing roll off his back and just do his own thing Ron inherited his mother's temper. And Hermione is not Molly, she may be just as pushy but she is not content with being a homemaker and mother, she will not be one to just take care and mother him so he can coast along.

And that will cause great friction and permanent unhappiness in both of them that will blow up in everyone's face if they don't get a clue early enough and gain some distance from each other.

Neither can be what the other needs.
