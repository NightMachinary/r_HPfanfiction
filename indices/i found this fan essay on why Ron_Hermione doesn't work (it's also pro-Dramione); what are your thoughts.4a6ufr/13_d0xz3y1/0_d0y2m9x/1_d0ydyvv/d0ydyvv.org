Well, and I said above that I think they could balance each other out. Opposites do sometimes get along really well.

I'm just saying I can understand the sentiment about how their relationship might not work if they don't develop some more mature patterns. Them at 17 is definitely not the basis for a healthy supportive marriage, which is fine, because they're 17. But I think they characters would have to mature more than the epilogue implies they do in order to work.

Basically, I'm not anti Ronmione, I'm anti epilogue.
