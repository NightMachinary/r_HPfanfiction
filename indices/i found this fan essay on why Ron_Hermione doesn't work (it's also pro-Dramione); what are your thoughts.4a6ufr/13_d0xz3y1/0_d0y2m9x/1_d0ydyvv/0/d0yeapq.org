But 19 years is a hell of a long time. Who's to say they didn't have a whole journey of breaking up, getting back together breaking up again then Ron does something stupid like sleeping with Lavender, it upset Hermione but then she didn't something out of spite and then they all reconciled and go through counselling a fair bit and they may not be all perfect yet anyway. Just because everything looks perfect on the surface doesn't mean it is.
