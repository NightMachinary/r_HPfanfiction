There seems to be a lot of My Ship Is Better Than Your Ship sentiment here, where people are saying Dramione is crazy, which I think is ironic given people are upset at the author for doing the same thing. And there's lots of down voting which makes me sad in an otherwise positive sub. Why not ship and let ship?

I don't agree that Draco is the only logical choice for Hermione, but I think the author brings up good points about the nature of Ron and Hermiones relationship. I always felt a little weird about their dynamic, and I think the observation that Hermione is exacting and Ron is insecure really hits the nail on the head about why their relationship always felt off to me personally.

I think her lecturing and his carelessness, her need for intellectual stimulation and his desire to make everything lighthearted could make them either really compatible as they balance each other out, or really incompatible as they clash.
