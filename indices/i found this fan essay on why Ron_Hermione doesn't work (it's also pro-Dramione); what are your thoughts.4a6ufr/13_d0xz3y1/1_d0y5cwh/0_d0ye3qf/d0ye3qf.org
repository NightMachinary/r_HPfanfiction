I don't agree with the article, just some of the points. I think Hermione and Ron would have to mature beyond where they were at 17 in order to work, and the epilogue doesn't give them that journey.

And I don't ship Dramione, but I think a lot of people are being hipocritical here by bashing that idea as stupid and illogical, while being angry with this author for defending her pairing and calling Ronmione bad.

Ship and let ship, I say.
