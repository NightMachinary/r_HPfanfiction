I would agree with two things: That Ron and Hermione were an odd and uncomfortable pair that I have trouble imagine working out long term, and that few other male characters were developed enough to be a potential romantic partner for Hermione.

If you put aside Neville, as the blog post author did, then Draco is the only eligible male character that's had significant page time. As he is at the end of the seven books, he's shown to have at least /disliked/ the reality of the rhetoric of his family and the Dark Lord. He also seems to be somewhat intelligent with a sense of humor, though he's a little jerk and a bully and arrogant as all get-out.

I think a good writer who chose to continue the story post book 7 could /develop/ Draco into a viable partner for Hermione, and in terms of storytelling there's real value there. Conflict and tension, etc.

A good author could also develop a whole new character who is a decent match for Hermione, too, in that case. But since many fanfic readers like to see their familiar characters treated, it might not pull in many readers . . .
