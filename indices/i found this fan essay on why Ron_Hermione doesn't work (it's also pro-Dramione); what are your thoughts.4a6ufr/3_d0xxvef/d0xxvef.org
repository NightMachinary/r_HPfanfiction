I have to admit most sorts of shipping, canon or otherwise are hard to really believe. Rowling is very creative, but her ability to develop healthy or balanced romantic relationships leaves something to be desired. I appreciate the points made in the tumblr argument about the epilogue not really giving characters a chance to move on from their 17/18 year old selves, but to put Draco in as the obvious next choice is too forced.
