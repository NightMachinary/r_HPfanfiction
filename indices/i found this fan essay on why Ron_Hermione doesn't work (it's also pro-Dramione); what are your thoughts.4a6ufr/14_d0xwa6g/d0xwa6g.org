I found it well-reasoned. Especially the Ron continuing to be immature and the relationships at 18 generally falling apart. And at least they rejected the "Hermione shows Draco the light" idea; I, too, wouldn't be surprised if he found rejecting his father's views to be in his own best interests, without anyone else's input. After that, imagining the two of them connecting as adults is believable.
