They do have a good point about the fact that the epilogue is 2 decades of time with no character development; it makes everything seem a little odd. But both the parts that criticize Ron/Hermione and the parts that hold up Draco/Hermione ignore textual evidence and conflate or exaggerate other sections as suits them. Hell, they say that they "personally believe" that Draco gave up his pureblood beliefs as early as book 4 in spite of their being absolutely no evidence of that, and ample evidence of the opposite. They say that Ron constantly compares women to his mother and holds her up as ideal. There is exactly one time that Ron brings up his mother as an ideal figure, and that's with regards to cooking, while they're starving in the forest and he's wearing a horcrux. They assume that the thing Hermione would value the most in a partner is the ability to match her for wits and cleverness, in spite of her expressly stating the opposite as early as PS.
