Ron helps George out (Fred DIED, I really don't think Ron is just leeching a job) and then goes on to become a motherfucking Auror. And that makes him a loser that's unworthy of a powerhouse like Hermione? I'm sure she'd be much happier with a "leader" like Draco Malfoy who'll inherit a fortune.

Looks like Ron's angst about being poor and not good enough is justified.
