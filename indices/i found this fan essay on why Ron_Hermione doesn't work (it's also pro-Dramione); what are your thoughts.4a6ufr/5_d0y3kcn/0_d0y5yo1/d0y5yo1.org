This is where I'm at, too. Like what you like, but don't tell other people they can't like something different or crap on what they like. Respect each other - live and let live. They're fictional characters, there's no need to hurt or insult /real people/ over them.

Not to mention that some of us aren't dedicated to one ship, and we easily read stories from all of them, without having to mentally deconstruct the previous ship we read to move on to the next.
