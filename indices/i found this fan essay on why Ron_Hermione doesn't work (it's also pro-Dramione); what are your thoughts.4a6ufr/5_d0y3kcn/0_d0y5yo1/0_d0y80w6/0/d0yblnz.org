Exactly! I can enjoy just about any pairing that isn't pedo/hebephiliac. It's actually part of the joy of fanfic that we /can/ explore the different possibilities, and there's no reason to be down on each other for our preferences within those possibilities. The main thing should be the quality of the writing.
