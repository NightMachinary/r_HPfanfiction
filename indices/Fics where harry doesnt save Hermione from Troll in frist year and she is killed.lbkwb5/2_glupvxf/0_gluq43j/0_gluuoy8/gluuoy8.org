By the end of first year, she's probably the one who's kissing Dumbledore's ass /the least/:

  “Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round --- that took a while --- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall --- he already knew --- he just said, ‘Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.”

  “D'you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your father's Cloak and everything?”

  /“Well,”/ Hermione exploded, “if he did --- I mean to say --- that's terrible --- you could have been killed.”

  “No, it isn't,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. . . .”

  “Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course --- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you --- but the food'll be good.”

And she already kind of has an "ends justify the means" attitude throughout the books. Trapping Skeeter in a jar and blackmailing her, permanently scarring Marietta, etc.
