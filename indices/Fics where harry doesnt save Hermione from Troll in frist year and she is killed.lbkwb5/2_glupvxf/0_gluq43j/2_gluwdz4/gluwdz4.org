Hermione become more proactive? unlike Ron and Harry she is the more active one. she study more advance magic some beyond her year level.

In the first year she push toward studying who Flamel is.

In the second she find out about the Basilisk.

In the fifth she come with the idea of an underground study group for study DADA.

In the sixth year she is the one to steal the books.

Having Hermione more active will simply turn her into some bloody Mary Sue (And this is why some people doesn't like the movies), and you wouldn't need Harry and Ron with her.
