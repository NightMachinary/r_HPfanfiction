I mean, what? Hermione in the books is totally on the same page with Harry and Ron about 90% of their rule breaking and even proposes some of its most outrageous points like the DA. She gets dramatically less high - strung after the troll incident as is literally pointed out in the books.

As a whole you sound like a typical case of "read so much fanon I forgot the source material" how exactly do you expect a 11-17 year old to get more proactive than canon Hermione, she tops her classes, researches the systems she is fighting, and literally bugs Harry to start a practical defense club even though it's what she is literally worst at.

On the point of kissing Dumbledore's hindquarters yall need to seriously remember that manipulative!Dumbledore is purely fanon material.
