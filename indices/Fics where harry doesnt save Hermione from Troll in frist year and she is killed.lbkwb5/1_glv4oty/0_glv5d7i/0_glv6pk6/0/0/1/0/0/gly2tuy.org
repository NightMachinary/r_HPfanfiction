She didn't tell Harry that she thought Black had given him the Firebolt. Of course he was happy about the broom, it wasn't like he'd had much in the way of presents in his life up to that point. If Hermione had expressed her thought to him in private and told him that she was going to a teacher because of it, I wouldn't be calling her sneaky. When did I say that she should've let him 'potentially kill himself'? If you read my comment, I said that she was justified in going to a professor, but Harry had a right to know that she was going to do it.
