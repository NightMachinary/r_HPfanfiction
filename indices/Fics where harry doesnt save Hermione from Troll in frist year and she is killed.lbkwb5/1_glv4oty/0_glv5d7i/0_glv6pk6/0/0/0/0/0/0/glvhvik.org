Where did I say she was a goddess? I just pointed out he multiple instances that disagree with your characterization of her.

Hermione has many flaws, she's bossy, she always thinks she's right, she is obsessive to the unhealthy degrees and she can be judgemental. However, she's also incredibly smart, very loyal, strong in her beliefs about what is right/wrong and will break rules if she believes it to be right, even if she fundamentally believes rules should be followed.
