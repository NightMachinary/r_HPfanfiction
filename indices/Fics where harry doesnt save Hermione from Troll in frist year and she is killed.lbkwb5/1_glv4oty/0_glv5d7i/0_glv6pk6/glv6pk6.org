You mean, snitch Hermione who setup an illegal DA? Charmed coins to go jinx anybody who did snitch? Was willing to go against a decision by the ministry to execute Buckbeak? Who helped care for and sneak out an illegal dragon from Hagrid? Who confounded Cormac McLaggen during Qudditch tryouts? Who refused to let Harry go alone when he was going to steal the Philosopher's stone, even after he offered? Who stole books from Hogwarts to help on the Horcrux hunt?

Hermione is willing to break rules, she does it all the bloody time. The difference is, unlike Harry, her first response isn't to rush into an unknown dangerous situations with zero thought.
