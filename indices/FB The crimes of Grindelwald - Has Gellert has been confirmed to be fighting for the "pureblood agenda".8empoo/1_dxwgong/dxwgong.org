I think a dark wizard who wasn't anti muggle born would be more interesting. Hell, a muggle born dark witch/wizard who genuinely believed that they would take over the world and then end world hunger, war, and diseases muggles have no cures for (maybe he/she had a parent die of cancer?) would be way interesting.

I don't think that's going to be Grindelwald's thing though.
