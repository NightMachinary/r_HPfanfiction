Grindelwald in the books wanted *all* of Wizarding kind to rule supreme over the muggles.

Some pure-bloods have the blood purity beliefs though, so they would probably join him (since muggles are dirtying the wizards with 'dirty' blood). But it wouldn't only be pure-bloods, no.

I would rather they didn't do blood purity again. But it is easy to follow the points from the HP-series and it makes money. So it probably will be.
