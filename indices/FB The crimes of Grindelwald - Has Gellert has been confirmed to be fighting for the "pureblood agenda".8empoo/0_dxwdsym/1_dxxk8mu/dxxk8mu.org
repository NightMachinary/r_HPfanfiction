  And in purebloods you could technically find your easiest allies, since they loathed muggles anyway, next to muggleborns or halfbloods.

I'm not sure this is true. In as much that "pure-blood" in canon is associated with political power (it mostly isn't), they tend to support the status quo. The Statute of Secrecy was a product of the wizarding political classes. That same political class is unlikely to support tearing it down.

It seems to me that Muggleborns and Half-Bloods are much more Grindelwald's natural supporters. Those with more contact with the Muggle world may have reasons for tearing down the Statute of Secrecy that pure-bloods lack. We even see it in this sub - people suggesting that wizards have a moral obligation to, say, cure cancer for Muggles. It's a short step from there to Grindelwald's philosophy of ruling Muggles for their own good.
