Wouldn't it be the other way around? Grindelwald came before Voldemort and was also mentioned in Philosopher's stone.

And you have to remember that the first half of the 20th century was a breeding ground for revolutions, so Grindelwald would have used different methods than Voldemort. A lot less sneaking around and a lot more "blast the door down and raise the Red Banner".
