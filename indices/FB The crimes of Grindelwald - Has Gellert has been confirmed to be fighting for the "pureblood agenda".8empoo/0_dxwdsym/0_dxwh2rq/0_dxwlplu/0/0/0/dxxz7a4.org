Can't speak for Mussolini, not studied him in nearly as much detail, but Hitler got his spot as Chancellor expressly because his party gave the non-socialist-aligned coalition a majority in the Reichstag. It was a genuine fear in Germany at the time - soothed somewhat by Stalin's policy of not helping reds in other countries than Russia - and the NSDAP played on it heavily.

It was very much a live issue in Germany at the time - again, don't know about Italy - because their revolution of 1918-19 included a lot of reds who'd tried very hard to make it properly socialist instead of the basic social-democratic regime change it turned out as. The spartacist uprising had had to be put down by armed force.
