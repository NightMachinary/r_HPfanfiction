In 1930-33, the KPD (communist party) was very far from reaching a majority in the Reichstag. While street fighting with right wing groups and the police, but they were still far from power. And Hitler became Chancellor after Hindenburg spent a couple years giving everyone else the job. He was certainly opposed to communism, but his main goals were restoring the old borders, revenge for Versailles and conquering new Lebensraum.
