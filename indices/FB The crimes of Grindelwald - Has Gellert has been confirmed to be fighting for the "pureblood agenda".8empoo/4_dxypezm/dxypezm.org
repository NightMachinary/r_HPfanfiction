See, in my mind I always pictured Gellert as a gent who utilized and uplifted the muggleborns, because to muggleborns of the 1900s the magical world must have seemed highly advanced, and having a charismatic leader tell you something like "You are special. You can help make the world a better beautiful place where the muggles stop darkening our planet with smog and corruption. I can lead you to green pastures and clear skies, where our children can fly free." And it would be pretty compelling. If magical beings have all of these skills and work together, couldn't they make a brighter future? Sure, some people might rebel but there always is someone against change. It would be easy for a muggleborn from a working class family to want to fix things for the better and ask questions later. I like the idea of Grindelwald having a muggleborn militia, because he was for all magical beings as supreme, with himself as the head.
