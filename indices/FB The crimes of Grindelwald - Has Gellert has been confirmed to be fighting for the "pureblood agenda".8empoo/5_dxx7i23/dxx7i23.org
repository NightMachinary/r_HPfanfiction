As people have said before me, Book-Canon Grindelwald wanted all magical beings to rule over all non-magical beings.

From what I understand, your fear is that J.K. Rowling will ignore that anyway and change his ideals? It has a slight chance of being possible but I think its unlikely. From what we have seen, he hasn't shown any signs of any pureblood agenda.
