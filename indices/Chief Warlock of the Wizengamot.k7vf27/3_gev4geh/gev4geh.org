Well, that is partially due to Dumbledore not exercising that power in full and because Rowling needed to have plot.

Basically, in the Parliament-like Wizengamot, Chief Warlock 'leads the proceedings'. That means he decides which cases are heard by the whole Wizengamot, and which relegated to be handled by Ministerial departments. He decides in which order they are presented. He speaks before and after each time someone presents a proposal.

​

That means, he could shuffle the agendas to polarize the voters and for example place every 'traditionalist' motion next to an Umbridge motion, basically sinking it via "Your approval fills me with shame" association. He can delay or push forward with a motion depending on who is present in the chamber. He can silence a speaker, or question them.

​

It's less a direct position of power, but more one that a charismatic leader can use to project the power they already have further. In other words... "I'm gonna ruin that man's whole career." is something that can be achieved with just a few words and good timing.
