Politicians by their nature tend to be very loud, gregarious, and dominant personalities - hence why every other 'debate' tends to devolve pretty quickly into people just shouting at each other rather than actually talking anything through. It's an unfortunate side-effect of modern democracy, it seems. We elect people in the same way we pick X-Factor winners, so the same qualities tend to be selected - popular with the people, content or wanting to be the centre of attention, very forceful about their opinions/talents and what they have to offer, etc. Thus, in order to get anything done, these people need to be moderated and told to get the fuck on with their actual jobs. This is where the Chief Warlock (the Muggle world has one too, but I can't currently recall the name we use in the UK) comes in. They'd moderate discussions and generally keep 'debate' from devolving too far into pointless bickering. So, I'd imagine that's why Dumbledore would stay in the role - to keep the Politicians from stagnating.
