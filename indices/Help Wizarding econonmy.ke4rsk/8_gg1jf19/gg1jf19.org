1. Generally in smaller communities, things are more expensive as there is less room for specialisation and economies of scale. However you have to take into consideration how magic affects this: for instance, if you are able to transfigure robes, then its price will likely be lower. If magic is used for agriculture, then food prices may be cheaper. Equally, it may be the case that if there is one food supplier, then prices are exorbitantly high. Again, context is very important.
2. In my opinion, you shouldn't worry too much about the exchange rate unless it is of importance that the plot crosses between the muggle and magical world. An exchange only warrants discussion in a fanfic if there is significant cross-world interaction. For instance, are there regulations to stop you melting down the gold and flooding the muggle economy, which would cause an investigation and threaten the SoS. Perhaps the ministry and Gringotts has a fixed exchange rate. If there isn't enough demand on either side, then exchange rates will likely be unofficial between private individuals, with the rates fluctuating wildly.
3. Again, this depends on context. With the presence of house elves (slave/free labour), who appear to actually be very motivated in their jobs, this likely means that the lower ranks of society are undercut far more than in the muggle world. For instance, Filch is easily replaceable, and thus would likely have a much poorer salary compared to a muggle equivalent. Equally, it appears many, if not all students are capable, at least to some degree, of charms, transfiguration and potions, meaning that these industries and their workers are likely to be squeezed. However, specialised positions hard to replace are likely to command extremely high wages, given that only a small proportion of an already small wizarding population would fit in those roles.
4. I would believe that a Hogwarts professor would command an extremely high wage. This is because, at least from what we are given, the role demands high qualifications. Snape, who is the potions master, was a child prodigy, modifying potions as a student. Mcgonagall demonstrates the ability to turn into an animagus, a supposedly rare feat, and on a tangential note was able to produce 3 patronuses (which I think is BS but is canon), suggesting she is extremely powerful and competent. However, keep in mind those are the /core subjects/, and similar to in the real world, professors of other subjects such as muggle studies may receive far less.

The most important thing in writing any fic is to make it internally consistent. This is something, which most economists would tell you, JK seems to completely mess up. The grand prize for the Daily Prophet prize is 700 galleons. A trip on the Knight Bus costs eleven sickles, meaning the prize could fund around 1000 trips. In the UK in 1994, the First National Lottery Draw had a grand prize of around 6 million pounds. Around that time, a bus ticket cost around 40 pence (15 million trips), an economy concorde ticket cost around a thousand pounds (rough calculation using approximation of 1500 usd with 1994 exchange rate median, 4000 trips). By this estimation, the Knight Bus would be considered a luxury transport. It's not, and if you consider the fact that apparation is extremely common, and other avenues of transport such as portkey, floo, broomstick or hippogriff (if you have the power of main character) then you'd expect prices to be lower than natural. A meat pie costs 2 galleons, while a soup costs anywhere from 3 to 5 sickles, meaning that around 8.5 soups is a pie, which seems quite high imo (keeping in mind this is bar food)

I think the best approach is to sprinkle this worldbuilding in as JK did. If it isn't absurd (or even if it is), you can get away with it if it isn't the focus of your fic. Talking in relative terms. For instance, Malfoy might mock Potter for his 'pittance of a salary', or we might see that Harry has to be frugal. Don't focus so much on the money aspects, but rather the implications on character actions and behaviors.
