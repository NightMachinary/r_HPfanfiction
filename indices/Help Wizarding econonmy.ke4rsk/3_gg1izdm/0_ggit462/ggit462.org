Your point for the weasleys is a good one, however I feel the need to point out that even if they only had around 5 pound, the books would be cheaper than in the muggle world. Let me explain. It would be easier for wizards to produce books on a large scale for really cheap because of magic. Books in the muggle world are likely more expensive because making the books is more expensive. Other than that I believe you have some very good points.
