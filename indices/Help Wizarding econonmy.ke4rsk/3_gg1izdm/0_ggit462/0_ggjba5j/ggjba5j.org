Ah, I'd meant to put "including books". Even with magic (and based on what Harry spends) Â£5 is cheap for what they get. (Without a doubt cheaper than the muggle world - or they'd have turned up bookless.)

I agree most elements of book printing would be cheaper, but companies things for peanuts in Chinese factories and then charge high prices so its not a given. Especially since Hogwarts books are essentially a closed market - you can't get an alternative guide (just outdated ones) and there's very little else in the way of education available.

I am unsure that the raw material costs would be much less; I think transfigured parchment could run the risk of being untranfigured, something most good printing presses would want to avoid (especially if selling books for rambunctious teenagers).

Even with magic, it could be more hassle to keep animals for parchment compared with growing trees.

Plus, goods can't be THAT cheap or else there wouldn't be a thriving second hand market.

It's my belief that living costs are low, but luxury goods are steeper.
