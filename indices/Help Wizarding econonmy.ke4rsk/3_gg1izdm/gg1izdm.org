I think that salaries are lower in the wizarding world - yes, the Weasleys are supported on one income, but they've also got just one gold galleon in their vault (plus some small change). Purchasing things second hand, they manage to buy books for 5 of their children. This is even though Lockhart sets several books.

On the other hand, I think the wizarding world is far more skill dependent. So, Molly Weasley is great at cooking and food related magic (Ron believes she can conjure it). Quite possible she makes ends meet by increasing food quantities.

On the flipside, we have Tonks who can't even fold a pair of socks.

In the muggle world, yes the available electronics might be (much) better and a very small minority have extraordinarily thrift skills that lead them to look down on those who struggle on benefits but electronics is more of a leveller.

It's also my suspicion that the gap between the rich and poor is wider, with higher levels of deprivation in the wizarding world compared with Britain at the time.

Quite possibly, Hogwarts pay includes board - if it was truly excellent pay, then there would be less trouble recruiting DADA teachers for just under a year.
