1) The magical economy looks very different depending on the limits the author puts on magic. Dumbledore conjures comfy armchairs with a wave of his wand, so furniture is probably ridiculously cheap...unless conjured items fade over time, or conjugation is power intensive. Overall, anything made with raw materials should be cheap and anything made with skill and/or labor should be expensive.

2) Check [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/43qv9c/lets_talk_wizard_money_a_look_through_everything/][this thread]] for a list of what everything costs and an estimate of galleons to dollars. Converting that into pounds, one galleon is about Â£20.

3) I'd guess about the same, maybe a little lower for magical salaries. A Hogwarts professor should earn less than that, though, because room and board is included as part of their salary. In the US at least, a balanced budget has rent as about a third of your income. So whatever salary you decide a teacher should earn, multiply that number by 0.67 to see what a Hogwarts teacher should earn.

4) They should earn enough to live comfortably but not lavishly. Harry never comments that Snape's clothes are ratty (which, he comments on Snape's hygiene all the time) and we know Snape didn't have any money or decent clothes from his parents. So Snape's salary must be enough to put him in at least average clothing. Likewise, the only professor we see living in luxury, Slughorn, tells Harry that his luxuries are gifts. He doesn't buy excessive extras with his salary/pension.
