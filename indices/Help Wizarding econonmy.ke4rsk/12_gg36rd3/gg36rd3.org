1. I'd say everything is cheaper. and I have two listings of prices for things in the wizarding world: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/43qv9c/lets_talk_wizard_money_a_look_through_everything/]] is something I found a long time ago but I also have a list for a lot of things that was listed on Pottermore when it was a video game: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BOzE6ih7ZrEJtCoGs_CF2_K0g5f3bSW0hHoOjiUc_L8/edit?usp=sharing]]
2. This can help you figure out the currency value per any date starting this exact moment that your read this and the current moment as it continues all the way into the past of when people kept track of the currency. It is based off a bank value converter of British Pounds and they assume that a Galleon is always 5 Pounds.
3. I'd say it is the same but it is likely that it is less. Most things are valued at substantially cheaper prices than the human world. Therefore it is likely the job payments are less too.
4. However, if you base it on difficulty I think it should be the same as a muggle teacher since they have to deal with potentially life threatening hazards on a daily basis. Snape was the only teacher who didn't have a kid die or get killed in his potions class. Cauldrons tend to go boom. The Creatures Class had at least one incident with malfoy and many with burn wounds thanks to the Blast Ended Skrewts.
