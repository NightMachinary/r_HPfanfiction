The best exchange rate is 1 gallon = £50.

That puts 1 sickle at about £3 and a knut at £0.1

Arthur and Molly support a family of 7 on 1 salary so I'd assume the cost of living is significantly cheaper.

It would follow that salaries are lower in general as a response.

Unless you feel that salary details add to the plot it'd be easier to handwave past it.
