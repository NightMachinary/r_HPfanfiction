IG is 5 pounds I believe

The salary will not be very high as 1) all expenses are provided but won't be low either it will be a middle to upper middle class salary

The magical world is different from the muggle world I would say that even if the headline number is a bit lower or higher wizards will have a higher standard of living or purchasing power, after all a lot of jobs become redundant due to magic, or at the very least take much less money. A team of 10 wizards could build a decent house from scratch in a forest in a day I believe so many cost will be lower as something similar by muggles will take more time effort and people

Also the existence of apparation means daily commute cost should be low, a big chuck of household expenses
