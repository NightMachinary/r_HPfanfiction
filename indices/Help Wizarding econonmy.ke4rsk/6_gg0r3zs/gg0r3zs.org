1. Pick some conversion ratio. Yes, 1G = £5 (used in the books) is probably wrong (because she has discalculia), so pick whichever you want and stick to it, but it really doesn't matter which one you choose, just stick to it.

2. Then try to approximate based on UK prices, because there must be at least some correlation, otherwise (if we assume at least partially rational behaviour) arbitrage would be a big deal.

3. Therefore, Muggle prices are pretty good foundation of what can be expected. So, when [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/brother_and_sister/_build/html/04_meet_parents.html#id1][I need to establish]] how much Potter family owes Weasley family for taking care of Rose Potter (aka Ginny Weasley, who is actually Harry's sister) for fourteen years, I have found governmental rates in 1990s for foster care family in rural England was £125 weekly (£219 in London), so that makes 25G/week for rural Devon, and you can make your calculations from there.

4. When we have prices which don't have Muggle equivalent (e.g., cost of building serious permanent wards around The Burrow), I just played it by the ear. There are some permanent protective enchantments (aka wards, but the term is never used in the books) around The Malfoy Manor House, but apparently nothing around The Burrow, so I had to find some price which was out of reach for Weasleys and still not completely ridiculous, and I had to invent some back story why something which could be just couple of waves of wand costs so much. So, the wards in my story must be custom designed by specialist for every location (taking into consideration shape of the plot, geological and magical structure of the soil, etc.), and some very special runic stones (only found in one quarry in the northern Norway) must be used. So, in the end they cost around 10-15 thousand Galleons, which fortunately the Potters vault can carry (and they owe to Weasleys that much money anyway; with above calculations for the foster care of Rose, I came with something like 20,000G).
