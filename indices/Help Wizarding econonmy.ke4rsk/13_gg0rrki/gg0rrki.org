In one of my fics harry gets smart and uses his knowledge of the muggle world to do an end-run around the stupid wizarding economy. He gets paid in galleons from his wizarding job, melts the galleons down into ingots (Gringott's ingots. Heh heh.) and then sells the ingots in the muggle world for thousands of pounds, then invests that money. That way he has an investment portfolio that insures he'll never have to work, he just lives off the interest.
