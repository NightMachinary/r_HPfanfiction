my thoughts.

1. 1 gallon equals about five British Pounds. IN the 1990s So, this is about 8 or so $ if your America. But. -Does Not Matter- which my next points will show.
2. I'd say Less. With hog warts Paying about 100-1000 G a year. depending on how you write it. (which gasp seems low. He said that's 8 Grand! but ill explain)

I feel the wizard society as a whole Does not have a lot of inflation our Normal worlds do for many reasons. Also the cost of living is a lot cheaper than most think.

1. as [[/u/Southdelhiboi][u/Southdelhiboi]] said many jobs become redundant with magic.and as [[/u/AnkitMishraGr8][u/AnkitMishraGr8]] mentioned 1000g was enough to start a Buisness. also [[/u/Luna-shovegood][u/Luna-shovegood]] mentioned that the weasleys a rather large family lived off 1 salary ( mind you very tightly but still 1 salary)
2. following gamphs laws you can't create food from scratch you can extend it, and even make it taste better. but you can't create it. we are never told the other 4 laws. but this means you can create -alot- of what you need from magic
3. think of the adult's mindsets/time frames. wizards age slower. so many of them still have older beliefs about money.
4. finally they still have Houses. which makes me think of old lords and such.

My theory is the wizard world is alot acheaper in terms of whats spent, but you also make a lot less. 1 gaellon is a good sized amount of money. but you cant cross it over to our terms. they also Don't need the money as much to live. Magic can warmth, clothes, make cheap food better. outside your few things your pretty much living well off a lesser wage.
