It's supposed to show he's no longer showing emotions, he's reached Equilibrium and can now act as he's expected, a weapon without emotion slowing his reaction times. It's a very fun movie. It's thematic sequel, Ultraviolet, has great gun play too but isn't as good. There's supposed to be a thematic trilogy of gunkata films but Ultraviolet's poor box office, I believe, killed the third film.
