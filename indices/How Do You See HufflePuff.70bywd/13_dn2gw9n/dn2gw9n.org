I'd expect Harry to have a much larger pool of people who know and trust him, and I would expect him to put some work into maintaining those friendships. Hufflepuffs are big on loyalty and community, and I think a Harry that belonged in Hufflepuff would be more proactive about constructing a chosen family for himself instead of being taken in by the Weasleys.

Also I think he would be a bit more community-minded and think more about the impacts of his actions on his friends.
