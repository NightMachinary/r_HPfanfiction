Actually, when harry is just another faceless masses to hermione (if harry in hupplepuff and hermione in griffindor, assuming she didn't die a death by troll), would it be like that? I don't see any indication of rivalry between hermione and any ravenclaw (then again, it has been years since I read HP).
