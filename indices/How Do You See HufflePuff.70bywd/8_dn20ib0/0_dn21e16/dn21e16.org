As I remember the books it says that the Ravenclaws were upset/surprised/disgruntled for the first bit of 1st year bc they thought Hermione should have been in their house.

I think people take this and blow it up up into bullying and rivalries in fannon. When it was more of a passing "but we're supposed to be the smart ones that's not fair" of 11 year olds.
