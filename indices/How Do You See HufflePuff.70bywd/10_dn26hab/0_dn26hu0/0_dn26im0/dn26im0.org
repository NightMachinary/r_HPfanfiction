The same thought applies to fourth year. Harry still doesn't really interact with Hufflepuff often. They are left with mostly rumours to go on when it comes to his personality. Every year he breaks rules, gets in trouble, has some big end of year shenannigans, and somehow ends up fighting evil that nobody else knew about. To the Hufflepuffs, it seems odd. Teachers should be the ones fighting evil. If Harry thinks something evil is lurking in the shadows, why hasn't he tried to warn more people about it? Even if they don't all believe him, they still deserve to be warned.

The rumour mill continues to get facts wrong, so nobody is really sure if anything he supposedly did is even true. Even if every Hufflepuff realizes that most of what they hear is just rumour, they don't have much else to go on. Their personal experience is that Harry attracts attention, regardless of how much he likes or hates it. He rushes into things, he occasionally has a temper, and he doesn't make much of an effort to be friends with people outside his house. To be honest, they probably don't think about him very often unless a new rumour starts.
