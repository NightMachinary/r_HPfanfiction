They finally have a chance to show what Hufflepuff is all about. Cedric Diggory, their close friend and housemate, has been chosen as the Hogwarts champion! He is someone they know personally, someone they see everyday in their own commonroom. Then Harry is suddenly a champion too! It's an insult to their house, their friend, and fair play all in one! Every main aspect of Hufflepuff has been slapped in the face at the same time. They make their loyalty very clear. Cedric is their champion, and they will support him completely. It's a little hard to trust the kid who constantly causes trouble, even if some rumours say that it was for a good cause.

Even his own house doesn't believe him. Ron, someone who has been his best friend for years, thinks Harry is lying! Why should the Hufflepuffs think any different? If the people who know him refuse to believe his story, it probably isn't that true.

As if that wasn't bad enough, Harry asks Cedric's girlfriend to the Yule Ball! Harry had no idea that Cho and Cedric were going together, but the Hufflepuffs don't know that. He really makes himself look like a little shit with that move. He barely even knows Cho, and suddenly he wants to go on a date with her? Seriously, he has had maybe two conversations with her at this point. In fact, I don't think he had a single full convresation with her at all by then. He simply knew she existed.
