Their behavior in second year is because none of them know Harry very well personally. Parseltongue is a rare talent and as far as everyone knew, it was an inherited trait passed down from Slytherin's line only. From their perspective, Harry looked pretty darn guilty. He barely even talked to them, and only really tried to explain himself once. Keep in mind that none of them had seen any of his first year adventure personally either. They had all just heard garbled rumours about it.

So to Hufflepuff...Harry was that famous kid who got a really bad detention last year, broke a bunch of rules, something something philosophers stone and an evil teacher. Then Dumbledore personally made sure that Harry's house got a ton of extra points at the last second. That would not have looked very fair to them, even if it did steal the win away from Slytherin. It's not exactly the best impression to leave them with when they're about to spend months away from anyone who might actually know the full truth.

Sure, they could talk to the trio...sort of. Harry doesn't like attention, and would avoid retelling his story to most of the people who asked. Hermione spent a chunk of 2nd year petrified, and didn't see what happened after that with her own eyes. Ron didn't even see the basilisk or the final fight. He was blocked off by a rockslide. In fact, Ron and Hermione didn't actually see the final fight in first year either. They stayed by the chess set because Ron was hurt.
