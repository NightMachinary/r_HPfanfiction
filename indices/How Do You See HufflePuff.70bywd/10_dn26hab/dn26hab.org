(I went off on a tangent a little, because I feel it might be helpful to think from a Hufflepuff perspective for this. I ended up breaking it into multiple posts. However, the first post is all you need to answer this question.)

To be honest, I don't see too much changing about his persoanlity if he were a Hufflepuff. He's already loyal. He has proven that he will work hard when it really matters, even if he isn't too focussed on his classwork all the time. He has shown multiple times that he is concerned about being fair. The only major difference would be the rush-toward-danger part of his personality. I think he would be more likely to gather backup and tell more teachers about his concerns as a Hufflepuff, but he would still rush into danger if nobody listened.

I also don't see him being completely selfish if he were in Slytherin. Ambition and cunning are not necessarily selfish things. Becoming the world's best lawyer would be considered ambitous, even if your reason to do it was to find the truth or help innocent people get justice. It would also require a certain ammount of cunning. I'm sure there would be hints of selfishness in a Slytherin Harry, but not as much as some fanfic writers seem to think. He might be a little more friendly toward other Slytherins than he was in canon, but he wouldn't suddenly be besties with Malfoy.

As to the canon examples of Hufflepuf, all I'll say is Cedric Diggory. Hufflepuff's traits are loyalty, hardwork, and fairness. The reason we don't see as much of this in canon is because the story takes place from a Gryffindor perspective, and Harry doesn't really pay attention to the other houses much.
