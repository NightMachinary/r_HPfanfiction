I think the "hardwork" trait for Hufflepuff means that they see working hard as a good in itself. You're not working hard as a means of acquiring knowledge. Neither are you working hard in order to achieve some ambition--becoming rich, the president, etc. Rather, you're working hard because it is a virtuous thing to do, or because you have a duty to society to do your best, or something along those lines.
