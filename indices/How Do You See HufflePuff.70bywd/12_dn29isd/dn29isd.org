I was sorted in Hufflepuff by Pottermore, and most other Sorting tests I take I'm almost always sorted into Hufflepuff, and when I'm not then it's mostly followed by Gryffindor.

I like the Hufflepuffs and think that they are severely underappreciated underrepresented.

From what we have seen they are hard working and loyal to their own. (The whole thing with the Tri-Wizard Tournament). I don't think they hated Harry like Draco and the other Slytherins did, they were just more loyal to Cedric because he was apart of their house.

Susan and Hannah are two of my favorite minor characters in Hufflepuff, along with Nymphadora Tonks.

Nymphadora could have very well been sorted into Gryffindor with her behavior. She's courageous, daring, bold, friendly, hard working, she doesn't seem to care what others think about herself or others. Falling in love with a man that's not only much older then her but who is also a Werewolf.

While Hannah Abbott seemed rather shy soft spoken. Falling in love with the bumbling Neville Longbottom, who for the longest time didn't have confidence in himself.

Zacharias Smith is a rather interesting character because he is much more abrasive about his thoughts much more bold and isn't afraid to say what's on his mind from the little we've seen of him. He abandoned them during the Battle of Hogwarts, which is definitely interesting and not as loyal as the other Hufflepuffs.

But they all seem independent, loyal (for the most part) and as I said hardworking in their own way.
