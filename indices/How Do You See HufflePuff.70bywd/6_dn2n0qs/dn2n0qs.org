Honestly, if the Hat made decisions based on what sort of influence a House might have on someone, I don't think it would ever have put Snape in Slytherin. Snape was always a bit of a lost cause, but he was virtually deprived of all chances when the Hat shouted out 'Slytherin.' It's just a bad place for a kid like him to be. Same thing with Tom. If the Hat made that sort of decisions, I don't think it would have put a bunch of like-minded and close-minded kids into Slytherin like it did in canon at all. That House just seems so toxic prior to the war.

Honestly I just think the Hat was designed by the Founders to perform a certain function, and it did that, according to what the Founders thought about human nature. Which is probably also why Dumbledore said he thought they Sort too early. After all, in the old days, the theory was mostly that character was predetermined. Now, with the evolution of psychology, we have a more fluid view of ourselves. The Hat didn't Sort based on potentials, or not mostly based on potentials (since it did mention a possibility of greatness to Harry), it Sorted according to what it saw most in the child at the moment of their Sorting.

And out of all the alternate-Sorting stories, I've always thought that Harry being put in Hufflepuff was the most implausible, unless there was some radical (and I do mean /radical/) change in his upbringing prior to his arrival at Hogwarts. When the Sorting Hat talked to Harry, it mentioned courage, cleverness ("not a bad mind"), talent, a a thirst to prove himself. It didn't mention a single quality pertaining to what Hufflepuff was described as in canon (loyalty, hard-work, honesty etc.) And it was right. Eleven-year-old Harry had very few Hufflepuff qualities - he wasn't loyal because he hadn't had anyone to be loyal to up to this point (only a budding loyalty towards Hagrid), he isn't very hard-working (seeing as he took Ron's example as an excuse to not do a lot of work very often - I won't go into the psychological aspect of this, though I do think the Dursleys are somewhat to blame), and he definitely isn't the most honest of kids, probably due to the frankly quite necessary need to lie to the Dursleys.

Now, if it were a time-travel story though, say Harry goes back to his childhood as someone who has survived a war - I could maybe see it happening, mainly due to the loyalty thing. But I just don't think he's a very Hufflepuff person at heart - too impulsive, too goal-oriented, and far too brave for his own good. He also isn't a very participatory sort of person, and Hufflepuff was always presented as having a community sort of feel. It just seems like more of a stretch to me than even Ravenclaw. (Though I did read this one story where Harry was raised by Voldemort and developed a severe case of Stockholm Syndrome in the process, and was almost put into Hufflepuff due to the sheer intensity of that 'loyalty'. Now this I could believe.)

But in the end, I do think Rowling didn't think Hufflepuff out very well - and for that matter, Ravenclaw as well. I don't think we've really had a 'true Ravenclaw' shown to us - Luna is an eccentric even in her own House. At least Hufflepuff had Diggory. I think she was always only ever focused on Gryffindor and Slytherin as the two Houses that embodied the main conflict of the books (and therefore was the most relevant to the story) during its writing process (but now with Fantastic Beasts, she's branching out a bit, since that's no longer necessary now). I do hope she'll touch on Ravenclaw a bit; Hufflepuff now has Newt to show that it isn't only the average kids that end up in there, but what does Ravenclaw have other than Luna, Cho and Marietta? Hmmm. (And for that matter, is there a Slytherin who /hasn't/ done bad things, any bad stuff for any reason? Or who is portrayed as mostly good despite the mischief? Welp, this did end up as a criticism of the House system as it is written in canon after all.)

Edit: and all this analyzing about Hufflepuff qualities is making me itching to write a Hufflepuff Harry story. I don't think I've read any good ones yet. Sometimes it's just authors using Harry as a self-insert and off-handedly goes "oh, and he's a Hufflepuff in this one cos Hufflepuff is awesome, pls stop the Hufflepuff hate" without any explanation whatsoever, and some random awkward shoehorning of Hufflepuff qualities in Harry that comes out of the left field. Imagine, though, a traditionally Hufflepuff family adopting Harry, and impressing onto him the inherent value of hard work, steadiness, the importance of being down-to-earth and realistic, and the weight of truth, since his birth...Imagine Harry coming back from the graveyard and goes through his schoolwork and self-study for the day in the Hospital Wing even though he's just about half-dead on his feet and would rather be knocked out with a hammer, but he powers on because work is work...Imagine Harry who is the anchor of all of his classmates...Imagine Harry who is the pride of his entire House....Hmm.
