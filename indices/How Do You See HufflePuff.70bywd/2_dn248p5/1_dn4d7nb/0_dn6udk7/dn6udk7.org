There's Old friends, new friends which starts with a similar premise (although Tonks is in her fifth year IIRC) but that story has an eventual romance plot which is poorly done, everything beyond PoA is a horrible mess.

Some time ago I got fed up with the lack of a decent Harry&Tonks sibling dynamic (with her as adopted big sister instead of an eventual love interest) that I started writing my own.
