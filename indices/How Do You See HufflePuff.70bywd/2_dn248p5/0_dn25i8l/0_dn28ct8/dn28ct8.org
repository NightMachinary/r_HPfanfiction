But the head can't just say "hold my beer, I'm going in". There are rules and procedures to follow. Usually Amelia just bangs in and shittalks Dumbledore without even bothering about a warrant. Then Dumbledore says something about the prophecy and she's like "I don't like it, Dumbledore. I don't trust you or your judgement. If you step one toe over the line I'll throw you into prison myself. Anyways, see ya later."

Dumbledore, as Chief Warlock (insert more titles here) could simply fire her and make up some false evidence to cover his actions. Yes she has power but nothing compared to Dumbledore. In a political contest she would lose badly.
