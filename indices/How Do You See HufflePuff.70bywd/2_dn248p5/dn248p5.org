Susan Bones ends up being a cheap plot device in 95 out of 100 cases. Mostly she is used to get Harry in contact with her aunt to do some stupid "politics" that would never work. She is almost never an actual character.

More importantly Harry would meet Tonks during his first/her last year. Since they are related (distantly according to Pottermore/ 3rd or 4th cousins according to fanon) it would give him some sort of family as well as someone who could actually provide him some information about the magical world.

Instead of Bones I would prefer to see stories in which Harry interacts with the average Hufflepuff background characters like Justin FF, Megan Jones or some other students that do not have parents in influential positions but are simple store clerks, employees or merchants. That would be a pleasant change from all the "Lord Potter, Black Windsor, Plantagenet" stories.
