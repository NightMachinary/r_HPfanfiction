Hufflepuff is not the house of the hard working or the loyal. They are the rest. When the magical hat puts you into special boxes, it takes the rejects and puts them into Hufflepuff. They are, from the age of 11, given a chip on their shoulder, something to prove to the world. They work hard because they understand that the rest of the world doesn't care about them. They band together because the rest of the world will look down on them. Looking at the dynamics this creates, Hufflepuff outperforms every other house by a massive margin: the other houses tend into small groups and are plagued by infighting, where Hufflepuff is a single, cohesive, absolutely focused unit. Badgers are fucking scary man.
