Hi there, so sorry it took me so long to come back to you (been very unwilling to engage recently)

I guess I just thought "what if Hogwarts had a darker edge" or it full into the control of a a corrupt establishment - such as the Ministry circa DH. That first point sounds interesting, almost akin to 'Muggleising' wizards.

I guess on the face of it, Harry Potter is too light and fluffy and needs to be darkened, ha!

I imagine that if this post were to continue, eventually the more compassionate staff would find out about Enfarbeitis and would endeavour to have it stopped. Waits to be seen!

Thank you for your comment.
