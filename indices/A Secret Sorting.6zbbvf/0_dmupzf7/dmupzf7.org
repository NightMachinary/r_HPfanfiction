So, what inspired you to come up with this somewhat twisted idea? I know I saw a horror one-shot once where Magical Britain became tyrannical and authoritarian after beating Voldemort, and new students who the Sorting Hat sent to Slytherin were instead put in an electric-chair-like thing and had their magic 'zapped' away, might that have been it?

How do you imagine this snippet continuing? Would 'Minister Granger' be aware of this systematic enslavement-or-murder of 11-year-olds? Is McGonagall, even, or does she think that Enfarbeitis is a private-tutoring house for kids who don't do well with normal school environments or something?
