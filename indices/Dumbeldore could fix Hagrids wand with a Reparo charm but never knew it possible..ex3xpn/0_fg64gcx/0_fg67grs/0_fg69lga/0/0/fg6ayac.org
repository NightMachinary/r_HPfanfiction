He's decent enough, the only spell we ever see him fail at is turning Dudley into a Pig, but we already know that Human transfiguration is quite complicated and he attempted it without incantation. He does show other N.E.W.T level skills though, like being able use Aguamenti and has shown proficiency in silent magic.

Though I doubt he was tutored for 40 years, I think we can assume that he was at least taught for a while after he was expelled.
