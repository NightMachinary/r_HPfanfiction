I've gotten to the point where I just don't read many fics unless they're fourth year or older. There are exceptions if the fic runs through early years quickly or has other characters and subplots to focus on while the kid(s) are growing, but I refuse to read stories dedicated to years 1 through 3. If they're in Hogwarts or some other conventional education setup, there just isn't a happy middle ground at that age for maturity and realism.
