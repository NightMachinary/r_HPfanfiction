Harry went to McGonagall about the stone. He wanted an adult before they went into the chamber. He asked Lupin to help him with the dementors. I mean, he even tried to talk to Dumbledore about Draco in book 6.

He was just shut down repeatedly, which is actually very typical of older adults.

The only adult that ever heeded his warnings was Mr. Weasley.
