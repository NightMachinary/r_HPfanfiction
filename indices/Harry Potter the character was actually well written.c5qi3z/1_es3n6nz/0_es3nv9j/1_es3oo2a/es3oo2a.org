To be honest, McGonagall has no reason to believe someone is after the stone and he did rival/argue with Draco and Snape for 6 years. And I don't really see them as his caregivers.

And what I mean by "shut him down" is "we are older therefore we are correct and you are wrong" which regularly happens in the real world.
