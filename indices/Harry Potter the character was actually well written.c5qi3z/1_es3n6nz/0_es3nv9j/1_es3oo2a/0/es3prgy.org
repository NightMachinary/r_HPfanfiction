  McGonagall has no reason to believe someone is after the stone
#+end_quote

The stone was moved into the school explicitely for safekeeping, as there had been attempts to steal it from its previous locations. Snape got visibly injured trying to confront a theft attempt. There really is no justification for McGonagall to think that the stone is safe at any point of the story.

That is, no justification except author fiat. The same reason why Dumbledore thought a broom to be the most effective way to reach the ministry from fucking Scotland.
