Sometimes I chuckle to myself about how truly emblematic Dumbledore's decision to fly to the Ministry is of JK Rowling's biggest (imo) flaw.

Convenience writing. JK often envisions a plot point or a scene, and then she makes it happen regardless of what that forces her to do to continuity, worldbuilding or character. And no single decision shows this more than the choice for Dumbledore to fly to the Ministry.

In Book 1, Dumbledore uses a broom to fly to the Ministry. At this time, the decision is perfectly logical and character/world consistent.

In Book 2, JK overrules that by introducing Floo Powder. Later books and scenes confirm that you can Floo to/from Hogwarts (or at least that Dumbledore could, as Headmaster, given that he can Apparate and even students can Floo-Call like in GoF when Harry talks to Sirius). Now, Dumbledore looks like he chose a multiple hour flight over an easily accessible less than 30 second journey.

In Book 3, JK adds another potential issue, with the Knight Bus. This one is arguable, as there's no guarantee you could call the Knight Bus from Hogwarts and take it to the Ministry any faster than a broom. Especially given you'd likely need to leave the grounds first. However, it's possible.

In Book 4, she does it again. Portkeys. Later books and scenes confirm that Dumbledore is capable of creating one, and able/allowed/willing to do so without any Ministry pre-approval or paperwork etc as often stipulated in fanon. Again, we ask why Dumbledore took a several hour flight over a Portkey.

In Book 5, yep, she does it again. Dumbledore flashes out of his office using Fawkes. Since Fawkes is almost always by Dumbledore's side and otherwise will come instantly at his call, this is even more convenient than Portkeys or the Floo. However, we're not given any information on its' maximum range, so potentially this could be a worse option than flying (except that one could still fly part way and Phoenix-Travel the rest, or vice versa).

Book 6, Apparition. Confirmed later that Dumbledore is capable of apparating from Hogwarts to the Ministry. Absolutely inexcusable to fly instead of turn once on your heel.

Book 7, Dobby transports 3+ magical humans with his House Elf magic. Dumbledore, as Headmaster, has immediate access to literally dozens of House Elves. So why not use one of them if for some reason the Floo, Portkeys, Fawkes and Apparition are all out of the picture for some reason?

Obviously, these aren't necessarily the first instances we get of each of these travel methods (apparition is used and referenced pre-HBP, for example) but these are at least the points in which we either get crucial confirmation that they would be an option (prior to Dobby's rescue in DH, I don't believe we had any info on whether House Elves could transport Wizards, even though we knew they could transport themselves since CoS) or the points in which they are most relevant and play the largest role. (Fawkes in OotP).

Literally every single book, with the possible exception of PoA depending on your take on the Knight Bus, introduces or makes heavy use of a transport mechanism that would be infinitely preferable on all axes to the one that Dumbledore chose to use, especially given the circumstances of leaving the Stone unprotected for the duration of his Ministry visit. This is not because JK wants us to conclude that Dumbledore is an idiot, or a chessmaster engineering Harry's conflict with Quirrell (despite the fact that many of us do conclude that) but simply because she needed him to be out of the picture for her grand finale that she envisioned, and then in later books she needed more effective transport methods for other reasons, and never thought to consider how they'd retroactively effect her previous plots and the characters involved.

It's a fairly minor thing, when compared to some of Dumbledore's more damaging or egregious decisions/fuck-ups (keeping Harry in the dark about the Prophecy, not noticing Fake!Moody) but it perfectly serves as an example of the trend.
