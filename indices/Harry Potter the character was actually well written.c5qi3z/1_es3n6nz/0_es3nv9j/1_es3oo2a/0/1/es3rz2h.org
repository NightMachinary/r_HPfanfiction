I should've phrased that better. The stone, regardless of why it was there, was not going to be taken, which McGonagall knew. Or maybe, she trusted Dumbledore's prowess enough to trust it wouldn't have been stolen. Either way she should've explained that to Harry, but for plot reasons she didn't. I would also like to reiterate that older adults really don't explain things to kids.
