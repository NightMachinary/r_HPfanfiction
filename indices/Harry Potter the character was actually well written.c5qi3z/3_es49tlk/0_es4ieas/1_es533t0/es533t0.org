Honestly, when i first read the books i was just so confused by Harry because he seemed so uninterested in everything. He went from being abused and living in a cupboard below the stairs to living in a magical world where he could do literally anything he wanted just about, and all he seemed to want to do was get through life and just had no wonder about anything.

Hermione conversely made so much sense. She found out she had magic and absolutely dived right in and learned everything she could about it because holy fuck its cool. Reminded me of when everyone in my class discovered pokemon for the first time and we all dived in the deep end on that, or the kid who played like 700 hours of minecraft in a year because holy fuck its cool and interesting.

Harry just spent so much time complaining about homework and getting into petty fights that made very little sense to me for someone who should have been acting like a christian girl who just went off to college
