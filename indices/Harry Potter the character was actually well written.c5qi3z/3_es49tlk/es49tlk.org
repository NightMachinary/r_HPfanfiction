I disagree. It's the subject material that makes me wonder about Harry Potter. He has the ability to change the world at his fingertips, develop powers almost out of a comic, and does barely anything. It's his lack of wonder and imagination that get to me.

Fanon Harry who for some odd reason gets into adult relationships as a 12 year old or banter with McGonagall is just unrealistic to me. An 11 year old working hard to control the elements, to change the world with a flick of his wand, I find that a more realistic reaction.

Rowling definitely surpasses any fic writers in the wonder and prose category, but she really didn't understand the men very well, as well as putting cliches in teens.

Just because a person is a teenager, doesn't make them a hormonal know-it-all. It is more that they're prone to yell or get angry.
