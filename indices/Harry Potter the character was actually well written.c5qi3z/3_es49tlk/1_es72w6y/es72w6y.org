  It's his lack of wonder and imagination that get to me.

He /was/ in awe, for like a week. Some notable things still get to him (like the two schools' arrival in Goblet of Fire), but he gets jaded because A) we see that living in magical society just kind of lends itself to that kind of acclimation, like a kid from the boondocks showing up in the big city for the first time, B) everyone just fucking loves reminding Harry that his parents are dead and he's famous for something he had no real agency in, C) nearly everything new and unusual winds up biting him in the ass, and D) he knows that at some point in the near future he's going to have to write 14 inches on everything he's supposed to be in awe of.
