Writing children and teenager in character and write a good story at the same time is a huge struggle.

One I'm struggling with all the time I write ff. Especially HP stories, because our canon characters are that age.

I have a marauder ear story that follows Lily Evans growing up and my aim is to write her and everybody realistical for their age and situation (the ongoing war). I started to write the story because I lost a connection and even respect for her when I read the 7th book and when I realized that I wanted to reconnect with this character and why she acted as she did.

But I know it is not the most exciting story out there and more of an over long character piece.

But everybody has to figure out for themselves what they like to write and read. Idon't like children acting as babies or as mini-adules, it pulls me out of a story. Others don't have the patience for them to grow up
