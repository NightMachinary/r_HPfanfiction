I always hear people saying they hate OOTP because Harry was so insufferable and so ~angst~, but I never really understood the hate of his characterization because of those reasons ... I mean, he's 15 years old. I was an insufferable bitch at 15 years old. Most teenagers are. They think they're right about everything (like Harry becoming obsessive with Draco Malfoy being a Death Eater in HBP). Imo I think JKR wrote it very well.
