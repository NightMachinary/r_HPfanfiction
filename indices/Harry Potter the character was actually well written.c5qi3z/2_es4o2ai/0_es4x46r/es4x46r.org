I don't know about others, but the reason I hate the Harry in OOTP is because he really doesn't do much except whine all day... I mean, yeah, I understand he is a teenager and life's hardly fair no matter your age, but Harry wasn't in a normal situation. Voldemort just came back, he knew that Voldemort was trying to kill him (or putting that aside, that he has been in mortal danger at least 3 times a year), and that they shared a mental connection.

And yet, he never did anything to prepare for an inevitable confrontation unless he was told to. The DA? It was all Hermione' s idea. Granted he was apparently really good at teaching spells but that's it. And the occlumency lessons? While I believe Dumbledore made a mistake when he made Snape teach Harry, Harry never really tried to look for informations about it either.

And concerning Harry being obsessive about Malfoy being a DE? Well he was right, wasn't he? And the worst part was that no one believed him except for Dumbledore (because he already knew), and Dumbledore was perfectly happy with letting Draco murder half the school in an attempt to kill him so long as he could save Malfoy's soul...
