My problem with Harry doesn't really learn anything from his near death experiences. Its almost like his character is reset as soon as he enters the Dursleys house...

I can't imagine any child going through near death experiences every year and not come out more determined to never be placed in that situation again.

Sure he learned the Patronus Charm but that was because of the threat introduced in PoA. I'm not even sure he even bothered to ask how to defend against them before the second time he was attacked.

It irritates me that someone like that doesn't actively learn how to protect himself when he's never seen any adults actually help him until well after the situation had been resolved.
