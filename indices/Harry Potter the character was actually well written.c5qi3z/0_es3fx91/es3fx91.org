At the risk of all the downvotes that I will get from people who disagree with me on it, here is is my unpopular opinion:

​

If you go down that route then no 11 year old can do what Harry did at 11 and I'm sure no 12 year old can fight a snake, let alone a giant snake with a sword. No 11 year old is destined to fight the greatest terrorist, and certainly no school is allowed to run the way Professor Dumbledore ran his school.

​

I don't really understand this strange desire to dumb down kids and force them to be boring, uninteresting but realistic 11 year old kid. This is fiction. Anything strange can be chalked up to presence of magic. Personally, I don't even mind an 11 year old wizard or witch acting with maturity of a grown up person, because it's magical world with supernatural powers. Just say that magic enhances the growth of their minds just as magic strengthened their body.

​

In the books Harry is far from typical real life 11 yer old kid. And even if he was an 11 year old kid in canon, a fanfiction writer going through pain of writing his own story deserve to write the characters any way they want for their story. It's not like they are earning money from it, or forcing people to read their stuff.
