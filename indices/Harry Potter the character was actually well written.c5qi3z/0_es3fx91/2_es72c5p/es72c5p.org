  If you go down that route then no 11 year old can do what Harry did at 11 and I'm sure no 12 year old can fight a snake, let alone a giant snake with a sword.

12 year olds have been child soldiers before. In medieval times, a 12 year old would have been serving as a page and have a firm grounding in combat training, only two years away from graduating to becoming a squire.

Like, 10 years ago a 4 year old dressed as a Power Ranger attacked two robbers with a plastic sword who had been holding a gun to his older sister's head. Don't underestimate what a kid is willing or able to do.
