I totally agree with you. Not only Harry, but everyone of the Ministry Six is totally exceptional and outstanding. Their mental toughness rivals or even exceeds veteran Navy Seals and SAS operatives. A fraction of what they had gone through is enough to reduce average adults to PTSD basket cases and completely break average teenagers.

There's nothing average about Harry and his closest friends.
