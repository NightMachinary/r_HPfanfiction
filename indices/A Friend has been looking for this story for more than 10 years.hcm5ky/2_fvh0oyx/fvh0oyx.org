I tried searching for stories with connected trunks. It seems I've read four. There are the two stories by Radaslab called Not Normal and The New Normal. There's a story called Harem of Honeys by Rotary File. And Finally there's a story called AU_Harry Potter is The Guardian, Balance and Protector by jordan_easton94 (but this last story is a Harry/Fleur story and Hermione isn't in it).

I've provided links to all four though I'm leaning towards these stories "not being it".
