#+begin_quote
  Harry's destiny has taken a sharp turn from what was intended. At age seven, he figures out that he can make things happen at will, like magic. He uses this ability to counter his bullying cousin, Dudley, and form a gang of his own. Harry's gang is composed entirely of female members -- except of course for Harry himself. They band together to protect themselves from the Dursley gang, and form a life-long friendship that is almost like a family. When he received his Hogwarts letter, Harry James Potter is a strong, confident young man. A young man who takes his duty to protect his girls very seriously. Lucky for him, one of his girls has a cousin visiting at the time he receives his letter, and that cousin just happens to be a fifth year witch. This fic is taken over from szordara and his fic Harry Potter and the Harem of Honeys with his permission!

  His life was never normal, then it becomes truly abnormal. He must save a world he never cared for, but with others ... he can care. H/Hr and maybe others. Rated M to be safe.

#+begin_quote
  (Continuation of Not Normal) Harry's life has changed from what it once was and he must accept his new life so that he might prepare for the war that looms in the future to avoid a far worse war he knows would be the price of failure.
