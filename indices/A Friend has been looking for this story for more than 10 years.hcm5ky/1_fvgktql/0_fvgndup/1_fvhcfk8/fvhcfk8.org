Yeah, while it sounds like it could be smutty, OP doesn't say it's smutty which would have been helpful if it were. This leads me to believe it likely is just asking for a friend. Also, if it was smut I'd have guessed Radaslab as the author, based on my memory of them being one of the two writers who wrote a /The Harem War/.
