See that's the twist. My first thought was the story Not Normal by Radaslab as that was the one story I read that Harry had experimental doors installed that connected his trunk to other trunks that has this door installed. So Harry could go from his trunk to Hermione's trunk (in her bedroom). Which means that he could catch Hermione coming back from the bathroom but not end up in the bathroom.

Are you sure Harry's appearance is due to the trunks?

I know in the story Overlapping Dots by canoncansodoff Dobby transports Harry to where he can take a bath to listen to the egg. Problem is it's the 4th year gryffindor girls bathroom as Hermione enters for her bath.

There's another story (that I'm checking for) that has Harry apparating directly to Hermione without knowing where she lives. He catches her having just finished shower/bath. Besides catching her naked/or almost Hermione is more surprised that he could apparate to a person which is "impossible". Hopefully I can narrow down my search terms to find the right story.
