I'm confused. As far as I remember in the story Harry Crow, Harry doesn't have a customized trunk, didn't purchase multiple trunks, doesn't have any type of specialized door or portal. And finally I don't recall a scene with Harry walking in on Hermione. (If I remember correctly Hermione joins Harry in the shower after he fights in the pit, not the other way around).

Now without a doubt I could have missed something but how is Harry Crow the story the OP is looking for (though it would be great if I was wrong and it is the correct story)?
