One of the best-known Sirius/female OC fics is the "Interwoven" series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/197906/Katinka31][Katinka31]].

It is old, the majority of it was written before OOTP came out, so it is canon-compliant up to GOF but no further. As a result Sirius' backstory and the events in Harry's 5th year are different.

Personally I love Abigail Loomis, it is a fascinating and well-written OC. For this reason I don't mind that the story is no longer canon-compliant.
