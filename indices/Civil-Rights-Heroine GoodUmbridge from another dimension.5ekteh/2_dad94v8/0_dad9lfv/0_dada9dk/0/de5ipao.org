There's a very sympathetic "good Dementors" story, simply entitled "Dementors" ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1584458/1/Dementors]]), where they're /not/ under a curse but still redeemed. I myself have also started a "good Dementor" story, "The Innocent Dementor", about a Dementor who grows up in a deserted place and never learns to see humans as prey.
