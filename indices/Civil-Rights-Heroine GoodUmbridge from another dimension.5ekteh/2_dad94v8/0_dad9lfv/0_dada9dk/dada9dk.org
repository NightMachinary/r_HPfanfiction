You two might like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3853787/1/Soft-As-A-Dementor-s-Kiss][Soft As A Dementor's Kiss]]; it's a short story that's pretty sympathetic towards dementors, being from the point of view of one of them.

Mainly the dementors in said story are sympathetic because they're starving all the time, and eating happy memories only gives them a brief respite.

I also read a story once, but as a major plot point, the dementors used to be benign creatures who could feed on negative emotions, but Salazar Slytherin cursed them into the sadness-causing happy-eating monsters they are now.

So yeah, my OP went with the idea that dementors are evil monsters, or that they're horribly suffering undead that either way need to be destroyed, but if you want you could go with them just being desperately hungry, or under a curse.
