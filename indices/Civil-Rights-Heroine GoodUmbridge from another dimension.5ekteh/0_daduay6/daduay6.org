Well, can't say if and when I might continue this, but here's an introduction:

Double Dolores

In retrospect, it had been a bad idea, Dolores Umbridge had to admit. Not the goal of her excursion itself; Acromantulas were a sapient species, and while they had an unfortunate but not entirely undeserved reputation as man-eating monsters, that had been the same for giants, who had proven over the last two decades that they could be peaceful, contributing members of society, and with the help of Rubeus Hagrid she felt that she had managed to build up a relationship with Alagorn, the leader of the Acromantula lair in the Forbidden Forest, that could form the base of further improvements. Just as with the giants, Rubeus and she made a good team.

No, the bad idea had been to wander into the Forbidden Forest while a thunderstorm was building up. They had been caught by the storm at the worst moment, a good distance away from Hogwarts, but already within the range of their anti-apparition wards, and after they had already turned down the offer of hospitality by the nest. Due to the storm, she could barely see the half-giant in front of her, much less the path, and had to use an Amplifying Charm to be heard over the raging winds.

"... takin' a shortcut..." she heard Rubeus say, "... through the Old Circle ..."

They usually avoided the old menhir circle - it was part of the centaurs' territory - but Dolores had no intention to stay any second longer in this infernal storm than necessary. Already her boots were covered with mud, and her jeans soaking wet. She followed Rubeus through the clearing that, according to legend, had stood since before the Roman Invasion, no tree encroaching on it even long past the last of the druids had died.

The witch was almost out of the circle, the half-giant in front of her bending a low-hanging branch back so she would be able to pass easily, when lightning struck and she passed out in a blinding flash of light.

When she came to, she had trouble orienting herself. It had grown dark, but the storm had passed and the rain had stopped. "Rubeus?" she asked, slowly getting up - her whole body ached - but there was no sign of the half-giant. She bent down, to read the tracks, as he had taught her back when they had been looking for giant tribes in Siberia, but there were no tracks. Not of him, nor of her. The rain could have done this, but the ground was dry now, and Rubeus would not have let her lay on the ground for hours.

She gasped - someone must have ambushed them! Potion Poachers, intent on preserving their filthy blood-stained business? But why would they have let her, and taken Rubeus? Maybe there were some Death Eaters left? As a proud and prominent blood traitor and honourable mudblood, Dolores had been in danger during the insurrection, but that had ended more than twenty years ago!

It made no sense. She shook her head and started to run towards Hogwarts. She had to tell Albus.

She was out of breath long before she reached the castle, and had to slow down to a brisk walk. Too much time spent inside on politics, Rubeus would have said, and not enough out in the field. Nevertheless, she made it.

According to her watch, dinner would have started already, and Albus would be there. She didn't like to interrupt him, but this was an emergency!

The doors of the Great Hall opened before her, and she strode in. "Albus!" Dolores yelled. "have you seen Rubeus? We were struck by lighting in the Forbidden Forest! I fear..." She trailed off when she realised that not only were all students staring at her, but that Albus Dumbledore looked at her with open surprise and that the other teachers were staring, or gaping even, glancing from her to...

Dolores blinked. There was a witch looking just like her, down to the pretty pink robe she favoured when not in the field, sitting at the staff table, staring at her. What was going on?

And why was Minerva glaring at the Gryffindor table?
