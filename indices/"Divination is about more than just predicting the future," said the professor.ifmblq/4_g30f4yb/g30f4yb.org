Technically any magic that has something to do with information can be divination. So magic used to gather information is divination but magic that is used to change or hide the information is also divination.

So things like scrying, leglimency or seeing the pasts of objects/peoples/locations is also divination.

Fidelius, Oclumency and such are also divination.

Even the Taboo can be considered as divination since it is used to track down information.
