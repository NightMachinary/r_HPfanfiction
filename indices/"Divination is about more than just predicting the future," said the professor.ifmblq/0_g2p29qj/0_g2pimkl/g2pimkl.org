Yeah. This is more along the lines that I was thinking. There is typically a /lot/ more that can be considered divination than is attributed to the subject in canon. I think even the “Point Me” charm, especially as it's used in fanfics(“Point Me Harry Potter!”) could technically be considered divination.
