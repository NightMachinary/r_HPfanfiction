"Then why do we study fortunetelling so much?"

"Well, that's the flashy stuff, for one," said the Professor. "If I show you that I can divine the contents of a sealed box, you might say 'but you packed the box to begin with' even though I didn't. The other part is that Divination requires the seer to tune into the observations where hints can be given. It isn't a voice from the ether saying 'you left the keys in your waistcoat pocket', but it can guide you to where those keys are left, if you're paying attention to what isn't random when it should be."

"What I don't understand," chimed in a rather haughty, swotty, sort of witch found in nearly every first year Divination class, "is how anything /can/ be divined. Predicting the future assumes that it has already been determined, but even if that were so, certainly we can change it using magic."

The professor turned to inspect the witch, unusual eyeglasses reflecting a convenient sunbeam into her eyes. "Either it is or it isn't, is that your view? Well, let me assure you that magic can gather guidance from times beyond the present, but that doesn't mean it is immutable. The path of a river is predictable overall, even if predicting the path of a leaf floating in it is not. And yet, the leaf is unlikely to turn upstream, either.

"That said, you're missing the true importance and value of Divination, which is not to find out where things are going, but to determine where they are now, and where they have been."
