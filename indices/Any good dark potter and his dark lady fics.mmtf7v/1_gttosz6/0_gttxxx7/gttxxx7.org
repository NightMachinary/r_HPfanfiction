The one that starts with Harry Potter and the Homecoming by BolshevikMuppet99. It's worth reading if you're into Dark!Harry. The first two books are riddled with grammatical errors so if you're a pedant skip to the third, but the characters are decently written and the plot is well though-out. Warning for gore and some v v dark themes though.
