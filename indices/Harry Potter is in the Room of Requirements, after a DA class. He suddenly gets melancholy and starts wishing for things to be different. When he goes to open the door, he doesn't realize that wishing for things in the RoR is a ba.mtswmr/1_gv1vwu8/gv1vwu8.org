This gives so much possibilities. Maybe Harry must mask himself if he travels back in time, because he is still in school or started it recently in this time. Or he travels ti the Marauders and is stuck in the 70s. Or he travels back, changes things, goes into the RoR again and lands in an AU. Maybe his parents are alive, but Voldemort was always alive too and it is up to Harry now. I could start smth, but I dont know which is the best, it gives so much possibilities
