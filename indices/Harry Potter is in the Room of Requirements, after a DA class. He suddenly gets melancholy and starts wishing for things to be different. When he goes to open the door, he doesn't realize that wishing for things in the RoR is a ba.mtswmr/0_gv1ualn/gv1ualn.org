Not entirely in-line with the prompt, but I'm pretty surprised that, with all the fanfiction out there, nobody ever did some sort of lemon or lime fic where Harry wishes for something a hormonal teenage boy would likely wish for, or where he wishes girls would be interested in him for who he was as a person, as a response to the things Cho or Vane did.

There's pretty much infinite potential for abuse there, but I don't think I've ever seen one person do it. Though I hardly claim to have read everything there is. For a room that can give you nearly anything you ask for, nobody ever seems to want much beyond practice dummies and libraries with fireplaces.

Then again, one could just as easily make the argument that there's a million different entertaining uses of the /engorgio/ charm alone, and it's silly to presume people are just frenching each other in the broom closets.
