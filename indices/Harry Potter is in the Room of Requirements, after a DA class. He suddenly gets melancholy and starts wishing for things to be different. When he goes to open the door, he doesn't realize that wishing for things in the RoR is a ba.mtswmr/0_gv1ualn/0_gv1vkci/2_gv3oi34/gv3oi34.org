The idea I had a long time ago is that Harry decided to 'misuse' the room a bit to spend intimate time with some of his friends who are witches, so he sneaks down there at night when everyone has gone to bed to have a bit of fun. The room gives him the scenarios he asks for: snogging Hermione in the library one stack away from a big crowd of people studying, him and Ginny undressing each other while on broomsticks, sharing a shower with Katie, Angelina, and Alicia after a Quidditch match, ect.

But (in my head), the limitation of the room is that it can't make people or accurate fakes of people. If you asked the room to give you, say, Lord Voldemort, the best you'd get is a statue, or some kind of highly realistic doll or immobile replica. So what happens is, the scenarios Harry conjures up to entertain himself translate into wet dreams of the witches he's imagining himself with. They dream the scenarios he creates. Or to put it another way, the room can't fake people, so it just inserts Harry into their minds while they're asleep, and manipulates their dreams to match the request that's been put to the room. So unknown to him, Harry is giving all the witches he's fantasizing about these dreams, that they remember when they wake up. You don't remember most of your dreams, and if you do, the details are always faded, but what the room is doing isn't really a dream, it's inserting a made-up situation created by magic (and containing Harry) into the same spot a dream would go, so you remember everything about it. It just feels like a really vivid dream.

I tentatively named the story Incubus, since an incubus is a male sex demon that comes to women while they sleep in their dreams, but I never wrote much of it, because I'm horrible at lemons.

What does surprise me, though, is that nobody really seems to have done this idea before or anything like it. There's so many things you could do with the room, but nobody ever uses it for anything interesting. Could you use it to fake people you know? Could you use it to have sex? What happens if you pace in front of the door and ask it "I need to have sex with So-And-So?" Can it produce alcohol? Or other forms of contraband? Can it provide a doorway to another location outside of the castle? Could a male student use it to circumvent the alarmed stairs on all the girl's dorms in the castle?
