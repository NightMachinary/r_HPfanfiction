So I just checked. Actually it totally could. Gamp's law says you can't make food out of nothing, because of something to do with nutrition, it isn't explained in direct detail. The elaboration we get is that you can't just make "good food" out of nothing.

However, you can:

- Summon food if you know where it is (obviously).
- Multiply food to stretch it out more or less indefinitely if you have at least a small starting amount of it (Doubling Charm, also possibly other similar spells).
- Engorgio works on food to make more/bigger food, and that's real food, not fake or empty food mass.

And in addition, things that are not very nutritious literally can just be outright created successfully: the examples given are sauces, potable water, and */wine/*. So it would seem as though alcohol is in fact an exception to Gamp's laws, which means even though the room cannot produce "good/nutritious food" out of nothing, it could easily make alcoholic beverages, because apparently whatever technical limitation applies to stop healthy food from being conjurable doesn't apply if you don't care about the nutrition.

Though this also raises a further question of, does that mean you could conjure chocolate and junk food that wouldn't make you fat, because it has no nutrition? Possibly. Another thing teenagers trying to abuse the room might care a great deal about.
