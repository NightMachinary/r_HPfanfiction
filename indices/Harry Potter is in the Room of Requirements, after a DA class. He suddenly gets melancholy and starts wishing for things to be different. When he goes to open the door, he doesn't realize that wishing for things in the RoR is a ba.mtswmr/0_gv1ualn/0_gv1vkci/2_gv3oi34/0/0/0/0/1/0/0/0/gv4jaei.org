Not to be rude, but it doesn't really matter if you "think" life can't be created. It can be, and they do it constantly. What you want to believe was debunked in second year, Harry was able to talk to the snake that Malfoy created from nothing at the dueling club. If what /Serpentsortia/ conjures wasn't a real snake, just some 'thing' that looked very much like a snake, that wouldn't be possible.

A cup that's turned into a falcon becomes a real falcon. When you say "I think there's some abstract thing that makes it not a real falcon," that's fanon. You're just making that up.

It's magic. You're trying to apply some sort of science fiction rule, like clones don't ever come out quite right, we can't just make people, to fantasy. This isn't science fiction. It is magic.
