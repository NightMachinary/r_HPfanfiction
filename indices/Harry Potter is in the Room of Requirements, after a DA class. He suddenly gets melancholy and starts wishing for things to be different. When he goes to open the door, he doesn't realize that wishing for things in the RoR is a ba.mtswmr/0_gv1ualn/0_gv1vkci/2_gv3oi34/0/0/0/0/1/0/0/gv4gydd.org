Well we're indirectly hinted at the fact that you cannot magically create love, only lust, so it was always my assumption that it's another exception. Also I don't think you can create life. Sure a desk turned into a pig might behave like a pig, but it's not an actual pig. Same with Avis and Serpentsortia... they are just embodiments of magic that behave like the said animals but are not real animals. Also if that were possible, there would be no need for Grindelwald or Voldemort to recruit actual people for their armies if they could just conjure them. Which leads me to my fourth assumption. You cannot create agency. Any wizard who gets good at casting the Imperius curse could build an army. Or in fact is not stopping Veela from building an army by enslaving people with their allure. Voldemort also can animate dead bodies to do his biddings. But I think that once they are under a mind controlling spell, people can't really do anything else other than what they're ordered... same with Inferi who are used for very basic tasks as dragging you under the water in the cave. If you want to effectively conquer the world you still need people to be able to make decisions and think for themselves and that's why Voldemort or Grindelwald still need actual willing supporters as opposed to an army of slaves. I have no assumption on what the fifth exception might be.
