That's another exception to Gamp's law. It's mentioned that you can "transform" food, and transformation is the subset of transfiguration that involves altering the physical features of a substance, such as turning falcons into cups or pincushions into porcupines. So in there's no reason you couldn't transfigure a rock or a desk into a chicken and then cook and eat the chicken. That does in fact work, it is explicitly stated it does.

What we aren't sure about is conjurations. We know from spells like /Serpentsortia/ that you can conjure animals out of nothing. Could you kill and cook the birds produced by /Avis/? It's not explained. Maybe. Maybe not. Only one of Gamp's Laws was explained to us, and without all five, we don't know exactly what can and cannot be done.

One thing that's interesting is that there are international laws restricting and regulating what wizards are allowed to conjure. Which implies there are things you can conjure that wizarding society at large does not want you to. We don't know anything about that either, but we can make some educated guesses. It seems very possible to conjure or transfigure precious metals, like gold and silver, because we've seen Dumbledore and Voldemort do it. I would imagine doing so is a restricted practice to avoid destabilizing national and global economies. Wizarding communities might also refuse to use raw gold or silver as a currency for that reason, because they know it can, in fact, just be made. Thus the necessity for minted coins that cannot be duplicated. That's also a likely reason for why the goblins are always checking and double checking things like gemstones on their counters: I'd imagine crystal gems would be something else you could conjure or transfigure, so the goblins would logically be looking for counterfeits.

I'll say this. Transfiguration seems to be absurdly overpowered. Someone who has mastered transfiguration can just about do whatever they like, as long as they remembered to pack a ham sandwich in their pocket before they started.
