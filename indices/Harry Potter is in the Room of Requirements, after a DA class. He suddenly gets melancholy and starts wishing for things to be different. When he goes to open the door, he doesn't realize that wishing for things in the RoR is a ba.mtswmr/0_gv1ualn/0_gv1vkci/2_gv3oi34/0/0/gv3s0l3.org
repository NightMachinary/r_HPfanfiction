I would also assume it could, because I can't imagine a reason it could not. The room could open passageways all throughout the castle, to any location that was necessary for a door to exist, so I can't think of a reason why it could not be used to bypass security measures in the castle. The room might even be able to open a way to the Chamber of Secrets, and the fact the last book had Ron bullshitting parseltongue to get into the chamber instead of getting in via asking the room for a way into the Chamber of Secrets is just one more reason I don't believe Rowling really thought a lot of her plot points through. One of those things is a lot more reasonable a possibility than the other.

Mostly, I'm just thinking of ways that a teenage boy might be tempted to use the room's power to fulfill private fantasies or desires. How many of those could the room do? Could it be used to smuggle alcohol into the castle, or produce alcohol? Smuggle, probably yes, produce, maybe, I don't know if they ever tested whether or not it can flaunt Gamp's Laws. Can you use it to sneak into any of the girl's dorms in the school? I'd say yes, you could. If you asked the room to help you have sex with somebody, what would the room do or create? Can you use the room to fulfill fantasies?
