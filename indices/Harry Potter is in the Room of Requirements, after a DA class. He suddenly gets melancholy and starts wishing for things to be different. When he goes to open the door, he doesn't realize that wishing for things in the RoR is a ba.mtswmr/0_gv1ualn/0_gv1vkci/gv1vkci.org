As Harry got out of the Room of Requirements, he was startled by a sweet girly voice, "Oh Mr. Potter."

"Professor Umbridge, I-" he tried to explain, but she cut him off in a sing-song tone, "I'll see you tonight in my office for your detention."

For a brief moment Harry could have sworn he saw Professor Umbridge wink towards him but before he realized what just happened she had already walked past him.

"Oh, I guess some things never change," said Harry to himself.
