Harry sighed as the DA filtered out of the Room of Requirement, fiddling with the odd bone he found in the corner of the room. As much progress as everyone was making in their little illicit impromptu study group, he worried it wouldn't be enough. Between OWLs and the newly resurrected Dark Lord on the loose, they just didn't have the /time/ to truly prepare for what the world was going to throw at them.

/Voldemort has decades on me/ he thought to himself. /I wish I had more time/ -- and then he heard it.

/Then time you shall have, o Wizard mine./

He jumped in shock, and spun around.

“Who's there?” he said -- he had been certain the Room was empty. And then the words caught up with him.

“What do you mean, ‘time I shall have'?”

But he heard no more whispers, and when he checked the Marauder's Map, the Room was as empty as he had thought it would be. Spooked, he threw on his invisibility cloak and opened the door to leave when, quite unexpectedly, he bumped into someone. Someone who shouldn't have been there, since the hallway was empty on the map just a moment ago.

Someone who was wearing flamboyant purple robes that wouldn't look out of place on Albus Dumbledore. Someone who had the same face, the same kind eyes as Albus Dumbledore, but with half a century fewer wrinkles.

“Oh, bollocks,” Harry swore.

Harry got his Ahamkara wish, and now the Room of Requirement has opened up in 1943, where he is the same age as a young Tom Riddle. Plenty of time for him to train up to match him, if he just puts in the work. If only he would stop hearing whispers in the back of his mind, claiming to be his /Salvation./
