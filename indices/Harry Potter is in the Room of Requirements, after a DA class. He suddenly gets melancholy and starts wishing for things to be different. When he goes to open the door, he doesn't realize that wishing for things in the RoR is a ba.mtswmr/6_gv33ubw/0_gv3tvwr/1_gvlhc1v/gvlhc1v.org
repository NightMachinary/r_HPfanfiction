Nice. I thought you were going to have the room trap Harry with all the books and training he could want until he was also 60, only to let him out and have no time passed outside. Alternatively, it could accelerate him so that the outside world seems to be frozen and he has time to do whatever he wants except interact with people. Both have interesting implications. Yet another alternatively, harry lives out the next 40 years and gets all the training and whatever he needs - works through all his emotional issues and everything - only to find he never left the RoR and it's all been in his head. Sort of a variation on the first idea.
