It is true most teenagers were dissatisfied with life. Mature enough to desire more freedom but not enough to be responsible adults they were stuck between trying to find themselves and obeying their parents and teachers. This was especially true of one Harry Potter who was currently moping around the Room of Requirement on a cold January evening of 1996. In a little over a year, he had been attacked by a dragon, grindylows, merpeople, skrewts, acromantula, dementors and to top it all off- Voldemort himself. As if that wasn't enough, he still felt responsible for Cedric's death, his friends had abandoned him over the summer and the press had slandered his name.

He had longed for the... normalcy of Hogwarts. As if a magic castle full of teenagers could ever be considered normal! And now not one, but two teachers were torturing him. Umbridge he could deal with, but Snape rifling through his memories was too much. In short, Harry was tired in a way that no sleep or rest could cure. He was tired of Angelina yelling at him during Quidditch practice, of Hermione forcing him to teach undisciplined children, of Dumbledore ignoring him.

But most of all he was tired of being so alone. Hermione always pushed him to do better at school with no thought of his feelings. And as much as he liked Ron the boy was not exactly emotionally mature. Sirius was next to useless as he was still a wanted criminal and in hiding. Remus and Hagrid had been on separate Order missions on the continent for months and neither had the time for him. Harry could turn neither to his friends nor to the adults for help.

Oh, how he wished he had one person on his side. Just one person to listen to him and support him instead of push him harder to see if he breaks. As he thought that he felt, more than heard a deep rumble and the torches' flames flickered. He barely had time to wonder if Hogwarts was protected against earthquakes and the rumbling had stopped. He was too tired to care at this point so he simply left for Gryffindor tower. It was already after curfew and the last thing he needed was more detentions.

The Gryffindor common room was empty by this time save for a lonely figure sitting close to the hearth. Paying little attention to someone studying late Harry made for the staircase to the boys' dormitories. The noise he made woke the girl which immediately turned her attention on him.

“Oh, Harry you're finally back. I must have fallen asleep waiting for you.” She seemed happy to see him for some reason. As she came closer, he saw her long red hair, blue eyes and slightly upturned nose. Her gentle features morphed from happiness to concern as she in turn inspected him. “You look terrible, sweetie. Has something happened?” She hugged him and Harry briefly froze before pulling away. He had no idea why this girl was talking to him as if they had known each other for years.

“Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?” he asked. The girl laughed merrily before replying.

“Oh, what's this?” she teased him “The great Harry Potter is embarrassed by his sister? There's no one around, silly. It's just us.” Her reply shocked him so much that for the first time in years Harry was left speechless. This caused the girl to worry even more as she dragged him to a sofa and made him sit.

“Merlin, you really don't recognize me, do you? It's me- Anna” she still hadn't let go of his hand. His empty gaze caused her worry to grow to fear “Did you hit your head on something? Were you hit by a spell? I'm taking you to madam Pomfrey” her determination finally got Harry out of his stupor. He could not let the nurse see his arm. She seemed to recognize the look on his face before he spoke. She sighed.

“Still scared of mediwitches, huh? Fine, at least let me look you over” As she drew her wand and pointed it at his face his Quidditch reflexes kicked in and he grabbed her hand. He didn't need strange girls pointing their wands at his face.

“You really are jumpy tonight.” There was no reproach in her tone “It's okay, sweetie, it's just me. Look at me, Harry” She placed the fingers of her other hand under his chin and gently lifted. “I'm not going to hurt you, Harry. I just want to cast a diagnostic charm on you.” Something in her eyes finally made him relent and he released her hand.

“Hmm, strange. You seem to be doing okay. Exhausted and a bit anemic, but no spell or curse damage.” Her brow furrowed as she pondered his state. “Please say something, you're really worrying me.”

“I don't have a sister” his voice was hoarse from disuse and shock.

“Well, that's a bit harsh, don't you think? I'm sitting right here. I'd get offended if you didn't look like the Hogwarts express had just run you over.” His revelation only caused her to hold his hand in both of hers.

“I'm sorry, but I don't know you. I don't have a sister.” He repeated again. “My parents are dead.”

“I know our parents are dead, silly. I'm two years older than you. Please tell me this is some sort of an elaborate prank so I can yell at you in peace.” Harry still remained silent. He knew he had no siblings and yet somewhere deep inside he felt he could trust the young woman in front of him. “Right, I want you to tell me everything that you did after your last class today” Harry wanted to get to the bottom of this so he obliged her.

“Well, I did my homework, then I went to dinner. After that, we had a DA meeting but we only practiced different types of shields. After the meeting I came here” he answered.

She contemplated this for a few seconds. “No, you didn't. I saw Ron and Hermione over an hour ago. They said you were still in the Room of Requirement.”

“Well, I was, but I didn't do anything. I just sat staring in the fire.” He replied. Now Anna was sure she was on the right track.

“Think, Harry. What exactly did you do there besides staring into the fire?” She wasn't giving up on this so he replied.

“I just... I just wished I wasn't so alone” He was looking at his knees now, his voice faltering. “That I had one person on my side”

Again, she seemed to recognize his mood. “You have me, sweetie. You always have” Gently, she cupped his face with her hands. He hesitated at first but finally gave way to the feeling deep inside him. Then she put his head on her lap. He could trust her.

“Shh, it's okay, Harry. We'll figure this out tomorrow. Rest now” As she stroked his hair his tears flowed freely. Perhaps he finally did have someone completely on his side. Even if he had probably broken several laws of magic to get there. He was too tired to think about magical impossibilities and soon fell asleep.

The End.

AU: Okay, so I thought about bringing Lilly back, but decided against it. It would open a lot of problems starting with resurrection and not to mention projecting mommy issues. I also didn't want the sister to be a copy of Lily so I gave Anna blue eyes. (Brown are too common and boring.) Harry is still the Boy-Who-Lived. The Room of Requirement either brought Harry to a parallel universe or brought Anna to Harry's. Or somehow warped time so James and Lily were older and had two children (The Room almost drained itself of magic in the process.) I think I like the second version better so Anna has memories of their parents who were alive in her universe. This gives us all sorts of options like her being off age and becoming Harry's guardian and protecting him from the other adults and so on and so on. But she knows their parents are dead, so never mind. Maybe in another version. But this is getting way too long for a reddit prompt, so I'll just stop here.

Edit: Thanks for the awards.
