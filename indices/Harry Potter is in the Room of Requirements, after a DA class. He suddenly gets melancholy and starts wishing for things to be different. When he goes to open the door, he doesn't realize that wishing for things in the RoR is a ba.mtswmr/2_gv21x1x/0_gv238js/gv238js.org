Another that comes to my mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486108/1/][From the Flame to the Spark]] where Ginny pulls it by accident after Harry died. Also the Diadem makes the Room explode as she arrives, and then the magic of the Room goes rogue giving a random OC muggleborn superpowers which culminates when his letter arrives, he freaks out over the Trace attaching to him (cause he could feel it), and the chase sequence ends with him wishing for Raven from the Teen Titans to come to his rescue... and the magic leaves him to do just that.

Too bad it was never finished...
