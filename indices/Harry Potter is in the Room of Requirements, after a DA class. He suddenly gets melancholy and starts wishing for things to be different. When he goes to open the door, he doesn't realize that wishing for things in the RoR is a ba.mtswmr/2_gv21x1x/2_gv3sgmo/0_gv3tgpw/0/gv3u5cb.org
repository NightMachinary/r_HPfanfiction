Ron bashing I don't mind. Never could stand that fickle fair-weather friend. And Hermione... is definitely more abrasive than fanfiction or the movie series made her.

But the isn't finished is part of why I never started it. I don't mind following active stories, but ones that've been around for years and haven't made much progress just seem like time wasters since there will never be a payoff.

I'm just curious if there were any interesting ideas in this one. The basic premise was interesting enough for me to put it on my follow list in case it ever got finished, but I don't think I've touched it since then. Sounds like it wasn't all that memorable, though.
