This could also be post DH and EWE, with Harry being a professor. Change some background that people were more affected by the war with many unable to continue to live normally.

This could mean that many became traumatized and just retreated into themselves, or to make it more morbid and cliche, have someone suicide or how they could not return to normalcy after two years of being in a battle state. Maybe with Hermione throwing herself into recovery and restructuring of the ministry and Ron becoming a hit wizard.
