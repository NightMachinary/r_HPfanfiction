  *...And one he wished he did have.*

  He misses Fred every day. They all do, but losing a brother is something that he never realises can hurt so much. Brothers are special. And now he has one less. Fred was his brother...and now he's gone. That was one wish gone wrong.

  Ron Weasley always wishes Fred was there because then... he'd have five brothers again.

  Fortunately, Percy finally broke down one day and ate the cake (after Bellatrix and Lucius tied him to a chair and force-fed him). After that, his fiery little fox's defenses slowly came down. He no longer ran in fear or tried to hex Voldemort when he showed up. Instead, he simply acted resigned to his fate. That was progress! Voldemort was quite pleased.
