Kudos for deciding to write fanfiction! I would say the first idea has more potential for you to put your own spin on. There are many fics of Harry joining the Avengers, but less Star Wars crossovers. Also you seemed to have planned out the first one more and I think you should go with the one you've thought about and written out the most. The first idea seems much more original and there's a lot of different avenues you can go down in terms of plot line. If you need a beta to bounce ideas off of feel free to PM me or check out the list of available betas on ffn [[https://www.fanfiction.net/betareaders/][here]]

Hope this helps!
