Agree with above, you have worked out more of the story with the first idea. The second feels like you just threw an idea together quick with no thought.

I would suggest you take the time to make the star wars timeline clear so you can choose an accurate time for the prophecy to take place. The way you described it made me feel like thousands of years passed since they saw him and decided to fight like him and the prophecy would start. You will need to come up with backstory for Harry for what he does for all the time that passes if it is that long.
