I'm afraid it would make a very quick story if we go with Canon. Death Eater write the names of his enemies (Dumbledore, Harry Potter, that damn Burke that sold him a piece of crap for 50 Galleons . . .), the good guys die and Voldemort win.

Now, if it's some kind of AU where every witches and wizards have a "true name" that they only reveal to their closest relation, then the good guys have at least a chance. Though there would still be the problem of the Muggleborns, can they chose their "true name" when they join the Magical World, is their official name their "true name" and they have to create a new usual name when they join the Magical world, or are they just "weaker" than the others in this AU? So many questions.

Anyways, I'm also curious about Voldemort. Would the Death Note work against Horcruxe or would Voldemort just spend some time as a wraith until he could (once again) gain a body? Also, could an instruction like "/destroy his Horcruxes and then kill himself/" really make Voldemort destroy his own Horcruxes? And if it is the case, would "/kill himself at said date/" be enough for him to automatically destroy his Horcruxes?
