How much of the death note universe is here? Cuz if it's just the book, Harry Potter, Dumbledore, and Moody die instantly. Probably more. It's just an instant win condition. If it's the shinigami and stuff too, then wizards might have some defense/historical records and experiences with death notes and be able to defend themselves.
