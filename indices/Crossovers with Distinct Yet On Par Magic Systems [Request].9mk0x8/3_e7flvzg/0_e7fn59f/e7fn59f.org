I was really referring to the typical definition and use of the word "sorcery" in real life not in modern fiction stories and such. The typical definitions that have ancient historical roots are:

#+begin_quote
  the use of power gained from the assistance or control of evil spirits especially for divining

  a type of magic in which spirits, especially evil ones, are used to make things happen
#+end_quote

It's usually in a bargain sort of way (hence "deal with the devil"). For example, Pope Sylvester II was disparaged as being a sorcerer by some aristocrats who claimed he was a sorcerer due to making a deal with a demon named "Meridiana" to use magic. That's why you get things like Dr. Strange (the "Sorcerer Supreme") calling out the names of the deities whose magic he is using ("By the Ruby Rings of Ragadoor!")
