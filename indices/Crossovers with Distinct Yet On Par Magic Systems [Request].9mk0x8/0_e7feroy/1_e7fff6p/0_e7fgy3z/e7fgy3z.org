It's because milo's rules apply to milo and his stuff and rawlingsverse rules apply to wizards and their stuff. Since the killing curse kills, that's pretty obviously an instant death effect. Turns out those are pretty straight forward to defend against in milo's universe - 4th level Death Ward spell does it. Undead are naturally immune. Sure, the killing curse explodes objects, but skeletons aren't objects (well, skeleton /creatures/ are not objects!).

Milo's universe pretty much no-sells all of the unforgivables. Pain is flavor text, it has no mechanical effect, so it has no effect on Milo. The imperious can be defended against through the first level spell family Protection from <alignment> (doesn't even matter what alignment!), and the Killing Curse is blocked by the 4th level spell.
