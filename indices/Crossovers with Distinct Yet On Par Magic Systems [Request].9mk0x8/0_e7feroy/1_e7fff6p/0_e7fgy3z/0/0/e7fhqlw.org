The other system is not obviously better. Milo is limited to spell slots (with some munchkining) and requires a level up to get better -- and has a finite number of them. Plus, under most circumstances, he's limited to 6-second rounds and can only cast one spell per round.

HP Wizards, on the other hand, can cast as fast as they can speak (and even faster, for silent casters), they don't have to wait and move in 6-second increments, and can learn new and better spells and other skills without having to level up.

They both have advantages and disadvantages. Milo's primary advantage is "Out of context problem." It takes a surprisingly long time before anyone but the other kids even understand that he's /not/ an HP Wizard, with everything that implies.
