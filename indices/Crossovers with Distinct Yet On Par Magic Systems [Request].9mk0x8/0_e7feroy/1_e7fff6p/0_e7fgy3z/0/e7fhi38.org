That's sounding like the thing I didn't want though (nixing the benefits of one magic system by making some other system obviously better). But at least in HP canon, Avada kills anything alive (besides a phoenix) and anything else it hits is irreparably damaged. However, I'll still give it a try in hopes that it's only limited to the Unforgivables, as to be fair those are pretty unfair spells.
