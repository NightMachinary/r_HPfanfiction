linkffn(8096183) is a good fic and both types of magic have their strengths. HP wizards can cast as fast as they speak and don't run out of spells, but Milo's DnD magic can do things theirs can't (casually shattering wands, detailed illusions, flight, summoning monsters, including killing curse proof undead) and he's far more durable than anyone from the HP world
