Yeah its a bit of a tricky distinction, a mix of sorcerer and wizard would fit the HP universe I guess.

In the fic I linked at least, the vast majority of the magic users in the universe would be standard HP 'wizards' where as the main character (Harry) is born a wizard, as in canon, and becomes somewhat of a warlock later.
