A bit of clarification from [[/u/baniel105][u/baniel105]]'s post

D&D has Sorcerers, Warlocks and Wizards.

A lot of more modern fantasy tropes stem from D&d

As far as D&d lore:

- A wizard is someone who studies arcane books and delves through dusty tomes to /learn/ their magic.

- A sorcerer is someone who is innately possesses their powers, they are /born/ with it and become stronger by honing their existing prowess.

- A warlock is someone who accepts a deal with a magical being referred to as a patron. They /bargain/ for their powers.

As far as your original question; perhaps something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]] would interest you. It's a crossover with The Dresden Files, which is a series of fantasy novels focusing on a noir-esque wizard who works as a private investigator, and has elements of all 3 of the archetypes of Wizard Warlock Sorcerer contained in the lore. The Denarian Renegade is regarded as a decent fic overall I believe and you don't require a knowledge of the dresden files to enjoy it.
