Well, /Nightmares of Future Past/ is a Peggy Sue fic, where Harry goes back in time to save everyone. It has its share of badass scenes.

In one scene, Ron stabs a /Dementor/ to death with the Sword of Gryffindor and then he steps forward and shouts "Come and have a go, if you think you're hard enough," to a crowd of dementors.

Ron's only thirteen when it happens.
