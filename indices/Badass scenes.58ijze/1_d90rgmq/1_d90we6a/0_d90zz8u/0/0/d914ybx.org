From memory (keep in mind it's been quite a long time since I checked it out) there's less action than the first novel since it happens during the summer, but the amount of character evolution is nuts.\\
He really delves even deeper into relationships of the characters and it's really well written that you don't feel lack it drags out.

You feel like Harry and Draco are 16 - 17, which I really found refreshing because there's so much stories where they just gives a 15 year old Harry the mental acuity and maturity of a 30 year old man just because they can't actually put themselves in a still rather immature boy.
