I hail from the drarry fandom so this is something I've encountered a lot. It's one of the more annoying fanon headcanons, tbh. I have come across a few fics where it was done well but for the most part fics featuring sex god!Draco tend to be pretty bad.

As for the "why"...it's because 1) Tom Felton and 2) Top!Draco shippers.
