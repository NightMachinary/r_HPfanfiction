No, it's not about Tom Felton, or at least it didn't used to be.

It's a well established trope that has its roots in the dawn of the Harry Potter fandom. Cassandra Claire (yes, the same person who published the Mortal Instruments series), started writing the very influential series called the "Draco Trilogy" which essentially whitewashed Draco's character, in particular writing a scene where [Draco is in Leather Pants]([[http://www.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][www.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants]]) and looking good in them. One must also not forget that Cassie and her Draco-loving clique were the "Big Name Fans" back in the day (we're talking 2000-2003 here) and thus they had the monopoly on which interpretation of his character was favoured, since fandom at that time was /very/ insular.

[[https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/ParadigmOfUncertainty/conversations/topics/2598][One fan even commented this]]: "Perhaps it is just due to the fact that we have /so many/ terrific, well-written, and thoroughly believable examples of fanfic here, but I'm beginning to get a little worried. I'm starting to worry that by the time JKR releases #5, we here in fanfic-land will have trouble distinguishing between JKR's Harry, Hermione, Ginny, et al. and Lori's/Cassie's. Especially difficult will be the readers' ability to see JKR's Draco the way JKR's Harry, Hermione and Ron see him - indisputably evil. We have already experienced Draco's transformation/redemption - will we be able to turn a blind eye to that? Or will we simply smirk knowingly?"

Since then, the Draco in Leather Pants trope has spawned thousands and thousands of fics and led to a massive fanon re-interpretation of his character. Though the attractiveness of Tom Felton is definitely playing a yuuuge role, it is not the original reason.
