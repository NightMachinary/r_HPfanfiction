He belongs to the House of the sly and the amoral, is rich, well-connected (via his father), confident (usually unjustifiedly), comes from what can be interpreted (if you squint) as Wizarding aristocracy and has the (in)appropriate attitude, is played by a handsome actor, and has a general disposition of petty malice (which, if you squint, could be interpreted as power and dangerousness).

In other words, he is the closest thing HPverse has to the male protagonist from the /Twilight///50 Shades/ school of romance. As a result, he gets shoehorned into that role, with all the things that make him kind of pathetic in canon swept under the proverbial rug.
