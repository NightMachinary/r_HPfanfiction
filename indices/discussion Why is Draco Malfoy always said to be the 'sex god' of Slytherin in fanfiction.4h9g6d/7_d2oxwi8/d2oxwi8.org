While the fantastically short, funny answers of "Tom Felton" explain a lot, I think that there is another thing worth considering, a trope that I encounter a lot because my day job is writing, mostly writing romance. Anyway, that trope is:

*The bad boy.*

With every fandom, again and again, people wonder why certain pairings are popular. Especially, they wonder why asshole characters are so popular. In real life, these would be the guys you run away from not towards. So why?

There's more than one answer.

- Women don't get much opportunity in fiction to play the rescuing white knight, so saving someone from himself is as close as they often get. It's a way to be the hero but without a "super" needing to be attached. And an emotional rescue can be committed by anyone, so the female hero can be anyone.

- A lot of these stories involve the bad boy becoming, well, less bad. There is something magnificently appealing about the idea that love can redeem, and, more than that, that it can change a person. Or rather, that he changes himself. The jerk, the bully, the criminal, isn't cured by love but it is a catalyst for his betterment. This is wish-fulfillment at its finest. How often have you wished you could help someone when you see them heading down a dark path?

- Then you have the exact opposite of that, the good girl dragged down by the bad boy. This is a bit more complex in a psychological way, but the short version is that fiction is a safe place to play with darker themes. The reader is in control and can close the book or click out of the story at any time. It's dangerous, but it isn't /real/. (And with this type of story there tends to be a lot of BDSM-y undertones, especially ones that sub-oriented women readers might find appealing.)

As for why Draco Malfoy in particular is so popular, I believe there might also be another factor at work. JKR likes to talk a lot about how all the houses have their good points, but Slytherin consistently gets the short end of the stick in canon. There's good reason for that. The series is almost entirely seen from Harry's perspective, so we don't really get to Slytherin characters be ... you know, anything but generally shitty, petty, terrible people (who are often uglier than everyone else purely by coincidence).

Fanfiction likes to rectify that by showing them as less shitty. It's part of the reason Daphne Greengrass is so popular. In canon, she's a faceless cipher mentioned a grand total of maybe once, but in fanfiction she is a fleshed-out character and an exploration of what Slytherin characters are never shown to be in the books.

Well, except for Slughorn. But no one wants +their Hermione OC+ to bang him because he's old and fat and therefore worthless. Sort of like Peter Pettigrew. No one wants to write redemptive Pettigrew fics. Poor guy. He's so creepy and useless that not even fanfiction can whitewash him hot.
