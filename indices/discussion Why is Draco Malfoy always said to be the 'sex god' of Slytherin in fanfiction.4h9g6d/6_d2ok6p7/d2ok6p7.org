Yea its got to be based on the type of fics you read. In all the fics I have read hes described as exactly the opposite of a "sex god".

As others have said, hes not implied as one in the books, but between the actor playing Draco, and the idea that his family is a powerful player in the pureblood world, I think for certain type of Fan fics people paint him in that light. Plus there are a ton of Dramione fans out there (i personally dont get that pairing).
