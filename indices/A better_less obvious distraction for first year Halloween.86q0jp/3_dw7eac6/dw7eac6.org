during a quidditch match

enchant the giant squid so that air temporarily works like water for it

also enchant it to know that voldemort is a danger to the students and that voldemort is in the castle

for purposes of the story lets just assume that it has animal level intelligence and tries to get into the castle to attack voldemort

from a spectator perspective this would look like the squid is attacking the castle.
