My question has always been why distract at all? Creating a diversion just supplies a chance for others to realize something suspicious is happening around them. He should just go in the middle of the night on a night when Dumbledore isn't in the castle, no muss no fuss. His master could attempt to grab the stone and if his master doesn't need to be in Hogwarts afterward I see no reason why Quirrell would have to stay after he's taken the stone.

If I HAD to choose a time for him to do it where he has a chance of being caught by Snape/Trio I'd probably do it during Quidditch. A majority of the students and some teachers go to watch the games leaving that stone sitting there ripe for the taking.
