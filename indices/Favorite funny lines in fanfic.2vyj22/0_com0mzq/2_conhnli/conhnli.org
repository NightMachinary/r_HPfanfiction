My personal favorite line from that was in Dumbledore and Harry's conversation in chapter 22

  "Really?" Albus asked in happy surprise. "I always knew Miss Black was quite powerful but... is that why you wanted to separate her from the Dark Lord?"

  Harry blinked. "Sure, I mean, that and... she's hot."

  "I hardly think being attractive should matter in this."

  "Maybe not," Harry playfully admitted. "But it helps when we loan her out for sex to our guests."

  "Harry," Albus reprimanded.

  "Why do you think Jimmy likes coming over so much?"

  Albus lightly reminded, "With the charm, I can tell when you're lying."

  *"Right," Harry agreed. "And Bellatrix is carrying Remus' illegitimate baby."*

  Albus furrowed his brow in uncertainty. "At least I thought I could."

  Harry's eyes were twinkling merrily.
