A Black Comedy is just a treasure trove of little jokes and one-liners. My favorite is this scene from Chapter 18:

  "Greetings," Albus loudly said as the two Potters and he approached. "Lord Black and Lord Black. I'm delighted to see you accepted Professor Potter's invitation."

  Harry could feel his mother's approach and tried to pretend there was nothing out of the ordinary. "Please Headmaster, for tonight, I'm Harry and he's Sirius."

  Sirius noticed Harry slinking away and slapped him hard on the shoulder in a friendly gesture, while adding, "But unless you count his back, he's not really hairy. And I am rarely serious."

  "Oof," Harry groaned, partly from the smack and partly from Sirius' line. "Can't you not crack a name joke, just once?"

  Albus' eyes were twinkling as he added, "If it makes you feel any better, I've never been more than two-thirds bus. Further proof there really is no truth in advertising."
