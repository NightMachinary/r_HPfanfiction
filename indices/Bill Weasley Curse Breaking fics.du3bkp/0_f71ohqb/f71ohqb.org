This is a Harry centric fanfic with Bill as a major supporting character and mentor. It focuses on Harry becoming a curse breaker in his own right and on a fairly epic adventure down in South America. Lots of action, lots of curse-breaking that goes into a fair amount of detai, and lots of interesting supporting characters.
