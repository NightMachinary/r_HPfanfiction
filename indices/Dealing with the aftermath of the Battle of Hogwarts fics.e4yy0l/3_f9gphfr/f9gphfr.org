I've seen this one recommended here several times. I tried reading and got to chapter 9. While it is very well written there isn't a lot going on. Harry hires some people and has an endless string of business meetings. Now the second one is much more fun. Well, not exactly fun, but at least stuff happens and Harry deals with PTSD.
