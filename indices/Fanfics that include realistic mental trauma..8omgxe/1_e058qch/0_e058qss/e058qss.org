  Soon comes the cold, and the night that never ends, warned the red priestess and, for once, she was not mistaken. At the Wall, an army of men fights ice with fire while the struggle for the Iron Throne continues with old and new players alike. Across the Narrow Sea, Daenerys Targaryen becomes determined to go home, leaving behind a trail of destruction in her wake. Amidst it all, Arya Stark returns to Westeros teaming up with the most unexpected company yet, becoming a participant in a very different meeting of ice and fire.The realm will soon discover House Stark and Targaryen are not as dead as everyone once thought and, more importantly, that the darkest hour is upon them.
