Glad you liked it! I have read Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation and The Princess Rescues the Dragon. I recall that both are well-written, but I'm not sure either one is complete. I think both are in the same universe (which is not the same universe as Four O'Clock) but are written from different perspectives. They are also somewhat grittier; mental health issues still apparent, but not dealt with as responsibly by the characters. I don't have strong memories of any of the others, but I probably read them, and they do blend together after a while.
