Yeah, but I couldn't really come up with anything interesting about a river bumblebee.

That list has a mistake with Ginny's name, it's Ginevra, not Ginerva, and it is in fact a variant on Guinevere, along with Juniper, Jennifer, Genevieve, etc etc. It could also be a variant on Geneva. Regardless, most of these seem to come back to the Juniper berry, or tree itself.

To quote Wikipedia:

#+begin_quote
  In Latin, juniperus is combination of the word junio, which means young, and parere, to produce, hence youth producing, or evergreen.

However, Genevieve can also come from Germanic roots, meaning 'wife' and 'kin' - possibly meaning wife who is also a relation? Regardless, as an interesting tidbit, St Genevieve's father was called Severus. Her feast day is sadly six days before Snapes birthday, or I'd have jumped up and down and declared this not a coincidence, but a massive conspiracy.

Taken from Welsh, can also mean white/fair spirit/fairy. I have no idea why white/light/silver features in so many JK names.

Anyway, Junipers are typically protective, sacred, and virtuous. Saint Juniper, "the jester of the Lord" is sometimes called the Saint of comedy, and was also extremely patient. Sounds appropriate for a sister of the twins.
