Yes I would like something like this! Like what if Neville broke his spine from the broom fall instead of his arm? Or what if Hermione died to the trolly, or Ron lost a leg to the Stone challenges? :o Or what about if in second year students actually got EATEN or killed? Or Sirius was actually dangerously nuts that he ended up killing the Fat Lady portrait, or hurting students to get to Peter? :o HARD MODE!!! :) Things are not easy and smooth and people don't have plot armors. Well, at least, not massive amounts of it...
