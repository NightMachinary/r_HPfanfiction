Hmm...well, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11029663/1/Promotion][Promotion, by Endgames]]. It didn't get very far, only up to 1st year's Halloween, though.\\
I don't remember the details that well, but I recall that Quirrelmort goes a little overboard on said Halloween, assassinating Harry and unleashing the Basilisk on the Great Hall...

...Okay, rereading it, Quirrell engineers a detention for Harry so that he's alone and easily murdered, releases the basilisk whilst Trelawney's sick and Fawkes is unavailable (Burning Day), and employs a dozen mountain trolls for good measure. Talk about overkill.
