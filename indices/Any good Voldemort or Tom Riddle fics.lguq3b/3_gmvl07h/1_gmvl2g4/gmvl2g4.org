  Bellamione / "Remember when I told you I'd read her mind? I saw something peculiar. Bella," she went on urgently. "I think there's a possibility she could be--- she could be a venor floccus." AU, centred around Hermione Granger, a very best friend of Draco Malfoy, back when she was just a fifteen-year-old kid dealing with her inner demons, trying to deny the growing interest in a mysterious Bellatrix Lestrange.

  The world believes Lord Voldemort's been dead since 1981. He wishes for it to stay that way, thank you. It is 1998, now, and Hermione Granger signs up for an international mentorship program as a stepping stone for her after Hogwarts life. Draco Malfoy, never to be one-upped, signs up for the same program and scores Gilderoy Lockhart as his mentor, knowing he is Hermione's first choice. Meanwhile, Hermione is stuck with some obscure, hermit NOBODY that can talk to snakes. Ugh. Her life is the worst.Or:Hermione Granger has no idea what she has gotten herself into, all while Tom Riddle plays an American persona very, very badly. Not long into their mentorship, the anonymity of Tom Riddle fades and he must face consequences for his crimes.OR:Abraxas Malfoy loves Tom Riddle. Even though it is very difficult to do so.
