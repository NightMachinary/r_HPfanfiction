Also, linkffn(The Darkness Within by kurinoone): Harry raised by Voldemort, not the best situation for getting accepted into a public school.

linkffn(Sixteen Years): Dumbledore was seriously screwed up. Props though for being one of the only stories I can say that both Dumbledore and Voldemort were scary as hell, plus one of the funniest multi-chapter jokes I have yet read.

linkffn(The Return of the Marauders): Sirius and Lily seem to have thought, "its not safe for Harry in Britain, lets take him to America and keep him safe." Fifteen years later, Harry and Sirius are fighting a basilisk to save a colony of sirens, so not the best job.

linkao3(C'est la vie by cwycross): Harry dimension travels to fourth year and starts out as a new transfer student. Probably one of the best Hufflepuff!Harry stories I can think of.
