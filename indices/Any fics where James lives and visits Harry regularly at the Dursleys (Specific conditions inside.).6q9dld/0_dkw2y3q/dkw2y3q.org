If James lived, Harry would have never been place to Dursley's. No, Dumbledore wasn't such idiot to force him to do so. Even if Dumbledore was idiot enough to do so, James would have never agreed. Any premise where James lives and Harry still places to Dursley's by default as logical as any WBWL/neglected brother of BWL. Makes zero senses.
