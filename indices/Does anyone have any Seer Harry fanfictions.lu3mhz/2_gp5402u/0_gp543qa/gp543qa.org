  He is the first seer the Potter family has ever had, but is it really as much of a blessing as it appears? Harry knows he has a chance prevent the horrors of the First Wizarding War from ever happening and set things right. Things don't go quite as planned, however, and Harry instead finds himself being part of a larger game with hidden rules. A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired pawn that is trying to survive the war that looms.

  Harry Potter was not the boy-who-lived and therefore he was not the favored child of the wizarding world. No, his twin brother Nathan Potter was and Nathan was easily loved by all, including the supposedly emotionless Harry Potter himself. Under the guidance of cold and strict tutors Harry has grown to be a rather emotionally detached young man but with the help of new friends who aren't his brother, perhaps Harry can learn what it's like to be seen as an individual. And maybe, just maybe, guidance from professor Snape, and upperclassmen can help Harry become the empathic Healer that he did not know he could be.That is if he can learn to navigate and cope with his visions as a seer and not fall victim to Voldemort's ever growing obsession with him that may very well lead him to insanity.!!!***01/01/2021 editing and rewriting AGAIN (Still, ah ha...) >_<||| sorry but I will still update as soon as I am able, sending much love<3**If you dislike characters being quite a bit OOC then this story is not for you. Please do not even attempt to read if you dislike OOC character writing or formal writing styles.<3 **

  NEWT-level Divination student Harry Potter bullshits his way through a major arcana reading, best friend of the year Tom Riddle offers a marriage of convenience with no ulterior motives at all, and the wizarding world's changing future is much less important than the seventh years' love lives.

  Since the singular incident of being a Horcrux for many years has left Harry with a sensitivity to Dark magic, Harry begins training with Jacob, a Wizard who lives in New York, using this sensitivity to his advantage to cleanse magical spaces of Dark magic. After a year of training, Draco Malfoy shows up, wanting to learn from Jacob as well, and unexpectedly the two men grow a bond, both magical and physical. But Jacob's sudden death leaves Harry floundering and growing increasingly dependent on drugs and sex to avoid his problems. After his brief and tumultuous affair with Draco ends, Harry begins a life of travel, avoiding returning home permanently and continuing his drug habit. He flits from job to job, from place to place, never settling down for a moment, until, years later, Harry is called back to England by his friends to help Draco find his way out of a cursed Manor.2018 *UPDATE* I have finally decided to post on A03 as well, for everyone who doesn't want to bother with the pdf.
