The problem with guns is likely that it is a one-shot affair and then every magic user is aware of the threat. It isn't inconceivable that anti-bullet charms exist, or spells to sabotage guns within an area. Even runes placed upon clothing or jewellry to negate incoming muggle weaponry.

Guns and magic have existed together for a long time in the HP universe. Perhaps the upcoming movie set in America will show how it works.
