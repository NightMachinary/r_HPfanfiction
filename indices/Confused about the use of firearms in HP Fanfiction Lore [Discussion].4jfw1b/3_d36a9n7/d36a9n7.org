Here's the thing about guns

1. Excepting small calibers (.22 for example) they are /loud/. Pretty sure my hearing is far worse than it should be from all those years of hunting.

2. Muzzle flash occurs, so if it is any level of not-bright out, they'll be a sudden source of unexpected /light/

3. With rifles, incredible range. The Shield Charm is useful only if A) you can cast it (please see the old shield hat argument) and b) if you know you need to use it.

4. Bullets are incredibly fast. A wizard who can cast a shield charm might not always be able to cast one before a piece of lead goes through vital portions of their anatomy.

5. The Wizarding community is incredibly ignorant of Muggle customs and items.

So guns are really great if you're going up against a wizard/witch who can't use a shield charm and can't apparate (please remember it is said in the books that some can't/don't like to), and for the ones who do know the shield charm, they probably won't know what the hell a gun is. But once wizards know, they'll still be useful for the long range when it comes to killing, and in close range they're incredibly distracting.
