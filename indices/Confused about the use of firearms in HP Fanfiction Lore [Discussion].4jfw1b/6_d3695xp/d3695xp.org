Because guns have far better range, rate of fire, and can be aimed far more easily than spells. In the time you cast one spell, dozens of bullets can be on their way to you.

How well they do against magic shields has never been shown in canon, so that's all up to the author.

But I have to point out that your proposed course of action is something no canon wizard has ever been seen doing. And it would likely take a transfiguration expert with a lot of experience to achieve. For the average wizard who has trouble casting a shield spell (which is canon - the Ministry bought shield hats from WWW for that reason), a gun could be a great tool - in the typical magical combat, even an untrained user can be effective with one. Not everyone is Dumbledore, after all.

And yet, if they actually took the time to learn how to use a gun properly in combat, they could learn how to cast effectively instead.
