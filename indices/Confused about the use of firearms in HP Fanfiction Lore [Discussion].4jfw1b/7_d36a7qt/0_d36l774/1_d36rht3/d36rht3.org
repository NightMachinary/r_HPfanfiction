I agree that the situation you described is bad, horrible writing, but i feel that firearms and magic can be a compelling story.

I feel that for large scale fighting, guns are better until close quarters confined spaces. But it has to be brought in organically and not just randomly pulled out of somewhere the sun doesn't shine.
