Because people like to wank over firearms. That's the reason the NRA exists, after all.

The thing about firearms in fiction is that people often think of guns as the ultimate be-all, end-all in terms of weaponry and masculinity. They've had it ingrained in their mind as the bestest most awesome thing since childhood, so they like guns in their fantasy fiction as a one-up to wizardry.

Honestly, I feel any creative use of magic is far more interesting than someone's pistol, but people like guns. They like big bangs. Magic just doesn't compare, apparently.
