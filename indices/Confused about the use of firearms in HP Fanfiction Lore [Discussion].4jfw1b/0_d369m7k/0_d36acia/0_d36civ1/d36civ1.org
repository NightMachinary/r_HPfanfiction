A shotgun would be devestating in the range wherein most magic fights are fought. However, it'll be difficult for said person to reload that weapon. I'm not a gun expert here, but reloading a semi-automatic shotgun/double barrel while holding a wand/casting isn't condusive to survival in a spell fight. Diving for cover puts one on the defensive and that person will lose ground.

Maybe it's feasible for an opening shot but in a prolonged fight? I doubt it.

Also if a user is using a gun with sights is it a given wherein that person is trained/have background knowledge about it?
