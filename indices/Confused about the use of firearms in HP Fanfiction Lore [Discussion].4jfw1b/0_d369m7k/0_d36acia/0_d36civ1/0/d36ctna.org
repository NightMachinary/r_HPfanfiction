With a sawed off, say, double barrel, you could easily have multiple on you.

As for the sights, all guns (with the caveat that I've only used a shotgun twice in my life, so I'm not actually sure about them) come with sights. The issue is that they can get misaligned, so at minimum you should check them once a year. Plus the setting that works well for say, 75 yards isn't accurate at 100 yards because of drop. Same issue occurs with scopes. The gun I use hunting is a .30-.30 lever action. Not the most accurate gun for longer shots, meant for hunting in the woods and not in the fields. Probably should have the scope set to 75 yards, but we have ours set to 100. Every year before the season comes around we generally need to check how well the scope is sighted in.
