  Bottomline would be that a wand in the right, a gun in the left hand would be a interesting combination.

The only issue with that will be aiming. Either they'll most likely miss by shooting the gun in their off-hand, or they'll probably miss the targets of most their spells with their off-hand.

This can be compensated for by taking a shotgun (20 gauge, maybe, to limit the recoil) and sawing that bastard off, and carving the stock into an easy to hold handle.

EDIT: Also sights are only accurate if the gun has been sighted in (adjusting the sights so that the correct target [bulls-eye] is hit). And that is only true at the range to which it is sighted in. Closer and farther you'll need to adjust.
