As a first you fall into the same mistake as many fics, I feel. Kinetic Energy doesn't matter. Physics doesn't matter, because magic is outside of physics. Protego protects against harm. A bullet does harm. Ergo, Protego protects from the bullet.

Guns do have their use. For one, they are incredibly accurate. While yes, we know that some wizards have good aim with their wand, gun-sights are perfectly accurate. Sniper rifles would be a devastating thing to have in wizarding combat. Furthermore, you shoot 600 piercing hexes per minute. Especially during battles like the one at Hogwarts, using heavy muggle weaponry would have been very effective to put the attackers on the defensive. Also, guns don't need an incantation, wand movement or anything like that. They need ammo and a finger to pull the trigger. The travel time of a bullet is way faster than a spell. We know that spells are slow enough to be deflected, shielded,... If you fire a bullet at a reasonable range, nobody has the time to react - /nobody/.

Bottomline would be that a wand in the right, a gun in the left hand would be a interesting combination. Both have their strength and their weakness. If brought into the fight in HP, a gun would at the very least surprise your opponent enough for you to get an advantage.

What you describe, I doubt anyone beneath the level of the most powerful magic users could do that. I try to come up with more fights, but the only one I remember with such a variety of spells would be the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort in the Ministry. Transfiguration and Charms with such precision, during a fight, has got to take decades of training if we compare it to what is normally done.
