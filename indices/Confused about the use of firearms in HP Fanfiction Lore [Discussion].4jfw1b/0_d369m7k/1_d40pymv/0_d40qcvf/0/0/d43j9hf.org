What are we arguing about here?

Do you want me to agree to an idea for one of your fics? Because, yea, I agree that this kind of dueling should be canon. Its more creative, more immersive and way more interesting than shooting magic bullets at each other.

Is it canon? No. It simply isn't. Which is why there is probably an explanation why it isn't done with the exception of the two most powerful wizards in Britain.
