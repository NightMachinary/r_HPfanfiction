That may all be true, but the fact remains that in fights during canon, wizards basically used slow moving bullets with effects on them. The only time, and I repeat myself here, that we saw people use something else in a fight was Dumbledores and Voldemorts duel in the Ministry.

Maybe wizards are just incredibly uncreative in a combat situation. Maybe chaining spells is harder than we think. But the observable evidence in canon would point towards some explanation that would tell us why your proposal is not done in actual wizard combat.

If you want to incorporate your fast-paced transfiguration and charmswork in a fic, go for it. Its a better concept for fights than canon. But if you're asking why guns would make sense within the observable canon, I keep standing to my statement.
