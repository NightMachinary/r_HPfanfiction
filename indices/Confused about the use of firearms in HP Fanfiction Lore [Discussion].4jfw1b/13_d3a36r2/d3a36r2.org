Guns are stupid because magic. If wizards can make whole buildings jump out of the way of a vehicle moving at ludicrous speeds I'm pretty sure an enchantment to make bullets swerve and avoid them would be nothing. And it's not like wizards are completely ignorant of the concept of non-magical ranged weaponry, so I'm sure they've thought of something already.

Also the firearms knowledge on display itt is laughably bad.
