  Gaiety Ollivander, the nineteen year old great-granddaughter of Garrick Ollivander, opened her wooden case, revealing her carving tools, her original wand, and a branding iron with vials of liquid gold and liquid silver. She took out the knives and set them on the table then laid out the branding iron and the vials, pulling a scant ounce of each into modern syringes.

  The blank of ivy wood and a dragon heartstring---both very common ingredients---awaited her first foray into a complete wand instead of just assembly line runic work. She took the half inch sickle blade and began carving the blank down to a rough heptagonal shape, twisting it so that its eleven inch length would have three full rotations.

  She winced as she cut herself and scowled, flicking the blood away, then used a muggle styptic pen to close the wound---magic near a raw wand was the best way to destroy one---and went back to carving, slower. I know better, she thought to herself angrily.

  With the rough shape done, she placed the wand into the holding stand and took out the flensing, coring, and obsidian flake blades.

  The obsidian flake blade was the first to be used, the only magical item used to make a wand. She ran it carefully along the wood, following the strongest looking grain from tip to tip, making sure she didn't go too deep.

  Sure she had done it correctly, she loaded the heartstring into the coring knife and inserted it, pressing it past the depth of the obsidian blade's cut, twisting. The blade spun, cutting the core cavity and expelling it out of the secondary cavity of the knife. She moved it, just a hair, and spun it again.

  Four hours later, she had finished coring the wand and began moving it backwards, watching the heartstring slowly bond to the wand wood.

  The core installed, Gaiety took the syringe of silver and carefully lined the cut with it, watching the magic of the obsidian blade left behind in the grain of the wood use the magical potential of the silver to bond it back together.

  "Well done."

  She jumped in fright and turned to look at her great-grandfather, breathing hard, a little unnerved by his intensity. "Gramps!"

  "Carry on."

  She took out the last piece to complete the raw wand, a small dragon pearl---actually a piece of talon fashioned into a orb using the dragon's own scales---and carefully inserted it into the cavity at the tip of the wand, carefully undoing the metal string she had used to compress the pearl, allowing it to expand and fit into the cavity she had carved for it. While her grandfather and great-grandfather eschewed decorative accents, she felt that each of her wands required them.

  She spent the rest of the day doing the final carving, using the flensing blade, taking almost dust sized particles with each pass until it was completed, the wood dust and the other ones she would shred and compact later, mixing with the silver to finish the wand.

  Garrick Ollivander watched his youngest descendant leave his shop then picked up the raw wand, twirling it, checking for the closing. He had been a little surprised she didn't use three biscuits to strengthen the seam but the curving she had been forced to follow would have made them harder to install and only a reinforcement of a natural strengthening. "Exceeds Expectations, my dear," he said then placed the wand back in the carving slot. "She will cut and burn you well, little one. When she's finished with you, a golden lacquer will adorn you and then, should you pass muster, you will be the first of her wands to join my wands awaiting young witches and wizards, ready to use you or your siblings in their education magicks. Someday you may do great things, terrible things, or some mixture of both. Choose your companion well little one," he whispered, taking his hand away. He made a mental note to remind her to speak to the wands she crafted as she did so. The wand looked for a moment as if it was about to tremble as he walked away.

  Gaiety studied the documents her great-grandfather had given her. She was to carve the blanks to roughly fit the dimensions of metal objects she didn't understand at all but would do as asked. The dimensions would test her skills since they would occasionally be thinner than a ring of growth and have cavities and holes yet would still have to hold a core and the multi piece wand design of two of the units would require her to create numerous prototypes. And were of a wood type wholly unsuitable for most wands.

  She turned to see her father busy carving a staff for a customer and decided to just start. Failures will teach me just as much as asking for help, she decided.

  ~•~

  Ollivander nodded. She had finished the single piece one and it looked correct. He took out a pair of calipers and other measuring devices then checked each dimension, seeing she had done it all near flawlessly. The only mar on its finish was a runic heart with an x through it. Her maker's mark on a small plane of the wood that was too high. It would be carved off carefully so he could add the runes after installing the liquified core. The design specifically required no maker's mark due to its technical illegality.

  Three months had passed and finally Gaiety had finished the carvings to Ollivander's approval and was off for a few weeks with her friends to Australia.

  While she was gone, Ollivander closed the shop and began the process of carving war runes on the three receivers. Designed to make a wand obey any master, it would cripple the wands for anything beyond destructive magic. The last time he had done this, he had conjured some songbirds and ended up with mutilated inferi birds, disgusting little avians that had made the elderly man who had lived and survived through two wars vomit. But if the wand decides to choose the user, even if designed for combat only, Garrick mused.

  Over a week he carved, burnt, and embellished with gold arrays of runes that covered every millimeter of the receiver, so small he had to use a seven array lens system to make the runes large enough to see.

  On the eighth day he carefully mixed ironwood dust and liquified silver then began painting it onto the wand, filling in the runes, making the receiver look solid once more. When it was complete and covered with seven layers of a diamond hard ebon lacquer, he tried to cast a reducto against a conjured block of wood. A miasma of charcoal was all that was left.

  "You've been crafted for a purpose," he told the wand. "For a specific user. He plans to use you in new and fairly exciting ways. Please, be a good wand for him. While he has his wand already, you are more than an experimental design. The care required to make you, he could have taken any wand and bonded it to the device you're shaped to be a part of. To make a whole from many pieces. So, understand, you're not just an experiment, you're a part of a whole. You and your two brethren will likely be his protectors." He was thoughtful for a moment. "I know you can't know who Harry Potter is but you're to be his. His companions. His allies. His tools. Be excellent tools for him, prove that you're what he needs." Garrick knew they weren't just experiments.

  The wand/receiver trembled in his hand, growing warmer, then stopped.

  He placed the wand carefully on the stand then remeasured and sanded off some of the lacquer in a few of the holes. With the first done, he started on the second. Gaiety's runic arrays were too simple so those would add another day or two to the crafting of the next day.
