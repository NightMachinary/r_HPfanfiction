So everybody's like guns are faster than hexes and in close combat they could be so and so.

But the only idea that has some merit is the sniper rifle one.

Humans can only focus on one thing at a time, so if you choose to use a weapon in a magical fight, at least while you're actually using the weapon you cannot use your magic. In close fight your opponent can see your weapon and then you have the issue of not what he can do to defend himself against your gun, but what you can do to defend yourself from your opponent while using your gun. And what your opponent can do to your gun. It's a gamble not worth taking, imo.

Plus, another point against that argument. In close ranged fights a knife is actually much more effective than a gun. Maybe wizards are not familiar with muggle guns, but surely they have knives. And in all the history of wizardry you want to tell me no one thought of using knives in combat? That's because they're either not effective or the effort you would put in mitigating all the weak spots you'd have is not worth it.

As for sniper rifles, I actually think that would work once or twice, as long as they don't know what they're dealing with. Once they figure it out? I don't know, but remember there's magic that lets them know your position as soon as you say a certain word out loud, a spell that affected a whole country, so who knows what they can come up with to deal with that.

Edit: despite this, I can see it being done correctly by a very strong author. Say, Frank Herbert strong. So if Herbert would return from the dead and instead of writing the 7th Dune novel he'd write HP fanfiction, and he would use this trope, something good could come out of it. But for anyone else it would be impossible.
