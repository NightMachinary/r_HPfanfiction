I'm more familiar with infantry tactics, though it's been a while since my last repetition course - I'm no longer in the reserves of my country's army due to age.

So, what I envision as the typical fight is closer to squad action, or more, at ranges where knives generally play the "what an idiot!" part.

And yes, you can disarm someone with a gun with your bare Hands. But you can also shoot an unarmed attacker. And if you can disarm someone with a gun, you can disarm someone with a wand.

Though in all those cases, the guy without a weapon is at a disadvantage.
