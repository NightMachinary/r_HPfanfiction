If you're close enough you can disarm someone with a gun with your bare hands. This being said... let's not forget about that whole magic thing going on at the same time. A fight in that world wouldn't be like a duel you see in western movies, if that's how you're imagining it. Or like shooting a defenseless animal who has no other option but running away when you're tying to kill it, if that's what you're more familiar with.
