It's not. The knife thing is common knowledge. Yes, at 2500m with a sniper rifle you have the upper hand, but in close combat the situation changes.

And this doesn't address the other points I made.

Edit: say you're in normal combat range for wizard fights. They see you reaching for your weapon and they apparate behind you, because they're not retards. Before you have the chance to turn around and reevaluate your surroundings you get transfigured into a mouse. The gun falls on top of you, squishing your frail body. You die. That's how I imagine these things would go.
