Shield charms do block physical objects, so yes. But it's not just time. Fred and George enchanted clothes to be permanently shielded. Raising and sighting a gun on a dynamic target is difficult and takes time to get a good hit without good luck, so it's quite probable that a protego can be thrown up in less time than an accurate bullet can go out. (Note to self. Enchant self aiming guns ASAP)
