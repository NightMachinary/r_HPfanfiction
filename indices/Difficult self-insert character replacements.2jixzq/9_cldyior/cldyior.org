Dobby, while enslaved. Actually, that doesn't need to be a self-insert at all to be interesting. Learning how Dobby struggled against his bonds and disobeyed his masters would be interesting. There would be a process of learning subtlety and things like it. Perhaps he eavesdropped to learn Slytherin cunning from them. Maybe he and Draco were close at first as he raised him, then they grew apart as Draco sought the approval of his father (might be too cliche). How exactly did he develop his obsession with Harry Potter? All neat questions to explore.
