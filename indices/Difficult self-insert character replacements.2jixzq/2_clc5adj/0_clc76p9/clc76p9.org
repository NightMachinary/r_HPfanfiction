Good point with Piers. Talk about SI hard mode. Piers being a muggle would prevent him/you from doing anything directly. You would have to work entirely by giving Harry ideas and then waiting til the next summer to find out what, if anything, happened. Tho a story told from his point of view, consisting of a series of conversations over the summers as he and Harry grow up could be interesting.
