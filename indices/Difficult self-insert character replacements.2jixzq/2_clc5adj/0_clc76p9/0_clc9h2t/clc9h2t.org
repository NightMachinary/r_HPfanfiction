  Tho a story told from his point of view, consisting of a series of conversations over the summers as he and Harry grow up could be interesting.

There's a very good, complete novella by Ecmm called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss][Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss]] that does exactly this, though through the eyes of an OC, Piers's younger sister. It's worth a read if you're interested in this sort of story.
