Dobby.

The good news: You get to keep both Dobby's memories and powers and your own, somehow reconciling them; your personality and values come out on top.

The bad news: It's 1991, you belong to the Malfoys, and whatever magic compels house-elves to follow orders and self-harm when they act against their owner's interests is still in full effect. Making plans to get yourself freed probably counts.

Have fun.
