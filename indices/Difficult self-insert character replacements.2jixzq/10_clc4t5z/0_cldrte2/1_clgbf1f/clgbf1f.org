God, right? Not to mention the giant gaping plot holes of um, hey, how the fuck did Lockhart get all this knowledge again? Like, they brush on it with talk about how he might have gotten information from dark creatures, but this character just barges in and demands things and people just accept it without questioning where the knowledge came from. Which is, you know, usually the entire point of these kind of stories. Such potential, but such a shitty follow through.
