I started reading it and, honestly, it's terrible. The author uses it as a soapbox to preach about their religion (I'm guessing LDS). They like to go off on tedious--and often dumb--monologues. They take extreme liberties with canon for no apparent reason other than power fantasy (all the memory magic stuff). And I felt I was just being trolled when [[/spoiler][we're told Nicholas Flamel is Gargamel and the Philosopher's Stone is made from smurfs]]. It's not even believable as a true self insert. The author doesn't spare a moment's thought for the life they left behind and just storms off to fix everything they think is wrong with Harry Potter.
