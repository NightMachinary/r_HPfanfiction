Oh I agree, tho, in defense of the author, that MAY have been on purpose. Considering that we basically are our accumulated experiences and memories, and the main character started out by incorporating Lockhart, I have little trouble imagining the end result ending up with a lack of morals, a massive ego, and a tendency towards lengthy monologues. Think: Lockhart as a door to door LDS guy.

Now obviously I don't know if the author /meant/ for that, but it was how I ended up reading it. He even notices other odd traits cropping up as he incorporates other people's memories, but iirc he mostly notices when he has conflicting impulses. I only made it about halfway through it tho.
