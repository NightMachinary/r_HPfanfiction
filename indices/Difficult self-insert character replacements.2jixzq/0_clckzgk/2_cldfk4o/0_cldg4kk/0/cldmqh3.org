To be fair, in canon, she doesn't bother to mention her parents' given names, either. Such is the fate of a supporting character. I don't see how that we know next to nothing about her parents is evidence of memory charms.

A much more benign explanation is that Accidental Magic usually emerges in times of stress and desperate need, though there are exceptions. If Hermione had a relatively low-stress childhood, there would be very few instances of that, many of them not very noticeable or easily explainable. (E.g., if Hermione walks away from a car accident that should have killed her, who's going to bother doing the math to notice that the forces involved and the (lack of) injury suffered don't add up?)

Or, maybe Harry's magical core is just that much bigger. A lot of writers really like that explanation. :P
