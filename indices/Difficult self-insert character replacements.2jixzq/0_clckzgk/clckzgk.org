Hermione's mom, just after the first time her daughter performs accidental magic at age seven.

Full memory of the books and movies, and of your past life. Nothing of Mrs. Granger's life. Because they just Oblivated you, poorly, and now you are someone else and you don't even know what your (her) husband's phone number is. Or even his name. Or your name, because that wasn't in the books. But you do remember your daughter's accidental magic and the wizards who screwed up casting that spell on you. And an entire other life.

You also don't have any magic. You are really and truly a Muggle. And no one will ever, /ever/ listen to you in the magical world. You only have your daughter's connection to book events for now. There's a problem, though.

You don't /feel/ the emotional link to your daughter; you don't remember Hermione growing up or her birth. You have a great deal of affection for her /as a character/ (you were a fanfic reader and shipped her /hard/, which is now really weird). You do have a chance to rebuild a strong, emotional connection while caring for her as her mother, if you don't screw it up. But you aren't there yet. And she's /very/ smart and will quickly notice you don't actually know or care for her. A crushing emotional blow to a seven year old.

Your husband, who loved Mrs. Granger very much, is also a complete stranger. And sort of a widower, in a way. The old Mrs. Granger is, effectively, dead, but from his point of view you are her and crazy or badly injured.

Oh right. And you were a man in your past life, but now have the body, hormonal balance, and sex drive of a woman. Unlike most shitty fanfic, this isn't shown as some sort of a horrible curse or a bitter trial or something. Being a woman isn't /bad/ or inherently negative.

But it isn't what you were before, and the change is psychologically devastating. That doesn't mean your personality is totally changing, just that you've got to deal with the possible gender dysphoria. This is sort of the reverse of the usual IRL, where someone is dissatisfied with the body they were born with, feeling they would be happier as a different sex. As you have memories of happily being male, but are very definitely in a female body with normal hormone levels, the decision is a little foggier.

You're going to have to deal with all that while making your cunning master plans. Do you shatter your family by refusing to be married to a man who loves the person you were and trying to get gender reassignment treatments, in the UK, in the late '80s/early '90s? Do you pretend to have feelings for people you simply don't have while attempting to live a lie in a body you don't know or, at least initially, like?

To top it all off, you can't do your job any longer because you can't remember how (you aren't a dentist), so your family's standard* of living is taking a nosedive. And you can't remember any of Mrs. Granger's friends or family. So your Muggle life is completely screwed up.

But you /do/ remember Harry Potter's address. And the address of a certain grim old place. And the general location of a hidden pub that you might be able to find with your daughter's help. There's also the name of a small town with a dark history and a very significant graveyard.

And you have four years to help a little girl who doesn't remember she can do magic, but has the potential to be the greatest witch of her age, get ready to go to school with the Dark Lord as a teacher. And then a basilisk. And then a crowd of soul-sucking demons.

Eventually, the magical world will start attacking Muggles like you at will. They'll then begin rounding up Muggle-born like your beautiful daughter. Unless you do something starting /now/, you don't really have a chance long-term. You can't ride out canon events. Canon Hermione's mother was /almost certainly/ not severely mentally ill -- which is what she and everyone else thinks now, regardless of what choices you make.

Good luck.
