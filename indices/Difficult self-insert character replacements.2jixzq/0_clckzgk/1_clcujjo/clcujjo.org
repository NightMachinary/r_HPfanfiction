Nice setup. Though a talented writer like you could no doubt make it work, I can't help but think that this would be one of the most depressing stories ever.

I think if I were the SI in these circumstances, I'd plan to enroll Hermione in Beauxbatons and just let England burn. At that point, I'd have no emotional ties to anyone in the magical world (though would expect to build them with my child over time) and sometimes mucking one's hand is the only way to play it. The only involvement with the canon world I'd consider might be an occasional, anonymous note delivered in the Muggle post to Harry or Mrs. Figg. There's no reason for a Muggle to willingly involve herself in a dark, dreary world that despises her.

I would think that the sexuality thing would sort itself out eventually. Sexual orientation is a physical thing, not a preference, and following the initial shock, one would expect the protag in the body of a heterosexual woman to possess the same orientation. Not the same affection for the stranger sharing her bed, of course, nor even the prospects of salvaging that non-relationship, but at least a preference for outies over innies.
