  I think if I were the SI in these circumstances, I'd plan to enroll Hermione in Beauxbatons and just let England burn.

Might work. It isn't clear it would be possible, though. You could teach her French, get permanent French citizenship, the whole deal. But it isn't clear if they even let Muggle-born in. There are hints that Europe is even worse about blood prejudice than magical UK. You might be running into a worse situation, and there is no real way to scout it out.

I see a greater than 20% probability of simply being Obliviated again and having your daughter's magic sealed when she becomes of age, instead of getting an invite to Beauxbatons. We know this magical sealing is possible, and not fanon, because it is in OooP as a threat after wand snapping.

  I would think that the sexuality thing would sort itself out eventually.

I think you're right there. It's still really jarring. And there's a chance you'll have some sort of induced disorder out the other end anyway. Sexual dysfunction is very likely, as is depression.
