Good points. I don't think going to Dumbledore is wrong, but as you pointed out there are a lot of factors. Best to check first, and that might need to wait until a certain little lady gets her Hogwarts letter.

  Please forgive the snark, but are you rational enough to distinguish canon from fanon? Dumbledore rejected the doctrine that he and Grindelwald called "Greater Good". That's why they ended up fighting.

Nah, that's fair. Except, of course, that's my shitty memory if I am at fault, not my rationality. Maybe I'd make a better Dumbledore than you might think. I might forget to check on a little orphan for a decade, too.

Anyway, if I remember correctly, he rejected /his boyfriend's/ greater good, the one that involved ruling over Muggles with a magical meritocracy and force, if needed. Not the doctrine as a whole. Harry certainly didn't think so.

From the letter to Grindelwald in book seven:

#+begin_quote
  We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.)

Same book:

#+begin_quote
  Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause he said. "How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?"

  A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart.

  "I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry," said Hermione.

  "Why didn't he tell him to hide, then? shot back Aberforth. "Why didn't he say to him, 'Take care of yourself, here's how to survive' ?"

  "Because," said Harry before Hermione could answer, "sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!"
#+end_quote

Harry says, Dumbledore didn't tell him to hide, because "sometimes you've got to think about the greater good."

Dumbledore's brother and even Harry seem to think Dumbledore thought of the greater good. It is clearly not something anyone believes he rejects wholly. At this point, Harry /knows/ he's been set up by Dumbeldore. The lies of omission and the projectile heading towards Voldemort's heart that is his life is clear.

/Hermione/ doesn't buy that Harry had to suffer and be put in danger for the greater good, but that poor girl hasn't been right in canon since puberty hit its stride. She's a little soft for wartime, and hardly ever talked to the man before he died. And is also a female character in a JKR novel. Poor thing.

Harry has spent his entire time at Hogwarts talking to Dumbledore. He knows what's what. And he doesn't deny that Dumbledore might do something for the greater good. In fact, he /defends/ the idea immediately.

Canon Dumbledore quite clearly still believes in the greater good. Just not as a whip or a sword. But instead as both personal self-sacrifice and as the necessary morality of inaction in the face of pain easily wiped away by possibly intrusive action. He doesn't abuse Harry himself, but he let the situation where he was neglected happen, just like with Tom, because he was not willing to take action.

Because powerful people taking action instead of letting the little people work things out themselves might mean you make a mistake and hurt people. Like your sister.

At last, I give you this great line from OooP:

#+begin_quote
  'Five years ago, then,' continued Dumbledore, as though he had not paused in his story, 'you arrived at Hogwarts, neither as happy nor as well-nourished as I would have liked, perhaps, yet alive and healthy. You were not a pampered little prince, but as normal a boy as I could have hoped under the circumstances. *Thus far, my plan was working well.*
