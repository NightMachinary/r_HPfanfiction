Good points, all. At the same time, I would think that Dumbledore's bias towards inaction would work in your favor with respect to getting to keep your memories. An Act-Utilitarian he isn't.

That said, my prior probability that I would be in the Potterverse would be vastly higher than that I would be in a Potterficverse. Still, here's an SI full of moral dilemmas: you are the Granger parent of your choice. You even get to sift through their major categories of memories and keep things like dental education. But, you are in Harrycrowverse. You are reasonably well positioned to do /something/. But, WTF /should/ you do?
