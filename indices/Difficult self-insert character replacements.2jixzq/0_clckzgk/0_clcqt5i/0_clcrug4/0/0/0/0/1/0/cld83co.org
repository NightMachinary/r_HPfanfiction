Muggle history for gross changes; taking that drive to Harry's hood; check Tom's hometown; get some phenobarbital, a cricket bat, 50' of rope, and capture that next Obliviator that comes at your daughter for some answers.

Maybe try to bluff your way into the Leaky Cauldron or even into Diagon Alley. I'm thinking cold-heartedly use your husband to poke at it. Put in place some controls to see if he gets Obliviated and see how far he and Hermione can get.

As with most set ups, you'd need to wait until Hermione hit Hogwarts to get real answers. Which is suboptimal.
