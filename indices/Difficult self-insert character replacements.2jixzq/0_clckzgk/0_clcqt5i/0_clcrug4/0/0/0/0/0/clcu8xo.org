Hold on...

- You are inserted into a universe where the bad guys would have probably won, if not for some really timely luck, and where they had, in fact, won for a year, instituting a reign of terror. In such a universe, you are confronted with circumstances that make you unable to take over your host's vocation (unless you are a trained dentist), gender dysphoria, and who knows what else. You choose to stay and remain engaged.

- You are inserted into a universe where the bad guys won't present any real challenge, and your daughter will be happy, albeit not in a dignified way, and you get all the good of the insert but none of the bad. You choose to flee.

Truly Robst is a master of psychological horror.
