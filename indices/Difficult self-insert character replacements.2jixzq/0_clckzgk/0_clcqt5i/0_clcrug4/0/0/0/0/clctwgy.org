Good one. Uh. I remember all my carefully constructed, self-protecting rationals for not commiting suicide? I take away my daughter's Jane Austin books and give her something anarcha-feminist, ASAP? Get her some pepper spray, too?

I just leave with my family, because we aren't really useful to the main plot, so someone else teenage with a vagina can throw herself on that granade of hat-tipping? SuperHarry shows no signs of being challenged, sooo...why stay and fight? I say Australia looks very inviting.
