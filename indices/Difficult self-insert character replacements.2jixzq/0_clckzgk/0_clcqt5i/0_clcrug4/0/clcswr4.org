These are all real risks. However, every single possible course of action carries risks. Maybe you will mess up with Hermione and be killed by a burst of Accidental Magic like, say, Dumbledore's mother was; or get hit by a car. Perhaps I am insufficiently imaginative, but I simply do not see a course of action with a better expected outcome (or, if you prefer, higher probability of an acceptable outcome). You've stacked the deck against the SI (as requested), and I would argue that you've stacked it to the point that, yes, going straight to Dumbledore is the least bad approach.

On the actual probability of these risks, I think that there is no plausible interpretation of Dumbledore's character that would hear "horcrux" from the lips of a Muggle and wouldn't, at the very least, take a moment to inquire as to how said Muggle learned of such things. His beliefs on the prophecy are stated in canon: he believes that Voldemort gave it power by choosing to act on it. And, on passivity, he did not hesitate to go after horcruxes when he knew where they were.

Now, mind you, if you actually found yourself in such a situation, you would probably want to first ascertain that you were, in fact, in canon Potterverse. For example, if you were, in fact, in HarryCrowverse, you probably /would/ get Obliviated by Dumbledore, so you might want to, instead, see if you could get Hermione adopted by the goblins, because it's the only way she's getting any sort of agency. Not sure how your actions would be affected if you were in WitchQueenverse instead.

  The pensive clearly uses magical memories. Those memories can be stored in a jar, and are extracted without a spell, simply removed from a magical person's head. I'm just a Muggle. I don't think that will work. Otherwise, Hermione would have used it as at least a backup on her parents, just in case her spell wasn't as reversible as she thought.

Fair enough, though it's more likely that she simply didn't have a Pensieve handy. Still, look on the bright side: it's a reason for Dumbledore to not Obliviate you.

  but I'm much, much more rational than someone spouting things like "for the greater good" with a straight face.

Please forgive the snark, but are you rational enough to distinguish canon from fanon? Dumbledore /rejected/ the doctrine that he and Grindelwald called "Greater Good". That's why they ended up fighting.
