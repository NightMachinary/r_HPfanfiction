I hate those "ask an evil gene for wishes and I'll shit on them for fun" types of things, but I don't think you've thought this one through.

The pensive clearly uses magical memories. Those memories can be stored in a jar, and are extracted without a spell, simply removed from a magical person's head. I'm just a Muggle. I don't think that will work. Otherwise, Hermione would have used it as at least a backup on her parents, just in case her spell wasn't as reversible as she thought.

It isn't even clear that Legilimency works on me. Harry doesn't know how it works, and he used it back at Snape without even casting the spell. That /strongly/ implies that there is something magical going on in the /receiving/ person's head.

My brutal-world view (and what anyone rational should consider) would be that it might not work on Muggles, and you can't risk your life based on the idea that it would. Maybe once Hermione can verify a few things...but that comes /years/ from now.

Also: you are a Muggle. If you show up at Mrs. Figg's and boff it, you might get Obliviated and forget your daughter is a witch until she's eleven. And if you forget /everything/ about and related to magic, you. Are. *Fucked*.

Even if you succeed, you might be fucked. You simply can't risk the very real chance that Dumbledore will listen to what you say, tell you he either can't confirm it or he'll do his best, and then (AS REQUIRED BY LAW) Obliviate you again.

You can't risk another Obliviation. Who knows what it would do.

  Because, honestly, you are not smarter or more powerful than Dumbledore; your only advantage is information, and Dumbledore can make better use of that information than you.

Ehh...Dumbledore might be more /knowledgeable/ than I am, at least about magical things, but I'm much, /much/ more rational than someone spouting things like "for the greater good" with a straight face. He might, even in canon, simply be going senile. You just don't know. I also suspect he has a strong "wait and see" bias, which doesn't help you. As well as other biases.

For all Dumbledore's talk, he doesn't seem to have any Muggle or Muggle-born friends, even amongst Muggle-born students' parents, does he? I expect that even in the best case, you'll get shut out instantly, simply for being a Muggle. And likely Obliviated of the dangerous knowledge of the horcruxes.

--------------

I simply do not see why getting an early start on killing the horcruxes before year one is worth risking your life, just to put things into he hands of a man who suspected horcurxes for /fifteen years/ before acting. By looking up old student records.

What if Dumbledore really, really believes in the prophecy, and simply won't allow anything to mess with it? Certainly not a crazy Muggle woman. Dumbledore in canon is clearly not evil or grossly incompetent, but he might be patriarchal, secretive, domineering, and just as bigoted as the Weasleys about Muggles. I love all the times Hermione's parents are invited over in...oh, wait...
