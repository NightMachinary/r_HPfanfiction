You don't pull punches, do you?

That said, I think that the best you can do in this case is to contact Dumbledore; give him a Pensieve memory dump of what you know; have him or McGonagall tell Hermione the truth, because it's the least bad option [1]; and wash your hands of the matter; also, maybe see if Dumbledore can hook you up with some magic for the body and mind issues, in either direction.

Of course, this assumes that you are, in fact, in Potterverse, so, for example, Voldemort's horcruxes are where you think they are.

Now, you might ask,

#+begin_quote
  "turbinicarpus, I just wrote that 'no one will ever, ever listen to you in the magical world'. If you try to so much as acquire a postal owl before Hermione gets her Hogwarts letter, you will be Obliviated at best."

To this, I answer,

#+begin_quote
  "Go to Privet Drive, and look for the house with all the cats. Therein, you will find Arabella Figg, who has a direct and confidential line to Dumbledore."
#+end_quote

Because, honestly, you are not smarter or more powerful than Dumbledore; your only advantage is information, and Dumbledore can make better use of that information than you.

[1] This might be a suboptimal move, as it might lead to a Dark Lady Granger by giving her a grudge against the wizarding world ("Hello. My name is Hermione Granger. You effectively killed my mother. Prepare to die."), but, again, considering how unpredictable the consequences of /any/ course of action with respect to Hermione are, again, it's probably the least bad option.
