Ouch. Not sure what the obsession is with demagicing people. Not part of the trope. But sure. You remember nothing Voldemort does and therefore can't do magic; because it's so hard, eleven-year-olds need an entire week to start picking it up.

On the other hand, I do remember the incantation of every Unforgivable. And none of them have wand movements, just a jab. So...exactly how much emotions do I need to cast them? And how angry am I at being suck as Voldemort? How much do I hate racist, murdering bigots, and want them to die?

That'll do pig. That'll do.

--------------

Regardless, I think you still simply stop being evil...and run. It is clear that your "soul" (whatever the fuck that is) is not Voldemort's, but you need to make sure the horcruxes don't get activated, releasing a "real" copy of Voldemort onto the world -- like the Diary almost did.

This also means you likely aren't immortal. Sorry.

Have Bellatrix retrieve your locket horcrux from the now-defenseless (or mostly so) Black family townhouse, leave the cup horcrux in her vault (which a password is now required to even be taken in a cart to access), tell Lucius nothing, and just scarper to South America. Or maybe Australia.

Bellatrix worships you, and will continue to do so even if you never cast a spell again. Take her with. Just dom her some -- christ, you do know how to do that, I hope? Not /50 Shades of Didn't Even Read the Wikipedia Article/, but real S&M stuff? Real dom isn't about displays of power or even pain (even if Bellatrix is into that, too), it is about control and trust games. Do that, or get some books to learn how; buy some nice whips; let her do a nightly rapist-trap walk through the docks to get some Muggles to torture who actually deserve it; and she'll keep purring like a demented little kitten forever.

And if I really /can't/ use magic, why do I look like that if I'm not magical? If I am actually magical, and I just don't remember how...well, I've got a demented, obsessed, childless woman to teach me horrible dark magic. Sounds like a win-win to me. I'll be in SÃ£o Paulo with crazy-pussy, the Death Eaters will be collapsing in on themselves, and Harry might actually get a decent year at Hogwarts for once with Scrimgeour in charge and not being murdered by me.

With me gone, there is no other plot.

Now, I wonder if I can work out a way to do this whole horcrux thing, just without the human sacrifice. I hope Voldemort kept notes. Do brainstemless clones work, magically aged with a canon potion? What about people on their deathbeds, hooked up to machines and in horrible agony? If it is an emotional thing again: what if I became hardcore vegan, and made myself feel really, really bad about killing a cow?

Point is, you still have volition and a powerbase to ransack before they figure out anything is wrong. Not that hard.
