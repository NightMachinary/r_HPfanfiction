Where's the challenge? You just stop being evil. Just...stop.

/Worst/ case, you are a shade between 1982 and 1991. Send a nicely worded note to Dumbledore, and done. No wizarding war needed. Dumbledore let a wizard /literally worse than Hitler/ get away with his crimes for at least a decade. He thinks you are insane, but if you start doing stuff differently, genuinely differently, his own moral code won't let him do anything less than give you a second chance. Once you prove you are quite literally not the same person, he will have no choice but to excuse Voldemort's past excesses.

Tell Dumbledore exactly what's going on and ask to use his friend's philosopher's stone to get a body again. Help him destroy your horcruxes, if that's going to be an issue, and give him an idea that maybe allowing Harry to be kept in a cupboard isn't a great way to handle things. Then start chewing apart the pure-blood bloc in the magical government.

Hell, if you swing it right, you can be "Tom Riddle" again, upstanding citizen. Hardly "nightmare difficultly mode".
