  Darkness. I guess I must have lost power... wait, why cant I feel my arms. I cant feel anything. NOT GOOD! Am I dead? ...well at least I can't hyperventilate right now... Wait, I feel... hungry? Great. I can't move, cant see, cant feel anything, but I'm hungry. What deity did I piss off? LIGHT! I see light. Huh... it kind of looks like a piece of glowing paper, that's wierd. /Dear Tom, I'm starting to freak out. I think I'm losing my mind. I woke up covered in blood and can't remember the last few hours. -Ginny/ ...well... bugger!
