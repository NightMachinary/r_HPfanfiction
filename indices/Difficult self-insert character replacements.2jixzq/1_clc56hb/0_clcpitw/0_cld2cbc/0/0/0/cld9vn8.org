Canon Dumbledore almost never takes action. This means it is usually safe to talk to him, perhaps at a remove like owl post. I'm sure he'd rather allow someone he thinks might be Tom Riddle's horcrux clone attend Hogwarts (as he did a professor in a similar situation) then take action to investigate the situation for possible threats.

Ficverse stuff is a crapshoot, obviously.
