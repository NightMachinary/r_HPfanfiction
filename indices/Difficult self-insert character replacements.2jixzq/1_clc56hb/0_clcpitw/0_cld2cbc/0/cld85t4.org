I think not dealing with Dumbledore or Voldemort directly is very important. That Voldemort doesn't appear to have ever used confidence tricks or mind games with Dumbledore in canon means you at least have a chance to talk to him about the situation.

You can always come up with a ficverse that is bad for a situation, but I think that is easy to sus out with Ginny's help and a trip to a book store.
