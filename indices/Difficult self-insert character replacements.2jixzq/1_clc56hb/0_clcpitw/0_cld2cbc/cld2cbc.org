What you described here is pretty much my initial plan in my head when I posited the what if to myself.

Much later, I wondered how difficult it would be to "eat" the other horcruxes starting with the one in harry, or if simply possessing Wormtail and forcing him to confess might work. How much 'Soul-Juice' is in Harry's scar? If I have access to Riddle's memories up until the murder of Myrtle, can I later memories from incorporating later horcruxes. Do I even want to remember Voldemort's rise to power from his own POV? I'm rather attached to my own sanity after all.

In my mind it all boils down to the part where Dumbledore takes one look at you and then the world goes black, roll the credits. How do you convince him that you're on the up and up while looking like Riddle? A Riddle who's apparent age and very existence confirms that Voldemort had horcruxes. And thats ignoring that you can't actually know if you're in the canon verse where he's iffy at best or one of the fic-verses where he (or Snape, the Weasleys, etc) may be worse than Moldyshorts in terms of your own survival. Thankfully Voldemort isn't INSIDE the castle second year.
