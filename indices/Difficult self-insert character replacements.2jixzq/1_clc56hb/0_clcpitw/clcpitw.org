Well, like I said in response to being Voldemort: Why not just stop being evil?

You just need x amount of soul juice, so simply stop taking over Ginny (even if you knew how) and get lots of people to write in your diary in secret.

It took about nine months to take over Ginny in canon, and that was with weeks where she refused to write or threw you away. Just ask her to keep writing and that it'll all work out okay. Then in a few days, ask Ginny to loan you to Hermione to help figure things out.

Tell Hermione you woke up stuck in a book, are afraid magical researchers would take you apart and kill you to find out how you work, and that you need (at that point) about four more person-months of people's emotional energy to escape.

Hermione will have you out in a week, tops. Harry is your safety net: he won't let you be confiscated or left trapped in a small place, with no hope of escape. And Ron will like your promises of knowledge and power too much to tattle to his brothers or other adults.

Now you're out, in the body of a dashingly handsome sixteen year old with absurd magical abilities, and have a future history of the magical world in your head. Time to hunt some horcruxes.

Getting matriculated back into Hogwarts is a good idea, if only for the hot, barely-legal Seventh Year co-eds. Rawr.
