OOOOH. The sphinx one could combine nicely with a time loop. The catch being that you're ONLY allowed to ask him a riddle. What riddle can you posit to Harry, who's not fantastic at solving them to begin with, that by its nature or answer, leads Harry to a better path? I picture the later loops being Harry finds a sphinx lying on the ground with its paws over its face "Just move along kid, I can't deal with this today, I'll see you next loop."
