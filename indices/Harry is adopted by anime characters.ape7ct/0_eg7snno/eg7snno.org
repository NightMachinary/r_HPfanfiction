Not 100% fitting maybe, as Harry doesn't actually interact with the anime cast too much after a few chapters, but there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12355543/1/One-Punch-Wizard][One Punch Wizard]] linkffn(12355543) which is a story where Harry is adopted by Saitama. It's a bit on the cracky side, so one probably shouldn't take it too serious, and it's still ongoing, but I kind of like it, so it might be worse a look. :)

Could you perhaps share the fics you mentioned though? Just to make them a bit easier to find. :p
