Harry is adopted by Sir Integra of Hellsing in linkffn(Death's Visage by Black-Raven3). Unfinished, but good as far as it went.

Linkffn(Bug Boy by Mrs. Insane One) is a Naruto cross that has Harry adopted by Shibi Aburame. My main complaint with this one is that Harry isn't "Harry."

Linkffn(The Potter Attraction by Pax Humana) is another Naruto cross that has Naruto and his harem adopt Harry. It's a sequel to Chunin Examination Day, which is where Naruto acquires his harem and abilities.

Harry gets sort-of (IIRC) adopted by Ryouga Hibiki of Ranma 1/2 in linkffn(Harry Hibiki and the Philosopher's Stone).

And, not really an adoption, but in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ultimate Force by DarkKing666), the Norns become Lily's cousins and take Harry from the Dursleys to put the prophecy back on track.
