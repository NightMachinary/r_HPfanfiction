Sorry, I don't want to be a ride, but I don't understand this mentality with them or against them. Is it so difficult to conceive that for a system to change, it must have decent people in the system? Or would you prefer that the entire system be completely demolished and start from scratch?

Furthermore, Harry doesn't "hate the system", he hates corrupt people. On the other hand, Mr. Weasley, Moody, Tonks and Dumbledore are part of the system and Harry has no problem with that.
