Well, he got to start somewhere.

According to JKR, he made it to Head Auror as early as 2007, and that's a top Ministry position. Rufus Scrimgeour was Head Auror before becoming the Minister.

I always consider the British Wizarding Government a hell lot worse than the US/UK Government, and if they can thrive in that cutthroat snake pit, they would even eat Frank Underwood for breakfast.

I don't think they would just become average corrupt politicians, but really insidious villains with an almost perfect public image (model families, modest living). They run on great sounding platforms (equality, justice, love, peace, and prosperity), have hordes of hardcore followers (DA, Quidditch fans, Hogwarts graduates, werewolves, fanboys/girls), controlled a loyal military (the DMLE), become filthy rich (confiscated Death Eater wealth, memory charmed Muggles, Weasley owned businesses, royalties from their 'heroic deeds'), dominate the public media (Ginny is the real force behind The Daily Prophet, Luna owns the next largest publication), are utterly ruthless to their enemies (real and perceived), and most importantly, believe what they are doing is right and protect their 'loved ones'.

Threats to their power base would have unfortunate accidents or die in embarrassing ways (what? he had a heart attack while engaging in autoerotic asphyxiation? oh dear...), or even accidentally blow themselves up while attempting dark rituals. People who oppose them politically would have their positions undercut through media and rumors. Some pain in the ass would be taken care of by street violence, such as an angry mob demanding the head of that 'Slanderous Rita'. Meanwhile, Hermione would be the calm, thoughtful, considerate leader who seems really nice, while Harry would be the brave, energetic, and powerful hero who keeps everyone safe.

I can very well imagine the following conversation: "Yes, it really is necessary, and I prepared this 400 page document that makes it all clear, so you go read it and come back if there's anything you don't understand, and we'll have a lovely talk about it." (person leaves) "Harry, I want that arse investigated so hard it scours his floors. Find something, and if you can't find something, make something up. Perhaps plant some naughty ideas in his mind first."

And none of the above violates what JKR has said about postwar.
