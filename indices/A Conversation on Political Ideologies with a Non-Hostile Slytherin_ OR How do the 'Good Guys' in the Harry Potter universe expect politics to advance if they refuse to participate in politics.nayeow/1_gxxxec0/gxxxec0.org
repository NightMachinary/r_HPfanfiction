Tracey got detention with the wrong Gryffindor. I wonder how this conversation would have gone had it been Hermione there.

*Edit:* This is /not/ a criticism of the story. I think it works very well. It just struck me as amusing that had Tracey started the same conversation with Hermione, she might have gotten more than she bargained for.
