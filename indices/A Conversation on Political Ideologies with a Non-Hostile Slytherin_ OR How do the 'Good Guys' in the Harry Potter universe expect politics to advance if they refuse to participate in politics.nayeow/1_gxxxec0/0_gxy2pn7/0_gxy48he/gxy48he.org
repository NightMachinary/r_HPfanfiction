I had asked myself that exact question; and my sense is that it would depend on when the conversation took place. Hermione got /a lot/ better at empathy and listening in her later years.

"If I say 'yes', are you going to start a revolution, Granger?"

"... Maybe. If, purely hypothetically, I did, will you join?"

"... Maybe."
