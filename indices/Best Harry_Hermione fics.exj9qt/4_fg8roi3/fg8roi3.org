Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700]]

Pretty much my unreserved req for this pairing. Hermione magically messed with things that results in her name coming out of the goblet. Feels very cannonish.

I also enjoyed Escape ([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11916243/1/]]), YMMV though. I know some of the tropes in it can turn people off.

For a background H/Hr relationship I would req Stages of Hope (where H/Hr are ambigiously together in misery due to their loves dying in the war And they are broken), and A little child shall lead them (Where H/Hr relationship is a motivation for Hermione, but is not seen in the fic itself. Also best closing line.)
