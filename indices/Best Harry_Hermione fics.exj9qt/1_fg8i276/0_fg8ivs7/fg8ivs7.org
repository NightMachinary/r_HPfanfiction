Oh, thanks! I didn't even know that existed. As for your questions:

1. I prefer romance to not be the focus, actually, but I can deal with it if it is.
2. No Evil!Harry/Hermione, no “Voldemort Wins” AUs, no non-magic AUs, and no “not like other girls” tropes, and no sad endings, I can't stand those.
3. Fantasy/Adventure. Basically anything but sci-fi or straight up comedy.
4. Preferably not, but if the plot is good enough I can deal with it.
5. WIPs are fine as long as they aren't abandoned.
