Curious, if Hermione never becomes friends with Harry and Ron, how does the author handle Harry surviving to the end of the year without the part she played in events? Cause to be honest, if Hermione is off doing her own thing and not getting involved in the plot, Harry would either have to smarten up fast and start taking learning magic seriously or I don't see him making it through to the final battle with only Ron for support.
