This is like deamus fic, except Seamus is a trans male character and it is all 7 years summed up.

Not too long (50,000ish), shows development of their characters a small bit of trio bashing not much (it's a side comment but still).

Really good easy read, sweet and I love seamus' character and his friendship with lavender and pavarti. Bit of transphobia towards seamus. Worth reading. :)
