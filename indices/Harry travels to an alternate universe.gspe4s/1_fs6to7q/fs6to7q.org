This is one of my favourite kind of stories. I have a few saved on my pinboard.

Which you can view here - [[https://pinboard.in/u:hellohexagon/t:alternateworld/]]

I don't think he actually fights Voldemort in all of them but usually the assumption he will is there. Most are incomplete but still worth a read.
