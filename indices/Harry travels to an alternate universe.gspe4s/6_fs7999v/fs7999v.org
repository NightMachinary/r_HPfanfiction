I can't remember the title off the top of my head (will look it up when im back on my phone), but he manages to resist veritaserum (i think), which apparently ha serious consequences in this fic and thus ends up in a universe where his parents are alive, he's nowhere to be found, and he's got two younger sisters. He chooses the pseudonym of Chris Collins. Pretty good, but may be abandoned.
