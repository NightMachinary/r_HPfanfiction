I certainly agree with those of you who've said that the opening chapter is one of the best around. It really is. It grabs the reader instantly and brings them right into the story.

After that though, I got a bit bored. The action scenes were pretty good but were pretty much interchangeable.The joke about Harry's name being Bond got a bit old, although I agree with [[/u/cryptologicalMystic]] that the "No Mister Bond, I expect you to die" line was well done.

I think the problem was that it's pretty much an obvious plot: there was always going to be a showdown between Tom and Harry in which one died. After a while I just wanted the story to get on with it.

All in all it was a story worth reading but I doubt I'll ever go back to it.
