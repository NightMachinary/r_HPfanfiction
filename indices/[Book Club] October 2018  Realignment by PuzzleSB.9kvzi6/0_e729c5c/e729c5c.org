There is so much to say about this fic for me. So I'll break it into a pros and cons list:

*Pros:*

- The magic and action sequences in this story are some of the most visceral and thrilling I have come across. From beginning to end, it grips you and tries to put everything it has to display on the table.
- One of the /best/ opening scenes/chapters in any fic I have ever come across. Harry's arrival, and seeing it not through the eyes of one of the powerful wizards but Tom Riddle himself, sets up a brilliant time-travel story that is only hinted at in the background.
- Never spends the whole time explaining every little detail of the world. Not every spell or worldbuilding piece or event needs detailed extrapolation. Thats what makes magic...well....magical. Saying more with less, something too many authors seem to fail to understand.
- Tom Riddle in this fic is the sole POV, a rarity honestly for 1st person limited HP fics. Whats more, his characterization is actually pretty believable. He's no saint - Tom wants power and strength. What changes is that he sees that his previous intimations of power pale in comparison to what Harry, Dumbledore, and later Grindelwald are capable of exhibiting. That is the crucial change, along with Dumbledore's partial mentorship. Not only that, but the idea of how Tom learns new magic, by emulating Harry's spells and techniques, is a clever twist on the Horcrux storyline, though a bit hard to explain.
- Tom and Dumbledore's mentorship is a highlight as well. Dumbledore isn't overbearing, he merely wants to keep Tom alive and maybe steer him away from his own past mistakes. Tom is also pretty hesitant, but keeps around both for his safety and the admiration for his teachers abilities with magic. In short, their motivations are very believable within the contexts of the story (at least until the end).
- Goblins are assholes. 'Nuff said.
- The discussions on Old Magic being inferior were rather refreshing compared to all the dumb "family magic" fics that are just short cuts to overpowering characters.
- The clever twist in the final battle: Tom Riddle = The Boy-Who-Lived
- No one ever bothers to reveal the time-travel stuff to the world, something which is shockingly rare in almost every fandom I have read tt fics in. Kudos.

*Cons:*

- The writing in this story, from a technical standpoint at least, is well above 95% of fics I have encountered. That said, just going back through the first chapter I can find slight errors and mistakes (mostly grammatical). It reads (and I can semi-confirm this from the earlier versions) like PuzzleSB was writing in a rush, trying to get as much out in a single setting as possible.
- The story is a bit piecemeal in its overall plot (if you can call it that). Boiled down, the author basically wanted to write that beginning scene, then didn't have a huge deal planned past that. The following is more or less a series of interspersed fight scenes as the author vacillated from one idea to the next. In a certain way that is enjoyable, in that guessing the future is nigh impossible for a reader, but on the other hand it loses the brilliance that a well-structured story can bring out.
- The ending. Having seen how this actually played out, as well as the authors comments on other forums like SB, I can say that basically he was running out of steam by the DoM scenes. The final chapter was essentially a result of Puzzle getting tired of the fic and just wanting it to have an end and be done with it. The result is less than spectacular, but I do admit I rather like it when things are not all wrapped up with a nice bow and explained how this person and that person lived there lives out pointlessly.

Summary:

This story is basically a magical version of Terminator 2. Replace Tom Riddle with John Connor, Harry with the T-1000, and Dumbledore with the T-800, and that about sums up a lot of this story (you could also compare it to Fate/Unlimited Blade Works but that is a whole nother can of worms). As a bonus, Gellert Grindelwald is also the T-X in this version, with Harry even getting in a one-liner at the end.

Overall: 4.5/5, lowered from 5/5 due mainly to the ending.
