I'm not arguing how the final product came out. It's just I have the authors actual words to attest to those view points. They started the fic with really only the first scene and just ran with things from new idea. That is their own statement.

When writing, your ideas change and shift into something else, sometimes in a direction you never really intended. This fic is interesting in that Puzzle really had no idea how they wanted to end this initially, and kind of threw darts at the board to keep the plot moving and start more fights. It's both a strength and weakness of the overall story, from where I stand.

It works, it just wasn't as intentional as it comes across to a lot of people. Kind of like how people assume Rowling had as much planned as she said, when she really just changed parts later in the series to explain earlier elements of the series.
