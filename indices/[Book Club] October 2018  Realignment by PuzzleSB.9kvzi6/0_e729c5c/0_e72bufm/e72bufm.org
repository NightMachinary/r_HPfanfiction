  The story is a bit piecemeal in its overall plot (if you can call it that). Boiled down, the author basically wanted to write that beginning scene, then didn't have a huge deal planned past that. The following is more or less a series of interspersed fight scenes as the author vacillated from one idea to the next. In a certain way that is enjoyable, in that guessing the future is nigh impossible for a reader, but on the other hand it loses the brilliance that a well-structured story can bring out.

I thought that the off-the-wall style plot might be intentional. For one thing it underlines how Riddle is continually out of his depth throughout the story, barely able to get his bearings before circumstances change beyond his control. Each new experience humbles him, taking his ego down a peg just when he is starting to feel self-satisfied.

The plot has a bit of the "hero's journey", Terry Gilliam style. Riddle is swept into a zany adventure of character growth, quite against his will. The people in control (Dumbledore, Grindelwald) carry Tom along from scene to scene a bit like the under-powered protagonists in /Time Bandits/ or /The Adventures of Baron von Munchhausen/. Overall, I think the absurdity is intentional.

  The ending.

If the absurdity is intentional, then the ending is the capstone that put's Tom's heroic journey in perspective. You have these three Gryffindors acting ludicrously heroic and larger than life, and then Tom seizes his One True Moment To Shine in pure Slytherin fashion. The contrast between Gryffindor "honor" and Slytherin pragmatism is deliciously ironic.

In my opinion, Tom's final conversation with Dumbledore was a perfect way to end the story because it shows what Tom has learned from the journey and what Dumbledore has learned about Tom (to his chagrin). Things seem to have reset to the way they were when the fic started, but with the main characters looking at their lives in a new light; a circle typical of "heroic journey" stories.
