I'm a big fan of this fic. The action sequences are tightly written and visceral; the author nailed Dumbledore and Riddle's interactions; the setting and the magic feels similar to canon, but a bit more raw and knotty, just how I like it.

And unlike some, I quite liked the ending. The fic was an action movie, not a bildungsroman. Riddle and Dumbledore were never going to iron their issues out 100%, and it was always going to end with only one of Dumbledore, Grindelwald or Bond standing. The twists in the final scene were clever (if a little hard to follow at times) and thematically fitting.

Criticisms:

- That first scene is a grammatical trainwreck. I recommended it to a friend and they couldn't get past the first chapter because of it.

- The Bond/dream sequences are completely unnecessary and drag down the fic. Their only seeming purpose is to show the connection between Bond and Riddle.

But yeah, still a solid 4/5. One of the best I've read.
