  Or sneak in and kill Tom from ambush.

That particular plan would have been more risky because of the way the Hogwarts wards function. Dumbledore gave some exposition in chapter 3:

  "Why do you think he attacked head on? He probably could have sneaked in."

  Dumbledore was silent for a moment, looking around as if to ensure he hadn't missed anything fixing the room. "Hogwarts is said to be the safest place in Britain, that's true up until a point. The wards around the castle were not erected by fools and every Headmaster has left his mark. Most made them better, at least three weakened them unintentionally, and a surprising number allowed them to be lowered in Quidditch point shaving schemes."

  His wand moved again and the rude table in the corner straightened with carved ivy growing up the legs as the scrapes and engravings of bored students were erased from the top. "However they are old magic at their heart. You grew up in the muggle world and are a skilled enough student that you think of magic logically. It's a rare talent in the magical world precisely because the fairy tales you dismissed do have some truth. Sleeping Beauty, Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White, they all feature powerful magic falling to a simple illogical condition. The wards are similar, anyone hostile to the students will be frustrated. If your attacker had attempted to sneak in, his schemes would be thwarted, his plans foiled. In contrast his direct attack didn't run against the older magic, he became the knight slashing through the thorns if you will."

  "So the wards only work against treachery?" Tom had noticed the lack of analytical thought before and had used it to his benefit. Realizing that there might have been a reason for the purebloods' occasional idiocy was a rude surprise.

  "Oh not at all, they are immensely powerful in all senses that you can think of and regularly updated, I just think the attacker chose to brave the more conventional ones rather than meddle with old magic. He did have some small success in that manner."
