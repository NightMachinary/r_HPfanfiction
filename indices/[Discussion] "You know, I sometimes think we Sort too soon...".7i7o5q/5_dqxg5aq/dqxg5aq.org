Harry I could see being re sorted into Hufflepuff. While Slytherin is what a lot of people see him as considering what the Sorting Hat said before, his loyalty is in my opinion what defines him.

I could see Percy and Hermione being in Slytherin for different reasons. Hermione wants equality as seen constantly through out the books, with the house elves as well as with Muggleborns. If a Muggleborn was sorted into Slytherin it would make Slytherins question if what they thought was actually right.

While Percy is a pretty ambitious person, he wants to be noticed by others and his desire to do that could get him re sorted into Slytherin.

Neville I could see either in Gryffindor or re sorted into Hufflepuff. He's had moments that show he belonged in Gryffindor, especially when the Death Eaters took over Hogwarts. But perhaps having a head of house that would have been more thoughtful to Neville might make him become more sure of himself sooner if he had been re sorted into Hufflepuff.

Ron I see as Gryffindor. Draco I see as Slytherin.

Luna I could see as a potential Gryffindor. Believing in things no one else does, and standing up for yourself and others in intense situations could be considered quite brave.
