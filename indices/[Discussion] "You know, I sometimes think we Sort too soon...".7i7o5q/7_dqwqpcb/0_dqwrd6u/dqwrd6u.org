You know, I've seen this a lot, but other than Chess, where is he a good Strategist? He's not even a regional champion or anything, he's just /good/ at chess. I might be forgetting stuff though.

(One of my brothers was regional champ some years ago, and he's... lets say less than brilliant, so I have that as a frame for Ron's character)
