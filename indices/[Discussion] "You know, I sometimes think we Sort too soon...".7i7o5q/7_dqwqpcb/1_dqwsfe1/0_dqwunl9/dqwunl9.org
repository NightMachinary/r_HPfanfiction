Same reason as canon --- she's /good/ at academics, but it doesn't define her core /values/ or personality, which is what the Sorting is all about. Compare, if you will, Peter Pettigrew, who didn't have an ounce of courage in his whole body but on an intellectual level /valued/ bravery and heroics and /wanted/ to be brave. Or compare Dumbledore who constantly Slytherined around with his schemes, but in the end wished to do good rather than further his own ambitions through this cunning.
