There was a fanfiction that did do that, and I found that I partially agreed with some of their placements.

Hermione, had the blood status rules for being accepted into it lifted, would have been a Slytherin. She had to be cunning and ambitious. I feel like she embodied a little of every house, but her ambition for fixing the Wizarding World wins me over her to Slytherin. If we factor in her cunning in her 2nd year (Polyjuice and cupcaking Crabbe and Goyle), and her 4th year (Rita Skeeter), she'd definitely make the cut.

Harry could be a Hufflepuff. While no doubt he is brave as a Gryffindor, I feel his loyalty is what defined him, especially in the later books. Loyalty to his friends, that he brought Cedric Diggory's body back, to Dumbledore, instead of etting Aberforth convince him otherwise, hell, to a world that so easily turned against the Boy-Who-Lived. He was loyal to them even though they'd been targeting him since he was 14.

Ron Weasley would have stayed in Gryffindor. Abandoning his friends would have negated his Hufflepuffity, and he isn't cunning enough, I feel, to be in Slytherin. One could make a case for Ravenclaw, because his strategic abilities are amazing, but he is not a studious person, so his bravery and recklessness would keep him with the lions.

Percy Weasley would have been with Hermione, for very different reasons. His self preservation is very high, and it wasn't until at the brink of conflict resolution that he turns to the correct side.

Neville would have stayed or gone with Harry. That's ambiguous, but if we factor in his 7th year, I feel like he would stay in Gryffindor.

Luna could stay or go with Harry. She went to Azkaban for supporting him. She fought with him. But she's a rare kind of smart too.

Draco Malfoy would stay where he is. He's not brave, he's not loyal, and while he is smart, his cunning and self preservation win out.

I could see Gregory Goyle in Hufflepuff for putting up with Malfoy's crap all those years, and following him and whatnot.
