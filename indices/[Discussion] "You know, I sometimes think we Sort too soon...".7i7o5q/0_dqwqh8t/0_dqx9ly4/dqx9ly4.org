That's what I think, too. You figure they start in the 6th-grade-age equivalent here in the US, so common class for 6th-7th and sort in maybe 8th or 9th equivalent. Maybe sort of like the first couple of years are your "liberal arts" portion and then the later years you focus on more specific things.
