I know many others will disagree with me but here are my thoughts:

Hermione: She would be resorted into Ravenclaw. She is brave and loyal, but Hermione seeks knowledge for its own sake and has a hard time disregarding the words she finds in books. Her default actions always seem to lend her as a Ravenclaw.

Percy Weasley: He should have been a Slytherin. Percy was ambitious. He wasn't evil, he just wanted to gain a certain respect for himself and raise his social standing. I often wonder what kind of change Percy could have had on his family in regards to Slytherins.

Remus Lupin: Should have been a Hufflepuff. Sirius comes back and explains about Peter and Remus is just on board? He's super loyal and should have been sorted as such. Just to add: Tonks was a 'Puff and it didn't mean that she wasn't also brave.
