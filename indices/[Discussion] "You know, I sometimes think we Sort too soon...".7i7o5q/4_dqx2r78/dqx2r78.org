I've always liked to envision a scene where the Sorting Hats finally has enough and complains about how it has had to sort people for years to protect them as much as they can from other students and from their own families because no one else will and then demands the staff start actually caring about their students and starts calling our resorts. Moving Crabbe and Goyle to Hufflepuff for their loyalty to Malloy. Moving Hermione and Percy to Slytherin for their ambition etc.

I feel that even just with some of the characters we know details about that this fits. Crabbe and Goyle are incredibly loyal but their death eater fathers would probably not have taken a Hufflepuff sorting very well. Hermione and Percy are both incredibly ambitious but Slytherin would have chewed them up for being a mud blood and a blood traitor.
