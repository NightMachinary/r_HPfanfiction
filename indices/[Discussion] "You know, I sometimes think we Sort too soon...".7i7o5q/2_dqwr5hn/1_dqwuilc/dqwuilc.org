And if we take the Sorting Hat for an idiot. It's pretty clear from how equal the numbers of each House are each year that he keeps in mind how many he's already Sorted into each house and tips the balance one way or another to try and get a decently spread-out year in the end. So if he noticed /everyone/ he was Sorting went to Slytherin, he'd realize something was amiss, demand we start over, and he'd leave Slytherin for the only /really, really/ ambitious while looking at secondary characteristics to Sort the others.
