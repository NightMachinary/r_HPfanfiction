It's kind of a trope at this point, but I think nearly every student would get re-sorted into Slytherin once they're age 15 or so. They're starting to become adults, they kind of know who they are and what they want to do. /Everyone/ has some sort of ambition, and that is often the driving factor in a lot of decisions they make.

This is really only if we take house ideologies at face value though.
