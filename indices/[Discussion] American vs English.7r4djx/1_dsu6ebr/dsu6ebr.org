The thing is, making a story British is not that difficult. Plug-ins like Grammarly take care of the spelling while a little research (Google) takes care of the biggest issues like geography and basic legal framework.

I'm not expecting that every author looks up the history of medieval Europe because they think that the magical population would not care about muggle borders or spent an hour going through Wikipedia to figure out which plane was used for Heathrow - > Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in 1995. On the other hand, using Google Maps to see that it would be difficult for Harry to walk from Privet Drive to Kings Cross should be feasible for everyone.
