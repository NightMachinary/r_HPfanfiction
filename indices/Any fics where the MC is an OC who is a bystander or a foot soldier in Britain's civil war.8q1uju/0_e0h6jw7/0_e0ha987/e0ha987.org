Ah, I meant the civil war featured in canon with Voldemort. I was thinking of a story through the eyes of somebody like Arthur Weasley, somebody who is very much at risk of some gruesome shit but they don't really have the option to run away and look for Voldemort's Soul Toys so they have to stick around and make do somehow.
