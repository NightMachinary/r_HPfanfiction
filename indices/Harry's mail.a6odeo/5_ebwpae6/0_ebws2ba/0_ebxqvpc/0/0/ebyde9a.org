They knew he was still alive after Voldemort.

My point is that it may not be common knowledge what exactly happened *after that*. I'd bet cash money that when Harry was a little boy there were at least a dozen really bonkers and contradictory rumours about where he was and what he was doing.

He'd died when he was three because Death Eaters had poisoned him. He was with Muggles, but they'd drowned him on a holiday to Blackpool. Dumbledore had stashed him away in Australia or something. He was being raised by the centaurs, or the goblins, or by something else not human.

The wizarding world seems quite susceptible to insane conspiracy theories.

A few people (like Daedalus Diggle) might find him...but you'll note that the few wizards he runs into before he turns eleven are all proved later on to be members of the Order or otherwise Dumbledore's mates, who Dumbledore could then ask not to blab about it.
