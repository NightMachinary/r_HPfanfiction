If you could just send a letter to anyone and have it always get there, the Aurors would catch Death Eaters or Sirius within about three days. They'd have been able to send a letter to the terrifying escaped convict Sirius Black, or to Bellatrix the Death Eater, and then just follow the owl. The Death Eaters watching the Weasley family should have been able to follow any mail they sent and kill all their friends.

Since that didn't happen...I'd figure that *normally* an address matters. Harry's Hogwarts letter was certainly addressed exceptionally carefully.

Maybe Hedwig was just a super bloody smart owl?
