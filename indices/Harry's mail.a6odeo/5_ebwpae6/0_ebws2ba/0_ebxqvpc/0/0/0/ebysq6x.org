I agree that there were probably a lot of silly rumours and funny stories. I don't get why that should stop every single person from sending him fan mail. A letter could reach Harry in each of the situations you described where he isn't dead. (And lots of people write fan mail to celebrities never knowing if it will ever reach them or if they'll actually read it...) To me, it seems more likely that there is some anti-fan-owl charm or something similar, than nobody ever even trying to send a letter to Harry Potter because they didn't know for sure where he lived - especially in a world where it is normal to be able to send letters to people without knowing where they are.
