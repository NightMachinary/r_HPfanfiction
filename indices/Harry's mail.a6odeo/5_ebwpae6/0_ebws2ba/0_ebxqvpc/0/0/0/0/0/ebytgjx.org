Ron's owl Pig found him too, I think. And the school owls when they couldn't use Hedwig because she was too noticeable. Maybe you can't follow post owls? They do seem to have a mind of their own - maybe they just wouldn't deliver the letter as long as they were followed. But it's all guesswork of course. Just seems to me to fit better within canon than Hedwig (and the other owls we see doing similar stuff) being an exception. There are muggle-repellent charms and notice-me-not spells and stuff. Could be that people could cast anti-Auror-mail spells and anti-fan-mail spells and anti-tracked-owl spells or something ;)
