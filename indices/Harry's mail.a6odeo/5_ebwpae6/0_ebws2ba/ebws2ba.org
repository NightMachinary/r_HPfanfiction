Owls don't seem to need an address to deliver letters though. In GoF Hedwig finds Sirius when he's in hiding, and Harry has no idea where he is. He never tells Hedwig any other addresses either, just to take it to Ron or Hermione etc and that even works when they are at Grimmauld Place - which they couldn't have told him about as it was under the Fidelius at the time...
