I've always rationalised it that the vast majority of the wizarding world simply didn't know where he was to send him anything.

There are three people active in the wizarding world who *definitely* know that Harry Potter went to Privet Drive before his eleventh birthday. Dumbledore is one, but he's not telling anyone if he can help it. Hagrid delivered baby Harry to the doorstep, but if Dumbledore says he can't talk about that then loyalty will mean that he never does. McGonagall watched the Dursleys before Harry got there, but again...even if she personally has her doubts that this is good for him, she'll trust Dumbledore's judgement.
