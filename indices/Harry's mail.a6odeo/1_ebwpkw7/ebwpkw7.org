Honestly, it makes a good deal of sense that fan mail is somehow held in trust for Harry - I'm not sure what the protections would be exactly, but there must be some kind of re-routing service for fan mail within the wizarding world, or your average celebrity like Gilderoy Lockhart or Myron Wagtail probably wouldn't be able to move what for the torrent of owls and other mail birds surrounding them. Moreover, Harry was a literal baby, and I imagine there's probably some sort of code for how young a child can be before they're legally allowed to receive post from an owl, this likely to prevent against kids getting hold of their parents' owl order catalogues.

As a young child, I expect that Dumbledore saying, "hey, no one should send this child fanmail because like, he's a child," probably would have been respected by a good deal of people, even if not like, every single person.

From what we see, a lot of the people who do send him post know him well enough to know his address or which dormitory he'd be in Hogwarts, and maybe that's part of the thing behind being able to send your post through, if it's a vague intent thing - if you already know that about him, it's possible the filter would let you through based on that. I'm not sure how postal magic works exactly, but I imagine there is /some/ sort of protection on the letters that Harry can receive, where he'd only get the stuff from people on an "approved" list of writers, probably based on family, and the Hogwarts student and staff list. While Harry isn't aware of this re-routing service, I would understand why it wouldn't come up in the plot - Dumbledore wouldn't want to mention it and would likely be in charge of managing it as Harry's magical guardian, and by the time he died, stakes were a lot higher, and Harry wasn't yet of age in order to take command of his own trust.

When it comes to the Prophet article, it's perfectly possible that in agreeing to do the interview, he opted in for some temporary waiver of that re-routing service, meaning that people would be able to respond directly to him - I wouldn't be surprised if Skeeter had that kind of thing locked down, just to add to the incendiary nature of the article. It's also possible that because he opted into a binding magical contract with the Goblet of Fire, which saw him as an adult, that the protections for a minor were temporarily lifted, because the magic was a little bamboozled by the contradiction, and then Dumbledore put it right again once the tournament was over.

I don't really know that it's necessarily like, an evil Dumbledore thing in this case - I think a lot of his decisions were pretty questionable, but as a child, it'd probably be horrible to receive a lot of fanmail, especially once Harry was like, fourteen and over, from which he'd probably get gross offers from various witches and wizards offering to bang him once he was legal - or before, because it's not being a sexual predator if they're a celebrity, I guess - on top of random death threats for no reason.

Even the genuinely positive fanmail would probably be a lot for him to take.

This is one where we kind of fill in the gaps, to be honest - I don't imagine JKR would have said much about it even if she had thought of it, just because it's not relevant to the plot.
