My headcanon is that owl mail tends to work best with people you've personally met, and thus most people wouldn't be able to send Harry letters. This doesn't really hold up to canon - it would mean Lockhart's fans would need another method of contacting him (though, then again, having hundreds of owls visit each day would be a problem by itself, so maybe that would be necessary anyway).

I rationalize it by saying that sufficiently advanced wizards can put up some sort of magical beacon that allows owls to find them. This explains why every good and evil person seeking someone didn't just send them a letter and follow the owl, as well.
