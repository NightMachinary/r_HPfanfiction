His getting on the Quidditch team as the youngest seeker within a century would probably warrant an article, possibly even every single one of his Quidditch wins.

The Dementors invading Hogwarts during the match in PoA would probably also make the news and Harry falling off his broom would be a key part of those events even without his celebrity status.

The events towards the end of Book 1 and 2 and his involvement in them would probably also make the news. I doubt Dumbledore would be able to completely suppress the knowledge of that getting out after giving Harry and his friends 150 house points in front of the entire school.
