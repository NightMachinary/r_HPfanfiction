All things considered there's no definitive answer. We know that he was able to receive his Hogwarts letter at 10, then after that he was able to receive mail from his friends. I'm sure Dumbledore could and would stop fan mail from going to the Dursleys (either to keep them compliant so they would be more willing to house Harry, or for his own nefarious reasons if you're into that). But that doesn't explain why he never got them later, or after he started going to Hogwarts.
