While this is not the perfect reason but it could be justified by Harry's popularity levels maybe. When Harry survived Voldemort's curse, he was just a baby. I doubt people would send mail to a one/two year old (sorry I forget the exact age Harry was). Even if they did, I do like the idea of Dumbledore blocking all mail to him until he was a certain age.

After a while, even though the wizarding world was aware of Harry's existence, it is possible that in the attempt to move on from the war and its memories, it got pushed to the back of their minds. IIRC, Harry made an appearance in Daily Prophet in his fourth year when Rita Skeeter interviewed him, which suddenly created a new wave of interest in him, hence the fanmail.
