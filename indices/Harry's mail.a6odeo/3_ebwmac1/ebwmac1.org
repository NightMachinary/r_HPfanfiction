Yeah I guess you can go with the "The goblet broke the mail ward" rationalization if you want. It's probably as good as it gets. Or maybe Dumbledore decided at this point to treat Harry more like an adult now and allow him to handle his own mail?

That Harry would have received all kinds of mail over his years at Hogwarts is clearly something that JKR forgot to include.
