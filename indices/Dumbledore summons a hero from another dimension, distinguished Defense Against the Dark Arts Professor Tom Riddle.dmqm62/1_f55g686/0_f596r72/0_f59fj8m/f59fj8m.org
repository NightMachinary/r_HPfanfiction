Probably just as well. If fragmented souls remained linked between dimensions, then that would imply that the souls of the same person throughout all parallel dimensions and timelines are linked, and therefore that anything that afflicts the soul of one dimension's iteration of that person would affect all iterations (or at least, the ones nearby in a cosmic sense).

Could you imagine that? If all of a sudden wizards and witches and muggles and magical creatures of all kinds started dropping into vegetative states, because of a dementor pandemic a few dimensions over?
