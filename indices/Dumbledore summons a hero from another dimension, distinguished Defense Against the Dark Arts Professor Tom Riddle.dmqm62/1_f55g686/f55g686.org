You know...that gives me an idea. With all the dimension travelling fanfics, what if Voldemort sent one (or more) of his horcruxes to a parallel dimension, to stop it from being destroyed?\\
When the heroes destroy all the horcruxes and confront Voldemort, they find that one of the ones they destroyed was a horcrux belonging to an alternate dimension Voldemort, and /their/ Voldemort's last horcrux is in an alternate dimension itself.

...I wonder if that /has/ been done.
