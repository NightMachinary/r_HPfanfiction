  I get it you are a "ally" but you are just reacting to words rather Than what they mean.

Intention does not override results.

This entire concept treats homosexuality as a joke. It did when that Seinfeld episode aired and it does now.

If the idea was written without the joke in mind and maybe a concrete message - like how people shouldn't assume a person's sexuality - it might be interesting. As a bisexual who's sexuality is constantly assumed to be something it's not, that would be nice to read.

Otherwise, it's a tired, outdated concept.
