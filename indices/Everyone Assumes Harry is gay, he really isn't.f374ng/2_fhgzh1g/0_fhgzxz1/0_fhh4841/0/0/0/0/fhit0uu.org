Could you please address the other things I had to say? I'm interested in hearing why you think I'm impeding a person's freedom of speech for being critical of treating a marginalized group of people as a joke? I'm especially curious since you implied that I shouldn't say what I said, which in turn would impede on my own so-called 'freedom of speech.' Whoever talks first is the only one with the 'right,' then?

And what I mean is that 'freedom of speech' can only be applied in context by the government, but people tend to wave it around as a flag of "I CAN SAY WHATEVER I WANT AND YOU CAN'T SAY SHIT IN RESPONSE" without even knowing the history of where it came from or how it's put to use.

Private organizations can censor whatever they want to on their own platform because they have the right to do so. Private individuals can respond to a person's speech with their own 'freedom of speech.' (There are obviously exceptions to all this - libel, threats of violence, inducing panic, etc.)

As for your examples, a judge will not side with you because you assaulted a person. (I also don't understand why you tried to use this as an example.) And you can sue whoever you want, but in your example, you would have a chance of winning against a state university, but you could very well NOT win against a private college because - again - it's a private institution.
