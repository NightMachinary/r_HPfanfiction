People need to remember that freedom of speech isn't just protection from the government

If someone called me a racial slur to my face, and i hit them for it and they pressed charges, i couldn't say to the judge "he called me -blank- he had it coming" no judge will accept that as reason for you to hit the person.

Just like you can't get in trouble for going to a college and writing a paper on a hot button issue. If you wrote a paper saying something like "i believe only gay men should be allowed to vote" and the college kicked you out for it, you could sue for them impeding your freedom of speech.

Freedom of Speech is more than just protection from the government
