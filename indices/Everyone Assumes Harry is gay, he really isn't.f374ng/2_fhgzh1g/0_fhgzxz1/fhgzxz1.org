You mean the fact that people are presuming his Sexuality with outdated stereotypes?

I get it you are a "ally" but you are just reacting to words rather Than what they mean. Harry isn't a Homophobe, Hell I'm not even saying anyone else is a Homophobe.

They just want to be a Ally, unfortunately they project their own ideas as to what makes a homosexual man on to Harry.

soooooo what exactly is wrong about this? It breaks down stereotypes about what exactly a gayman is or "supposed to be"

Its 2020 AlmaArachnidFriend, time to stop continuing stereotyping people
