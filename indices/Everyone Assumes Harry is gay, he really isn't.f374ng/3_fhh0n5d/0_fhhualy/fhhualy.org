I was going a little less dark and black and more Harry sitting there exasperated as Ginny and Susan Bones (who Harry had invited to the Library to ask out) whisper about setting Harry up with Anthony Goldstein who had recently come out. Ron who is in the Closet gritting his teeth because he's gay but every time they broach the subject with anyone they assume the conversation is about Harry.

Harry alone with Padma talking and joking, he tells himself 'alright time for your first kiss' he leans in and Padma puts a hand on his lips and tells him "It's OK Harry you don't have to hide with me".

But your ideas work too
