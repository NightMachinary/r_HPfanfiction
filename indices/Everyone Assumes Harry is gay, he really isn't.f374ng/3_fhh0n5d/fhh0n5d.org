I in no way support the things below, this is merely my more serious attempt at analyzing a prompt that was indeed maybe mildly funny at most, twenty years ago. I however could not deny the potential that laid within even if I have to claw it out of the shell of sexist, homophobic thought it is hiding within. Many of these interpretations are less than favorable, or even just quite fucked up. The first paragraph explores these. The second paragraph is less controversial and an analysis as to why this might be the case.

* PARAGRAPH I *

A few more serious interpretations of this could have a Harry that grows into being at least mildly homophobic from his bitterness at being completely unable to even hit first base with any girl because they think he is gay, no matter how vocal he is about this. A Marriage Law fic would have Harry as happy to bed a woman at last as any of the sickly old geezers the law was actually meant for. Or he joins Voldemort, and consistently demands as much as a reward for completing tasks as him using the Imperius curse, raping a woman or being ordered to bed Harry are the only ways he can get laid despite not being an ugly troll. Even Crabbe and Goyle get laid easier than Harry. These Harry Potters would not have a gay friend because to him they are what muggleborns are to Pureblood supremacists, the thing that is ruining his life. Obviously all of these are a darker Harry, born from frustration at really, being discriminated himself in a manner more befitting how one would chide a child for mischief.

* PARAGRAPH II *

More empirically, this might be the result of a younger gay Tom Riddle hexing himself (read, his soul) to appear this way to any woman so he was not as consistently harassed by them due to his dashing good looks, except the truly crazy. (like Bellatrix, who somehow completely ignores the curse, leaving Voldemort extremely frustrated and awed at the same time.) When Harry becomes an accidental Horcrux the hex transferred with him, causing the same result. This, however, is a saving grace as it makes it easier for Harry's soul to contain the Horcrux and prevent possession by letting the hex take full and utter effect.
