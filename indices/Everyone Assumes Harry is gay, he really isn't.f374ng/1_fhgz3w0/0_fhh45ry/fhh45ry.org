Welcome to the past! Have you heard of Legally Blonde: The Musical? It just hit theatres! My favourite song from it is /Gay or European./

And if we're talking making fun of trying to figure out if a person's gay or not in theatre productions, there was this one song in Avenue Q (2003) titled /If You Were Gay/ is pretty good.

Oh, and there was this other guy from 2011 who showed me a music video from this new site called “Utoob,” called /If We Were Gay/ by Ninja Sex Party.

What about you? What's happening in 2020? Same sort of thing? Ah. I can't wait.
