In general, you don't need a ton of Worm knowledge to enjoy worm fic. The original work is a very dark take on the superhero genre.

Worm in general is a masterpiece. If you can stand the very real possibility of your favorite character dying gruesomely, and you like really interesting characters, deep, thoughtful worldbuilding, and layered plots with satisfying payoff, you should probably read it. I can't emphasize enough how good it is.

Oh, good comparison:

Worm : Marvel

ASOIAF : Wheel of Time

Except since Worm is finished I can guarantee you that Worm has a satisfying ending.
