That's odd. I've never seen someone describe Taylor as unlikable. Most of the discussion I've seen indicates she's an easy character to relate to. However, she is a character who winds up making difficult moral choices in situations where the 'good' option wouldn't save the day.

Regarding this fic, the author does include some backstory and explanation of the world in the course of the story, but there are other bits of context that get left unsaid. I think you have the right idea about giving the fic a try to see if you enjoy it.
