So nothing is explained? That would be a big difference to all his other crossovers, wouldn't it? Because he always took pretty good care that everybody could understand what was going on, even if they have no idea about the fandom.

Well, maybe I will just give the first chapters a try sometime and see how it goes from there. But I don't really see reading Worm in my future. 1.7m words and a theme that does not have me interested from reading the summary, even though I love the genre. Also hear the protagonist is very unlikeable. Dunno if true, just something I have heard a few times.
