Is the story you're looking for one of the one's below.\\
Both seems to have Harry (Slytherin), Ron (Gryffindor), Hermoine (Ravenclaw), and Ginny (Hufflepuff) and they all go back.\\
Granted, this does differ from what you said since you said you thought Hufflepuff decided not to go back so it might not be it.

linkffn(The Founders Four)\\
linkffn(What-Went-Wrong)

They were both on my reading list (I read a few chapters of each in the past, but it's been awhile I forgot most of it).

I know there is 1 more that I remember reading (it's not either of the above I said) that had the same premises (with the same 4 people).\\
I'll check my fanfiction downloaded stories and see if I might have that one (with 3 of 4 founders) since now that you mention it, that story does sound a little familar.
