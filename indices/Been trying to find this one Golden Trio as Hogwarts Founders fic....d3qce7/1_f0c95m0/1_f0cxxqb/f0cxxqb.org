Woah, awesome! Thanks for the reply!

Yeah, I'm not 100% sure if either of these stories are the one I was referring to (It would definitely be a lot older than What Went Wrong, haha I'm ancient), but they seem to be along almost exactly the same line/trope. So thanks for bringing them to my attention! Sometimes I feel as though I've read [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] dry xD
