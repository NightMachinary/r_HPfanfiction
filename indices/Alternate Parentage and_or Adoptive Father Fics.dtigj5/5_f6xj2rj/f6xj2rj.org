linkffn(A Second Chance) this isn't finished yet but receives updates every week. Sirius adopts Harry and fic follows him until presumably 7th year. All I know is it begins 4th year around chapter 160 (that's when I stopped reading it, because I don't like waiting for updates)

Edit: it linked the wrong fic... Just search for "A Second Chance"
