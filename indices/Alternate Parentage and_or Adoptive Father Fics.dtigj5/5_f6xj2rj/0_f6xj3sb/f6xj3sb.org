  Ever since turning immortal, Alice had experienced visions of Jasper. But visions were only possibilities. Days before she was set to meet him in '48, he committed suicide. Traveling to the Cullens on her own, she accepted that she'd be alone forever. But in 1995 she suddenly gets a vision of a man who looks like Jasper. How? Rating pulled up to M from chapter 8 just to be safe.
