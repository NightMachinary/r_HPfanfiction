Heh, this was once a really controversial pairing, but opinions have mellowed over time. i always liked Ginny though, and have read quite a few of these. Lets see :\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]], One of the greatest stories of all time.\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]], Great Time-travel story, mostly fast paced and action based, though light on HG\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute][Backwards With a Purpose]], A time-travel redo, though slower paced and more focused on HG\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/739771/KevinVoigt][The Death Gate Trilogy]], A really underrated Adventure/Mystery trilogy. Highly reccomended.
