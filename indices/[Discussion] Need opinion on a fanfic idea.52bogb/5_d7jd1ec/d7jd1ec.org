Thats combination of several ideas, some are good, some are bad. With stories you could try to experiment to change some bits to make it better.

Diary-format: As said before its hard to make that interesting.

A 20 year old self insert fic: You should avoid that as this idea has bad reputation. Half of readers will drop it after reading first chapter as 90% of these stories are trashy mary-sue romances with OC/Harry+Snape+Draco ship. For that reason better writters avoid this cliche which causes average quality drop more.

Time-travel idiots: No, just no. When one reads that story contain this, mainly based on: "We need to preserve the timeline and change only small things" speech followed by checking 20 chapters forward that while character traveled in first year Sirius escaped at start of third year then its one of my main reasons to drop a fic.

This basically tells your readers that you are lazy author and story would be boring because you don't bother to come with original plot. So why should we read this story? I read dozens of stories and even if some other aspect catches my eye I will skip paragraphs and paragraphs that rehash events that I already read dozens times about. That story would likely contain lot of railroading to keep it close to canon instead just letting to flow it naturally and do canon divergence. Last reason is that it makes time traveler an idiot that discards most advantages that he has for keeping future knowledge which is useless as he doesn't act on it and it could be erased by butterfly effect of changes that he made in any moment. With any decent plan an future knowledge he could neutralize Voldemort. For example in three days he could tell Harry to open chamber, place and basilisk and mirror next to Quirell's office. Then put Voldemort's statue in the chamber of secrets and Voldemort is gone until Ron reveals his true colors and frees him because he is his son (how else does on explain that Ron is parselmouth?). Defeating Voldemort isn't that difficult, main problem is not to accidentally kill him as while horcruxes save him from death they don't prevent keeping him alive but permanently asleep once captured.

Now for your aim as I previously written that your setup contains stigmas that cause lot of readers to drop story before they evaluate it on quality of story itself a simplest improvement would be following:

Dean Thomas just found that magic was real. He visited a cool magical place called Diagon Alley and bought some extra books at Transdimensional books INC. He didn't know how what looked like child's books will change his life.

That is basically same as your premise but framed differently. Dean is muggleborn and new to magic, knows about HP events from HP books that he bought at alternate dimension bookstore, then he meets real Harry Potter at train platform before Ron does and finds out that books were sorta real except that lot of events change to keep story interetsing.
