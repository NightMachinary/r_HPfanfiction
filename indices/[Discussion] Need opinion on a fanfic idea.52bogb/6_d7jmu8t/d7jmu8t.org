While it sounds like it is a great idea and could potentially be super interesting, there are a lot of red flags that pop up for me. The biggest thing that I really, really can't persevere through anymore is canon rehashing. I've literally read thousands of fics rewriting first year canon and it's a real struggle for me to slog through the events of Harry's first broomstick lesson, potions lessons, troll incident etc without some sort of divergence or different resolution. It's seriously difficult even if it's from another perspective or something. Any OC fic that I read nowadays, has to somehow differentiate itself from all the others, generally by making huge waves and significantly changing events from how they are in canon. First year is definitely the hardest for me since those are the most overdone, so maybe it could be better if the dying student was in his second or third year maybe?

Anyway, best of luck with the fic and I will endeavour to read it, but it will be hard if the OC sort of sidelines the first few years or so and doesn't really start influencing the story much until the later years. Sadly, I'm too impatient to wait through those kind of fics anymore
