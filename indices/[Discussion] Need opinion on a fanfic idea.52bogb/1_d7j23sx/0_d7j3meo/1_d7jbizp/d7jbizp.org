Thats great idea. Unless you use magic causes insanity Voldemort would easily enslave muggles in a day. Easiest way is to make parliment pass law that makes him supreme emperor of UK, with bit of imperius curse. Or just apparatate there with nuke and tell muggles that they have hour to sign terms of surrender or London would be destroyed.

I imagine a 1984 style future. A muggle would be caught by thoughpolice wizard that uses legilemency, imprisoned and used to experiment with transplanting souls where accident causes him to go back in itme. That limits characters future knowledge as while he read "The rise of our god-emperor" its hard to distinguish truth from propaganda.
