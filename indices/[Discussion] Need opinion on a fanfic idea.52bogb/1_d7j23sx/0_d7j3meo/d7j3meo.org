That's a really interesting thought. I'm now visualizing a muggle coming from a future in which Voldemort won and enslaved all muggleborns/muggles or waged war on the muggle world or just generally did something egregious and noticeable, so they somehow know that something went terribly wrong but not the details. That's just what my brain immediately jumped to, though. It might be better with no knowledge relevant to the magical world at all.
