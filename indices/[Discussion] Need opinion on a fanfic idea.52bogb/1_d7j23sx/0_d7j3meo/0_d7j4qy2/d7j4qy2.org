Your idea would be equally interesting, it all depends on the direction the OP would like to go! Another thought is that the OC could be originally a /squib/ from 2016, so they have a very basic knowledge of magical history and spells like you mention. Hell, it would be hilarious if the only spells he knows "well" are the household ones his wizard parent/s used regularly around him! It would also give the character the added dimension of never having magic and jealous/angry about it to suddenly being magical himself.
