I do enjoy stories like this, so yup, I like it. I dislike reading first person stories for the most part, so unless you're really really good at writing diary type stories, I'd recommend avoiding it. Or maybe you could do the old 'half and half', where for the most part we see it in third person subjective, but part of it is the character writing in his diary.

I have to say, at first read, I thought it was /Harry's/ dying body he'd occupy. And I rather like that idea. Basically magic doing weird things because the horcrux has to have another soul in there, or somesuch. Or, what if, it was Hermione, and that's why she's so smart. Especially if it were a witch from the future stuck in a muggle child's body.

Now, the idea of him joining the Golden Trio...Unsure about that. I'd prefer it if they were the Twin's age, and befriended them. Or maybe, a girl, who doesn't quite make the Golden Trio, but is close friends with Hermione, because she tried befriending her from start.
