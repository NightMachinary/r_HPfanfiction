I don't think it's a stupid idea. It has the potential to be good with some careful thought.

I'll give a few of my opinions below, but ultimately, you should write whatever you'd like.

First, I think that it may not be the best choice to do the story in diary format. It's certainly easier to write it that way, but it's very difficult to make it engaging to the reader. That's not to say that it's impossible to pull off well, but it limits you a lot. The reader won't be seeing events as they happen, complete with dialogue, descriptions, etc. but will be getting all of their information from the words written down by the protagonist.

Second, there are a lot of traps that can be fallen into when writing an OC (original character), particularly one that you'd like to join the Golden Trio, so you'll have to be careful about having things happen in a realistic, natural way.

I frequently see OC's that magically know how to say exactly the right thing to everyone in order to solve all of canon's problems and/or eliminate other characters' personality flaws.

It's a lot more interesting (and realistic) when an OC with foreknowledge tries very hard to fix things, but isn't always very good at it, or fails to take all variables into account, or is just plain unlucky.

For example, take the issue of how to make your OC become friends with Harry, Ron, and Hermione.

What if your OC tries to make friends with Harry and Ron on the train, but as a 20-year old has no idea how to make friends with 11-year olds and does a terrible job? What if he's sorted into a different House and hardly sees them? What if he inadvertently prevents Ron from insulting Hermione after Charms class, and then she doesn't need to be rescued from the troll in the girls' bathroom and never warms up to them? What if your OC does successfully make friends with the trio but then finds them all incredibly immature and annoying and constantly has to come up with increasingly terrible excuses for how he knows things?

For every situation in your story, think of everything that could happen differently or go wrong because of an OC's involvement, and then decide which course you'd like to take. Don't always make things go smoother than canon, because that's no fun. :) Every story needs to have conflict.
