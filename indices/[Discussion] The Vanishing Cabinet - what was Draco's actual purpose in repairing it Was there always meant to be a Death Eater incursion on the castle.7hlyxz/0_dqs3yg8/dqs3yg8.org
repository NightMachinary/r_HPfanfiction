I think it was said by Narcissa Malfoy in the Half-Blood Prince that Voldemort gifting Draco the task of killing Dumbledore was punishment for the failed retrieval of the prophecy in the Department of Mysteries the previous school year, a gang that was led by Lucius. In other words, Voldemort never expected Draco to actually carry through with the plan, rather he wanted Draco's parents to suffer under the weight of their son's failure, caused by that of his father. Voldemort was playing mind-games with the Malfoys then, driving them near to the brink of insanity. That's what I got anyway from the Half-Blood Prince.

To answer your question more directly, since Voldemort never expected Draco to succeed, the infiltration was to carry through with his plan to get rid of Dumbledore, leaving both Hogwarts and Harry vulnerable. It was said that Snape knew of the plan, leading Narcissa to make the Unbreakable Vow with him to keep Draco safe in his attempts to kill Dumbledore. In the end, Voldemort always wanted him dead (as he's the only one he - meaning Voldemort - ever feared).
