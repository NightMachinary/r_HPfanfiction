Meaning, then, that the infiltration was always part of Voldemort's plan. He would've assigned Draco to do it alongside his attempts to kill Dumbledore.

That's mostly what I was trying to figure, so I could take it into account as part of an AU. If Voldemort plans the infiltration because he expects Draco to fail, then if he assigns Dumbledore's assassination to someone he expects to succeed, he wouldn't also plan the infiltration.
