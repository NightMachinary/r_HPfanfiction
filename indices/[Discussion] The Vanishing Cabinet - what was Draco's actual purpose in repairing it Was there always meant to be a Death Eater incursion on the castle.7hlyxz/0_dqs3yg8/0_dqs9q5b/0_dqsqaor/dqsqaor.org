You have to note that even if Dumbledore were to die some other people that Tom would want gone would still be there, weaker than him but still strong, such as McGonagall and Flitwick, and for some reason access to the castle from the outside was limited to him. As such, it means that for as long as he, or anyone else under him, found out about the other vanishing cabinet, him tasking someone with the repair is still a real possibility.
