I don't have the cabinets ever turn up, but I've got another method he could access the castle. Given that, do you think he would plan an attack on the castle that year?

Also, Snape, Draco, & co. fled as Dumbledore died, but if the fight went more in favour of the Death Eaters (no Felix Felicis or Harry warning RHr to be on the lookout) then do you think it would have gone on longer and Voldemort himself might have turned up once he got word of Dumbledore's death?
