Hmm ... those are good questions.

With the first one, I personally believe that Tom is at the very least aware of the broken cabinet in the room of lost things. As such, the cabinets not coming into play would have to mean that the one at Borgin and Burkes got lost or destroyed or alternatively no death eater of any competence ever limited the place. It may be something to pay attention to, as your readers may wonder about it. That said, assuming he is the same as in canon I would presume he'd take the other way in, since for some reason that (getting inside without going through whatever defences Hogwarts could have had) mattered to him.

As for the other one, it definitely would have gone for longer, but I would expect some casualties on the heroes' side for it. Now, Tom himself appearing does not seem all that likely to me for one reason: the whole plan with the cabinet seems to have been caused by him ... being afraid, I guess, of something in Hogwarts' defences. As such, with apparition not being available to him and thus him being limited to some kind of tunnel or passage, I do not see him bothering unless there was something he desired so badly, and with Dumbledore dead and him not really being that afraid of Harry there doesn't seem to be anything of that kind there. Then again, at least in canon Tom was somewhat crazy, so I don't see people questioning his appearance too much unless you establish him as above that in your story.
