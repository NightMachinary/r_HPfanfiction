  the cabinets not coming into play would have to mean that the one at Borgin and Burkes got lost or destroyed or alternatively no death eater of any competence ever limited the place

But they would have to know about BOTH cabinets. Knowing about the one in B&B is useless if you don't know where the other one is. Draco put two and two together because he saw the working cabinet the summer before his second year, and then he learnt about the broken one in his fifth year after F&G shoved Montague into it.

But now I'm remembering that the one in Hogwarts only broke because Peeves knocked it over in COS, which only happened because Sir Nick convinced him to, which only happened because he witnessed Harry getting in trouble with Filch. Given that this never happens in my fic, that means there's a working vanishing cabinet still in Hogwarts. (Assuming it was Peeves that broke the spells; I suppose they could have been using it just for decoration if it was physically fine but magically broken.)

... which actually means that for a while there was a link between Hogwarts and B&B that no knew about. Dumbledore didn't seem aware ("That was clever... there is a pair, I take it?" -- unless he's pretending not to know about it), which makes for a terrible security risk.

If the cabinet never once shows up or ever gets mentioned in all the story before 6th Year, readers probably won't wonder about them not being used as part of the HBP storyline. I've found that when you're ~200k deep in an AU, certain canon things will just slip past you completely. Even now I've realised there's a working cabinet in place, coming up with a subplot that involves it is likely to come across as forced at this point. Better to just leave it all completely unmentioned. (But I'm thinking of utilising it in some other fic now. The idea of an unbroken vanishing cabinet in Hogwarts early on is too intriguing not to explore.)

On the matter of Voldemort breaking in, I agree with your points. I wasn't initially planning to have any kind of big attack during that year (just a quiet assassination of Dumbledore), but I started thinking it may be possible and therefore whether Voldemort would do it. The Hogwarts defences can be bypassed, allowing Voldemort to come and go as he pleases, but it's also plausible for that information to never reach him.

I guess it's a matter of whether or not I want to write an attack on Hogwarts. It struck me as a good time for him to make a big stand--to come in and stand over Dumbledore's corpse and say "I win!" (Harry's perceived as a complete non-threat at this point)--but he also doesn't have the Ministry under control yet so he might refrain until he's got them bested, too. On the other hand, laying claim to Hogwarts might give him an advantage against the Ministry? Either as base or operations, or to just say, "I've got your kids, give up or I kill the lot."

... Actually, that might work. I guess I'll have to go do some hard thinking.

(I know my stories will be better for it, but damnit writing was so much easier when I didn't bother to think these things through and just went with whatever my brain came up with first.)
