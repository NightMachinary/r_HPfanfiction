I really wonder whether the infiltration was part of Voldemort's original/ultimate plan that year. It's implied that Voldemort never expected Draco to succeed, and for Snape to take over the job in Draco's stead. From "The Princes Tale" in DH (at the time of HBP):

#+begin_quote
  ‘In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,' said Dumbledore. ‘Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?'

  There was a short pause.

  ‘That, I think, is the Dark Lord's plan.'

  ‘Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at Hogwarts?'

  ‘He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.'

Since Snape was always someone Voldemort could rely on, in a way the task was as good as guaranteed. And I think we can assume that Snape was indeed the expected successor should Draco fail, because he knew of Draco's assignment when very few others did (as we learn when Narcissa and Bellatrix visit him at the beginning of HBP).
