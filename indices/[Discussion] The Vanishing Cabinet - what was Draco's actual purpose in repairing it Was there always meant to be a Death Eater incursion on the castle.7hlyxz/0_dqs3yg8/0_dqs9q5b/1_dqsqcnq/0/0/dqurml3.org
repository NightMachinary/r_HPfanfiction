First of all, I'm so glad I'm not the only person who has wondered about this. I've scoured the web and apparently nobody else ever thought it was weird that this infiltration happened at all.

Okay, anyway: interesting point you bring up with the bit of dialogue in HBP. It definitely seems like he has some sort of plan for the infiltration. I have a hard time thinking Draco (terrified and frustrated) would honestly believe Voldemort might let him off the hook and live if he could let the Death Eaters into the castle.

Your point about Draco hoping to claim someone else beat him to it is interesting, except the Death Eaters who were there were adamant about it being Draco who had to do it. Plus, I could see Voldemort using Legillimency on those present to verify what went on.

It is definitely curious though, when Draco says he has "other people on [his] side, better people" than just Crabbe and Goyle though. Could be just saying that? He could be talking about Bellatrix for sure, but then it makes me wonder a couple of other things:

- How soon before going to Hogwarts did Draco come up with this plan?

- Was Voldemort even aware of the specifics of Draco's plan, and/or how did he check on his progress throughout the year (other than just not seeing any news articles about Dumbledore's murder)? Even if Draco had the Dark Mark (which we don't know for sure), he can't Apparate at that time. Snape is obviously not Apparating with him since Draco's avoiding him. So I'm not sure there.

I hadn't considered that Bellatrix might have discovered Draco's plan while teaching him Occlumency; that's very interesting, and I like that idea. Hm, but if Voldemort is expecting Draco to give him a way into the castle, then why should he bother trying to kill Dumbledore with the necklace and the poison before the cabinet is even ready?

Blah. I've clearly thought about this too much. (Edit: and I do have my own headcanon on how/why an infiltration happened, but as it would sort of ruin the story I'm writing, I don't really want to write it out here. You can PM me if you want though.)
