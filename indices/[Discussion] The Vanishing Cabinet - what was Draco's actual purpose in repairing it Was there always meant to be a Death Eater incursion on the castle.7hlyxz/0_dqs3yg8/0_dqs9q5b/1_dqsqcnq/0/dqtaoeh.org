If the infiltration wasn't part of the plan, it leaves me wondering why it happened. Draco only fixed the cabinet shortly before Harry and Dumbledore left the school. Are we to think he sent word to the Death Eaters then and it was suddenly decided to attack the castle? Or did he let them know about it earlier so the attack was pre-planned and they were just waiting for confirmation it was time?

I just went to check some bits in HBP, and I noticed this:

#+begin_quote
  "I've got a plan and it's going to work, it's just taking a bit longer than I thought it would!" (Draco to Snape, Ch15)
#+end_quote

That almost sounds like the infiltration is Draco's idea. Perhaps he did it hoping it would ease Voldemort's anger when he failed at killing Dumbledore? Or maybe he was hoping that with a load of Death Eaters in the castle, someone else might kill Dumbledore in a way that would leave Draco able to claim, "I was going to but someone else beat me to it!" (Questionable as to how much that would actually get Draco out of trouble, and as you say Voldemort seems to have expected Snape to do it the whole time, but it's something he might think.)

I've just realised that Bellatrix may very well have known about the plan. She taught Draco Occlumency; there's a good chance she learnt about it then, and Draco does tell Snape that he's got "other people on my side, better people" than just Crabbe and Goyle.

So perhaps Draco comes up with the initial idea, sometime between being assigned the task early in the summer and his trip to Diagon Alley in early August. Bella finds out while teaching him Occlumency, then she or Draco (I lean towards Bella) tells Voldemort about it. Probably after Draco's been to Borgin and Burkes to confirm the working cabinet is still there; possibly even after Draco's reached Hogwarts and got the broken cabinet into the RoR. Voldemort knowing that Draco's going to give him a way into the castle might be why he was more forgiving of taking so long to kill Dumbledore and the two failed attempts, even if he does expect Snape to do it in the end.
