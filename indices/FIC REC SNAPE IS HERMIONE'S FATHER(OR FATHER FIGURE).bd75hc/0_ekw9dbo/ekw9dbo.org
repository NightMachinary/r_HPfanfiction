linkao3(6237706) Sirius raises Hermione from near-birth after Bellatrix kills her parents. I have in my notes to myself there's family magics, so expect world-building and it's endgame Draco/Hermione.

​

linkffn(keogh) although it's incomplete, I really liked the parts where Snape was fatherly but I admit sometimes it veered to the ridiculous, like giving boys detention for wanting to ask her out. I really liked the crossover on the whole, though I haven't read the Necroscope books it was pretty easy to understand.

​

linkffn(11153333) very long, over the top Regulus is Hermione's father and she's actually a pureblood oh no! Hopefully this isn't the one you already read, I don't remember much about it.
