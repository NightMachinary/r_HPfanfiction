I meant that the messages she'd been getting are self-entitled, actually. Because if they actually were writing anything they could just do that, and if they wanted to adopt her story they could simply message her about it (and even if they did not know if she'd be for it, they hadn't tried at all); but to get onto someone's case for taking time to write when the person doing it doesn't write at all, that's just being an immature and self-entitled arse.

So really, /if/ her message is self-entitled they only have themselves to blame for it.
