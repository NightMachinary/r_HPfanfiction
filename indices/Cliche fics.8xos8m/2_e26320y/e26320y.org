linkffn(A Cadmean Victory)

Angsty teen Harry "I do not forgive, I do not forget" Potter, Salazar's Paiting in the Chamber of Secrets, Abusing Timeturner to train and do shit, Veela's allure imunity making Fleur fall in love with him Twilight-style, Manipulative Dumbledore (although, its really close to canon in that one, Harry's the one that thinks there's more to it than there actually is).

Overall, I'd give maybe 5/10 or 6/10 because some things are entertaining.
