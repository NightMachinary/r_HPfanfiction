  so you dont look like a bigot that you are.

  implying that I'm still a bigot though you've just acknowledged my argument that was designtspecifically against it

  there isnt much a difference from disliking it to not wanting to acknowledge it exists

This doesn't make sense to me. To use the same analogy with sex in general, I acknowledge its existence but still don't want it showing itself in my Pixar movies, books, or pretty much anything not specifically sex-oriented (e.g. porn). That may be my personal preference, but how does it make me into a bigot?
