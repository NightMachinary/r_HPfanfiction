Even if I'm young enough to be gen z I don't really know anyone who uses some of these terms. No matter how many people watched Little Einsteins as kids it's not actually something I've seen referenced in person. Just online, rarely. Also, "anna oop" is another spelling of "and I oop". It's harder to recognize when it's been further shortened.

The OP is likely gen z since they have great grasp on when to use gen z slang in a sentence. Many people who aren't gen z can pick up a slang word but it won't work naturally in a sentence for them.
