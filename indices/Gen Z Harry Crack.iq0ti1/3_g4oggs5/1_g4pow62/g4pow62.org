Honestly tho don't even worry, Gen Z humor makes /absolutely zero sense./ It's so broken, that we make jokes about and acknowledge how stupid it is. The best explanation I can give is we see someone do something weird or funny, then we talk about it, create a word or reference of some kind, put it in our everyday vocabulary, use it till we get tired of it, then use it occasionally, maybe changing It's meaning by making it ironic. Its pretty much all one big inside joke lol.
