Oh, I remember that! Read on AO3 , it's not fantastic (well written but like, WBWL, so...) but /it was/ one of the first HP fics I really got into, so it's got a small special place in my heart, fun to read and I did genuinely root for her when she was ice-skating, helps they didn't bash the twin. If you like WBWL I second the notion of reading it, though it's not my thing anymore.
