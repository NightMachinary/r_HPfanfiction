This may be the best and worst thing I've read in recent memory. Granted, memory has more holes in it than a colander, but my point stands!

The deadpan "wtf" from everyone else is what makes this. Although I feel this is less 'Gen Z' than it is 'Gen Z by way of Internet memes', but I appreciate both the effort and the insanity required to cram so much ridiculousness I to such a short bit of writing.
