I'm a millenial, and this story has references to humor from the time period where I was most actively looking for memes and internet culture, like end of 2000's to early 2010's. That's just before the first gen z's have the privilege of chatting on the interwebs.

Before reading this story, remember that memes age fast and they may age badly. Judge your predecessors kindly.
