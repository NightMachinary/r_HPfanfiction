I'm over 30 but I work with some gen z and I know they all talk like this because I always immediately notice. I think it's just so cute and funny when I hear it ( not in a mocking way, in a â€˜how unique' way ). Either way I know at least some people talk like this still, that's for sure. Maybe just not around your area, perhaps.
