I work in remote field camps that frequently have no/little connectivity and the only way me and my sad ADHD brain make it through is pre-downloaded audiobooks, music, and tv/movies. I'm sure there are probably wizarding equivalents to audiobooks, and we know they have music, but it would be tough.

It would definitely be a struggle for modern kids to adapt to the late-1700s technology in the wizarding world, but cool magic powers would certainly make things easier to accept.
