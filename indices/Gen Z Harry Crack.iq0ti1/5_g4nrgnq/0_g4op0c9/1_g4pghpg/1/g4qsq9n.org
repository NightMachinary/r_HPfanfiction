you say that

but being bitter all the time can't be that healthy for either mindstate or blood pressure

In all seriousness, the sentiment you're espousing is ridiculously overblown. "kids these days" aren't spending inordinate amounts of time on the internet doing /mysterious harmful internet things/, all that's happened is media has shifted. The internet is the supreme aggregator, which condenses newspapers, books, phones, letters, TV, and also creates Social Media, which hasn't existed before.

Think about how much time people /actually/ spent away from all those things I've just mentioned before the internet. It's not a lot.

Not to mention, kids are really, really naive. It sounds mean, but it's true. They don't know anything! You cannot stop the march of civilisation, but you also can't throw your hands in the air and give up raising them. Kids need borders, or else they'll overdo it - just like a dog will overeat. But they also need to /understand/ these borders, or they'll disregard them out of spite or because they don't see a reason. And "because I say so" isn't a reason unless the real reason is inappropriate for children.

Social spaces have shifted, away from what you know, towards what you don't. Yes, it seems strange. Everything new does. But you gotta accept it and open your mind to new ideas, and dumbfuck jokes like the one I responded to are not productive, they reinforce your cozy little mindstate instead.
