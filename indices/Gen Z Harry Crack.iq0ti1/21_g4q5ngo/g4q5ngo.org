It's extra funny because canon Harry is peak Gen X despite being born in the last year of it. So it's really funny to see him so drastically different. Also canon often writes Harry and CO as millenials, because they are millennials writing their favorite characters. I think it would be a breath of fresh air to read fics where they are either written as too cool Gen Xer's (HP is set in the 90's for fucks sake) or just write them as incredibly earnest Zoomers. I'm so tired of reading the same millennial drivel
