1. there was a show in the early 2000s that many gen z kids watched or knew of called "Little Einsteins", and someone made a remix of the song that plays when they go into their rocket ship. It was kind of a bop/meme for awhile on tiktok especially.
2. Periodt is pronunced periot, and the saying comes from the show "City Girls" in which they say it like that as a sentence closer. Like, "I'm done, that's the tea, periodt."
3. your welcome! And thanks for the nice comment â˜º
