Yes I would!

1. What's the rocket ship reference? 2) do people say 'periodt' out loud? And does it sound like somebody is making the t sound at the end of "period" or does somebody really say "period tea?" 3) Your drabble made me laugh. Thank you :)

Fun fact for anybody unaware, shook has definitely been used by Gen X and Gen Y people. There was even a rap song that used that word extensively which was really popular in the mid/late 90s ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTKpYJ80OVQ][Shook Ones Part II]]). To be fair though, I didn't see that word on the internet until 3ish years ago.
