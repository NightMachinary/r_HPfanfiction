Can you imagine??

Peeves getting his hands on some memes and slinging them round at the professors.

Someone putting 👁👄👁 in permanent sticking charm on the potions classroom. Or the entrance to the chamber of secrets, once known.

Omg endless possibilities for Fred and George. And Moaning Myrtle will try impress boys with stale memes.

Someone would come up with an airhorns charm for sick burns. The crack value on this is truly endless.
