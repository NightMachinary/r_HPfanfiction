End of the Line - a well-written fic that explores how different characters react to the afterlife. Even though it's a Discworld crossover, it focuses on the HP characters and doesn't require any knowledge of Discworld.

The Exceptional Mr. Weasley and His Approximation of Obedience - great Fred Weasley character study with lots of feels.

Passports Required - a much lighter and funnier take on Fred and the afterlife.
