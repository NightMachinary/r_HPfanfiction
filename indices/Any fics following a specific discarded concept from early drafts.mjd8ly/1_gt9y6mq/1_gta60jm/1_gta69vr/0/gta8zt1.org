Interesting. I see her as having a chip on her shoulder the size of the rock of Gibraltar, and a burning desire to prove that she's just as deserving of being there, if not more so than those with an unbroken wizarding lineage. Likely something she developed after a year or two at Hogwarts, having to listen to the taunts from people like Malfoy (possibly even him specifically if/when he learns of her rather direct relation to the Weasleys) given the fact of her father being a Squib, and the doubts that she's even a quote-unquote "real" witch because of it.
