Yeah there's some interesting stuff on the cutting room floor, like Vernon being a Member of Parliament. You can kinda still see the traces of that idea - the paranoia about how his family is perceived by the public, the fact that he attended a public school and is sending Dudley to the same school. But it's then been mixed with a more "working class" aspect, living on an estate, reading the Daily Mail, etc. So you're left with a kind of hybrid caricature of the worst, most stereotypical aspects of both the upper and working class.
