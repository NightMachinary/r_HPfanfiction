Tread Softly by Dius Corvus (on fanfiction.net) is a time-travel story where Harry has a really hard time fitting in, makes terrible mistakes, and is even the cause of worse events. It begins with the side effect of Voldemort trying to kill Harry and a piece of Voldemort's soul (and memories) ends up in Harry. The resulting magical backlash sends Harry/Voldemort back in time to the year his parents graduate Hogwarts; Harry takes on the name Jonathan and attends another 7th year at Hogwarts where Dumbledore can keep an eye on him. Harry is in this early 20s, I can't remember exactly how old, pretending to be an 18 year old, and is interested in another 17-18 year old. If that age difference bothers you, please take note!

*Please note: story features a scene of child abuse*; a memory of some older students sexually abusing a much younger student at Hogwarts. It is absolutely recognized as abuse in the story, there is no excusing or sanitizing the violation and trauma.

Major spoilers:

Harry/Voldemort really fucks things up; he murders a classmate, kills the DADA professor while she is defending Hogwarts, is responsible for Snape being noticed and sought after by Voldemort in the first place, and causes Peter Pettigrew to betray Potters. The awful part of Harry learning how to get back to his time, while struggling with feeling that he doesn't have the power to change anything, is that Harry /is/ so magically powerful because of his strength combined with Voldemort that he could have made a better future. Snape, already an angry, abused, and abrasive teen, ends up a broken and bitter man from his entanglement with 'Jonathan' and being enticed into the Death Eaters.
