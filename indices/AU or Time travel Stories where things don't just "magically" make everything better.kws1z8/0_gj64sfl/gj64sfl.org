I'm reading linkao3(The Second String by Eider_Down)

Harry goes back to 1976ish but doesn't do the whole "Find his parents" trope. Instead he carves out a place for himself in hogsmeade and joins the fight against Voldemort for his own reasons. He really struggles. There's a lot working against him here. I don't want to say anymore because spoilers but yeah... It's not the usual tropey fic you're used to seeing. And he does make mistakes. A lot of them ðŸ˜Š

It's a new history. Broadly canon but a few key things happen that make it different. I have no idea how the story is going to end but im very excited!

Harry is a lot more mature. And he really grows up he's a fecking idiot for the first while but life and experience really matures him. I'm really proud of him now!

There's so much plot. Secret vigilante groups, barfights, pirates, politics, Squibs, jail time. It's amazing how...canon adjacent it is. Different enough to be a whole new story but with little hints of big events that you recognise from the books.

10/10 would recommend. It's genuinely brilliant.
