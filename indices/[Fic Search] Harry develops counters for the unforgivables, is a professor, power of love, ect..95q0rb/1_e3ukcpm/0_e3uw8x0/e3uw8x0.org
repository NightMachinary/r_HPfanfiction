I wanna say, original characters, goblin warrior and armour, animagus training for many many students, Harry running a defence club in the chamber of secrets. Harry and hermione receiving auror training and learnibg from an aural pensieve while they sleep. Harry requiring a godparent, and they keep dying. But still can't remember the story and can't find it in my reading lists . I may be amalgamating several stories in my head at once.
