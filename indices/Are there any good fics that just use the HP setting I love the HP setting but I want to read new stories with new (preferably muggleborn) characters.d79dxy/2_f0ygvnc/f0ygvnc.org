(*Self-plug incoming*): I am writing a fic that sort of resembles what you describe. It's a crossover between X-Men and HP, with strong focus on the HP universe.

It's set abroad, but not in any magical or non-magical school.

The MC is a muggle-born and a mutant who only learns about magic during adulthood (for reasons currently being explored). She works as a paranormal investigator, and stumbles into the wizarding world on the latest assignment.

It /isn't/ all about ordinary wizards going about their daily lives, although we meet some along the way. There's no grand prophecy, but the villains (when we get to them) are still entangled with the whole Voldemort business, in a roundabout way that should not interfere with canon.

The story also relies on the concept of obscurials, courtesy of Fantastic Beasts (the good first movie, not the abominable second). You don't have to know what the hell an obscurial is because the MC doesn't either. Just thought I'd say.

Hope it ain't completely outside what you seek.
