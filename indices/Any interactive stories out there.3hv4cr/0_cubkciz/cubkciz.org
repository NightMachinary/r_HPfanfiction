Not exactly what you're looking for, but most HP quests would fit. A quest is a work usually written in second person, where a snip is uploaded bu the author, and viewers vote as to what the main character does. Good ones are on Spacebattles, Sufficent Velocity, and Questionable Questing. I'm not sure what Harry Potter ones are running right now but I know there's a few on SB and SV.
