I'm only aware of /Worm/ fanfiction/interactive stories on those three sites, but QQ has some stories (most notably /Amelia/) which don't show up elsewhere, but are still good. I think SB is the best one, for /Worm/ at least, but that might be because Wildbow ran a PRT Quest game on there (he's the author of /Worm/).
