Other than [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1567849][Potter Rage]] I don't remember any that I've enjoyed.

If my memory doesn't betray me there might be one, many years ago, in which Harry is taken from the Dursleys by his maternal grandfather (Petunia was Lily's half-sister) to France where he met the family many of whom (all?) were able to talk to different animals (like parseltongue but other species) and they might or might not be veela.

I will look for it, I think it might have also been from Lomonaaeren but I might be conflating my memories.
