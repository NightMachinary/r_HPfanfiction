Haven't seen the movies but in my headcanon Grindelwald was into Arianna while Dumbledore was into him. After the duel which killed Arianna, Grindelwald blamed Dumbledore and swore vengeance. He left for Eastern Europe and spent decades studying the Dark Arts. He also saw the horrors of the first World War and decided to unleash it at the British because public opinion was with the rising star Albus Dumbledore.

Since the likeliest enemy of the English were the Germans and their new Chancellor had a warmongering rhetoric he approached Hitler and made a deal. For some magical assistance (Veritaserum, screening his guards, runes to enchant weapons) in exchange for a few favours, like a magic homing version of the V1 and bombing runs on empty fields (hidden Manors).

When Grindelwald realised the extent of what he unleashed (2nd world war, holocaust) he tried to stop it but was hindered by an international magical coalition, making him fight the "good guys" so that he could stop Hitler, which was difficult since he previously did everything in his power to prevent that. He succeeded after realising that his "enlightenment" project ended in blood and ruins. He wanted to surrender himself to the International coalition but when Dumbledore was there it turned into the famous duel.
