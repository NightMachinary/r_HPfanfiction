I kind of feel like Grindelwald is everything Voldemort could have been, if he didn't go crazy. (Not that Grindelwald's all that sane, but there you go.) I mean, they're both said to be young, handsome charming characters at their origins, they're both Dark Lords, they'd both like to rule somewhere in Europe and they're both trying to play with Death. I feel like these parallels aren't by accident: I think maybe J.K. Rowling was trying to tell us that in the grand scheme of things, Voldemort is insignificant, as is Grindelwald before him and whoever will come after him. The struggle between good and evil, light and dark, is eternal.

I feel like I'll be disappointed by movie-Grindelwald, partly because he's super evil and crazy in fics, but the movie has to be appropriate for children / young teens (I thought I heard somewhere the thing was going to be PG). Also, he's being played by Johnny Depp, who was great as Jack Sparrow, but who I feel like never graduated from that role.

Just low-key, I love the headcanon with Ariana! Are there any fics that explore this Ariana Dumbledore Grindelwald scene with. Good character development? That would be amazing!
