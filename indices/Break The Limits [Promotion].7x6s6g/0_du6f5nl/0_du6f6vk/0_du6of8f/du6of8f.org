Thanks for the input. I did consider have someone British going over it, but since I wasn't sure I'd continue it is didn't bother. xD I'm glad you liked the premise. Hopefully the 2nd chapter, once uploaded, is to your liking as well. I'm a bit nervous since I got some positive feedback in the reviews, but I suspect a power Harry gets in the next chapter might be a bit much for readers (check the linked thread in the OP for the power). I can't think of how to make the premise believably work without it, lol.
