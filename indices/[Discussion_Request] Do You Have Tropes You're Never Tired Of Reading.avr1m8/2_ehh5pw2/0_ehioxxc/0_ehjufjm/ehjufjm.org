Honestly, I feel like if he had gotten to know and hang out with the DA kids from the first day people would not have been so quick to blame him. I remember in book 2 the ones who he did spend time with (Quidditch team, etc.) didn't take the accusations seriously and then he mostly stopped being a suspect as soon as Hermione was petrified. A big issue for Harry is he is this mysterious figure who's reputably very powerful but not very social - not a good combination.
