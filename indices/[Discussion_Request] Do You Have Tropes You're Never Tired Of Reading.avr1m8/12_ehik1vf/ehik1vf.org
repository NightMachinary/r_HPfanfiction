Protective McGonagall! Don't see this nearly enough.

Slytherins who aren't truly evil, but who also aren't truly good. Who are 3 dimensional. I really liked Slughorn, he wasn't evil, but he also had his own personal flaws; which was something I enjoyed reading.

Characters getting a good redemption story, rather it be Snape or someone else. Maybe he sees Harry as his own person, maybe he doesn't but something happens and he's torn, I don't care, it's always great to read those.

Great character development in general, am a huge fan of it.
