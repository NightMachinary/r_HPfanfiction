This might sound odd but I love reading "Depressed!Draco" fics that focus on his life, especially after the war. I like to see how the authors write his struggles to find his place in the wizarding world with the tarnished reputation of his family. How will he survive that? How do you build a future for yourself when you feel like you don't have one? I love to see people's takes on his character.

Seriously, feed me that shit all day long.
