Yeah, sadly most H/Hr stories lack a relationship between equals. Most either have OPHarry and Hermione as a follower or Hermione acting like a mother and not a lover.

I did write one fairly successful Harry/Hermione oneshot based entirely on "I would do this completely different", but despite liking the pairing I can't come up with a longer story to write with them. I always run into "X story already did this and it sucked" or "Y story already did this well, but I don't want to copy that".
