Honestly, I think a H/Hr could be interesting if you successfully explore the friendship relationship between the two characters, from when they first meet on the train until they become inseparable best friends who spend 12+ hours a day together. Make it more a slice of life and character study of both Harry and Hermione, where both learn to appreciate each other over the course of their life, and I think it would be warm and beautiful.
