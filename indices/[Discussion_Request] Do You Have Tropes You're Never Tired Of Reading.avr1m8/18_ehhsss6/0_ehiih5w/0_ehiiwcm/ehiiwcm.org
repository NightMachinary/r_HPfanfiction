I'm into Harry x Hermoine, but only when they're best friends and lovers; philosophically, I think romantic matches between best friends work better than just romantic matches between people you simply court for romance because somebody who is your best friend already knows all your foibles and little quirks and would put up with them even before you two get together, so not much would change after you do.
