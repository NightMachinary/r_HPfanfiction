I will always read time travel stories with my favorite pairings. I may have to backbutton for all manner of things but I will always try them, they're my favorite. There's of course Debt of Time, but also Chemistry and Timing (Remus/Hermione) linkffn(7860277). That one has a 20 year old Hermione traveling back to 1993, so it's not a Marauder-era fic, which is a nice touch.

​

I also really enjoy soulmate fic, especially the whole 'werewolves get soulmates, and they're super rare but hey look it's Hermione' trope. Super cheesy, still a favorite.

Moonlight is a good one, Remus/Hermione linkffn(12601876)
