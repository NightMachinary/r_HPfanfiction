IDK who downvoted you but I put it back up. I wasn't trying to make this a race argument. My wife is black and grew up around the same time period. Granted she's American and that makes a huge difference but she has strong opinions on these things and they influence my views. I wasn't makeing that into a 'hey everyone should see her this way' I was just say why I do.
