I've never actually seen cursed child. I did see the arguments about the casting, though, and that was when my image of her changed.

Her being black made more sense to me after I thought about it. I've seen smart know it all type people have friends growing up and the description of her didn't make much sense to me. Black Hermione, though, made sense. A black girl in a predominantly white environment in the late 80s would be made fun of and have few real friends. It also made her sudden outrage about house elf slavery so much more in character. On the whole I just love the image and it clears up some of the problems I had with her.
