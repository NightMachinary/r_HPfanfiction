I'm not quite sure you understand race relations in 80s Britain. While there were race riots and racially motivated attacks which still continue into today, the Grangers were in a position of affluence as dentists. They would have been unlikely to experience much discrimination. It is also highly unlikely that Hermione would feel a connection to house-elves based upon a personal connection to black slavery, as slavery had been abolished in 1803.

In addition, Hermione's personality as a know-it-all very likely could isolate her. Depending on the size of her school, other children who could tolerate and be her friend would be rare. Moreover, participation in physical activities and childish games would be unlikely for Hermione, a bookish, unathletic girl.

All of these factors show that it isn't likely that Hermione being black would have any influence over how she acts. And in the Wizarding World, where the Shacklebolts are part of the Sacred 28, being black definitely wasn't an issue.
