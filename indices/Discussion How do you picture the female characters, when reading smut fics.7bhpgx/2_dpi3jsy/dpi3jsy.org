I think the fanon for Susan Bones has to do with the movie casting a round-cheeked child.

If I'm reading smut, I may as well cast myself. I can't stand imagining the actual actors in those scenes. I usually just skim the smut the first time I read for possible important story bits, then read the scenes separately later, just so I can picture the actors while the plot is happening in my head.
