I made a subreddit for posting pictures of how you picture the characters. I happen to mostly post pictures of the characters who I consider attractive. Everyone is welcome to submit pictures but /please/ follow the posting format.

[[/r/HP_Casting]]

But to summarise:

*Harry Potter*: Tall (approx 180cm) and slim. Messy dark hair, green eyes. Glasses. Very handsome but in an athletic, boyish sense rather than a buff, manly sense. Casual dress. Confident but not arrogant pose/body language.

*Female Harry*: The female equivalent of the above: dark hair with a bit of frizz to it, glasses, green eyes. Very pretty. Skinny but not stick thin. Casual dress and pose but still feminine.

*Hermione Granger:* I actually have two different mental images of Hermione that I flip between. One is a petite girl with little in the way of curves. The other, perhaps inspired by the idea that she doesn't get too much exercise as a library-dweller, is a slightly curvier version with relatively large breasts (compared to Emma Watson) and a curve to her stomach. Either way I picture her as having a relatively pretty face and big, frizzy brown hair.

*Ginny Weasley:* Petite frame, freckles, hair more ginger than red, very pretty face.

*Fleur Delacour:* Neither too skinny nor too voluptuous. She's described as willowy, so she should be petite in frame, but given how attractive everyone finds her (and in a sexual manner at that) I feel like she needs to have at least some curves to her. Further, she should not be a "golden blonde" like the typical American beach blonde Baywatch style look. There should be a pale, silvery aspect to her. I enjoy depictions of Fleur in which she is casually dressed as it's an interesting contrast to the fandom idea of her as constantly dressed to the nines.

*Pansy Parkinson:* For some reason I have always associated Pansy with having curvy hips. I think it might be an association created via the idea of her wearing a pencil skirt from the office scenes in the fanfic /Parkinson's Knickers (Or Lack Thereof)/. Her other distinctive feature being her "pug" nose, which I read as meaning upturned and with a bit of width to it. Despite that nose, however, I still tend to think of her as quite pretty in a girl-next-door kind of way. Not "model pretty" but eye catching. Black haired.

*Susan Bones:* Below average height, hair mid-way in the ginger-red spectrum, large breasts, curvier frame (that's not a euphemism for "fat"), either no freckles or light freckles.

*Daphne Greengrass:* Mousy blonde, very pretty, petite. Classy.

*Lily Potter:* Average height, hourglass figure, hair closer to red than ginger, no freckles, pretty face.

*Parvati Patil:* Indian ethnicity, toned body and stomach, long black hair, medium sized breasts and relatively narrow hips.

*Lavender Brown:* Brunette, girl-next-door type, medium-to-large breasts.

*Cho Chang:* British-Chinese rather than pure Chinese ethnicity. Slim, small chest, pretty.
