Initially my thought in reply was 'however they're being described by the author', as smut fics tend to be more specific about this sort of thing. Then it occurred to me that many smut writers are vague on the details that don't matter to them, which results in many girls being effectively faceless.

A few idle notes:

- For whatever reason (probably made worse due to fanon reinforcement), whenever Susan Bones in mentioned she comes with a footnote connected to Michael Palin in Monty Python and the Holy Grail saying 'she's got huuuuuuuuge... tracts of land!'

- Hermione wasn't black in my mind, but when the idea was suggested I rather liked it, except that the association of her being black /and/ involved in stumping for equal representation and ending slavery made it seem too obvious, edging toward racial profiling errors seen in Star Wars: Phantom Menace.\\
  She's most often portrayed as Emma Watson or a curvier version thereof, that no doubt was hiding her awesome rack beneath the shapeless robes of the school uniform. When she isn't being lovingly described in smut fic, I try to adjust my mental image of her to be like Anna Poppelwell (Susan Pevensie in the Narnia films) - chipmunk like with too-thick wavy curls that can be polished up into a jaw-dropper, but is generally too serious-minded to want to be attractive to boys.

- I like the movie twins, yet I'm confounded by the book description of them being of the stout like Charlie variety of Weasley. Ron should have been the tall one, and his representation in fanfic suffers from being 'Rupert Grint-ized'. If they'd used someone more like Sean Biggerstaff (who played Oliver Wood), I could see much nicer outcomes. The Harry/Ron shippers alone would quadruple.

Aside from those, I have some quick casting alternatives that I prefer:

Ewan MacGregor as Bill Weasley; Keira Knightley as Fleur Delacour; Karen Gillan as Ginny Weasley; Tim Roth or the guy playing Igor Karkaroff as Severus Snape; Emma Thompson as Minerva McGonagall, though her performance would probably be a version of Maggie Smith anyway; and Stephen Fry as Albus Dumbledore
