I don't know if I've read that one yet, but I guess you could say that: lack of thrust in authority+motivation and opportunity to take action yourself could lead to law and order falling apart. Especially if after the first violent clashes aren't competently handled.

Maybe a bit like starfox's stories, but not quite on the civil war scale and with the story actually taking place at Hogwarts.

I'll check out the fic though, cuz it does ring a bell but I don't really remember.
