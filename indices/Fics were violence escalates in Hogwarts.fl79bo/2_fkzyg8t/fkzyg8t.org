God damn, I swear to God that I read a fic where Harry literally blows Draco's head off with a bombarda spell after he (Draco) disemboweled Luna when exiting the RoR. She gets put under s stasis spell to keep her alive while Harry finishes Draco off. I remember Dumbledore doing a purification ritual in his office after that, but I can't remember the name of the fic to save my life.
