There's also /Harry Potter and the Hands of Justice/ which is the second part of the Cry of Freedom series.

This story deals with Harry's second year, with the attacks on muggleborns, both by the Heir and other purebloods, the corruption of the Hogwarts staff and the Ministry, and Harry's retaliation. The series starts with /Harry Potter and the Vault of Time/.
