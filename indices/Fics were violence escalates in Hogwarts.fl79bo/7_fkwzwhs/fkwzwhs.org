Id really just like a fic with "but the slytherins/malfoy did this and wasn't punished, so i wont be either" Malfoy gets away with hexing someone? Hex back and refuse punishment.

"of cause bullying is fine, the slytherins do it, and none of the teachers stop it, so that means we can do it too"

Just mayhem until the teachers start punishing everyone fairly
