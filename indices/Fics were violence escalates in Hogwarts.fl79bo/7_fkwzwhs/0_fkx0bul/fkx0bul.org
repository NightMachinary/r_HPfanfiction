Yea in fanfiction its either evil slytherins who bully, or when the main character is a slytherin it's the evil light Gryffindor bullies.. except when everyone gets together to bully the chosen one.\\
Usually it's a plot device to show how righteous the main character is and how bad everyone who isn't with them is.
