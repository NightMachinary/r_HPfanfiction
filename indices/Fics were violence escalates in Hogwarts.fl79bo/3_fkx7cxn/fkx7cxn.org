I (barely) remember a fic in which Harry and Cho (others joined later I guess) were doing brutal interrogations/torture sessions and killings, all the while doing drugs to not think about what they've done and still to do. At some point Harry decides to stop using drugs but Cho doesn't like that at least initially. I think at one point they've rescued a bunch of muggles from one of the D.E.'s houses.

Anyway I don't remember its name and will look for it but while I do so, if anyone knows this fic, do share its name please.

Edit: I looked but unfortunately couldn't find it.
