For some reason, I thought of having a Dark Lord Dumbledore be named Tomus Dumblemort, would that be the most ridiculous name you would ever read? (I also thought for a platformer sequel game where Harry has to go through levels based on fics and common fandom plots and gets to blow the levels up to complete them and can find upgrades like a alternate Elder Wand which allows the magic shot out of it to deal more damage and you don't lose after you get hit or lose a life, that the fandom plot of evil Dumbledore being the main focus of one of the worlds, as the boss of that world.)
