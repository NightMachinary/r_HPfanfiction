interactions on the internet are difficult because we can't see each other's faces and expressions. when someone behaves (or writes) significantly differently to the average reddit poster, it is conspicuous. that's why you gotta ask questions sometimes. Self expression is great and all, but we sacrifice some individuality to participate in a shared consensus reality. If you don't recognize the difference between the average (dare I say: normal) post on this subreddit and your posts, I think you have a problem. If you realize it but do it anyway, great, but then you need to accept that it influences the number and type of interactions you will have.

I don't have a huge amount of experience here on reddit, but from what I've seen, the way you express yourself here in this subreddit is unique. therefore, I think, yugiohgenius's question isn't out of line. it's not impossible, for example, that you are in fact a child. Most people here would probably react to you differently if they found that out. but it's also possible that you're a troll. or just someone with a lot of excitement and passion for fanfiction. maybe english isn't your first language and some of your tone is getting lost in translation. and to be honest, I've wondered whether there's some mental illness at play as well, which is why I've tried tp phrase this post respectfully and I hope you don't feel personally attacked.I'm just trying to give some feedback, because in my opinion, reporting yugiohgenius for the above post is childish behaviour.
