A little bit of background here, my wife (45f) and I (48m) took in our nephew (16m) when he was an infant after his parents died. We had a son the same age and my wife thought it was important he grow up around family. His parents were really deep into some kind of cult, and they were actually murdered by one of their fellow cult members. When we took custody of our nephew, one of the cult leaders made it clear they wanted to remain part of his life. We told them very clearly “no” and cut off all communication with them.

Well, a few years ago, the cult started getting really aggressive in trying to reach out to my nephew. I tried my best to keep it under control, I had to take time off work to try to keep them away from the house. I have reason to believe they were watching where my nephew was (they knew when we moved him to a new bedroom). Eventually I got scared and took the whole family out of the house to a cabin for a while, but they still found us. Around midnight a man from the cult broke into the cabin, assaulted my son (He had to have corrective surgery for his injuries) and kidnapped my nephew.

So now I'm terrified. The police don't seem to have any power to make the cult cooperate with us, and his parents have set it up so the cult has legal authority to keep our nephew. After some time we come to a custody arrangement, my nephew will live with the cult 10 months out of the year and come home with us for the summer.

This has been the arragnement for about 5 years. My nephew has clearly been affected by his time with the cult, and makes it clear he would rather not see us at all. Since this whole thing started, he has given out our home phone number to the cult, destroyed a dessert at a big company dinner party I was hosting, and attacked his aunt (my sister). I'll be honest, it's been hard. We have taken to letting him go back with the cult early so we don't have to deal with him in our house.

Today has been the worst incident yet though. He and my son were walking home, when one of the cult members attacked both of them in an alley. My nephew refuses to tell me the details, but he came home carrying my son, who couldn't walk and immediately vomited on the floor. I'm yelling trying to get him to explain, but he's getting messages from other cult members and not really paying attention. Finally he tells me that is was an attack, and I completely lose it. I tell him he has to move out, he's no longer welcome in the house if he's going to expose my family to danger. I'm fed up with it.

Then suddenly, my wife gets a message from someone in the cult. I'm completely caught of gaurd by this. But now she says my nephew has to stay, in order to keep him safe from the cult. But I think we are the ones in danger here. Am I the asshole?

Edit: cult is called "Hogwarts" or something
