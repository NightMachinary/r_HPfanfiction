Other than circumstantial? No.

But does it have to? I'm not claiming it's canon. I'm just saying that if you see what the locket did to Ron, imagine what living with Harry could do.

It's not Dursley apologia. I have no doubt they would treat him terrible regardless. But making a child sleep in a closet is pretty extreme and outside what people as obsessed with being normal as the Dursley's would do.
