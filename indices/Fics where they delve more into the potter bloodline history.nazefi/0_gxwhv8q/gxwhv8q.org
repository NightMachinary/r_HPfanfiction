Little self promotion here, and forewarning, the story hasn't been posted yet, but I am actively writing and plan to start releasing chapters soon.

In the fic I'm writing, I have the potter's being descendant of the peverells (can't remember if that part is canon or not). But I've added on that the peverell line is descendant from morgana Le fay. I won't get into more than that because I have some cool stuff planned for this subplot
