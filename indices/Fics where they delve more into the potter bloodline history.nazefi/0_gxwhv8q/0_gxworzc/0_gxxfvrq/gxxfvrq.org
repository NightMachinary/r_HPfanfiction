I'm using the common "Morgan was bad" Arthurian take, with a big caveat, morgana wasn't actually the bad guy. History is written by the victor, and when Merlin won, history was written and twisted to make morgana the bad guy. I have it written that Merlin gave birth to Salazar Slytherin familial line, and thus voldemort is descendant from Merlin.

It gives me the opportunity to have a cool take on Arthurian legend and tiring it into harry potter verse. There's also some poetic writing here since lily and James were seduced (using the term non sexually) into the death eaters side of things, and were killed when they tried to mutiny against voldemort. Harry grows up hated because his parents were death eaters despite him deffinetly not being a blood supremest himself, and over the course of the 4ish year timeline I have for the books, he will rebuild his family's reputation through fighting against the death eaters and will make ally's along the way.

Morgana also makes an appearence very early in the fiction and will be a big part of it throughout, and will be Harry's chief mentor. I won't ruin how I have done this though (no she is not alive)

It's also a harry and Daphne pairing, because I love daphne's character lol.
