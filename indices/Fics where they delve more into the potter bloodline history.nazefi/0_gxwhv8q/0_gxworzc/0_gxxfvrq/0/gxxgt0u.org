Ironically Morgana not being that bad, seems to be the original telling of the Arthurian canon. Her evil with Mordred for example, is a later addition.

The original telling, has her more as a Cartoon Villain, where one of her schemes was literally to scare Guinevere to death with the Green Knight. After that she pretty much retires and becomes a benevolent sorceress. She is then one of the few who attempt to heal Arthur and sail him to Avalon after the Strife of Camlann. That and she's a fairy, hence Le Fay.
