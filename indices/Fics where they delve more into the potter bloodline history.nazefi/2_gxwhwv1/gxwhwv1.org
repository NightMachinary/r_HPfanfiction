I am constantly confused about “Strong Blood” by CooLibrarian linkffn(7211094): there are some parts which are really great, and some which are very much not, and the whole thing is unfinished, but there is a lot of family histories (more Evanses, but some Potters as well, I believe).

Also, “Honour Thy Blood” linkffn(12155794) (the author is also working on rewrite of the story).
