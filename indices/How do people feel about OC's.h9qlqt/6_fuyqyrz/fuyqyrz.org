OCs for me are sometimes kinda annoying when there's a canon character more suited to the role, but mostly I just feel empty after finishing a fic with OCs that I grew to love, but then realising that I won't have anymore of their content or character available ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…. My favourite example of well developed ocs/blank slates is linkffn(The Second String)
