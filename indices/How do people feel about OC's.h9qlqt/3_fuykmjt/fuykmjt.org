An OC is like a wooden figurine. The more time you spend developing them, adding detail, shaving excess, giving background, putting them in a good spot, the better the result.

A good OC also follows several unspoken rules, and tries to explore little-mentioned corners of the fandom.

Daphne usually fits this bill pretty well, though her mileage may vary depending on variations.

Lastly, names are important. If your names suck, it turns me away. Reason it, make it not silly. Would a parent have named their child (X), really ?
