How I feel about OCs depend on two things: the reason the OC exists, and the way the OC is fleshed out. First, I want to be clear on one thing, though: the existence of OCs in a fic does not affect my willingness to read a fic in any way whatsoever beyond whatever other things/flaws the fic has going for it. An OC can make a fic worse, but it can also make a fic better, just like any other character in a fic. E.g. an "OC in all but name" character like Daphne doesn't make me more willing to read a story than an OC would with the same characterization.

Let's say your OC is a major character. In that case, the way the OC is characterized is important. While a Mary Sue OC might not make me drop a fic if it has other things going for it, it is IMO always a character flaw, and in that case I'd probably prefer no OC at all instead. But if the OC is there to fill out a gap left by existing characters, I don't really mind at all, and might actually consider it an improvement to the story.

Take, for example, the various Marauder-era fics out there. Typically, since I like to read Snape-centric fics, Marauder-era ones is likely to feature Lily to at least some extent -- no matter the kind of relationship they have in the fic (friends, enemies, lovers, whatever), due to her prominence in his (early) life. As a result, we're probably going to see her dormmates. If her only dormmate is Mary (which we know she is close with from canon), it would feel... empty. Thus, I don't mind sticking a couple of OCs to fill out the blanks in her year at all, even if the OCs aren't well-defined beyond "minor character who is a dormmate of Lily".

Your case is somewhat similar, and I would rather find /not/ having female OCs as Lily's friends more weird than having them. So yes, go ahead and create your OC(s)!
