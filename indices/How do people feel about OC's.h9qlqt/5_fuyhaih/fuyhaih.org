The real sin to OCs are in how their written. To expand on that.

Self inserts are fairly obvious and can be very good. They are also very difficult since characters without flaws are boring and weak writing. Even when it's not a one to one exactly OCs have a hard time staying separate from their authors. This means you need to take a very serious look at yourself and acknowledge your flaws.

Also too many OCs are just hard to keep track of and don't get enough character development. This is key in OCs just because we have zero frame of reference to work off of.

Lastly OCs need to be believable in world. Like I get fantasy fulfillment fics but when it gets to the point of a half-veela half merfolk hogwarts student who was adopted by the goblins who James loves and drops lily like a stone after meeting once, well you have just written a new story.

Regardless write it anyway. If noone likes it oh well.
