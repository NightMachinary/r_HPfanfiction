It depends.

OCs are generally great to put a new perspective into the plot, which is usually represented by the author's own thoughts. This prevents the protagonist from becoming OOC.

The same is true for an OC as the main protagonist. It provides a new outlook on canon or fanon. The author may feel a bit obstructed by canon characters but OCs give free rein to the author.

The problem occurs when the OC becomes a wish-fulfillment. There is no character development. The OC is a Gary Stu/Mary Sue cringe-fest, who shits rainbow, or is an overpowered asshole who gets all the girls.

It also gets worse when an OC is used to replace the main character, especially when the main character is present in the fic. This especially happens when a female character is a protagonist, who just steals the thunder from the canonical male protagonist.
