Not all OCs are created equal. I personally find it depends a lot on why there is an OC and (not shockingly) how well written they are. I personally don't love when people invent OCs just to fill a role that another character already has. Don't invent some kind of Mary Sue love interest when Hermione exists. (Or for that matter a fanon OC in Daphne). Acquila Black makes OOTP angsty Harry look like he has perfect control over his emotions and it's painful to read.

But there are fics with OCs I love too - linkffn(grow young with me) is probably my favorite in progress fic.

All that to say, if you're going to flesh them out, giving Lily a friend and giving them plenty of prominence sounds fine
