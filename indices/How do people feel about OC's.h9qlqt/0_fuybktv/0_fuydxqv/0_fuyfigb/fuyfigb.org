My problem with it is that it's usually done as an extra way to bash. People write an OC mentor to bash Dumbledore, an OC smart girl to bash Hermione, an OC guy-friend to bash Ron, etc. This is largely true of background characters (i.e. Daphne) too, to the extent most of them are basically OCs too. And the best are often the ones most distanced from actual characters for the same reasons

And you're right, it can be totally fine. But in my experience, the best OCs tend to be ones that fill a role no one else really does.
