That's what I'm aiming for, someone who fills a role that doesn't exist in canon - a mother figure for Harry who knew Lily and James and knew them well. A female counterpart for Sirius, I suppose.

The problem is of course that an OC can change everything - my plan/outline seems to have gone from "what if Lily had another friend" to "hmm, this person would also maybe have to be nice to Severus, hey what if Severus wasn't bitter and doesn't become a DE" to "if Severus isn't a DE, who is the spy" to "ok so what of Malfoy Snr was forced to take the mark by his dad and goes straight to Dumbledore" and I've now got a plan for a story I love but has twisted canon so much I think I'll get bashed if I post it!
