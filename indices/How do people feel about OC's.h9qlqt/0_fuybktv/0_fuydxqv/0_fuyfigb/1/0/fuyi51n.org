The main reason I hate bashing is because it's rarely done well. Weasley bashing especially, you get scenes like Ginny having a tantrum in Diagon Alley screaming "but I want to be Lady Potter and have all his moneyyyyyy and then kill him" and Molly giving Hermione love potions to keep her with Ron, then it turns out that she has been potioning Arthur for four decades etc etc. It's just totally unbelievable.

You don't want Ron to be Harry's friend in your story? Cool, make them less compatible - maybe your Harry is more into drawing than Quidditch and is quieter so ends up closer to Neville. Don't make it "looool Ron was being paid by Dumbledore and now he's been found out."
