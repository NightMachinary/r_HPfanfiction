OCs are fine by me, as long as they fit the story well and aren't /too/ much. Often you can get by with pseudo-OCs - people are a lot more likely to accept an OC that takes the name of a background character than if it's an entirely new character.

An example of that approach might be to appropriate Mary MacDonald (a technical character from the period) and have her be Lily's friend - or shift the age of the Longbottoms down a bit so that Alice is a year up from Lily or in the same year and having them be friends. Both of those characters are blank slates - but by virtue of being named in the books, people tend to be more accepting.

The issue with OCs is that sometimes they can overshadow other characters - so you have to be careful to make them, well, a character. I personally don't mind them, but good writing is the key - like it is with everything!
