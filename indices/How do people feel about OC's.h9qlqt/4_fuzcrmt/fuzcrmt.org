The problem with OCs is twofold for me.

First, there's the problem that 99% of OC characters are there purely to replace a character that's vilified by the fanfic, and to be a "better" version of that character. A lot of them are mary-sues for this exact reason - fixing all of the perceived flaws of a canon character leaves very little in the way of actual /character/.

Second, there's a /bunch/ of characters that can probably fill the same niche as whichever OC you want. In the books, a bunch of names appear in the same manner one would mention the background furniture. A prime example is Daphne Greengrass - the name gets mentioned /once/ in the books, as Hermione is exiting her OWL exams. Going purely off the books, we don't even know which House she's in.

In the Marauders era, this gets even easier to do. A lot of characters are mentioned as either being dead, tortured into insanity, or otherwise mentioned as having fought in the first war against Voldemort - characters we never get to meet. Need a best-friend for Lily? Marlene McKinnon, there you go. Or Alice Not-Yet-A-Longbottom.
