The only problem with OCs is that fanfiction is inherently lazy writing. Instead of doing all the work to make your own characters, settings, and even plots, fanfic authors mostly rely on someone else---the original author---to do the heavy lifting. So when we (the readers) read a new fic with, say, Hermione in it, we don't need to learn all about her from the beginning, we just import our existing knowledge of her. The fic author might make some tweaks to her characterisation, but that's still less work. And they'll be more focused on those tweaks than on her whole character, because they can rely on the readers to fill in any gaps.

An OC, on the other hand, requires the author to do all the work of characterisation from scratch. This is obviously a lot more difficult and results in more varied quality of writing.
