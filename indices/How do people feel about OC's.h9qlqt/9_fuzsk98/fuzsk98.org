There was a discussion posted a couple of weeks ago about our favourite OCs. Here's my comment from then:

#+begin_quote
  There's a lot of good OCs in both linkao3(The Heir of House Black) and linkao3(Basilisk Eyes).\\
  From THoHB, some highlights are Alex Fawley, Carmichael Wilkins, and Kaiden Potter.\\
  Basilisk Eyes has Gemma Boot, Mei Lee, and Tony Montague.

I think that when creating OCs you have to focus on making them feel like they would be able to fit in with canon. Could they have been a background character that Harry didn't pay attention to? Does their existence fundamentally alter what would have happened in canon?
