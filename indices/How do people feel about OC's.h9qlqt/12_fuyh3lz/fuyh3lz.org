For reasons other commenters have explained, I think writing an OC into an established setting is much harder to do than writing one into a setting that we know very little about, or an all-OC fic. Calypso Rosier from Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived and Lorena from To Be a Slytherin are very good OCs in somewhat canon settings, and even then they're both somewhat controversial and the setting is AU enough that their character can find a niche.

As much as Alexandra Quick or a next-gen fic might have really good OCs, it's really not very hard to find space for distinctive characters when you're working outside of canon. Your situation is a bit more complicated. You probably want to expand, not contract, Lily and Snape's characters, and any OCs you introduce into the story can't trod on them.

I haven't actually read it yet, but I've seen people point to linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba) as one of the very best examples of writing OCs in a canon setting. It's set during the Second War, not the first, but you might want to check it out to see how you can insert characters into a somewhat known plot.
