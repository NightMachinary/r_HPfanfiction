I never enjoyed main character OCs, I think because I have come to expect mary sues- but I dont think that's entirely fair, I'm sure there are good main characters OC fics out there, but I know for sure I'm probably not gonna them.

Background character OCs are a different story however. They're sort of necessary because it's not like every person in universe got an in universe name and personality.

I have a fic in my head set partly in the US, where they have to go for whatever reason, and meet someone who went missing during the war. Apart from those main characters, I'd have to add in OCs for the rest of the MACUSA workers. In my head that's fine because I like my OCs, but on paper, I feel like no one would want to read the fic if they feature too heavily because that would annoy myself as a reader. But I don't know how much to minimise them in the fic. Do I include names? Dialogue? Personality? Who knows.
