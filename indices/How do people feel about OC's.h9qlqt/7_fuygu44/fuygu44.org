The thing is, all the canon characters are Rowling's OCs, so what makes your OCs any different. The difference is that canon characters have baggage, they come with a pre-understanding of who they are, and what role they generally play in fanfiction. Umbridge, villainous bitch. Dumbledore, a very old and powerful wizard who is either a good, but flawed, mentor and leader of the good guys, or Albus the Senate Palpatine Sideous Dumbledore.

OCs on the otherhand are unknown entities, there's no canon/fanon characterization for them to fall back, so when you write, you're on your own.

And here's the thing in regards to all this, we are reading fanfiction, we are reading stories about the characters and worlds we know and like. If we want to read about new characters, we can just go to the library and find a book that's actually finished and had a publisher actually print it. This is not to say to not include OCs, but they have to be handled carefully, particularly in regards to the role they play in the story. Lupin or Bill equivalent, you're probably fine, even if the character is somewhat poorly written. Main character, love interest, or Ron and Hermione equivalent; and you better get it right and have a great character, and even then you will still have people who won't like him/her.
