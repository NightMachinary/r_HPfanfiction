I've just started reading a new story like this... I never learn from my mistakes. It started out kinda okay and got worse and worse each chapter, until suddenly Harry was part of the royal Goblin family, on first name basis with their king, heir of Merlin, and engaged to Hermione after only professing her love to her a few hours earlier.

You could do a whole story off *one* of those things not *all* of them at once (and I didn't even list all of what was going on). I have no idea why authors insist on writing such trainwrecks.
