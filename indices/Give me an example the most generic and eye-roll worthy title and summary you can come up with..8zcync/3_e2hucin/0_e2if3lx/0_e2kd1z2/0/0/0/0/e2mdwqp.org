/Looks at two open tabs/ Um...yeah, I never do that. /Quickly closes story where Harrys Twin sister is mistaken for the Girl who lived and James and Lily turns out to be terrible people who sends Harry to the Dursleys knowing he will be abused, and for some reason Regulus Blacks ghost appears and Harry gets blood adopted by the Malfoys quite literally out of the blue. Seriously, I might have to re-read something there, because why is he at the Malfoys?/ Wouldn't even think about getting 15 chapters into that fucking mess of a story. /Laughs nervously/

There's a bunch of great stories, and I still gravitate to the trainwrecks. I think part of the problem is that I tend to read a lot of stories at the same time, like I have 15 stories opened in tabs right now, and two pinboard tabs, actively reading 4 of them.
