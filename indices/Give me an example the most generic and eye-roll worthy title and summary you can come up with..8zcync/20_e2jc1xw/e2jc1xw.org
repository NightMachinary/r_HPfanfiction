*Harry Potter and the Just Desserts*

When Harry is killed in book 7, he meets Death, who is furious about how her Master was manipulated by Dumbledore and the Weasleys and how he never got together with any of his true soulmates. To make up for it, she sends Harry back in time to do things over. Dumbledore and Voldemort had better beware! Manipulative!Dumbledore, Evil!Weasleys, Independent!MOD!Gray!Harry, Harry/Harem. R&R!
