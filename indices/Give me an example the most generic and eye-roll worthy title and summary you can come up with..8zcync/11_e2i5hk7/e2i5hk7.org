Harry Potter doesn't come to Hogwarts because he has been missing for eleven years and no one knew it. What happens when a crazed headmaster tries to cover this fact up. Harry is secondary to Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape in this story. Plus you get a small taste of the of the Labyrinth's goblin king. Not enough to be a crossover, but an appetizer.

Megan falls in love with the most nonlove teacher you could ever imagine: Snape. How will she deal with it? And how will he? LAST CHAPTER UP!

In regards to "They're only 30 years apart" apparently Megan attends Hogwarts at 6 and is in love with a 36 year old Snape. Do people not bother to look up characters ages before they write things? my god.
