Vague Bullshit by robst.

Harry gets some help from Hermione and realizes he's in love with the goblins. Wait, reverse that. He's determined to evade Dumbledore's manipulations and go his own way, as long as that's the way Hermione goes when she leads him by the prick. Can he fulfill his destiny or whatever? It doesn't matter, you'll stop reading by word 200,000.
