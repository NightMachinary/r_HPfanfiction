I thought souls abound was pretty good mostly because it avoids the h/hr romance the most. Makes me sad this is the best one because I really like h/hr but good ones are so damn rare. I'm still looking for a complete h/hr where they are actual partners and they are both competent or similiar power levels. Also where Harrys they are both a focus instead of most where hermione is the focus.
