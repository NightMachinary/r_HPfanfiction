The Hidden Heir

When Hadrian was introduced to the magical world earlier than what Dumbles wanted, the house elf who rescued him warned him about the Potter, Peverell, and Slytheron lordships he'd have to assume once he contacted Gringot's. But, the elf forgot to warm him about the Black, Grifindor, Huffelpuf, Goku, and Jesus lordships. Follow Hadrian as he embarks on a magical first foray into Diagon Alley and meets his future soul mates. HP/GW/DG/NT/FD/TD/ Bash!AD/RW/MW Powerful!Harry Harem!Harry
