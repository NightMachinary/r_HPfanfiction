Here's something a little different, a generic crossover fic:

*Expecto Ninjutsu!*

/Team Seven was given a strange mission from the Hokage: To help protect Harry Potter in Hogwarts! Watch out wizarding world, here comes Naruto!/

Unfortunately this exact type of fic comprises 90% of the Naruto x Harry Potter crossover section on FF.net and I'm sick of it.
