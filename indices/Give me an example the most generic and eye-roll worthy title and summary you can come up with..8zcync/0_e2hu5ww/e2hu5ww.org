*Green eyes, dark heart*

Summary: Nothing is as it seems to be: Can a moody potions professor with a heart of gold help Harry? What are the Malfoys really up to? Severitus, MoD!Harry, Dumbledore bashing. Story is better than summary. Read and review.

Characters: Harry P., Severus Snape, <Hermione G., Draco M.>
