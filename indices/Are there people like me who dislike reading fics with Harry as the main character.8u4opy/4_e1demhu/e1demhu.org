I didn't come to fanfiction for stories about Harry anyway. He's not my favourite character; he's pretty passive and just seems to wait for things to happen, but that's the way canon is set up. I do feel he's been rather done to death in fanfiction but I'm not the target audience.

I don't mind him as an adult---I think there is potential for some good characterisation---but I admit I wouldn't read about him as a teenager. That's not because of Harry particularly though, it's because I'm old and don't much want to read about teenagers at all.
