The main issue I have with other characters being the MC is that people tend to over-glorify the characters they use.Hermione is the most intelligentestestestes of them all! SO beautiful! So mega! So uber! So awesome! So cool! So nice! So SJW! - ech. I wanna throw up.

If there were stories that went ahead, took the HP-Universe, its magic and its history and added an OC that creates his own path. That would be nice.Sadly most attempts simply retell the canon-story. WHICH IS BORING!
