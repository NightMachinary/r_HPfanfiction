First go and get lost in [[http://tvtropes.org][tv tropes]], Particularly, the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanficRecommendations][Fic recommendation]] page.

Find fics you like, then read them. Then Read them again, except this time carefully analyse them for the tropes you have come to know and love.

Then, read [[http://www.accessdenied-rms.net/guide/fwg.txt][this]].

Finally, started writing. Then keep writing. Then Write some more.

Writing is a skill like any other, so you have to build it up. the prior points are just so that you have a place to start.
