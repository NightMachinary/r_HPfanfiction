In response to the other people mentioning betas, they are correct in saying that is basically who you would want ideally. However in my experience the stories that get the best views, and are marvelous, are already "beta'ed". By that I mean proofed by a person who has no connection to the story. I know it seems a common sense thing to everyone who writes anything, especially here, but you would be surprised how much of a difference it makes in quality, and as a result view rates.

That being said, if a beta is not for you, I would recommend DLP. They are serious, but that only means that they will tell you objectively what is wrong/right with your piece. If it is a minor point/ not a point that would require a ton of background info, you can most likely get opinions in this subreddit. I wouldnt do it daily, or for every plot point since we are most likely the ones who will read your story anyway.

But from what I understand, you would require a beta. If you cant find one, message me on here and I will gladly do the service.
