there are not hard rules for writing only what you can make people feel and think about what you are writing is important for example i am writing a story where Harry becomes female I have Ron switch between him and her depending on the situation as a small nod that Ron is having a hard time separating his Best friend from Cute!Girl!harry

in your case it doesn't matter if your narrator calls them Dad/mom or Dan/Emma (*snicker*) as long as you don't confuse your readers.

who is your narrator? should he call them dad/mom or by their names? does it really matter? what sounds better? is important for your story's endgame?
