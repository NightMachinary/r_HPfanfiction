That's fair enough. I don't even have a beta, though, and honestly I'd never heard of the concept until a few days ago. Maybe if I ever get around to posting my 'fic and it actually gets a lot of views(unlikely to happen) then I'll consider getting one.

Kind of weird questions, because they can be super specific at times. However, here's a silly question I have. As the narrator, I think I'll go with using the character's parent's name- so, instead of "Dad gave him an extra ten galleons, just in case." it'd be "David gave him an extra ten galleons" or "Emma hugged him before he left." However, obviously, the character is going to refer to them as mom and dad.

Is this weird? Because it's weird to me, but it's a good weird, and I kinda like the style. It'd feel weird to me to refer to them as "Mom" and "Dad", especially because the fanfic starts with a situation where the character isn't even there and his parents are talking to McGonagall, so in that situation I'll obviously name them. Of course this might be par for the course, but honestly, given how little fiction doesn't make a character an orphan...I don't even remember what kind of style is usually used!
