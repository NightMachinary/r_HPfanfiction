I wouldn't say it's weird. Some of it depends on your style of writing, some of it depends on the perspective you're using. If you're using 3rd person limited, for example, I doubt it would be out of place, or at least not very much. 3rd person omniscient would be more-so, and I would use their names in that case. First person it /would/ be out of place to use their names, from the perspective of the son. But whatever you decide on, be consistent! Even if people notice it at first, it'll become normal as they keep reading.
