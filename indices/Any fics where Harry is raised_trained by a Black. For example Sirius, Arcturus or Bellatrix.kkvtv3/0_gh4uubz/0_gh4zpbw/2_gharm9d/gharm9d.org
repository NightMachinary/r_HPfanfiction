It sadly feels like, while the story is great, all of his other fics are basically rehashes of it that follow the same plotline just with different names and settings. The Tonks one has a Daphne named Tonks, the Bellatrix one has a Daphne named Bellatrix, same exact tropes and personalities for Harry, Arcturus, Sirius etc.
