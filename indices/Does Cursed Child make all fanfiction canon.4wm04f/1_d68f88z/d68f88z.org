How I have chosen to interpret this cow pat is that while it does not make all fan fiction canon it makes every fan fiction AU a possible and valid outcome of canon. Splitting hairs I know but even so it works for me.

It means it is valid to build your own canon from the material that speaks to you and pass by that which doesn't.
