I consider pacing on a higher level than that, just below plotting.

On point, yes and no. I've concluded that Harry Crow is paced well for what it's supposed to be: feel-good pablum where good things happen to good people, bad things happen to bad people, and all children are above average. The pacing is actually a feature, not a bug: you can keep reading and reading about yet another easy victory, yet another good thing happening to a good person, and yet another bad thing happening to a bad person.

HPMoR feels like the author shoved every idea he had for showing off how clever he is into the fic. What We're Fighting For, I don't remember the quality of pacing, but that's because I found plot and characterisation too distasteful to even pay attention to pacing.
