linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph14) is a heavy AU that has him raised by Lily, after James dies at war.

linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader) has him raised in a Muggle institution that (accidentally) ends up specialising in Muggleborns whose parents can't handle the Accidental Magic.

linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5) has Harry raised by The Order in exile in France.

There's also the Grey Maiden series, where he is raised in North America by a Ravenclaw OC who is Lily's friend from Hogwarts. You'll have to google around for the title.
