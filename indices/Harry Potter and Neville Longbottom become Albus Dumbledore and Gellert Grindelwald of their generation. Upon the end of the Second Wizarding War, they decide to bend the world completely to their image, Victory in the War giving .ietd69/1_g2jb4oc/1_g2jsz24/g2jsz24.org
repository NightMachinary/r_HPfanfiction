With Hermione and their respective backstories and personalities I think Hermione would be the one easier to fit into a Dumbledore mold in fighting from within the system for equality while Harry grows disillusioned with the governments and starts a revolution. Though then again if it is regarding the Statute of Secrets Hermione would be the most likely to try abolishing it while Harry fights to keep it and maybe even making the divide greater.
