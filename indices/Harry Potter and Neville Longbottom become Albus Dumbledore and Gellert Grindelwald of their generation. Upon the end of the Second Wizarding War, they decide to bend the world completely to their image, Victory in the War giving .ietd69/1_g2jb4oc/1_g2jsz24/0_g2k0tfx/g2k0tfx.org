I don't see why Harry would fight to keep the Statue of Secrecy. He literally got emotionally abused for a decade, and absoutely hated his relatives and going back to Privet Drive.

I can see a timeline where Harry grows so bitter and frustrated by the divide that he wants to break the Secrecy because of the injustice he faced. Heck, I could even see him agree with Grindelwald's speech of "/A law that has us scuttling like rats in the gutter! A law that demands that we conceal our true nature! A law that directs those under its dominion to cower in fear lest we risk discovery! I ask you, Madam President--- I ask all of you---who does this law protect? Us? Or Them?/" because he himself was hidden.
