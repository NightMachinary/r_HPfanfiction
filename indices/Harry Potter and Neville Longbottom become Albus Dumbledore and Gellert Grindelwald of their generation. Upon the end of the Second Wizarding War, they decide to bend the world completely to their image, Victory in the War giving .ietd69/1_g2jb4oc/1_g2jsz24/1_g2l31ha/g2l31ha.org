  Statute of Secrets

Yes. My thought was that they'd start out trying to breach the gap between the two worlds. Hermione grows increasingly more violent against wizarding obstinacy all the while Harry is learning about the wizarding world and the Potters specifically. In the end it would completely break with Hermione trying to destroy the statute so as to give muggles access to magical things, specifically medicine, and Harry being wholly against it.

Or, as someone suggested on DLP once, you could have a Harry who is exhausted of fighting while Hermione wants to keep going. He supports her from the wings, but then her mind begins to wander to the Unbeatable Wand.
