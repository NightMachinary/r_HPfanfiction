I really like this prompt, but if I could just make a little suggestion, "What we do is for the Greater Good" may sound a bit too much like Grinderwald slogan (judging Krum reaction at the Lovegoods in DH, people have not forgotten).\\
Maybe Harry and Neville could use another seemingly nice slogan which could later be corrupted by their actions (especially if they follow the Dumbledore/ Grinderwald road with one of them regretting their action while the other commit atrocities). Something like "Never Again" or "For the Future".
