I'm going to be cheeky enough to mention my own story, Holly Potter and the Witching World. It's only six chapters in, and no real pairing yet, but I can tell you that I'm not planning on hooking her up with either FemDraco or Hermione... Tom Riddle is still male in this universe, and regardless of gender /definitely/ not a romantic prospect.
