Seems interesting, but why is it showing that only has 2 chapters instead of 6? Or you meant that you had written 6 but haven't released them yet? TBH, I love ongoing fics, as long as they get updated, I don't mind the wait. Hell, I've been waiting for months for "I'm still Here" like 80% of this reddit population...
