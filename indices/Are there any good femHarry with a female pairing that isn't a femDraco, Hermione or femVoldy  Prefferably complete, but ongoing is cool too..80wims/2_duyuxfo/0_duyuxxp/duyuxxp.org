  Ginny Weasley is straight - she's had boyfriends, after all. But when she sets her sights on a position with the Holyhead Harpies (the only all-women Quidditch team in the League), she decides that going to the Harpies' favourite hangout - which is also London's only wizarding lesbian bar- and pretending to be a lesbian will help her chances of getting on the team. She decides to bring Harriet along for support - unaware that Harriet is in the closet, and terrified of anyone finding out.But Ginny's reasons for going to the Kitty Kat Club are more complex than Harriet knows - and maybe people finding out the truth about Harriet won't be such a disaster, after all.
