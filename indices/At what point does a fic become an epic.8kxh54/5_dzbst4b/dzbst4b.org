When it's passed down generation to generation in an oral tradition that stretches back thousands of years... o no wait that's epic poetry. #goals tho (if u want to work those writerly muscles try writing in dactylic hexameter... “Evangeline” by Longfellow is a great example. It mimics the meter used by Homer and other epic poets.)
