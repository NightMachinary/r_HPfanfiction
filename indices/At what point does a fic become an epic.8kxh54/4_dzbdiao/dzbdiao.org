To me it's a combination of good writing + 250k or more words. That puts it at about OoTP length at minimum, and it has to be coherent rather than rambling to up the word count.

I'm pretty much in full agreement with the other comments here, I'm just also not inclined to count something at 100-150k words as an epic.
