I'd say the quality of writing defines an epic, really.

The traditional definition of epic is "long story (technically poem) with a hero doing hero things." But to me, an epic needs to /feel/ epic. Prince of Slytherin, despite being long as all hell and having a ton of world building, lacks the feeling of vastness to the universe. On the other hand, the writing and atmosphere of By The Divining Light lead to an epic feel.

That was a lot of 'epics.'
