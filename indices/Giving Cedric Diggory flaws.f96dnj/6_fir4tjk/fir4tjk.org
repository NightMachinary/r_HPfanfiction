If you look at Canon, I really think that Diggory is "perfect". Rowling made a caracter without any flaw (except maybe his lack of iniative while put in a dangerous situation but I think it's more about Harry being way too much used to it while Cedric is more at the "normal" level) so his death would make everyone safe.

I even disagree with you about his lack of competitive edge, rather than that, I think it's more about his other qualities that kinda counteract it :

- Cedric wanted to win the Quidditch match and focused on the Snitch. It's just that he later found out that he only won because Dementors entered on the field, and decided his victory was dishonorable, hence why he proposed a rematch. And even when he father pointed out that "Harry felt while you stayed on your broom", he probably understood that the Dementors had more effect on Harry, and could easily understand why.
- Cedric wanted to win the Triwizard Tournament, and did his best. But unlike his Housemate, he was kind enough to not start bullying a younger roomate even if he was dissapointed that a Gryffindor stole the attention Hufflepuff finally got. He was so honourable that he felt obliged to help Harry understand the clues for the 2nd time after he revealed the 1st Task to him, even when he was a competitor. And in front of the Cup, he knew that he only managed to reach this point because Harry had saved him twice (from Krum and the Acromantula). So he was ready to step down.

Cedric had plenty of competitive spirit, but unlike someone like say Draco Malfoy, how he won mattered as much to him that the victory.\\
Anyways, I don't think Cedric had any "true" character flaw like other members of the cast. So at this point you can ever just invent one (any could work as long as he is not a complete asshole and it's pretty discrete. Maybe he was a bit jealous and insecure while in relation. Harry being rejected by Cho was one thing, but maybe he would be truly bothered if he had later started to be close to Cho "as a friend"). Or maybe you could push one of his qualities to the point of annoyance, say someone so caring he will not let a friend who seem bothered in peace, even if said friend really don't want to talk about his problems.
