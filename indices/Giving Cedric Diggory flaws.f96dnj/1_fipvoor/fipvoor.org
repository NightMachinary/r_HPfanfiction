Harry has lived through a lot of shit. Murdered parents, evil Dursleys, three headed dogs, teachers playing host to your arch nemesis. A ruddy great snake with death ray eyes, hundreds of dementors and a werewolf by the time we get to fourth year. Cedric was in the castle when some of this happened but wasn't really in danger.

Then comes the Triwizard tournament. Seems like a laugh, bit of glory for Hufflepuff and you know what he even makes it as a champion. Fuck yeah, but now he has to deal with the expectations of the school. Only holy fucking shit they want him to fight a dragon. The kid years younger than him doesn't even blink. They want him to fight a dragon. A bloody great dragon.

Cedric knows he only beat Harry in quidditch because Harry was attacked by Dementors. It only counts as a win because I don't think dementor attacks were included as a valid reason to stop the game. somehow this one win and now being champion means he's expected to win the whole Triwizard thing.

Cedric is a normal hardworking Hufflepuff with a loving family. He's not cut out for all this life and death stuff and it should worry him. He should regret entering. He should swing between the shame of being beaten by a 14 year old and rationalising it to himself that the 14 year old is Harry Potter.
