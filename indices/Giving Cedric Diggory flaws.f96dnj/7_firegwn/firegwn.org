I'm not sure what all the trusting/naive/idealist comments are all about - in canon he didn't believe Harry about not putting his name in the goblet. He wasn't actively mean to Harry, but he also didn't try very hard (or seemingly at all) to stop his house from bullying Harry or to publicly reach out to Harry. Cedric is not a hero or paragon of virtue, he's just not an arsehole.

His negative traits are:

- Passive - too willing to accept things at face value, will go along to get along rather than standing up for others, etc.
- Lacks depth - I think the Goblet is the first time he's faced an actual challenge. He's like James Potter in that as the handsome, popular only child of a loving financially stable couple, he hasn't had many obstacles in his life. He hasn't been in a situation where he'd suffered or had to make a significant sacrifice to reach his goals. He comes off as immature or naive in that way.
- Maybe a little conceited? Not a lot, just someone who doesn't get rejected socially and is not used to it and so may not know how to handle it.
