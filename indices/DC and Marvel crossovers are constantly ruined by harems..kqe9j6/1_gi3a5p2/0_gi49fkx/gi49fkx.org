I couldn't agree more. Especially as Marvel, which gets far more crossovers than DC, is so expansive in its most popular canon. Trying to stick to the canon pretty much means you're stuck with an endless story which doesn't actually /do/ anything.

How many times has Harry rescued Tony from his cave... but only /after/ Tony has the chance to build the suit, and poor old Yinsen has his chance to die? Is it more times than he has somehow, inexplicably, became trapped in that same cave, I wonder?

Because we wouldn't want to drop an Ironman sized spanner in the works. That would be far too interesting.
