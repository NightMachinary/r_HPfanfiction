It is very important that your fic have the words "some Granger girl"... for absolutely no reason. I swear that half of the rules of that challenge are there specifically to make the story as awful as possible.

But at least that challenge has actually resulted in stories being created, even if almost all of them are awful. I'm pretty sure that every Vegas challenge story I've seen has been abandoned shortly after the "figuring out what happened last night" scenes, because there's basically no plot left after that point and the author has no idea what to do.
