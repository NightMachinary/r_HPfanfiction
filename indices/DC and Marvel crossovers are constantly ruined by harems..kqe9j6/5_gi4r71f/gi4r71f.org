I do believe it to be possible to write a decent harem/multi fic. Obviously, reading a fic like that requires suspension of disbelief, because this isn't something that would happen in real life.

I'm writing a multi fic, and I make certain to give every woman her time in the sun, explore their characters, and give them a distinct role in the story.

As for body types... I don't go into too much detail, and only vaguely describe their bodies, allowing the reader to do it themselves.

Oh, and there's no smut.
