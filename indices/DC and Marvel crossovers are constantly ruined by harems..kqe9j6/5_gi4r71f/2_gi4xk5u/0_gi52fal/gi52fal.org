Hey man, I don't like these kind of fics neither but this is fanfiction - the whole point of it is to create something that isn't canon, possibilities, what ifs, AUs, etc.

Also nobody is forcing you to read these kind of things (and therefore "ruining" you childhood) just don't click on it and move on. For example, if I see a fic tagged Snape/Harry I just ignore it and keep scrolling.
