Reptilia28's Don't Fear the Reaper Challenge. It spawned a genre of stories that are a goddamn plague -- there's little-to-no originality in the stories, and it's all the same rehashed shit over and over and over...

Megamatt09 is an... infamous writer on FFn. Enough said there. XD

Blood Brandy's Vegas Challenge... it's always a plot set-up for piss poor Indie Harry stories or for Harry to be automatically hooked up with that crossover setting's attractive lady/ladies. Of course the married women/girls are always fine with it, you know.
