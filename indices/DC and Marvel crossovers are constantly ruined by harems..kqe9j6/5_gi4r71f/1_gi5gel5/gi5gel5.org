The only way a "multi" fic would work?

1. Love triangles. Even then it wouldn't really be a "multi" but drama and conflict, be it from one person moving on to another partner and the former paramour trying to win them back, or the character being torn between two competing love interests
2. Character dates X for XX amount of chapters. They eventually break up or move on with their lives. Character then dates Y for XX amount of chapters. X comes back into the picture XX chapters later. Drama happens.
3. Character cheats on their paramour, with the side piece either being complicit or unknowing.

Poly and open relationships are bullshit that in 99% of the cases do not work -- the only reason they've gained traction is because people publicize the one out of a hundred-thousand relationship that did end up working than the ninety-nine thousand marriages and relationships that crashed and burned.

Reptila's challenge is one of those that wants to make you gouge out your own eyes -- it's a goddamn plague. And Megamatt09 dominates DC and Marvel crossovers with his pre-teen views on relationships and sexual harem bullshit.

I'd read a story where Harry was torn between a competing Stargirl and Supergirl -- that's drama, and it happens in real-life. I wouldn't read some wank fantasy that has him with both at the same time and their being perfectly fine with it.

...Actually, that'd be pretty hilarious to read, but still.
