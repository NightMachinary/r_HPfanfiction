Exactly. Personally, I really think Harry and Scarlet Witch would be fun to read. Two people who rather shitty childhoods that have trauma they faced, but also arguably blessed with powers. Added to that, she always seems to be underutilized. Anyone who has fics like this they know of, comment them please. Even if it is a harem, I'd still read it just for their interactions.
