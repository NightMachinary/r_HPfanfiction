For a moment I thought this was referring to actual DC/Marvel crossover events and I was wondering "Whoa what have I been missing in these comics"

But, anyways, agreed!

Why can't I have a fic where Harry interacts with the Marvel or DC universe without him also boinking every female in it? Which makes his interactions a) predictable and b) all the same. And also, since many of these women have canon love interests in-universe, destroying a lot of their characterizations.
