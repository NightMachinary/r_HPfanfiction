I agree with you on the need for putting care into crossovers. Too often writers take the easy route of having one side solve all the problems of the other, which in a way defeats the purpose.

Uncharitably, harems in crossover fic seem like a way for author avatars to live out their superhero fantasies.

To contribute, here's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27622472/chapters/67580753][my take]] on a DC crossover. The premise is an amicable/ambiguous WBWL situation (it's not clear if there even is a true BWL at first), where Kal-El lands in Godric's Hollow where Lily, James, and Harry are hiding. A theme through DC is that different worlds/reboots all sort of end up taking a similar shape, but it's all kicked off by the arrival of Kal-El. My goal with this crossover is as a full AU of both -- a synthesis of character and setting, so instead of Batman existing as Bruce Wayne all the way over in Gotham, circumstances contrive themselves so an existing character in the Harry Potter setting becomes essentially Batman.
