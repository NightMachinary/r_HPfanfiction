Keep up the good work, I love all your fics. Honestly I never set foot in DC fics because I just don't know any DC lore, just bare bones what you get from existing. But I was bored over Christmas, ended up reading both Kicking Gotham and Toppling Heroes in 2 days.

I know you're good at providing needed background info to people who don't know lore from your Shadow of Angmar, but it really showed in these stories because I knew basically nothing while I already had most of the needed background knowledge for LotR. Also how you mix in the HP magic world into the world of bot DC and LotR feels so clean.

I love your stuff.
