Well, there is at least one more story in the HP/DC fusion setting I made up. Maybe two more, depending on how things shake out as I tighten up my plan for number three.

Anyway, I'm glad you enjoyed it, and didn't feel too lost in the DC stuff. I try to add references that will be understood by people 'in the know', without ever making the story hinge on that knowledge.
