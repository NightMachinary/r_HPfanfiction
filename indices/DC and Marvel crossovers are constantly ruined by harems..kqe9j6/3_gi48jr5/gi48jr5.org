This is something which has long been a source of frustration for me. I feel like a crossover has enough work to do in merely making the crossover aspect work, and giving the disparate characters and settings their due. Adding harems and multi-pairings just seems like a bad idea in the circumstances, really. I'm not a fan of harems at the best of times, but in crossovers I feel like they are more common (relatively) despite being even harder to pull off than in non-crossover stories.

I've been trying to improve matters (well, in my view, anyway. I'm sure there are plenty of people who do not or would not like my stories) with [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13521865/1/Kicking-Gotham][Kicking Gotham]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13694861/1/Toppling-Heroes][Toppling Heroes]], but I'm only one person. I'd love to see other people try out their own takes on Marvel & DC crossovers, without feeling like they need to stay in the well-worn footsteps of Megamatt or the Blood Brandy Challenge.
