Sometimes, it feels like Fanfics in general are ruined by harem. It's more visible on AO3 than on FF, but I'm often amazed by the sheer number of Harems fics, and how popular they are, with the exceptions of some rare gems, it's almost as if the most popular fics are only harems sometimes (though it may depends of the fandoms I guess).

In the case of "Smut" fics I have nothing to say (since harems seem to be pretty much the point of these fics), but I'm a little tired of all these fics where the "fixed MC" (who somehow became perfect by having a epiphany and training for 2 paragraphs during the prologue) seems to spend all his time sleeping with every named female character of the fandoms (plus some genderbended male ones) rather than . . . saving the world.
