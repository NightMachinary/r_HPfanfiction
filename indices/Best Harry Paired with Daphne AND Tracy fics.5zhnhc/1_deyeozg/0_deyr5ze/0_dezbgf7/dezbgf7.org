Yes she's a major character, I just have ...issues.

What definition? I dont claim to be be an expert in harems, but I do know that the word originated from 'harim' which was an area in a Islamic household where female members resided.(Iv read some Moghul fiction) This word was later twisted into harem due to many factors. Id honestly consider more than 1 female with a male as a harem.
