The word originates from ḥarama (be prohibited). It later became shortened to ḥaram or ḥarīm in the 17th century. It actually isn't quite where "female members resided", although the translation does describe a prohibited place where women reside. A truer description would be a place within the Muslim household where wives, concubines, and servant women resided.

While there is no actual agreed upon set amount in any documentation as far as I know, these original ḥarama, were intended to be 12-24 women in size on the lower side, although for kings and other powerful individuals, they could be hundreds of women in size (or even thousands). Keep in mind its wives AND concubines AND female servants. So that does sorta make sense.

Now, if you look at a separate portion of history, early Japanese Manga and Anime used the 6 or more women definition, and more recently 4 or more women (Although sometimes its 3).

I said 6 because it was a compromise between the original definition and what is in Manga and Anime. I also dont think 2 or 3 women to a guy really should constitute a harem since that would mean anyone with an open relationship or similar would fall in that bracket. As would practicing Polygamists which again, is quite a different thing than the definition of a Harem.

For example... Here is a good comparison: [[http://the-difference-between.com/polygamy/harem]]

Notice that the Islamic form of Polygamy is a man with UP TO 4 WIVES (so not more than 4). As in, 4 wives is not a Harem.
