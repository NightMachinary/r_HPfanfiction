Yes my knowledge comes from fictional series. But the area contained all the female members, not only the ones married/serving the king. For example, his sisters, daughters, mother/step mother etc. So the numbers are a bit misleading as you said.

I'd hardly consider Manga and Anime as proof of anything, but I guess I agree that in the technical sense Harem would have to have more than just 2.

Because upto a certain number, a man can be dedicated to each wife/member, till that point it could be considered as a relationship(in the romantic sense). Harem implies that the females are dedicated to the male and it is all about him, not the female participants.

FYI: My source of info is the series 'Empire of the Moghul'
