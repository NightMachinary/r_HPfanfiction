I agree its a bit of a grey area because there is no "absolute" total (minimum or maximum) in the official and historical definition of a harem. In fact, most of the numbers with regards to the Islamic/Muslim definitions and descriptions (12-24 or others), come from interviews, historical commentary, and the like, and they are ALL over the map. And yes, Manga and Anime are not exactly proof of anything but then again, we are talking about Harem as defined in the sense of Harry Potter fan fiction ;)

Honestly I think the strongest proof of a harems size relates to the distinct definitions of Harem vs Polygamy. Clearly 2 very different ideals, definitions, and intents behind the words.

  Because upto a certain number, a man can be dedicated to each wife/member, till that point it could be considered as a relationship(in the romantic sense). Harem implies that the females are dedicated to the male and it is all about him, not the female participants.

The only problem with this statement is that a man with 1 wife can not be dedicated and expect the wife to be dedicated to him and its all about him. That said, there is certainly a "transition" point where even the most dedicated man (to his wives), simply has too many to be able to dedicate enough time or provide enough support (not financially).

If I personally had to put a number on the transition from Polygamy or group relationship to Harem.... I would say 8 is the transition point. But that's a personal viewpoint.
