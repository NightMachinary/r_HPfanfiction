Ive read a few that dont have her paired with harry or even that involved, but yea I somewhat agree. Than again, she is a MAJOR player in the original books so it makes sense she ends up in the mix a lot, regardless of if its a harem or not.

Than again, is Harry/Daphne/Tracy (and even Hermione thrown in) a harem? Not really, since the actual original definition of a Harem requires 6+ women (half a dozen), and is more traditionally between 12-24 (in real world situations... yes they still exist in todays world).
