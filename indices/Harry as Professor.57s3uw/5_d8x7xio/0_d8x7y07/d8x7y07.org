  Harry is Teddy's adoptive father. What will happen when Harry follows Teddy to Hogwarts 10 years after the war to become the new Defense professor, while Snape has returned as Potions Master? With Neville, Luna (married) and Charlie on staff as well, it is bound to be an interesting time. Eventual Snarry but very slow build.
