Harry is sent back to the early seventies, one of it's greatest points is it's combat, it's very creative in its spell work.

might not be quite what you're looking for though, Harry is good but more than willing to kill, as in he killed a squad of death eaters in the very first chapter. oh and it doesn't have Dumbledore bashing, some philosophical debating between the two of them, but nothing i'd call bashing.
