Azkaban itself is a very “warded” place as it was only found by accident. It used to be a lab of some sorts, that is heavily protected. While I do think the ministry would ward it further, they might not have bothered to ward it more. Also the wizards and witches that are locked up might not use the house elves as they might be under the impression that it won't work, in truth no one bothered to try. Thus is there no reason for the ministry to make sure no one escaped due to their arrogance. If that makes sense
