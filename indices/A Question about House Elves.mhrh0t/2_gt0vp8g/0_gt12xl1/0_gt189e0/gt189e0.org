Weren't there anti apparition charms in the cave? If they were, Kreacher went through them because his master ordered him to "come home". I believe orders give them purpose, and purpose (intent) is a big part of magic. Dobby probably sees Harry as his saviour and values his directions as orders. When Harry asked for help in the mirror, Dobby heard and entered Malfoy Manor (probably, he was never ordered to not enter the Manor, or once allowed always allowed). Then Harry asked him to take Luna and Ollivander to Shell cottage and then go back. He then went for the trio, always under Harry's directions. When Harry called Kreacher in Private Drive, it was with the intent of him appearing, so it was an "order" and I believe it is what pushes Elfs magic to come to their masters.

That said, I do think they can be stopped. I don't think it possible for a wizard calling their Elfs to Azkaban to break them out. Either it has a "no Elfs can enter" ward or it breaks the link to their masters. You can probably make it up.
