For the wards, is that just that anti-apparition protections don't work for them as they do not use human apparition, but wards designed for them could. Also, owners can apparate into their houses and Dumbledore can apparate in Hogwarts, so maybe all the times we see them ignore wards it is just because they are explicitly allowed to. Remember Dobby used to be the Malfoy house elf, so presumably he had permission, and perhaps either the family forgot to remove him or they couldn't (would need to recast them entirely or for Dobby to be there in person maybe).
