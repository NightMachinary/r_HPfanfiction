  Also in terms of how much house elves can do. Hogwarts has 'hundreds' of elves, which within an order of magnitude an elf per inhabitant.

I like to think there are house elves working in places other than the kitchens. The hospital wing, for one, might have elves helping out behind the scenes.

I'm sure they still have to do a certain amount of polishing, cleaning, etc. even allowing for Filch, cleaning spells/self-cleaning items, and cleaning products. Maybe Filch does the daily high-traffic cleaning (stairs) and the house elves do the general castle maintenance? E.g. cleaning the large unused portions of the castle. They also clean the common rooms (OOTP), and possibly the dormitories.

Where I suspect their magic works best is en masse, sort of like a colony of ants can devour an insect carcass far more efficiently than one alone.

  The privately owned elves each served a small family [...] the work they do doesn't seem to be irreplaceable, so is it fair to say that a single elf might actually be less useful than an average wizard in getting stuff done, i.e. their magic is different enough to break a few minor rules that wizards follow, but not particularly powerful.

I'd say so, yes. The most powerful thing we see Dobby do is block Harry's post. I imagine that house elves were probably like the elves we are familiar with (kobolds/brownies/â€˜traditional' elves who may help around the house/bring good luck if left offerings), but gradually became enslaved and then just became a status symbol/property of the house.
