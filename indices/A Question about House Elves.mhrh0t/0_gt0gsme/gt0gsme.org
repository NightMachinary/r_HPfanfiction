In Half-Blood Prince, Harry manages to summon Kreacher by calling for him. He also manages to get Dobby too, since at the time Dobby and Kreacher are fighting.\\
Later on in Deathly Hallows, Kreacher explains that he was recalled by Regulus after being used by Voldemort at the cave, and Dobby is able to pop into Malfoy Manor to rescue Harry & co., with a little direction from Aberforth.\\

As a side note, I notice that earlier in the book, when Dumbledore summons Kreacher, the way he explains things, Kreacher is bound to Grimmauld Place and was inherited along with it. There's a usable idea somewhere in there...
