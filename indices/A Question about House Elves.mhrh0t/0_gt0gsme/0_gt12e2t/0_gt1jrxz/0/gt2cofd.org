It could also be that Kreacher was to come home after the Voldemort was done with his services.

If you think about the scenario like this:

Voldy makes Kreacher drink the potion and leaves him to die.

But Kreacher need explicit instructions that voldy is done with him.

Kreacher asks for help from voldy (cause hes just drank the equivalent of dementor spit).

And voldy is just like "lol. No. I don't need you anymore so just die quietly - m'kay? Cheerio"

So Kreacher takes that as "well he said he doesn't need my help anymore. Master said to come home when we're done. I can go home to master and 'die quietly' indeed. Prick."

Kreacher wasnt Called home BUT had specific instructions to Come Home.
