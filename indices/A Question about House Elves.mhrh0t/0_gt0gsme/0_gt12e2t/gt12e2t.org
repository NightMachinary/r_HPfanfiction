I feel that could still be construed as the 'master' actively notifying the elf that they are wanted, and it is up to the elf to make their way to them. Maybe they can find their master over short distances, but Kreacher would have already known that Harry was at Hogwarts and Regulus just called Kreacher home. I don't like the idea that house elves are always looking over their master's shoulder and will appear every time their name is mentioned, or can be used to immediately find anyone.
