I dislike the super powerful house elves, who can magic food out of nothing and can basically do anything the master wants.

As far as canon goes, they can pop in and out of pretty much anywhere, or at least anywhere they have permission to be (or know of). Dobby knows Malfoy Manor, both of them were accepted into Hogwarts with permission from the Headmaster. We don't have any evidence if they can teleport anywhere they want to.

Apasrt from that and the ability to levitate and push with their magic, they don't seem to be able to do much (Dobby is stupid overpowered in CoS and then suddenly loses the ability to directly manipulate magic, if all elves could do that they would be used as untracable assassins and saboteurs, not as kitchen staff).

I always liked if the author shows the house elves actually doing things by hand, as in cooking or cleaning, not just by clicking their fingers. Most fanfictions makes them almost omnipotent, but the stupid purebloods never catch on to that, becaue they are bigots of the highest degree, and other such nonsense.
