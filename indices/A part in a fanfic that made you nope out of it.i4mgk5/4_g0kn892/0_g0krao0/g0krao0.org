Often times, Mpreg is because they want M/M couple to have blood-related children, related to both parents. Mostly so they can look like both the parents. (Draco face with Harry eyes for example)

I don't read those because it often times author implies some stuff about the importance of genetics in someone personality that I wildly disagree with. And it also implies that blood family is better which makes me angry.

And authors don't intent to do this, usually. Which tell me that they didn't really think things through, and weren't careful with their word choice and/or phrasing. And this is rarely a sign of a good fanfiction.
