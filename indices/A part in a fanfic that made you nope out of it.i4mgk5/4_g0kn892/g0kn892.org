I usually nope out of a fanfic when:

1) Horrible grammar 2) No coherent plot 3) Creature Heritage (I don't really get the idea of that) 4) MPreg (Don't understand that either) 4) Too descriptive when introducing a house, clothes, etc. 5) Any implied rape scenes

That's probably all, can't think of anymore
