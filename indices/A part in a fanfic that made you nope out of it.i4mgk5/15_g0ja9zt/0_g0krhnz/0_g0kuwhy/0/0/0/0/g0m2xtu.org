I mean... some people, some times, wake up having thought of a terrible thing. Most people forget, or repress, or otherwise dispose of any thought of the terrible thing. Some people turn that thing into art. This is like the modern version of those Hieronymous Bosch Paintings and Lovecraftian Writings. :D

Also some people do think of some fucked up shit. Horror movies, that Darknet game, some of the actual stuff coming out of that IRL, etc.

And 'normal' people are also capable of some seriously fucked up things too, for the record. Regular people with no history of violence in The Stanford Prison Experiment went fully barbaric in less than six days, and repeated electrocuted fake-people to death in the Milgram shock experiment. Social Psychology is powerful stuff.
