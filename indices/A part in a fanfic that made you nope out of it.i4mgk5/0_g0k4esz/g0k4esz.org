There's a top three for me and I can stand most of the stuff but there is:

- The fic is advertised about how different Harry will be but follow cannon religiously; if you're advertising a Hufflepuff! Necromancer! Harry but it only begins on chapter 32 and I have to read PS and CoS again...( Snape asks about the draught of living dead, bezoar and wolfsbane, Quirrel stutters and Hagrid talks about Fluffy.);

- Hermione went to the library for one hour, came back with the location of the Holy Grail, the recipe of the philosopher's stone 2.0, the secret album of the Beatles and a law saying Harry must have fifteen wives (is she the only person that knows how to read?) ;

- Daphne accepted Harry's invitation to a date and explained the laws and pureblood culture, in a icy way, without blinking, because it's normal for a teen to be so political that Churchill and Thatcher would think it's too much;
