As stated above:

1. Hermionewank Grandstanding

2. Mugglewank Worldbuiliding

As you haven't really articulated your objection, it's unclear to me whether you are saying (i) you like Hermionewank and Mugglewank, (ii) you don't think those 2 quotes are genuine examples of Hermionewank and Mugglewank, or (iii) you don't know what the terms mean.
