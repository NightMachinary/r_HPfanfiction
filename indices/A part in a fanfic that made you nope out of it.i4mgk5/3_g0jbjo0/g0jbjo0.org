i nope out of a fic when there is

1. unnecessary bashing.
2. horrid grammar
3. too much of time and words spent on describing everyone's clothes and looks and rooms and choices and fashion (you get the idea)
4. literally nothing is believable from the first chapter.
5. the fic is turning too morbid. Dark is ok. Morbid is where i draw the line.
