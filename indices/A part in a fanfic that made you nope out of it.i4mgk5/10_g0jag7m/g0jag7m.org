I was reading a cool Harry-goes-back-in-time fic, he ended up in Africa, met Newt Scamander, and ended up accompanying him around the world to see creatures and stuff. It was slash (which I can read as long as it's sfw), they made Harry 5'3, and ended up feminising him way too much. I was feeling iffy at that point, but then they started going into Harry's weird s*x life... I cannot explain to you how fast I closed that tab.
