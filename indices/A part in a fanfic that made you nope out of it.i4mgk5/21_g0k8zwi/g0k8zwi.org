Fics that spend ages establishing details that everyone already knows from canon. Like Harry wakes up in the cupboard under the stairs, thinks about how bad his life is and how he wishes his parents hadn't died, goes out to the kitchen after Aunt Petunia yells for him to come and cook breakfast. All this rehash makes me nope out of a story.
