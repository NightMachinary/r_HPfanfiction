I usually drop stories as soon as Ron gets bashed. It's really sad how many stories are ruined by this weird need to bash one of the best characters in the series. Especially Harmony stories - so many authors seem to think that Hermione would never fall in love with Harry if Ron were not an irredeemable jerk or worse.
