Every characters has some qualities, and some flaws (except maybe Umbridge, can't say anything positive about her except that she is really good at bad). And everyone is free to have his own character preferences. This guy love Ron and I do too, while some people hate him. At the same time, you have a bunch of Hermione lover of this fandom while I think she is an annoying know it all with absolutely no diplomacy skills, and I can barely tolerate her. Everyone love some characters and hate others, and that's totally fine.
