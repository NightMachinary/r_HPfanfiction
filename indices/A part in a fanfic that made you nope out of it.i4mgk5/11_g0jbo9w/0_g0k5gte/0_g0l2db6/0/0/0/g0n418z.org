I can say something positive about Umbridge. She likes cats. I'm a cat person, so I consider it her only redeeming feature. Even if she has a weird fixation on pink-adorned kittens. She's horribly evil, vile, wretched, likes the colour pink, sadistic, bigoted, bureaucratic, wears the colour pink, nasty, toadlike, and dresses exclusively in pink, but at least she likes cats.
