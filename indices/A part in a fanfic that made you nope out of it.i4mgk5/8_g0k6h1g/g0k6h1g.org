Undisclosed character bashing

Stories without warnings for pretty triggering things. Reading a fic with a sudden r*pe scene is unpleasant. As that is something I avoid in any fiction I consume.

Too much whump. I'm never in the mood to read 10 chapters about Harry recovering from being severely, far far beyond canon, abused by the Dursley's. in which he curls up in Sirius' arms and cries like a small child, even though he's 16 now.

Completely unnecessary relationship drama used as a lazy plot device, usually an absurd lack of communication causing a misunderstanding. This tends to have no impact upon the overall story and just wasted two chapters.

Complete OOCness with no warning whatsoever. I don't mind ooc if it's been disclosed, but I don't want to start reading a fic and suddenly Ron's calling Hermione a mudblood, Harry cries at the drop of a hat, Hermione is an all knowing goddess and Draco simps for her.
