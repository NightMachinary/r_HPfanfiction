-Whenever I see stupid nicknames such as pup, cub, prongslet, 'mione, moldyshorts, etc.

-Unnecessary drama just to spice the plot (all hurt/comfort stories and most angst stories)

-Harry being fucking incompetent and having everyone kissing his feet wherever he goes.

-Snarry, Dramione, Remus/Harry, Lucius/Harry, Voldemort/Harry (if he's 70 and Harry a teenager) stories...

-Lord Hadrian James Potter Black Peverell Gryffindor Slytherin Hufflepuff Ravenclaw Pendragon La Fey... Who is a friend of the GOBLIN NATION (and nobody apart from him is)

-Dumbledore bashing

-Rehashing the cannon, either from Time Travel stories or from normal ones
