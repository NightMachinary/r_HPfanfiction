It's going to be a long list..., lately, I had really big trouble finding something to read.

- bashing - it stopped being funny long, long time ago, and now it's just very repetitive,
- goblins - if the author takes too much time to describe goblins and Gringotts, and has Harry say "Good Morning" to a goblin then, it's time to get out because it's probably going to be one of the many "Harry takes the world with goblins' help" fics.
- Dumbledore the manipulator - the premise of the story has to be really, really intriguing for me to read a fic where Dumbledore looks even a little bit sketchy.
- Harry trains to defeat Voldemort (he jogs when he's at the Dursleys to get fit because magic is all about getting fit). The same goes with Harry shopping sprees or Harry making a list of things he needs to do to defeat Voldemort.
- Snape being friendly to Harry, Snape takes pity because Dursleys don't like Harry.
- Rituals. Overcomplicated magic that the Golden Trio learns in the span of a few hours or a day at most.
- too much of muggle world.
- Romance at the age of 11. Children acting like adults talking about politics, inheritance, and of course, marriage.
- Nicknames: Prongsie, Dumbles, Voldyshorts, and other ridiculous names. Also, Harry has a different, more distinguished name like Hadrian or Harrison or something like that.
- "BAMF!Insert the name of the character" in the tags.
- Death Eaters are secretly good, misunderstood guys or they had a very good reason to join Voldemort that did not involve bigotry.
- Drarry, Snarry, Snamione, Dramione, Tomarry, Tomione, and other, strange pairings.
- Chambers of Secrets used as a room for secret meetings of Harry's secret group of friends.
- a wall of text.
- repetitive mistakes in names of characters and places: Regulas Black, Nivelle Longbottom, Minevra McGonagall, Pavrati Patil.
