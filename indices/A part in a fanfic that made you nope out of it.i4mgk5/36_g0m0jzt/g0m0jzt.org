Really not squeamish at all about fanfics, I will read the weird stuff, the nsfw stuff, the weird nsfw stuff, the problematic and controversial, the dark and morbid, the angsty as hell stuff... But I will nope the F out if:

1. The writing is just plain bad.
2. The fic is too rushed and wastes zero time with set up or description.
3. The fic is way too slow and way longer than it has any right to be(800k words) and wastes to much time with description of clothes, scenario, objetcs...
4. The characters are super OOC and no one warned me about it. I read fanfic about particular characters because I like particular characters, I don't wanna read your OC with said characters name. Put them through all the weird shit you want, but make him react to it accordingly, or make the changes believable, or at least warn me it is ooc so I don't waste my time, cause it is not my cup of tea.(that is differente from things like Dark!Harry, Slytherin!Harry... although those can be super ooc)
