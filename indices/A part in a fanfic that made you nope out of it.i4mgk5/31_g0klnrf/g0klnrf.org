Something I don't think I've seen so far is author soapboxing. If chapter 1 contains a ten paragraph monologue from Harry on why the story author's IRL views are correct and anyone who disagrees is irredeemably evil and should be dragged into the street and shot, I'm noping out of there after a paragraph at most.
