I suppose Snamione, Snilly, Snarry, and Dramione like a user hear has commented because I seriously can't imagine a person falling in love or liking romantically a bully who degrades them for years such as 'Mudblood' and 'Know-it-all'.

I cry at how older fics have bad grammar. Like a story with a good plot but does not have good grammar is such a turn off. I really hate the people who don't use paragraphs and punctuation, just generally bad formatting.

I don't like how some people tag a pairing but they break up in the first chapter and move on. Same with how the author doesn't tag the pairing but it's part of the main plot.

Lastly, I hate the stories where Harry or/and Hermione haves sex with everybody (because truthfully it's always either Harry or Hermione). But I can't change anybody's opinion.
