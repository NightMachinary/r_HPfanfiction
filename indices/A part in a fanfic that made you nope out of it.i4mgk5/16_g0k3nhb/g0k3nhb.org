Well there is this thing that may not sound too awful to anyone but me: When a character's already in love with someone but still sleep with other people, especially someone who looks like the person they fancy. No just no I really really hate that, even though it's technically not cheating or anything. And of course, cheating is a bigger NOPE.

Maybe it's just my stupid girly sentiment.
