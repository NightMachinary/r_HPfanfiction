I keep a list of fanfics I dropped (because otherwise I sometimes forget them until I read the terrible part again) and other than spelling/grammar/punctuation this is the most common aspect that causes me to nope right out.

Another issue is this one fic (can't remember the name, coincidentally proving my need for the above-mentioned list) where Harry and Hermione start dating before the Yule Ball but after she said yes to Krum.. which was fine, honestly.

Then the Ron-scene happened like in canon, leading to her snogging Krum to.. make Ron jealous/feel atractive? Whatever, it was crap and I leaped away!
