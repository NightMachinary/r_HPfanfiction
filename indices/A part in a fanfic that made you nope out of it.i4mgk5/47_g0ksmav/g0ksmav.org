I just can't stand mcgonagall bashing. Almost all other bashing I don't really have that much problems with, but I can't see mcgonagall as a bad or dumb person.

Besides that, the nick-name moRon makes me just roll my eyes, and give up on that fic. Also, I dislike fics in where people think it's really funny to insult Voldemort constantly. In the heat of battle I can understand, but really, calling him names isn't really that much of a joke
