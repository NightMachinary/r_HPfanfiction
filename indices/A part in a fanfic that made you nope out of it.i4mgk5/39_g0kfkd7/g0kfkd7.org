*if there's any slash *long drawn-out vocal explanation from character, very detailed *Harry or Hermione bashing *copious amounts of fluff *unoriginal jokes which dont make me take the fic seriously anymore like "Voldy-Moldy" it's just so cringe *bad grammar and spelling *interesting start to a story, but leading to unoriginal plot I've seen a gazillion times *There was this fic in which after Harry gets hurt and Snape immediately warms up to him after hating him the whole time *If it's too fast-paced *If it's just dialogue and no descriptions And many many MANYYY more
