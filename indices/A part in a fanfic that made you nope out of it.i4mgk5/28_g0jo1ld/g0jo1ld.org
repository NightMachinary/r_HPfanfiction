Eeeeh heh heh heh heh heeeeeh! I didn't even need to re-read the chapter to guess which scene you meant xD Hail Odysseus has a lot of problems but only scene that makes all the muggleWank, GrindleWank and usual Indy!Harry! problems look /kind of tame/

To quote Dresden Files: "Have you guys been /getting down/ while you were fuzzy?"

It's a greeeaaat place to dip out of this fic. I don't think you'd like how the author justifies it afterwards (ew, ew, ew)
