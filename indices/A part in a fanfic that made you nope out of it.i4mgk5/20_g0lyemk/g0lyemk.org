Bad grammar/spelling

Ron/general Weasley bashing

Dumbledore bashing (Slightly more leeway if it's meant as a joke, and not intended as serious criticism/sendup of the character. Some stories like to hide their bashing in alleged jokes, and it's never not super obvious.

Magical cores. Seriously, this is the MOST made-up thing in the Harry Potter fandom.

"True names"

"So mote it be"

Weird pairings of side-characters that make no sense canon-wise.

Characters knowing things they couldn't possibly know at that point in time, but the author knows, because they've read all of the books. IE, Ron referencing Thestrals during Year 4, when he didn't know jack about them until Year 5.

Characters being overly-wordy or verbose, especially for their character. Not that deviation from original flavor is an absolute deal-breaker, but Harry shouldn't sound like he's being written by J.R.R. Tolkien, and Hermione shouldn't sound like Mr. Spock.

More than a single, short paragraph to describe a simple scene or character appearance. Leeway is given for complex scenes that require more explanation, but don't dwell on minutiae.

Dwelling on minutiae. As opposed to the last entry, this concerns drawing out a subplot, or exchange that should, realistically, take a few pages to solve for many, many chapters.

Making the bad-guys cartoonishly evil. Delores Umbridge, Lucius Malfoy, Voldemort, they're already evil enough on their own, you don't need to turn them into a cross between Cobra Commander and Skeletor.

Making the stupid characters stupider. Fudge was already a massive tool, you don't have to make him dumber and more prone to evil influence than he was. We had an entire book dedicated to why the Wizarding government in Harry Potter sucks, you don't need to invent new ways for them to suck.

Obvious political screeds. Doesn't matter what you're trying to convey, if you're trying to big-up or bash a group that, realistically, has nothing to do with Harry Potter, stop. Get help. I don't find it enjoyable to try and pick out the good bits from a story that reads like bad fanfiction for God's Not Dead.

Snape bashing. He's already enough of a jerk in-canon, don't Flanderize him, especially since he's not really a bad-guy.

Snape idealization. Likewise, don't try to make him out to be some perfect angel, he's not. He's a massive dick in-canon, to Harry, and many others, and is a former Death Eater. Give his choices some weight, unless you're writing a "What if Snape was in Gryffindor and part of the Marauders" fic, in which case, I need you to link me that, because I want to read all of it, provided it's good.

James Potter bashing. Typically goes hand-in-hand with the above entry, especially in Severus/Lily fics. Yes, he was a jerk to Snape, but Snape is also kind of a jerk in-canon. Don't turn him into a rapist, don't turn him into a pureblood supremacist, don't have him become a more evil Death Eater than Bellatrix Lestrange, and don't make his parents evil, either.

Crossovers that retell a story from a different universe with no changes except the character names.

Making all of the female characters fainting damsels. Seriously, this is one of the most irritating things in otherwise good stories. All of a sudden, otherwise competent characters become unable to fend for themselves. Hermione has a tendency to freeze under pressure, but Ginny? Come on, she's a bonafide action-girl in-canon. That doesn't mean every girl has to be hypercompetent, but come on, just write them the way they were in the books.

Female Blaise Zabini.

Blaise Zabini being one of Draco's minions (Hi movies!)

Inconsistency with canon, be it of the story itself, or Harry Potter as a whole. New words for things that were referenced, but barely identified? That's fine, like "wards" and any name for Hermione's parents. Don't introduce elements from other magic-systems into the series without a damn good reason, AND making them conform to the magic-system of proper canon, especially in series that are like "Okay, everything up to X book is canon" or "everything up to X part of X book is canon." By all means, deviate, and expand, but don't introduce stuff from Fullmetal Alchemist or Septimus Heap and try to hodgepodge it together into making sense. Likewise, don't have massive gaps in the plot, don't have plotholes that could've been explained in a sentence, etc.
