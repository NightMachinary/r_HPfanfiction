I once more the mistake of reading a very very dark Harry Potter whump. That Harry was remade into something else by Bellatrix's torture for days and physically altering him into something hotter, with his equipment ridged by Bellatrix 'for her pleasure' was something I could somehow still stomach.

I am pretty sure he is made to involuntarily have sex with a younger girl who is also clearly a victim. He gets saved, and gets in the care of female classmates.

There is quartet or quintet of perky witches that were nursing him back to health with little to no success. I dropped the fic when one of those witches was turned on by Harry who was clearly wasting away and raped him while he was barely conscious, and his physical condition magically improved. As if he were an incubus. She and her nurse-friends had to rape a barely conscious torture victim in order for him to get better. All while being incredibly turned on by getting to do that to Harry.

That was where I dropped it, after continuing it for far too long. It was gruesome and the story stayed with me in a way I wish it didn't.
