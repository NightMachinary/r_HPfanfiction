For me, the marriage contracts are 'fine' as a way to force the start of a relationship together - but more than that isn't particularly pleasant, and ideally there'd be a way out of it. But most people taking that approach are pretty lazy about it, unfortunately.

The best marriage contract fic I can remember is linkffn(Contractual Invalidation), but I don't know if that's the one you were talking about.
