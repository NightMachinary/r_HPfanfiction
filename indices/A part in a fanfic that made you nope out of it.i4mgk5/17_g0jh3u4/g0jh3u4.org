I generally stop reading a fic as soon as marriage contracts are mentioned to the mc. At least if they come of as a possible major plot point in the story. I really dislike the the forced romances.

I am however completely fine with soul bonds or similar concepts.

Edit: I was going to link one of the very few stories that I like but goes against that which I stated above but I can't remember what it's called.
