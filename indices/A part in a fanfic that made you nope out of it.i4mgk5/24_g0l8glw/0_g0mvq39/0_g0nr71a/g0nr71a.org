Exactly. Also, there's nothing wrong with just writing “Ron said”. Referring to blood status makes it seem like the character we're reading through (let's say Harry like in the books) cares about blood status, and Harry did not care that Ron was full-blood and Hermione was muggle born, so why should he be thinking about his friends in those terms?
