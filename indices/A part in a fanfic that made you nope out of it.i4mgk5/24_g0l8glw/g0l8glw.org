I might still give the fic a chance but this is annoying:

Harry looked over at Hermione. The witch was pouring over her book.

Or

Hermione look at Harry's weary face. The half-blood boy was nearly asleep on the sofa.

I don't recall JK Rowling ever using ‘the witch'/wizard or ‘the halfblood/fullblood' to refer to people, because Harry sees them as people, friends, not a blood status. So it annoys me when fanfic writers do it.
