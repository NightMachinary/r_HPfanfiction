I don't know why, but Hermione x Sirius with time travel is always really good, but if it were Harry x Sirius it would make my skin crawl. I think it has to do with Sirius being such a paternal figure, so it just feels like such an odd betrayal of trust to me, along with grooming. Even if it's obviously not.
