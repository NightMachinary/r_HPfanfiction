- Blaise Zambini gets me every time. At least get the names right!
- One of his love interests putting her wand in his groin and firing off a stinging hex to "teach him a lesson."
- After accidentally turning somebody into a toad at the beginning, never even thinks it might be an idea to use that against his tormenters for the rest of the story (or as far as I got, anyway). After about the third time he's trying to fight off a superior foe and doesn't use this particular Chekov's gun, I gave up.
- Badly-written hospital wing scene, including Madam Pomfrey waiting until he regained consciousness to start any healing or even clean the mud off of him.
- Taken prisoner by the centaurs, put in a body bind with compulsion spells, and then group mind-raped "for his own good," and he stops fighting because Mooney is one of his attackers.
- Since learning that it was barely ever used in canon (and never by Dumbledore), I've become sensitised to use of "my boy." It's not enough (yet) to get me to give up a fic just for that, but it jars me out of the story.
