There are a few things. If it's badly written, it's hard to keep going. If it's super creepy (like Hail Odysseus, or some time travel ones) towards very young characters, I can't read them.

If it bashes characters to an extreme, it needs to have the rest very solidly written for me to keep reading it - hyper dumb, manipulative Dumbledore in particular is a huge pain to try to parse. Otherwise, a lot of the Indy!Harry tropes can be painful, because they're just a power fantasy that isn't interesting to read - but that falls on the writing quality, IMO.

Otherwise, fics that drag on too much with nothing happening can get frustrating. I don't mind more slice of life type content, but if it stagnates (or it's meant to have a plot), it can just... lose interest.
