- Anytime I see the name, Hadrian or Harold.
- Magical Cores
- Romance immediately upon first sight and the first girl Harry sees in his first year is inevitably the one he's going to end up.
- New Special Wand from Ollivander because being the brother wand of Voldemort's isn't as interesting. (A different wand might make sense if Harry isn't the BWL in the story, but other than that it's just lazy writing and really serves nothing)
- Sanctions of Canon/Nothing new and interesting added to the story other than the particular trope they're attempting to emulate.
