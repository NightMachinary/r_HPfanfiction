I have literally only seen the name 'Hadrian' being used in clich√©-ridden "Harry has 9001 titles and/or an overpowered creature inheritance, Dumbledork is hiding things from him, the Weasleys are after his money, luckily he was nice to a goblin once" bashfics, none of them worth reading.

Also, if you /have/ to give Harry a 'formal' name purely for paperwork, use Henry or Harold. Those are names that /actually/ make sense for a 'Harry', Hadrian would make sense for an 'Adrian'.\\
Don't use Harrison either - it's a patronym, not a formalization. The name Harry predates Harrison by a few centuries as a first name, and by at least one generation if you count the /last/ name Harrison (as in, Harry's Son).
