I'll agree with other all of this other than Hadrian. If it's a legal name and essentially never used again I don't mind. I can see a someone giving their kid a fancy name that they immediately shorten to appease grandparents and such. That said any fic long name change that isn't required for time travel shenanigans or adoption purposes for last names gets a no from me dawg.
