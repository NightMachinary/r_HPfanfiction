A few stand out for me:

- If it'd get a failing grade as primary-school English homework, I am not reading it.
- Any time I read the name "Hadrian", I nope out /real/ hard.
- "Ginny, thirteen years old, had an orgasm". Aaannnndddd that's me noping out of Bonds of Blood and wishing I could erase my memory.
- I remember a Harry/Fleur fanfic where, with zero indication up to that point, Dumbledore and Ron suddenly start scheming to arrange an "accident" for Fleur so Harry can be love-potioned to impregnate Ginny like a good boy. I outright felt /betrayed/ by that fanfic - it was actually good up to that point.
