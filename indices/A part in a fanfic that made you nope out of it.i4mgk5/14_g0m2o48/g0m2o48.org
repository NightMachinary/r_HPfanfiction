I guess mine is pretty unpopular since I haven't seen it mentioned yet but as a general rule, I absolutely cannot stand first person POV. It's an immediate close tab for me.

The only one I read to completion, with a lot of cringing on my part, was Seventh Horcrux and it's only because I keep seeing it referred and recommended in this sub with admittedly hilarious quotes that I was intrigued.

Though I'm not native, Grammar and Misspelling the character names or common words/terms in HP is also a big deal. I don't care much if your tenses is off but if you can't differentiate “your” and “you're” or if I saw Luscious Malfoy or Professor Macgounagal, I'm f-ing the nope out of it.
