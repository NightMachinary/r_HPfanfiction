When a canon Harry becomes too lovey dovey. I know ships are a big deal in the fanfiction world, but, despite having so much love for everyone, I just can't picture him as a love-sick puppy. Especially when you see a Harry whipped by either Ginny, Hermione, Draco or Tom then you know that that's not fanfiction but rather a clumsily written novel which borrows character names and circumstances from a world renown series.
