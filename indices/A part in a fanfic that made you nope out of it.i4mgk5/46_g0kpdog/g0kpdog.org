When there's terrible grammar, there's too much character bashing (ie Ron and Ginny especially), and the characters are too OOC to the point that the author is just using their names without any relevant personalities.

The only non-canon ship I read is Dramione (for that good ole Draco redemption arc - Drarry shippers can also relate) --- but none of the age gap ships make any sense to me (Snarry, Snamione, Tomione, Tomarry, Lucius/Hermione, etc). I also hate Harmony because it feels too incestuous to me because Romione at least has tension and jealousy throughout canon but Harry and Hermione treat each other like siblings.

In terms of Dramione, if it's fluff right from the start pre-dating/marriage, then I exit out because it's way too OOC for Draco to immediately drop his prejudices.(slowburn is the best course of action).
