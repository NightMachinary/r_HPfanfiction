I can tolerate some bad grammar. Completely OOC characters are just spicing up the story. I actually kind of enjoy bashing. Weird sex stuff? How weird are we talking?

But what I absolutely cannot stand is when an author makes me empathize with a main character then abruptly and with no foreshadowing makes them do something moronic and/or reprehensible. If you want me to dislike the MC, cool, but be upfront about it.
