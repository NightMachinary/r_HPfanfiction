Usually it's grammar, the tenses or if it's first person, but I specifically remember starting one book and in the first chapter it was all about healer "Jennifer Lawrence". I just couldn't, other than that the story seemed fine but it just seemed lazy, really any weird celebrity name inserts put me off, come up with your own names/characters or use already canon ones.
