Heh. Tru dat.

I don't think there's really a physical component to magic - after all, centaurs and goblins and veela and humans and nundus are all magical and there's no specific morphology common to any of them beyond 'legs and a brain'. So, their 'magical' population wouldn't necessarily look any one way beyond how normal evolution would dictate. Unless, I suppose, they had magic from the very beginning and that allowed them to evolve along more cerebral paths as their magical abilities took care of the physical needs or skills we'd evolve physically to face. If that was true, then the XCOM series might be the best place to look. The Ethereals from that are very cerebral due to their psychic abilities, but not physical because the psychic stuff covers what other species would do physically. You don't need to be big and tough to beat predators up if you can just cast a blasting curse or whatever.

If you're asking what they'd look like culturally, now that's a more speculation-able question, 'cause it'd depend on their psychology. We value big, showy displays of strength, so our primitive cultures were often ruled by the biggest, showiest, strongest person or people. If they valued stealth and cunning, they'd prefer the person best able to manoeuvre their system.

So, their cultures would be borne of whatever resources their geography had/physiology necessitated, then evolved along the lines of what their magic allowed and their psychology dictated. If they were stealth-focused, they might create Hidden Cities and develop magics that focused on augmenting ambush or persuasion skills. Misdirection. That kind of thing.

Sorry. I'll cut that off there. I could be typing for hours if you let me, building cultures and worlds and shit is my jam.
