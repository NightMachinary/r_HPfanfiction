Realistically, Quidditch is basically a magical version of cricket. That's where the inspiration for potentially weeklong games comes from. So professionals probably have some theoretical reserve players to tap into and there are probably rules regarding breaks for meals (that just aren't relevant to the level of play practiced by teenagers)

For the sake of in-school Quidditch, to keep people more engaged and since they have more freedom to just move/postpone games, and due to the small size/cast of characters they want to balance, it makes sense that reserve players aren't really discussed much in canon.
