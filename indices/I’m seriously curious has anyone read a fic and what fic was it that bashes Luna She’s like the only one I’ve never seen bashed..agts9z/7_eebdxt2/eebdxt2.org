Luna's like the darling of the HP fandom, so... not much bashing for her. I do remember one fic that came close.... it came out shortly after OOTP and it essentially featured Luna as a total idiot who annoyed everyone and who kept doing harebrained things in the mistaken belief that she was helping. I think the author just mistook her weirdness for stupidity. But even that fic portrayed her as a WELL-MEANING idiot.
