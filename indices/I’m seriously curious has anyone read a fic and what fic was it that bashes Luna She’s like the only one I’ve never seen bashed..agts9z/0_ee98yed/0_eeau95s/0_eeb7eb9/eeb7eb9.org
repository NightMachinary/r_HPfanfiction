So she's a little crazy. The most you can do with that is make her an idiot or slightly insane. I don't really see how those are overly bashable, especially considering she has an actual justification for being unstable (her mother's death, unstable father and mistreatment throughout her Hogwarts stay). I suppose it could be bashed but it feels too much like victim blaming. Most writers don't feel comfortable doing that and instead just ignore her existence entirely if they don't like her.
