Luna is awesome. She's incredibly likeable with enough malleability of character to fit most roles she's assigned. Plus her mum died and she was bullied for being different but didn't turn into an absolute arse hole, so she gets a fair bit of leeway as to what she can do. There's also that she never really did anything that could be bashed. Ron could be an arse hole, Hermione could be controlling and a teachers pet, Dumbledore was somewhere between extremely manipulative and outright senile. Even Harry could be an arse at times, not to mention a wet blanket. Luna however, was calm, loyal and an all around nice person. She suffered in the last book and before that she was nothing but nice, never getting angry or anything of the like. She's just too nice to bash
