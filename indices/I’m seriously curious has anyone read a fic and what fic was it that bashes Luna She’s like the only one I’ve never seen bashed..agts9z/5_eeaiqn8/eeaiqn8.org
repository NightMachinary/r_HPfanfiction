Luna and Neville ARE the least bashed because they are both the true underdogs of the story; because they do not have as much screentime as the heros for us to get annoyed by their flaws and because they are written as being quite naive in a Sense...

Bashing Luna is like torturing a puppy...

An author would have to laje her Very OOC to be able to bashing her...ir exagetate her traits to the pointer of absurdity.

Ideas to bash Luna in a fic:

1)have Luna being up the existence of Snorkacks during the MINISTRY fight and get people hurt because she thought she ser one ?

2)have Luna being up the Rotfang Conspiracy during Dobby funeral and imply that Hermione parents were att fault.

3)have Luna insist that wrackspurts could Exorciste the horcrux on the Diadem and nagg Harry to give Ger the Diadem because she os a Ravenclaw?
