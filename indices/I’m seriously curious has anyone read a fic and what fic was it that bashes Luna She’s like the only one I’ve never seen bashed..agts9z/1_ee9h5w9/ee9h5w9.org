The way I could see it being done is bashing her for being so dreamy or spacey. I mean it's not a nice thing to do, but bashing rarely is.

If I /were/ to write a Luna bashing fic, I would depict her as a 30 year old women who's still clinging to the child-like naivete and going on about made-up Quibbler stuff. It doesn't really answer your question because I don't have a fic to recommend, but there you go.
