I think I've seen like one? But it was a while ago. I guess if you want to find a story where she's bashed, a Cho pairing or a Ginny pairing are your best bets, since bashing is most often done to love rivals. Having checked AO3 for stories with Harry/Cho and Luna as a listed character, I cannot find any.
