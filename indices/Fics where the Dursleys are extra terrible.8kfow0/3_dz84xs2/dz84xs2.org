*I do not recommend this if you cannot stomach explicit R rated stuff, but this fic made me truly want to murder the Dursleys.*

*A word of caution.* This fic goes into child trafficking in a truly horrific way that uses them for sexual play. It is in no way a â€˜pleasure' kind of read. It goes into depth of details trauma and does not shy away from the explicit details. The author themself hates the topic but wrote this fic in order to reveal that *this* is the harsh reality for some kids. It is truly sickening but sends a message at the same time.

The main characters are Harry and Draco.
