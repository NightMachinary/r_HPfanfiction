My idea was that Neville would have grown up with his grandma still but I think he would have less of his nervousness because he didn't have to watch his parents be insane. I was planning on Neville being a bit more like Harry where he's not necessarily the most brave person but he's still willing to do the right thing no matter what. And I also want Harry to be in it with his parents still alive. I think it would make a really interesting Harry, probably a lot like his dad but less mean about his pranks
