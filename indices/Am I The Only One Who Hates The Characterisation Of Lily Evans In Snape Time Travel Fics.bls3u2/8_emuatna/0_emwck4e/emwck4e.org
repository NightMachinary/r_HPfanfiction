we don't know how much time is between those incidents and what other things happen between those moments that maybe relit the rivally between them.

We know that Snape apparently went around and called muggleborn (other than Lily) mudbloods regulary... At a time when being seen as a mudblood was a death threat/sentence.

The mini-death eater were the more dangrous bullies and Snape waspart of them

Now out of every muggleborns point of view, the friendship with Snape was probably something other muggleborns dispised Lily for, because you hate the collaborator with the enemy. To me that was always the much bigger flaw of Lily
