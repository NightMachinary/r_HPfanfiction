Canonically, Snape's Worst Memory comes before the Werewolf incident.

That means that after Sirius nearly got Snape (and Remus) killed, he and James carried on bullying Snape. Which tells you something about what they were like.

Couple that with Snape's status as a half-blood who is likely already on shaky ground in his house and views success in the magical world as his only escape from his abusive muggle father, and is it any wonder he became darker and darker and more Slytherin, eventually exploding at the girl who was supposed to be his best friend but would happily pal around with some really cruel bullies?

Honestly, Snape was in a terrible situation from birth and handled it badly. James Potter was in a blessed situation from birth and still became a mean spirited shit.

Lily had a choice between two shits, and she chose the handsome and wealthy one, forgiving crimes far worse than those a 5th year Snape had yet committed.

Everyone's at fault here.
