  It does not, however, justify Lily's utter dismissal of his attempts to apologize. Yes, she is hurt, but putting him on the spot the way she did, without at least trying to calmly let him explain his reasoning (he has plenty without resorting to admitting personal feelings, so that isn't the problem), solves nothing.

She owes him no chance to apologize tho. If something is broken beyond repair, there is nothing left to say. What good would let him explain himself do if she has no plan of becoming friends with him again anyway?
