Or the opposite. Either everything is Lily's fault, or it's Severus' for their disagreements and ultimate estrangement. Really though, they're both to blame.

There is little defense for Severus joining in on Slytherins' Muggleborn bullying (Mary incident was almost certainly not an isolated case), and is outright hypocritical of him, supposedly being friends with one, and also for being a victim of bullying himself. However, him uttering Mudblood in a moment of weakness is generally given far too much weight alone. Yes, it was what broke the camel's back on the ruin of their friendship, but it did /not/ cause them to go from close friends to indifference -- it was on the brink of ruin as-is. The word is deplorable, and while it's understandable that it was said in a moment of weakness (just like Lily's response), it shouldn't have happened in first place.

It does not, however, justify Lily's utter dismissal of his attempts to apologize. Yes, she is hurt, but putting him on the spot the way she did, without at least trying to calmly let him explain his reasoning (he has plenty without resorting to admitting personal feelings, so /that/ isn't the problem), solves nothing. Also, Lily can't expect him to openly antagonize his housemates who sleep alongside him in the dormitory. Yes, outright joining them is going too far, but he can't openly oppose them. She puts too much weight on the words of bullies against her supposed best friend -- for example, in the aftermath of The Werewolf Prank. Potter and his friends really is no better than the Slytherins, whether they use Dark Magic or not -- harassment is harassment.

Severus isn't blameless. Lily isn't blameless. They're both human and made human mistakes leading to the events of canon. Ultimately, the blame on their estrangement can be put on the lack of adult control over the bullying situation between Slytherins and Marauders, who allowed it to go as far as it did.
