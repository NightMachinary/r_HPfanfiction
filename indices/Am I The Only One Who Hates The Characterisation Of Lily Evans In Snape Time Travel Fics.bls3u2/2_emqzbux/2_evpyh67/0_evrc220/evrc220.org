Actually, it is worse because of ''mudbloods'' are killed by DEs when he calls her mudblood he basically says to her something like ''you (her family too) deserved to be killed/you should die because you are inferior''.

To me; considering Snape her first magical friend and one of the oldest he is important to her and she believes he could change but calling her mudblood there is no returning for him if he calls one of his closest friends and oldest that way there is no way for him to change his beliefs.
