Yes, this is true, it's way worse than the real life example. What I found weird is that even her friends wondered why she is friends with Snape and she was blind. Okay, it happens of having hopes for a shit person.

Also even Snape not being a nice person, she married the bully of her ex best friend, which makes me think she was a bit opportunistic and justified people bad behavior when it was convenient to her. Most people who have a good compass wouldn't do this.
