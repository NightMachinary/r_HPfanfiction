The first and the most important thing you should know is we know James and Lily married in the first chapter of the first book and they have a child. Later Rowling wrote their personality, how they looked etc. Authors of novels, games, plays, TV Shows aren't write their work linearly (I imagine they are some exceptions).

The second thing is Snape is not innocent. He bullied other people and laugh other his friends who bullied and used dark magic on others.

  “Of course he was a bit of an idiot!” said Sirius bracingly. “We were all idiots! Well --- not Moony so much,” he said fairly, looking at Lupin, but Lupin shook his head.

  “Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?”

  “Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes. . . . That was something. . . .”

  “And,” said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, “he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!”

  “Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,” said Sirius, shrugging. “He couldn't stop himself showing off whenever he got near her.”

  “How come she married him?” Harry asked miserably. “She hated him!”

  “Nah, she didn't,” said Sirius.

  “She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin.

  “Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius.

  “And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin.

  “Even Snape?” said Harry. “Well,” said Lupin slowly,

  *“Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down, could you?”*

  “And my mum was okay with that?”

  “She didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth,” said Sirius. “I mean, James didn't take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he?”

  Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.

  “Look,” he said, “your father was the best friend I ever had, and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it.”

OOTP/CH:29

The conversation you mentioned. Snape isn't bullied at all and *I* won't count racist bullies who want to join (did he joined in his 7th year time or later I don't know) a (magical) Nazi organization bullied at all especially when they start it.

She thinks he is ''arrogant toerag'' a bit after Werewolf event happens and she thinks him as ''arrogant bullying toerag'' in their fifth year and prefer Giant Squid over him.

I recommend you read SWM again for how Lily despises James.

  at least they had a moral compass and were fighting on the right side.

And James has it too and he is also fighting on the right side.
