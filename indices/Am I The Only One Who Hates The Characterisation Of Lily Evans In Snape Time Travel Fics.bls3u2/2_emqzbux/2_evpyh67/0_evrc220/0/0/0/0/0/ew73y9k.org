I never said that Snape is innocent and I would never defend him, I even make an effort to say that Lily and James were better than him cause few things are worse than a racist and terrorist. But I don't think that Lily was a flower and for what is shown she was very flawed , I think the point of showing the parents personalities was to show to Harry that they were not the perfect people he envisioned in his mind, and Harry himself is ironically is more like (a good version) of Snape, an abused bullied kid than the popular kids that James and Lily were.

Not sure why you are so defensive I even agreed with you about some stuff but I don't have the same views as yours and yes I already read it all so there's no need to recommend me anything, I still found unbelievable the way their relationship was builded.
