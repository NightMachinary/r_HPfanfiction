I don't doubt that the majority of the blame was on Snapes end. He was an awful, bitter person, and being bullied is no excuse for any of his behavior towards his students. Quite honestly, the only character who disgusts me more than him is Umbridge. (he's also my 3rd favorite character tbh)

At the same time-

Lily is also the type of person who would date a boy who bullied and publicly humiliated her friend.

Now, I love a good maurader fix as much as the next person, but James was an asshole. Honestly, they were all probably assholes imo. But with James and Lily, I can understand befriending him once he changes, but dating and eventually marrying him? That takes a type of trust that I just don't see most people developing with a kid that bullied her friend like the mauraders, and specifically James, did.

However I can see her starting to date him to spite Snape. To get back at him and hurt him where it hurt the worst. (And then maybe fall in love)

To be perfectly honest, I'd say that Snape was probably just as angry at Lily, if not more so, than he was at James. To Snape, James was a bully, and a pathetic swine not worthy to lick his shoes. For Lily to date and marry James Potter was the ultimate act of betrayal.

Actually, if anyone knows any snape lily fanfictions that plays that up, I'd love to read it. If not, I'll probably just write it myself.
