I completly agree with you. One of he established characteristics of Lily is being hypocrite and a bit opportunistic. It doesn't make her an evil person though, but she was for sure flawed.

I see James as some kind of jokester spoiled jock that loves attention all the time. It's established that he used to bully people when Lily wasn't paying attention (or took a blind eye as always). I believe most of his "jokes" were apparently innofensive though, at least in his mind. He had his good side like not being racist, being a militant for good causes, etc...

Snape was no saint though. He was racist and part of the deth eaters, which is the equivallent of a creepy cult and nazist or any racist terrorist group
