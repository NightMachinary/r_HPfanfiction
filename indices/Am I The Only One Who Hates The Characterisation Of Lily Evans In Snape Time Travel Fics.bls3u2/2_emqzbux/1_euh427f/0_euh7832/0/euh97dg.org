I don't really defend James either. But I do kind of view him on the same level as a pre Death Eater Draco Malfoy. Just, kinda a twat face. Attractive to a certain sort (me) and likely slightly or a lot elitist.

It wasn't the dialogue. I haven't read the seventh book in so long, that I can't remember the dialogue. My views might change if I read it again, however. But for right now it's the simple fact that she even started dating him.

Now, don't get me wrong. I do think that she was ultimately a good person. But good people can have serious flaws that they struggle with.

Like, she's shown to have a temper, and that she blushes at the idea of James Potter liking her. Say that it's Seventh Year, and Snape does something to piss her off. Then in the heat of the moment she has had enough and just goes 'fuck it' and goes out with James because she should be allowed to do something purely for herself... but maybe also she's mad at Snape and wants to piss him off?

Idk. It could also be that time has skewed my perception of the books.
