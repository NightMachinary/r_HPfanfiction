Draco and James are different. I really don't understand why people see them as same.

The only time we read her blush (from what I remember also she isn't shown that much):

  “I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold.

  “Why are you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they're doing at night?”

  “I'm just trying to show you they're not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.”

  The intensity of his gaze made her blush.

DH/CH:33.

Nothing to do with James.

Too much assumption.

After Snape calls her mudblood (which makes Lily enough about him) I don't think she ever wants anything from him ever again.

You should read the books again.
