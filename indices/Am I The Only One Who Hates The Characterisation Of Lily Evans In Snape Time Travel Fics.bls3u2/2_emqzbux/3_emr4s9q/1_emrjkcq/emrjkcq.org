I don't hate any character of any franchise. I hate how people whitewash them, how their potential wasted but not the character itself because to me hating a fictional character makes me immature. I dislike them, their ideology, what they are doing or what they are not doing but not hate but no the character itself. I like some characters and I have favourites across franchises though but not bias level.

  For some reason, fanfic writers feel the need to assign all the faults to Severus while conferring saint status on Lily Evans. Then the whole fic devolves into a whole lot of apologies on Snape's part and thowing temper tantrums/pointing out Snape's faults on Lily's part.

I was speaking about this as I generally don't read to the past time-travel fics so I ignored the fic part.

All faults are already Severus's. He did call her and others mudblood, he did bully others and other things...

What Lily gonna do?

''Severus, you bullied others, called me and my friends mudblood and you want to join DEs whose purpose is to kill every one of my birth but they aren't important and I forgive you.''

Do you want her to say something like this?

Of course, he going to apologize, do you want Lily to apologize?

She makes excuses for him for years and calling her mudblood is the last thing that shatters the glass.

  Lily 'I-Can-Do-No-Evil' Evans.

It is sarcasm? Because she didn't do any evil.

What are authors gonna do? Maybe make her secret murderer, a bully, someone who takes pleasure from others pain or something?

To me, most of what you said is your taste in a fic.
