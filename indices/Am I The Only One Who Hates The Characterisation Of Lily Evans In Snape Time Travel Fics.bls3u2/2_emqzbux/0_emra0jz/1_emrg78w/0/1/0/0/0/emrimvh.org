I was questioning /Lily's/ reaction, not Snape. Lily's reaction implies that there wasn't rape. Or she'd be a lot more displeased than she was.

And she did not. It lasted several months beyond that incident -- it was definitely beginning to break down at that point, but it wasn't past the point of no return. The next confrontation we know of is the aftermath of the werewolf prank. /Then/ comes the OWL incident, where the friendship is destroyed for good.
