The fact that Lily has some feelings for James is undeniable. But I highly doubt she'd ever give him a chance in a universe where their friendship doesn't break down, due to James' history with Severus.

Does that mean that she would end up with Severus? It's /possible/, but hardly guranteed.

Fanon generally has 3 views on this relationship romance-wise in a canon compilant context, all somewhat equally popular:

1. Severus' feelings for her was entirely unrequited
2. They had reciprocated feelings for each other, but never knew about it
3. They did have a temporary romantic relationship that broke down alongside the friendship.

I find #3 highly unlikely. Canon makes no explicit mention either way, but never implies Lily having feelings for Severus -- so there's no reason she "should" end up with him.
