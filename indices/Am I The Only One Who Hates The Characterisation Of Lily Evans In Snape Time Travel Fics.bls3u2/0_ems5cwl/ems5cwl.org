I think that there is a general tendency in fics to deify the protagonist's absent mother. Compare the /HP/ fandom's treatment of Lily with with /Ranma 1/2/ fandom's treatment of Nodoka.

Personally, I haven't seen any fics of this kind that I've particularly liked. In principle, I'd love to see a fic in which Snape goes back in time and, with benefit of hindsight and what little maturity he had managed to acquire over the prior two decades, realises that his obsession with memory of Lily wasn't healthy; that even if he manages to seduce her this time through, their relationship will always be tainted; and that while he was dealt a bad hand the first time through, he now has a chance to make something better of himself and the world around him.

Also, in light of the recent Slytherin!Lily thread, I still want to see a fic where Lily gets sorted there and ends up going Dark even harder than Snape, because you don't survive as a Muggleborn in Slytherin with one friend during Voldemort's first rise by being a good person. Ideally, it would avert the Dark is Not Necessarily Evil trope and actually see Lily lose the reader sympathy somewhat over the course of the story.
