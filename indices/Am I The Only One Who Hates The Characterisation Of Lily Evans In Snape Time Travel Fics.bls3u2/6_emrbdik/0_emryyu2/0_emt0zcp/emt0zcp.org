Thank you for your kind words! :)

I've tried to do Snape justice for as far as possible, but I'm actually feeling OPs problem regarding Lily's character. I'm always extremely cautious of her dialogue because cannonically she already as a bit of a Mary Sue (Pretty, talented, already well liked by others. Not to mention her heroically selfless death etc.) In so many fics she is portrayed as sort of a Hermione 2.0, and that bothered me so I'm trying my best to actually avoid that. I hope I made it happen. :)
