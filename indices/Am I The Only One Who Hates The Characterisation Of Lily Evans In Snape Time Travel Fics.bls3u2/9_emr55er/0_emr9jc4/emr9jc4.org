Which is basically how 90% of HGSS time travel go. Severus is burnt by the friendship loss, is badgered into a friendship by Hermione, and ultimately realizes that maybe the loss wasn't the end of his life after all and in the end romances HG.

I've always been curious of the ultimate aversion -- him reconciling with Lily and eventually becoming more than friends with /her/ rather than Hermione in the end in a HG time travel fic which starts the typical way. But I suppose it wouldn't be as satisfying a plot (and would leave loose ends).
