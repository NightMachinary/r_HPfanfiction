Eh, I think he remains friends with Lily in some of these fic. Personally, I'm pretty much never fond of Lily in fanon, either because she's deified or a bitch or anything in between, so I would probably never read a story where Snape ends up with her. I've tried reading Snily fic and I just...can't.
