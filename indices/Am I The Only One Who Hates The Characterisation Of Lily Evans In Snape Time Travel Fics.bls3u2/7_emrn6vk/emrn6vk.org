I really have to stop reading the comments of threads dealing with Severus. I always end up feeling that something is really screwed up with me because I empathize with Snape and want him to have some happiness with Lily.

Edit - Forgot to do a rec. The Peace not Promised by Tempest Kiro is a pretty good one. Yes, Severus is really, really hard on himself and Lily is a bit of a saint in the initial chapters but after Snape apologizes (obviously) and a few other things happen, Lily becomes a nice, layered and believable character once more. Also I really, really respect the author for giving an update schedule and strictly sticking to it.
