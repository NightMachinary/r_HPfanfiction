linkffn(Turning Time)

Decent fic, but I have 2 issues with it: Harry's sheer determination to set Severus up with Lily (in spite of who he is) rather than let things develop naturally and just prevent Severus from doing something overly stupid (basically, avoid huge canon mistakes), and the ending.
