I don't know the name, but I remember one fic where Harry is the one that travels and convinces Snape that if he wants to stay friends (theyr're 11 yo) with Lily, he'd have to choose Gryffindor instead of Slytherin, and this catapults into several changes, including the destruction of Harry's timeline (it uses mono universe, not the multiverse concept, so paradoxes happens, which sucks imo, but it works out here) but the Lily from there is fairily enjoyable to see, she's a flawed, confused teenage girl that found herself in world that is extremely predjucial against her, but is trying to do her best and help her friends. Eventually there's some conflict with James because, well, without any sort of conflict there isn't a point to a history. And I can't even search my files for the name because I downloaded it on my old cellphone and have no idea of its name. Only that Harry used a special Timeturner after the war, on purpose, and it would allow him to go back to his present.
