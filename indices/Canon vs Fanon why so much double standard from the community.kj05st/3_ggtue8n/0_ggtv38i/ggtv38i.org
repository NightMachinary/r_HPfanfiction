  We rail against JKR all the time here. For example, I wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/khg9e6/why_are_darkharry_fics_so_popular/ggla261/][that comment]] just two days ago and received quite a few upvotes.

Maybe I miss it when that happens, but nearly every day there is a discussion to say how Fanon is so bad and people rarely seem to remember that Canon does it too. Now that I read the thread you linked, it illustrates pretty much what I'm saying.

One is boring as hell and the other is as you said an edgelord. Tough choice.
