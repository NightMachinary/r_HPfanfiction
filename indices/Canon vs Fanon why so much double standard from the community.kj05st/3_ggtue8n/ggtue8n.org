We rail against JKR all the time here. For example, I wrote [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/khg9e6/why_are_darkharry_fics_so_popular/ggla261/][that comment]] just two days ago and received quite a few upvotes.

But, those fic writers suck a lot more. Their 'solutions' are significantly worse than those canon problems. Just ask yourself this question, would you rather be friends with canon Harry, or those asshole edgelord Hadrians?
