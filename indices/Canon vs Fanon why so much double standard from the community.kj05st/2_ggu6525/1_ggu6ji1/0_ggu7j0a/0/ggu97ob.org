I just saw your edit.

  And then the fanon rituals only get used by Harry and friends for the most part, and hardly ever by their antagonists. Now that's an even bigger Deus Ex Machina than wandlore, the blood protection, etc.

For me, it's the same. The only difference is in one case you have a proactive character who actually tries something (Fanon) in the other the character just waltz in without actually doing anything consciously to save the day.

  And then the fanon 'solution' more often than not tends to involve making child Harry into some super-amazing grandstander. He can shut down the stupid Dumbles right then and there in the Great Hall whenever he feels like it.

Once again it's pest vs cholera. I mean in one case Harry tries to have some spine in the other he just forgets to have one. But I agree I would also prefer like you that he shut up and wait for the plot to come to him.

And incompetent adults is one of the many flaws of HP. But once again it's a children's book so it must be expected.

  Also, Harry then changes his name to something 'better', such as Hadrian, and proceeds to trash talk and own the entire Wizengamot while also discovering how much ancient power the Potter family has. Wow, amazing! Hadrian finds these uber artefacts and grimoires in his vault -- wait, why didn't Lily and James use them, then?

Why didn't Lily and James use them? Because they didn't need to use them since they weren't prophetized to vanquish the evilest wizard of all time. In JKR's world, Good Guys wants to be Good Guys and only bad people care about being Powerful. When you're busy being a loving father and a doting mother you apparently don't have time to check for uber artefacts and grimoires in your vault.

I play devil advocate here...

Not partially broken. It's just broken. HP is entertaining don't get me wrong when you keep your suspension of disbelief through the roof and don't look closely at things.
