  The thing is, a lot of the time the reasoning behind the complaints is the ridiculousness and repetition of those fanon plot points. It's fine to be a bit flawed, but not when the story tries to 'one-up' canon (subtle bashing, in a sense) with its ridiculous pile of contrivances in favour of Harry. That's why people often complain in the first place.

It's a fair enough complaint. Truth be told I also tend to skip training montage in fanfics too. The thing is I would always chose a proactive character who actually tries to do something than a passive character who is just there at the right time at the right place.

I think it's one of the reasons Indy/Dark/Grey Harry is so "successful". Many people tend to like when they feel the MC is actually trying to do something.

  The complaints often focus on the way fanon so blatantly force those ridiculous advantages out of nowhere for Harry.

Once again, fair enough. Until people start considering anything Harry tries to do besides doing the same thing in canon is blatantly ridiculous. Remind me of the fic "On the way to greatness", many armchair readers/authors here and elsewhere praise a lot this story ("Best Slytherin!Harry" for many) when actually it's just Canon!Harry with a green tie...

Nothing ridiculous for sure just tasteless.

Edit: while being hunted by the evilest dude of all time James didn't have his wand on him at all time, IIRC. Just sayin'
