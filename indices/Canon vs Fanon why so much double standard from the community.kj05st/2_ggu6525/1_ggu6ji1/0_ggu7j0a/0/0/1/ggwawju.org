Now I want a well written story where Lily and James did use the a grimoire or artefact ect, which allowed them to save Harry. But being rushed for time, they either never got to expand or learn enough to save themselves. This gives Harry a reasonable way to grow in power over time, using a device set up earlier in the story.
