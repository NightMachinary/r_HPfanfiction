  Fanfic authors need to at least try and consider the broader implications of their addons to their story.

They have the same shortcomings as JKR.

#+begin_quote
  In canon, for example, we see JKR at least try to give Voldemort an advantage. Canon Voldemort has the brains to go out and seek the Elder Wand to try and defeat his nemesis. But fanon will more often than not usually leave anything non-Harry stagnant or downgraded.

In Canon, JKR made Voldemort a cartoonish villain. If it isn't downgrading I fail to see what it is. I'm still waiting to see the fabled genius of Riddle.

Book 4 is one of the worst plans ever devised by a villain.
