  I know someone else already explained this, so I don't know why you're acting ignorant. That situation was special because Voldemort was specifically trying to kill Harry and let Lily survive. If she had stepped aside, she would have loved, so she was actually able to sacrifice her life. When Voldemort attacked everyone else, he intended to kill everyone, so there was no sacrificing that could be done.

As many people here you think I consider this as a plot hole when it wasn't what I said to begin with. What I said is that it's a convenient plot point like so many others in canon that people chose to forget but complain about that kind of convenient plot point when it's done in fanon.

  Yes, but you specifically complained about her being the first person in 1000 years to figure it out. And that's not unreasonable, since no one had heard anything about the basilisk or the chamber in that time (other than Myrtle's death, of course, but that appeared to have been wrapped up nicely at the time). You might be able to argue that the adults should have figured it out if Hermione did, but it's not that unusual for a kid with a different perspective to think of something that adults don't. (And I could be misremembering this, but I don't think Harry told the adults that he heard the basilisk, so Hermione had an extra clue too.)

The Chamber was a myth well known. People didn't just know where it was and what was the beast inside. That's why they considered it was a myth after people failed to find it. The fact in 1000 years nobody never thought that the snake speaking founder and lover would use one the most terrible magical beast (who happen to be...a snake) to guard his secret chamber is quite far fetched. Like you have Snake emblem for the House of Snake speaking and lover wizard and you know that Basilisk exist and nobody thinks maybe there is something in 1000 years. Once again, when JKR does that nobody mind but when fanon pulls something like that it's outrageous.

  The Elder wand shenanigans were, and people do complain about them, myself included. But that's not really when Harry defeated Voldemort. Voldemort was actually defeated when Harry went into the forest and let Voldemort kill him. That gave everyone fighting Voldemort the same protection that Lily gave Harry, and Harry even pointed it out later.

So Harry defeated Voldemort by being just there and accepting to die as Dumbledore planned it. So no Deus ex machina I guess.

  Ahh, yes. The woman who lived through two wars can't possibly be able to defend herself because she's just a housewife. Even if you ignore the inherent discrimination (is that sexism, classism, a combination of both, or something else?) in that attitude, it's still not that unreasonable, and I could come up with plenty of reasonable explanations. But really, it doesn't matter much and ultimately comes down to symbolism and storytelling. Bellatrix is kind of an evil mirror of Molly in a lot of ways, so Molly beating her has meaning.

Many civilians lived to two wars that don't make them able to defeat supposedly hardened and battle experienced warriors. The reason I pointed out that Molly is a housewife is precisely to show that she isn't a warrior technically, so no need to make it about politics. Now we have a woman who is apparently able to defeat Bellatrix when she didn't show any aptitude to fight. Bellatrix was hyped for nothing anyway. Molly beating Bellatrix is mostly because JKR is a mother and wanted to show "the power of a mother".
