  Lily Potter is the only woman in history to ever stand between a murderer and her child?
#+end_quote

I know someone else already explained this, so I don't know why you're acting ignorant. That situation was special because Voldemort was specifically trying to kill Harry and let Lily survive. If she had stepped aside, she would have loved, so she was actually able to sacrifice her life. When Voldemort attacked everyone else, he intended to kill everyone, so there was no sacrificing that could be done.

  Wasn't Hermione the one figuring it was a Basilisk?
#+end_quote

Yes, but you specifically complained about her being the first person in 1000 years to figure it out. And that's not unreasonable, since no one had heard anything about the basilisk or the chamber in that time (other than Myrtle's death, of course, but that appeared to have been wrapped up nicely at the time). You might be able to argue that the adults should have figured it out if Hermione did, but it's not that unusual for a kid with a different perspective to think of something that adults don't. (And I could be misremembering this, but I don't think Harry told the adults that he heard the basilisk, so Hermione had an extra clue too.)

  Harry defeating Riddle wasn't a Deus Ex Machina?
#+end_quote

The Elder wand shenanigans were, and people do complain about them, myself included. But that's not really when Harry defeated Voldemort. Voldemort was actually defeated when Harry went into the forest and let Voldemort kill him. That gave everyone fighting Voldemort the same protection that Lily gave Harry, and Harry even pointed it out later.

Harry came back to life because everyone loves a happy ending. But if Harry had stayed dead, Voldemort still would have lost the battle. He had no horcruxes left, he couldn't hurt anyone, and the defenders of Hogwarts were refusing to stand down. Voldemort didn't stand a chance.

  Molly (the housewife) didn't kill Bella (the SS)?
#+end_quote

Ahh, yes. The woman who lived through two wars can't possibly be able to defend herself because she's just a housewife. Even if you ignore the inherent discrimination (is that sexism, classism, a combination of both, or something else?) in that attitude, it's still not that unreasonable, and I could come up with plenty of reasonable explanations. But really, it doesn't matter much and ultimately comes down to symbolism and storytelling. Bellatrix is kind of an evil mirror of Molly in a lot of ways, so Molly beating her has meaning.
