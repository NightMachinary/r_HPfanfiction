  People do complain about canon. And a very large chunk of fanfics are basically just the author trying to fix canon in one way or another. But canon is still the baseline to judge fics off of, and when changes make the story worse than canon, they should be judged accordingly.

My point is that people complain about Fanon who like you rightly said try most of the time to fix canon but forget that Canon has the same shortcomings as Fanon. It's like people forget about Canon sometimes when they complain about Fanon.

  If those are the best complaints that you can come up with, then the real problem is that you need to read the books again. I'll agree with the time turner one, but the rest sound like you either completely misunderstood the books or have read so many fanfics that you've forgotten what actually happened in canon.

It was some examples amongst many. But tell me where I'm wrong. Molly (the housewife) didn't kill Bella (the SS)? Wasn't Hermione the one figuring out it was a Basilisk? Harry defeating Riddle wasn't a Deus Ex Machina? Lily Potter is the only woman in history to ever stand between a murderer and her child?

I would really like to know what I missed.
