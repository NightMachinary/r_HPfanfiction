People do complain about canon. And a very large chunk of fanfics are basically just the author trying to fix canon in one way or another. But canon is still the baseline to judge fics off of, and when changes make the story worse than canon, they should be judged accordingly.

And besides, this subreddit is specifically about fanfics, so of course more people will be talking about fanfics and the problems in them.

  I mean Lily Potter is the first witch who sacrificed her life to save her child in human history. Nobody found that Slytherin Beast was a giant Snake for a millennia before a 12yo muggleborn put two and two together in one year. Same muggleborn who gets to use a Time Turner (pretty OP tool to study and being more knowledgable and powerful btw) to be able to study...muggle studies... Harry Potter the 17yo guy who achieved to beat the most powerful wizard of his time by being...just there. Molly Weasley, the housewife, was able to defeat Bellatrix Lestrange because...she is a mother.

If those are the best complaints that you can come up with, then the real problem is that you need to read the books again. I'll agree with the time turner one, but the rest sound like you either completely misunderstood the books or have read so many fanfics that you've forgotten what actually happened in canon.
