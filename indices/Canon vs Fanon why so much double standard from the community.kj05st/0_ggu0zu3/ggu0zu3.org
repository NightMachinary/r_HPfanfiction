  I mean Lily Potter is the first witch who sacrificed her life to save her child in human history

Whatever flaws you may find in canon---and I have never found this sub to be averse to criticizing canon--- this isn't true at all. Lily's sacrifice worked because she had a choice due to Voldemort's deal with Snape. Not because other parents didn't throw themselves in front of their children. (Hell, James did that with no effect.) I don't love it as a plot point, but it's not a plot hole.
