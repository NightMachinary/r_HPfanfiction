  And so Lily is the only mother to either be asked to step aside or to protect her child from a murderer?

Regarding Voldemort, yes. She is the only person he killed that he offered to step aside. That is what you are forgetting or not seeing.

The only reason he even gave her the choice was that Snape begged him to let her live. If it wasn't for Snape, he would've killed Lily before moving onto Harry. With Harry having no protection Lily's sacrifice granted, Voldemort would easily kill him and continue the war.

Yes, any mother would beg for the murderer to spare her child. Yes, any father would lay down his life for his wife and child. But neither of them had the same /choice/ that said murderer offered them.

It's not any single factor that caused the protection but the combination of all of them that contributed to one event.

Factor 1: After hearing the prophecy, Voldemort chose to go for the Potters, not for the Longbottoms or any other family that /may/ have fulfilled the prophecy's requirements. Why? Dumbledore suspected that it's because Harry was a halfblood, much like himself.

Factor 2: Snape still loved Lily so he begged Voldemort to let her live.

Factor 3: Voldemort complied with Snape's plea and offered Lily the /choice/ to stand aside and let him kill her son.

Factor 4: Despite being offered the chance to continue living in exchange for her son's life, she chose to sacrifice herself and died for her son.

Yes, you can call it convenient that all of the requirements were met and all of these events happened but they are not a plot hole whatsoever.

That is the big thing that you are not seeing. You are confusing the choice offered by the murderer and the choice any parent would make for their child.
