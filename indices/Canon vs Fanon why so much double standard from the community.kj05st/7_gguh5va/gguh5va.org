Heh. If everyone here were entirely satisfied with the canon story, why would we need to be here?

A fanfiction should give the reader something that wasn't in the original, right? Just repeating canon is pointless. On the other hand, it doesn't necessarily have to improve /everything/ about canon. It's not reasonable to expect perfection from anyone, after all.

So, an author can get a pass on repeating a canon mistake instead of trying to fix it, so long as they're fixing, improving or adding /something else/ that makes their story worth reading. On the other hand, making a canon mistake /worse/ means that their time and effort has (in the opinion of the one criticising) been spent in the wrong direction.

If your car has worn-out seats, low tyre pressure, and leaks oil, it's okay to ignore the seats while you fix the other issues. It's less okay to pull out a pocketknife and start scratching up the seats even worse.
