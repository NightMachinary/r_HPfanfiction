People already addressed some of your issues in other comments, so I'll focus on a different aspect.

There are more complaints on this sub about fanon over canon because this is the HP /fanfiction/ sub. On the main HP sub, people complain about canon. I've seen most of your issues (2D characters, flat villains, evil Slytherins, Molly defeating Bellatrix, etc.) all addressed there. I recommend you search there and perhaps make your own posts on that sub because it could lead to some interesting discussions.

Because this sub covers the fanfiction based off the book series, most of the posts are geared towards the topic of fanfiction and fandom tropes. The kinds of canon critiques you are looking for can all be found on the main sub and are better suited for the main sub because discussing them in both places might get redundant. Most people here subscribe to both subs.

To give you an example, I might create a post on this sub criticizing the stereotype of Slytherins in fanfiction as being miniature politicians. On the main HP sub, I might create a post criticizing Slytherin students in canon largely being portrayed as ugly, dumb, stupid, and villainous. I wouldn't post the latter on this sub because it doesn't deal with fanfiction, so it's not a double standard. You don't talk about basketball on the baseball sub even though they're both sports.
