I think you are mistaken. There are many complaints against HitlerJugend in Slytherin, but there are also many complaints exactly against too black-and-white world of all Slytherin being all evil (whole Haphne ship is based on fighting that stereotype).

We all complain bitterly against all those /dei ex machina/ in the canon: DH is full of them (whole business of wand ownership, for example). And no, it is never said how /exactly/ Lily Potter vanquished Voldemort. Her motherly sacrifice was probably just one component of the thing.

And so on. There are acknowledged and bitterly complained many plot holes in JKR books. I have written myself how I hate [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][poorly written Ginny]] (and I am thankful to many fanfiction authors, who managed to write post-war Hinny so that it is believable; [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]] in the first place.

So, in conclusion, you have created lovely straw man from this subreddit, but really doesn't correspond to reality.
