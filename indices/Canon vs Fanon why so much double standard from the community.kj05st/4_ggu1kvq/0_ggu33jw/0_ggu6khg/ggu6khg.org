I don't think there is the Central Politbureau of this subreddit, so it is really difficult to say, what is the party line. What I wanted to say is, that nobody will stone you for saying that something in canon is stupid. And yes, many Fanon tropes are a way more stupid than whatever JKR wrote.

Besides, the point was that it is possible to criticize canon, and we had already presented couple of well received threads like that. Just feel free to say whatever you want. The worst can happen is that somebody tells you are stupid. Sticks and stones ... you know how it continues.
