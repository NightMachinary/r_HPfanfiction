Canon is always a lot more forgivable, for the simple fact that it is canon.

JK created the entire universe that all fanon is derived from, so all fanfics automatically owe her a debt.

Saying that though, I don't see how all canon characters are black and white. It has been explicitly stated that the "heroes"(Harry, Dumbledore etc) are not perfect, nor are they meant to be.

Harry is moody, childish at times, lazy if Hermione isn't nagging him, is of average intelligence and has a short temper. However, he's also brave, has a strong sense of right and wrong, is very loyal to his friends and a strong protective instinct.

Dumbledore is secretive, aloof, too forgiving and manipulative. He's also incredibly giving towards his students, has a great sense of fun even at over a century old, wise, patient and tolerant.

Snape is a vindictive bully to his students except his favourites, biased and incredibly petty. However, he's also courageous enough to operate as a spy while pretending to be Voldemort's right hand man, and loved Lily Potter enough to be killed to avenge her death.

Draco is also a vindictive bully who has aspirations of joining the death eaters. However, once he gets there he realises that he doesn't have it in him to kill, maim and torture, he's basically just a coward. When he realises this (from what we can gather) he matures and becomes a contributing member of society in future.

I could go on, but you get the idea.

Fanon has an unfortunate habit of oversimplifying characters so that:

Dumbledore: manipulative Harry: classic hero Ron: food obsessed Hermione: smart Draco: misunderstood

...and so on.

That went on a lot longer than I expected it to...
