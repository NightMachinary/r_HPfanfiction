I didn't say that Canon characters were perfect. I said the setting is black-and-white. There isn't any nuance of grey in JKR's world. It's the good guys vs the bad guys. People who don't like the Golden Trio are either incompetent adults, misguided fools, bigots, or all of that.

There is no nuance in JKR's world. Or maybe we don't have the same definition.

I personally find most of HP characters boring mainly because it's cartoonish Hitler vs liberals.
