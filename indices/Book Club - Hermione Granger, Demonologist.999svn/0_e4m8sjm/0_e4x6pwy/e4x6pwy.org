For sure. I forgot how nice the first year of the story was and then the rest all gets rushed into the epilogue. It would have been nice to see an expanded version--the story really contained some great world building and some different sides to the whole dark/light distinction that gives concrete examples of exactly why they are split.

The epilogue definitely would be a great complete story on its own.
