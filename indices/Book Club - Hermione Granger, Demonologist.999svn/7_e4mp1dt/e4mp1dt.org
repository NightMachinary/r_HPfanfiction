Ahh, this was a treat.

As someone eminently familiar with the Ars Goetia, as well as the other lesser keys and a few other grimoires, it was quite an amusing thing. I have to wonder how much the author was influenced by [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magi:_The_Labyrinth_of_Magic][Magi]] ending recently though.

A fun take on Dark magic. One one thing that struck me as off was it seemed like the story was leading toward Hermione realizing the demons views were biased and she should form her own conclusions...and then that never happened. Maybe I was expecting more introspection than was merited.

Am I the only one who saw the Grangers as off? There was something intangible that I can't really name, but am I the only one who felt this way.

It's weird, but I feel that the fic was better when Hermione wasn't at Hogwarts. It feels like that dragged down the plot (except when Hermione summoned them to deal with Pansy and co.).

The only downside is I don't really feel like there was a story line for the most part. It's whacky and entertaining, and I'm glad I read it, but by the end I'm not really sure what the story was beyond â€˜what if Hermione could summon demons?'

Interesting stories fall into several categories for me: fics that do unique ideas, fics that are enjoyable reads for various reasons, and there are fics that pass the time but never really push the envelope. Hermione Granger, Demonologist falls into all three categories for me. The main weakness is the lack of an overall story direction beyond summoning demons.
