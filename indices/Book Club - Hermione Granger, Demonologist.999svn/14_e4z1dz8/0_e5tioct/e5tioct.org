I'm usually not a huge fan of the fanon "pureblood culture" stuff, as I find it difficult to believe that 11 year olds would be able to understand and use so many levels of subtext and formality in every single conversation they have. Even in real life and when adults are involved subtext like that is probably only used occasionally during actual negotiations on things, not random casual conversations. I still enjoyed the fic though, as the plot is interesting enough for me to look past that, just read through the whole series.
