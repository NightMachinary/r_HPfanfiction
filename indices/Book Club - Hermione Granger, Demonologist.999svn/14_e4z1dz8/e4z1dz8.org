I was interested enough to take a look at the linkffn(Perfectly Normal by BrilliantLady) series, and that seems pretty decent for what it is: an exploration of a different side of the HP world. The plot is basically canon-plus, with smart!Harry doing everything better than the original, but the world building around the traditional magical culture is neat. Note that it's in progress, early fourth year.
