It was awesome. Really fun read. There were a few things here and there that weren't very realistic or likely but that was kind of what added to the less serious more fun aspects of the fic so ultimately it was a very entertaining and well written. I loved it. Tbh i kinda wished it was a long, multiple book story hahaha but that's just my personal preference.
