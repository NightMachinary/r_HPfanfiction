It was okay.

The premise was pretty interesting, but the story itself kind of fizzled out a third of the way through. Had to force myself through the last two chapters.

It has some of the annoying tropes that come with Slytherin!Hermione fics: wise beyond her years (which is, frankly, in a lot of Hermione fics), friends with Harry, no real lasting obstacles as a Muggle-born in her particular house, doing evil stuff without any heavy consequences or true sense of danger, no consequences for the Dark Arts (which have lasting negative effects in canon), and then it's topped off by a summary-style epilogue.

The demons don't ever really feel dangerous, either, which is a sticking point for me.

The style of writing does mitigate the stuff above for me somewhat, but not enough. It's decently written, but as it is, it reads like a relatively weightless outline for a much larger story.
