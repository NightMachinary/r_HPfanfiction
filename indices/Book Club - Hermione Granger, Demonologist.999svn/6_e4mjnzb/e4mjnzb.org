Absolutely loved it, it was a brilliantly written and fun story which used the basis of canon to create a new and interesting take on the world.

The demons were a delightful mixture of amusing and actually pretty evil. I personally would thoroughly recommend it to others.

I'm also glad that it didn't drag too much, leaving it short and sweet at the end of first year was the right choice to my mind.
