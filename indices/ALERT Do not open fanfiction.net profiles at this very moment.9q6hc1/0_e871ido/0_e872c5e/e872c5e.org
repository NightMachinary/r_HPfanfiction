I'm not the most tech literate, either, but there's a number of reasons that someone might do this. It could be anything from an overzealous ao3 supporter as suggested by others, or just someone who hates Critics United doing a false flag, or it could just as easily be a script kiddie just trying to get some practise in with a relatively harmless prank. It's kind of dumb that someone would do it, but it's also kinda funny when you think about it. Ultimately, it looks really bad for the fictionpress admins and makes them look even more incompetent, since there's a bit of a meta issue surrounding the functionality of their websites.
