It's really the billions of tags that sucks. I think AO3's filtering system is pretty good but invariably there's like twelve fics per page that have 50 tags, half of which don't even make any sense to people stumbling onto the fic. Like, really? Do you have to tag every character, every genre, every concept and theme you have in your fic? It's honestly the biggest eyesore.
