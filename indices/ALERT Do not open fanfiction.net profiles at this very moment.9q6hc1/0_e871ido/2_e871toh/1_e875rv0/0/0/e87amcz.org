Yeah, I think really the one advantage I'd give ff.net over Ao3 (from a reader perspective) is that the limited amount of characters you can tag means that when looking for fics about a certain character, I can actually find fics about that character, rather than fics where that character says one line in chapter 13.

I have found the new "exclude crossovers" option on Ao3 to help with this problem, oddly enough. An awful lot of fics with a million tagged characters end up being cross-fandom drabble series or whatnot. (Though I suppose that's not much help if you're looking for crossovers, admittedly.)
