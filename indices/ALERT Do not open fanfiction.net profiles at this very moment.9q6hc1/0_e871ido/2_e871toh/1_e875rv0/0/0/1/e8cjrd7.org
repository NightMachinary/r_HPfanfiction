My problem is, my primary fandom has been going on for a few decades, spanning multiple iterations in the process. Thus, it has a tag for each series, and then a catch-all tag. It's not uncommon for a fic to be tagged with its series tag and the general tag, which means excluding crossovers is functionally useless.

At least it doesn't have the sheer volume that a bunch of other fandoms do though.
