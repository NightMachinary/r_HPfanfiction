Excluding crossovers on Ao3 doesn't remove works that are tagged with multiple fandoms that are all part of the same universe though. If I'm searching for, say, Torchwood fics and choose the exclude crossovers option, it still pulls up fics that are also tagged with Doctor Who, Sarah Jane Adventures, and/or Class, but not stuff tagged with Supernatural or whatever.
