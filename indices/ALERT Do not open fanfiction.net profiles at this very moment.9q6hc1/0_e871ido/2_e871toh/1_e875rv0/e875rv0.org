The day I can scroll through AO3 without dealing a billion tags and basically nothing but slash regardless of my fandom (I'm Bi, I just dont like reading slash unless the pairing is canon or the characters are actually gay in canon), is the day I'll switch permanently.

Until then, FFN is where I'll stay.
