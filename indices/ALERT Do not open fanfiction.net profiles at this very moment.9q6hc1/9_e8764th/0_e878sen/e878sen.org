Nope; still happening and its hopping from account to account.

fictionpress hasn't said anything either, nor have they handled the spam review bots that have been attacking the site for over two months. It's highly likely they wont fix this for months as well.

The hijacked accounts are also liking stories, sending spam reviews, and sending spam pms.
