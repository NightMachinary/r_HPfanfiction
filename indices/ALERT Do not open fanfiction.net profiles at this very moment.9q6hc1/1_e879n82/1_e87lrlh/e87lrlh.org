I took a look at the script and it /seems to be/ only XHRing to FFN, though it does dump cookie data into reviews (?!).

What's odder is I can't seem to figure out how this /spreads/, if it even does so. Oh, it definitely overwrites your bio, posts reviews, etc. -- but I'm not seeing where it embeds the script into other bios.

Not sure if the script has changed since initial reports or if it's just people getting confused between the spam/bio-edit and an actual self-spreading script (read: virus). I'm also not bored enough to go through the trouble of creating a new account just to test it.
