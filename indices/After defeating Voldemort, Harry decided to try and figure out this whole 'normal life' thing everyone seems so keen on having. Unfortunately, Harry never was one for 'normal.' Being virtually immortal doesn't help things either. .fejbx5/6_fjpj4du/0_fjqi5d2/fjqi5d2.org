Oh god, that makes me so frustrated. There's so many Marvel, particularly Avengers, crossovers. A bunch of super popular fem!Harry ones too. I don't even know who Bucky (Rogers?) is, and I feel like he's half of the ships. Beyond my dislike of superheroes, I just don't like how it doesn't make sense that in a lot of the fics Marvel and HP just somehow coexist and SHIELD knows about all the magical happenings but not vice versa. There's also a lot of MOD dimension hopping which is par for the trope, but I also like my MOD!Harrys more ethereal and really powerful than what you normally see in Marvel crossovers.
