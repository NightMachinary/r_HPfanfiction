/"So Harry, I heard you seduced a princess."/

"I swear Hermione, it wasn't like that. I just saved her from breaking her nose when she tripped. She recognized me and asked me to visit her little brother as he was a big fan of mine. There were these menacing people in Hoods that had surrounded us and I think I would died hundreds of time if they had a Basilisks power.

I thought it was best to go along with the princess to avoid them and that I would slip away under the Cloak when no one was looking."

/"What happened then? They say you stayed there for the night and were both you and the princess were exhausted the next morning and there is a photo of her hugging you."/

" We got tired because of the..."

/"Because of what Harry?"/

"...(sigh) Her brother was really cute and energetic. We played with him the whole day and when it was time for him to go to bed he said he wanted to play one round of hide and seek and that we had to find him. Turns out he knows his way around his home as well as I know my way around Hogwarts. We spent the whole night searching for him. We finally found him at dawn sleeping on his bed. Turns out he got tired of hiding and went to sleep. She was just thanking me for helping her find her brother. I don't know where that rumor came from."

/" Why didn't you use the point me spell?"/

".... I ... uh ... that would not have worked. If it did all that Voldemort would have used it to find me."

/"..... that's a good point but just admit that you forgot to use it."/
