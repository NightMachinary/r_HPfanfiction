If you're talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic by Books of Change]], Harry would eventually become a mini-Sherlock somewhere during the 4th year, or maybe third? I don't really remember. To be honest, I prefer this than mini-Sherlock from the start, it shows the growth of Harry's deduction skill from his canon self rather than making him a completely new person.

The universes does interact with each other, but not much. Lestrade was a squib from the Lestrange family and his children will go to Hogwarts, an assassin that Moriarty hires is actually a wizard that eventually tried to kill Sherlock and Dumbledore.This is the weak point of the story, even with Sherlock's superhuman deduction skill the story still follows almost all of canon stations. It does show why it happened like that, for exampleLucius Malfoy obliviated Sherlock after giving the diary to Ginny, so they have no idea who is the Heir of Slytherin.

It become more interesting from the 4th year with some kind of Magical TV invention, and Sherlock's plot to overthrow the Ministry during 5th year is brilliant. Personally, I love the interaction between the character from Sherlock and Harry Potter. Sherlock-Snape banter is incredible, and the fact that even Dumbledore fears Sherlock's ability is always interesting.

It also have an abundance of OCs. They're a little Mary Sue-ish, but I don't feel them as an Author-insert, so it doesn't bother me that much.
