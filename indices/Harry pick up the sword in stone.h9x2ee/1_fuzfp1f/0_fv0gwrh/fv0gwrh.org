I vaguely remember /Dawn/ having a boss-speedrun mode that unlocked some weird weaponry, including a stuffed teddy-bear, a pair of nunchucks with ridiculously short range but fast attacks, and the Excalibur-still-in-the-rock. You could get a few of them with a weird out-of-bounds glitch.

I don't remember any such thing for /Aria/ but I could be mistaken.

EDIT: Apparently it /is/ a thing in both, and I'm misremembering which funny thing was in which game. /Dawn/ had an RPG, a teddy bear and nunchucks. /Aria/ had the Excalibur-in-the-rock, a futuristic gun, and Valmanway/Crissaegrim - as per the [[https://castlevania.fandom.com/wiki/Boss_Rush_Mode][Castlevania wiki]].
