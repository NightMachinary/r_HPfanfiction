linkffn(8106168) has [[/spoiler][werewolf animagus Harry]] adopt Fluffy as a pack member, who he takes with him in the back of his bigger-on-the-inside SUV to visit some kinda werewolf party.

edit: this is an absolutely atrocious summary of the fic mentioned. Were's Harry is actually quite good, and I am sad that it hasn't been updated in forever.
