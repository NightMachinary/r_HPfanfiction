I'd have to dig it up, but one of the +HGSS+ stories I have in my favs list has them track him down in the forest, deage him to puppy, and adopt him. If I can find it I'll edit it into this post :)

Edit: Found it in first go! Turns out it's not an HGSS like I thought at first, it's a Hermione/Viktor, with Snape a main character. linkffn(looks can be deceiving by corvusdraconis)
