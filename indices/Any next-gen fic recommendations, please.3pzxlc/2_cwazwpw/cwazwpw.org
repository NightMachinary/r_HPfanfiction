linkffn(Albus Potter and The Global Revelation) is part of my favourite next-gen series. A lot of OCs, and the author isn't the best at characterization (at all. Seriously, only Albus has any character whatsoever), but it's worth a read for the quality of the plot alone (at least up to 5th year, where the author seemed to get bored).
