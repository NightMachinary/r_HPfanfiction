#+begin_quote
  Twenty-one years have passed since Lord Voldemort's final defeat at Hogwarts, and the wizarding world since has enjoyed quiet stability. Lily Potter, youngest child of Harry and Ginny, has watched her two older brothers head off to Hogwarts and eagerly awaited her own opportunity -- but as Lily takes her first step in her formal magical education, an ancient horror awakens from its forgotten slumber.

  Lily faces the trials and tribulations of boys, grades, and school trouble as Hogwarts both tantalizes and troubles her, but as part of the magical community, she'll have a part to play in the unfolding of a dark plan long in the making. The cruelest wizards of the modern age, Grindelwald and Voldemort, may be dead, but some horrors have no qualms about shattering the wizarding world's fragile peace. Some horrors know nothing of humanity, and Hogwarts, again, will host a struggle between good and evil.
