How about headcanon? Pulmenti Pulmonum and Pulmenti Cor are latin for Soup of the Lungs and Soup of the Heart. They're charms, â€˜cus they change the state of what they hit (food preparation charms, to be exact), but all the same I'm sure it'd be Hard to heal yourself (use your magic At All) if your lungs were reduced to steaming cream of lung soup, while still inside your chest.

I'd additionally imagine it'd kill you as surely as any dark curse.

Though, I'd also say I love all the things Hermione invented in linkffn(The Arithmancer) and it's trilogy...
