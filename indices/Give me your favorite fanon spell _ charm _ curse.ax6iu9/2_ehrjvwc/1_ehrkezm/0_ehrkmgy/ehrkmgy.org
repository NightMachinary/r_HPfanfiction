The Arithmancer series is all about spellcrafting. Hermione is really good at it and creates a ton of her own spells for various purposes. The laser spell is one of her more versatile creations. She once uses it to play with Crookshanks, Cedric uses a variation to temporarily blind Voldemort during the graveyard, later it's used against Dementors.
