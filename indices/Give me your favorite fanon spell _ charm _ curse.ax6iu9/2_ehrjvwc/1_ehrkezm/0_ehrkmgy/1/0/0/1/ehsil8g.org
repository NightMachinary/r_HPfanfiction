I mean in this case...

What's light, even lasers, gonna do against a dementor? /Fire/, sure. Fire has long-standing association with both danger/death and life/rebirth/enlightenment. Death for the Dementor, life for the caster. Has to be some special fire, but I can dig it if it's set up properly.

Additionally, the only spell noted to be able to ward off a Dementor is the Patronus Charm. Warm, happy feelings made manifest to ward off the living depression analogies that are the Dementors.

The fuck's a laser, even a magical laser, gonna do?
