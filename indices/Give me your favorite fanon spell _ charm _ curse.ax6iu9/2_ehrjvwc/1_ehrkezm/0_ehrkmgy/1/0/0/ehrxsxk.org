Not at all. "Wank" and "bashing" are two of those things that always come down to execution, not content. If you do a crap job of it, then it's wank or bashing. Done well, wank is just badassery. Done well, bashing is just having evil and/or stupid characters doing evil and/or stupid things in a realistic way.

Opinions vary on The Arithmancer, but I loved it. Yeah, it's OP super-genius Hermione but it's well-executed and she's a badass.

She doesn't just ROFL-stomp everyone immediately, but she's able to come up with clever solutions to problems, and after years of learning and growing, she's able to do hyper-advanced maths and spellcrafting on the fly, mid-combat. The lake with the false locket and the ministry battle are two particularly well-executed examples that are /immensely/ satisfying to read.

The thing about the Arithmancer that keeps it from being over the top Hermione-wank is that she doesn't just immediately win at everything, Harry Crow style. She's a world class math prodigy, but within the bounds of reason and actual real-life examples of math prodigies. She has to grow and develop, and ultimately Harry is still the "hero" as the Boy-Who-Lived.

It's a slow story and at first it's painfully stations of canon-y, but I still recommend it highly.
