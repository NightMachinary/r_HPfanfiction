Yeah, she doubts herself all the time, gets too involved in "senseless" projects because she /has/ to solve one problem before moving on to the next, and despite her spellcrafting talent, is not a particularly talented or powerful with combat. Her flaws are a good counterbalance to her OP-ness, and my only gripe with the story is its length and how many early chapters don't diverge from canon too much.
