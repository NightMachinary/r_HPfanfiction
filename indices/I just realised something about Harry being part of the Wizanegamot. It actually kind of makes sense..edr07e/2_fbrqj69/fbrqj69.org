While Wizengamot is a cross between a court and a parliament, we know nothing how its members are appointed. However it would seem mighty unfair to larger population if it was a purely hereditary system owned only by old families.

After all larger part of the population does not appear to be of pure blood nor hold to their fanatical views. This is a fringe ideology that flourished only due to Voldemort's power.

My personal belief is that it is an elected body with each member being equivalent to an MP in the House of Commons (UK) and each member representing their own constituency.

Also Potters were considered a minor pure blood line with no great significance. They are not counted among the sacred twenty eight. So it would be unlikely they would hold many seats (if any at all).
