The Sacred Twenty-Eight has no actual significance. It's just some anonymous person deciding which families had the purest of blood. The only reason the Potter's didn't get in is that it's a common Muggle name. I agree that it likely isn't hereditary, at least, not anymore. It's possible that before the war, they /were/ hereditary.

I wrote this mostly because I realised that, in many fics where Wizengamot seats /are/ hereditary, they give horrible justifications (like, "that's just the way it is" being the most we got out of a fic that I feel is pretty famous, but I can't remember the name of). This makes sense to me if seats are hereditary.
