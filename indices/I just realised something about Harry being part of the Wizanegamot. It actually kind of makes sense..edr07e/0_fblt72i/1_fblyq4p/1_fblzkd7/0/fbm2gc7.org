I, in no way, implied all Pureblood families were members of the Wizengamot, nor do I assume that. I am saying that if you are a member of the Wizengamot, it would be hereditary. In fact, I never made reference to blood status at all.

My point about British Parliament was merely saying that it was more akin to the House of Lords (which is based on "nobility" i.e. it is hereditary), rather than the House of Commons, which i believe is an elected position.

Also, in point of fact, in "Lady Black, Lord Potter", a large plot point that greatly effects the Weasleys revolves around them holding a Wizengamot seat. So it does exist as a point in some fanfics.
