The assumption you are making however, is that all pureblood families are noble families if it is a hereditary system, for example the Weasleys never have a seat in the Wizengamot in any fanfic, despite being purebloods.

In my opinion it makes sense for the Black family to have a seat if it is hereditary because they are on the same level as the Malfoys etc, but the whole 'Lord Potter' thing is total fanon, the Potters lived in Godrics Hollow, on that basis they are far closer to the Weasleys than the Malfoys or Blacks.
