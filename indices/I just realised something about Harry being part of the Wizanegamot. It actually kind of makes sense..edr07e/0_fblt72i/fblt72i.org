I might be mistaken but are there any actual signs in the books that the Wizengamot seats are hereditary? I mean we know that they're mostly being sat in by crotchety old purebloods, but that's not terribly indicative of anything, as it's noticeable in our own muggle politics that the people who win votes are mostly the rich upper class. That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions of course, but assuming that the Wizengamot being incompetent purebloods is because the seats are hereditary is a bit of a leap, I think. It could just be because the wizarding public who elects them is full of idiots (want proof? see : reactions to the Prophet's articles xD)

But do tell if there's any proof to the contrary in the books, I'd be interested to know !
