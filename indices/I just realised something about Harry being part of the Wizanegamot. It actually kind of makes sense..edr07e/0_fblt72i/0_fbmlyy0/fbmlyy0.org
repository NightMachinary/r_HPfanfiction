We see no mention of the seats being hereditary, not being gained any other way, so people just figure that with the wizarding world being a bit old fashioned and having split off so long ago it might be similar to the old House of Lords.

For all we know the seats could be for sale, 20 galleons each, no more than one per syllable of your last name, a 3% discount to anyone born in a year ending with 7.
