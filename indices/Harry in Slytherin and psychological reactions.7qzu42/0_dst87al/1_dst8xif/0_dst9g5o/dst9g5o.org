Hermione has read about Harry and surely knows about the theory's for Harrys survival, him being sorted into the house known to produce dark wizards would mean a lot to her( and she knew about the reputation of houses). Hermione is smart but she is still a little girl and would avoid the person who everyone assumes is going to be a powerful dark wizard and pure-blood champion. Its not like they had any positive interaction before that makes everyone seem wrong. And the house-elves were a cultural thing, Harry is a perceived danger.

Honestly I would assume that Hermione would try even more to outshine Harry in class to impress the Gryffindors and make friends with them by making a `dark wizardÂ´ look bad. Causing Harry to dislike her even more than he did at the begining in canon.

And the moment it gets known that Harry is a parselmouth she would have fully made up her mind about him.

Also I doubt that Harry would get involved in Hermiones confrontations with Slytherin simply because most of them are fights between girls and even canon Harry barely cared for those.
