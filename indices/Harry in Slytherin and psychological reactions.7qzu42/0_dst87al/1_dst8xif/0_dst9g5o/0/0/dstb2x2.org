I seriously doubt Draco would even talk to Hermione if it wasn't for her friendship with Harry. I mean people like Pansy and Millicent would still insult Hermione but its not part of Harrys personality to get involved in fights between girls.

  It wouldn't take much for Hermione's sense of justice to be riled

I think we remember early book Hermione differently.

When Draco was making fun of Neville and attempted to take his Remembrall only Parvati and Harry spoke up. Hermione only got involved when they started to disregard the teachers instructions and started to fly, because she thought she would also get in trouble.
