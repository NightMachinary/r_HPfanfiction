Ah, thanks, interesting. Personally, I wouldn't interpret the scene the way you do, as an attempt of the soul piece to get him resorted. More like a normal dream/nightmare where he processes what's occupying his thoughts. That the sorting hat wanted to place him in Slytherin comes up again at the end of CoS, so it is something that seems to linger in his mind uncomfortably. His dreams are described a few times during the books. But intersting theory.
