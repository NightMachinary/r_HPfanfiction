If the soul piece recognised Quirrel, then (to me) it seems more likely that this is Harry subconsciously picking up on it. But the soul piece actually talking to him, and potentially (as you mentioned above) advising him how to fit in better is fanon, in my opinion. I don't think the soul piece was actually capable talking to him or influencing him. Otherwise, it could also have tried with Gryffindor Harry to steer him towards a certain path, but it never even tried.
