Thanks for copying this here, I actually am aware of this interview. I still don't think that the soul could have interacted with him in an advising way, that it could have spoken to him. When he went through a dark time it fed on his negative emotions and made its presence known in a rather crude way, and when it did Harry's scar burned fiercely, but subtle manipulation, conversations even, is in my opinion beyond it. (Edit: And I think if it was capable of that, then we would have seen it try to influence Harry at some point during this dark time, e.g. by exploiting his anger against Dumbledore)
