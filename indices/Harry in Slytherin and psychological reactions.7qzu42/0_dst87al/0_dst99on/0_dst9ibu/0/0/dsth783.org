Rowling confirmed that it was the soul piece that caused the sorting hat to consider Slytherin. And that the soul piece knew about Quirrel and wanted to join him.

Without the soul piece influence Harry would have no reason to connect Quirrels turban and Slytherin. The turban also causes him pain like the sould piece would.

I mean Quirrels turban talking to him and telling him to become a slytherin is obviously the the soul piece talking to him.
