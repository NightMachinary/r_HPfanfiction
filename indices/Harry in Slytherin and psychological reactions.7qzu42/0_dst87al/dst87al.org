He would be disappointed to have been sorted into the same house as Voldemort. But would probably get over it after having someone speak with him about Slytherins image. From Pottermore we know that the welcoming message even addresses the reputation of Slytherin. Its also possible that Harry allows the soulpiece to advise him so fits better in. We know it tried to get him resorted into Slytherin and may have talked more to him if he was one.

Snape would be pissed. And would still be mean to Harry, but more as a head of house rather then a potion teacher. And he would most likely give detentions rather than take points.

The students in Slytherin would be extremely happy to get a celebrity, but also because one of the more popular theorys why Harry survived was that Harry will become a more powerful dark wizard than Voldemort and death eaters believed Harry to be a second chance.

This is also the reason why basically everyone else would be a little wary of Harry. I think except Dumbledore nobody would treat him fair and more like Harry was treated in second year.
