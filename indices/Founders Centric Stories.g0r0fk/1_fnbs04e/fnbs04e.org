In linkffn(Basiliskborn), Harry is sent back to Merlin's time and becomes Salazar Slytherin. He is unable to age until he gets back to 1995, so he travels the world, and eventually founds Hogwarts. However, most of the fic doesn't take place during the Founders' Era, so it's probably not what you're looking for.
