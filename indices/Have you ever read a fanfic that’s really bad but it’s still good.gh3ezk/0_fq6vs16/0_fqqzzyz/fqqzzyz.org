This author has a bizarre ability to find an interesting trope, play with it for a while and then drown it in an unending torrent of worst fanon cliches.

What is even worse, I can't even say that all his works are 100% unreadable. The good and bad points are so extreme that together they somehow result in being mediocre at best.

And come to think of it... It was his fic (Three to Backstep) that, among others, actually sparked my interest in HP fan finction.
