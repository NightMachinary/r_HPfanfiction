Preoccupation? Out of all of my storylines, I can count on one hand the stories that feature it that I've published (There is one I have not published yet as it is mainly just notes only, that being one where Harry is raped by Hermione as vengeance for Ron being killed in battle)

The first love potion storyline was to do with a fic where Lily and Sirius are in love with each other, but James, who secretly agrees with the Pureblood Supremacists, forces her to marry him, with Lily finding out a couple of times and James removing the memories.

The second one is where Hermione is potioning Harry, all because of family vengeance, a perceived wrong that the Potters did against her true great grandfather, Grindelwald, as in it, Henry Potter was the person who killed Grindelwald, yet gave the credit to his best mate, Albus Dumbledore. It involved her being adopted by the Grangers

The Third one would have been where Harry had a reason to potion Ginny, as he was in love with her yet was sick of seeing her with Dean Thomas.
