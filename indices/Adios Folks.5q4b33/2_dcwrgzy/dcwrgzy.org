Somehow? I usually tag people on Reddit so I can spot coincidences, agenda-pushing, or just happy circumstances when I see people again.

The very first time I saw a post of yours here, you got the tag "pedophile rape addict". I can't exactly remember what you were suggesting or pushing or requesting in that post, but it was no good.

So, having an obvious warning flag flair, I've been particularly observant to whenever you pop up in a threat to constantly talk about the same, frankly disgusting, crap. Furthermore, in the last week, my [[/r/hpfanfiction]] front page has been full of red warning flairs, because you've been spamming inane requests for extremely specific fetishes.

That doesn't come off well. Goodbye, but at least you got an achievement: you are the very first person I've reached -40 negative karma rating for.
