I read that one too! Equally amazing.

It did give me a hilarious idea for a conversation between Voldemort and Harry in my current fic though. I don't think there's any way it makes it into the fic, but it's funny in my head.

On a side note, since after just reading commentary on OP's story, and his defense of 'it happens in real life,' has he ever written a fic where Harry is repeatedly gang raped by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle? Because you know, that happens in real life too.
