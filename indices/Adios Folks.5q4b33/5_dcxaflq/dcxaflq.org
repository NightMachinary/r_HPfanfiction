[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGcHNnI2mh4][All I can think of it this video]]. I'm not sure what prevaricated this, but I do remember your rather disastrous thread where you defended your exploitative use of rape centred narratives.

But I don't get why you would up and leave this forum, despite the echo chamber of recommendations, it's still a useful tool for finding new content that's been vetted by a community with decent standards.

Seems like cutting your nose off to spite your face.
