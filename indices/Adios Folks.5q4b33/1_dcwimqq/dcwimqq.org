You're not a particularly malicious person, so it isn't your attitude as much as your blatant proclivities, I think, that sets most people here on edge. You're also not very subtle or self-aware. This sub doesn't have many people at all who would be sensitive to your particulars. I hope you find your happy place, and that said place isn't jail.
