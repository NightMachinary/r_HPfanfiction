Voldemort traded off some ego for security: he mixed 1 mundane item among his artifact Horcruxes, and threw that one to the bottom of the Pacific.

I'd like to see how well canon Horcrux Hunt works here.

If I were writing this fic, I would get rid of canon Horcrux Hunt altogether. We know what happened in canon, we've seen it or its minor variations thousands times already. How about writing something new, something creative, and something refreshing?
