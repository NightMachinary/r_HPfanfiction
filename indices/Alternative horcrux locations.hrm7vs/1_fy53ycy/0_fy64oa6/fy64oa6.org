My head canon: objects for Horcruxed need to hold some importance to the creator, otherwise it was almost impossible to bind your soul piece to the object.

And Horcruxes should be closer to a magical place otherwise the protections around he horcruxes deteriorates slowly, like say a century or two.

And throwing it in ocean, make it impossible to access your Horcrux if needed in future.

As per locations to store Horcruxes

1. Some place in Forbidden Forest.

2. Ministry of Magic

3. In his fathers tomb?

4. Hogwarts Express

5. Azkaban
