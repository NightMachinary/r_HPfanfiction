Thank you very much for this.

I clicked on each link and compiled a list of the most frequently featured pairings (not just through tags, but what actually happens in the story [e.g. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][Strange Disappearance]] is not actually H/Hr]).

'No pairing' is the most frequent with 13 over the course of the last two years and three months.

'Harry/Ginny' is a significant outlier with 7.

'Harry/Luna' has 2, but all of the other pairings frequently seen on this board (H/Hr, H/F, H/DG, H/GD, HG/SB, HG/SS, HP/DM, DM/HG) have only one.

[[/u/denarii]] would it be possible to please have fewer selections from H/G in subsequent Book Clubs?
