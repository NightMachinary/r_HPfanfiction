Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to apply for the position of Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. You will find me a first-rate scholar and a charismatic teacher, who gets along with both students and staff alike, and who is totally not evil. Please find my resume and [[https://imgur.com/gallery/s1H9M][a recent picture]] attached. Letters of reference are available from Prof Horace Slughorn and Headmaster Armando Dippet.

Sincerely,

Theodore ("Tod") Malboro Biddle
