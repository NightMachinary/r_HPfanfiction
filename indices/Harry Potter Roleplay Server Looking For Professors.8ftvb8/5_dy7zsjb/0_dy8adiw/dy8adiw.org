IIRC there's some very specific rules on when you can read minds, and there has to be OOC agreement (I mean, how else are you even going to get the info on what they're thinking)

Avada Kedavra likewise has some really restrictive rules. I honestly don't remember how it works, but probably it takes permission from the person you are killing. Meaning they are wanting to start a new character or leave, probably. And of course, it is an unforgivable so if you're caught there are consequences, but I forget what they are.
