The power of 7 on ao3 is pretty good. Kinda long but harry figures out hes a horcrux during the riddle history lessons. Hermione and Ginny find a ritual that can destroy the hoecrux but it requires he bond with 7 witches. Admittedly a little smutty at times but it doesnt detract from the plot. A few surprising plot twists and a good amount of character development
