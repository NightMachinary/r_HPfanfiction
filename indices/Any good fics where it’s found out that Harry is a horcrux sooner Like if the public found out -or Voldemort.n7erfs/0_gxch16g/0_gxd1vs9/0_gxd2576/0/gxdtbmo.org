I sort of agree to a point but it just makes it porn with plot in my book, which is certainly a tag for a reason. I admit I'm very partial to a good sex scene but even I stopped reading it because it was too smut heavy.

...Actually now that I think of it I stopped reading when they wrote that super unnecessary Gabi chapter

But the first few chapters are the ones with OP's plot point anyway and it's certainly valid for all of that! Dumbles is like ‘too bad you have to die' and Harry's friends are like ‘uh no. Nope. No.'
