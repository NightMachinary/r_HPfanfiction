I can't believe no one has linked linkffn(Emperor), or the linkffn(Denarian Renegade) trilogy, or the linkffn(Wastelands of Time) series - or the pinnacle of fight scenes, the linkffn(Sword of the Hero) trilogy - which have some of the most amazing fight scenes you will ever read.

I mean, these have some of the most epic, visceral, massive, fast-paced and well-written fight scenes I have ever read.
