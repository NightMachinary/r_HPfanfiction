You seem to be combining your recollections of a few fics.

What you've described of the conversation between Harry and Snape, the name of Harry's pet snake, and the health checkups all exactly matches scenes in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15087428/][Harry Potter and the Greatest Show]]. It's a work-in-progress MoD fic in which Harry gets sorted into Slytherin after waking up in his young body in the past.
