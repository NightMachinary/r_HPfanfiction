I agree, History is quite ignored as JKR hated history in her school years, which also sadly affects her worldbuilding. I particulary love the idea of exploring Wizarding History and I've put a lot of effort in my local magic government fanon to represent the history of the Colonial RÃ­o de la Plata.
