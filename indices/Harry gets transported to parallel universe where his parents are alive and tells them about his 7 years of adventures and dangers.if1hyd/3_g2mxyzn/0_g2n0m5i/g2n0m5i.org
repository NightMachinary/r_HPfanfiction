Thank you for recommending. This is very shot, however it captures lily and James emotions very much the way I wanted them too. I am still a bit unsettled about the way it ends. I hoped more along the lines of harry telling them his adventures one by one but maybe I am asking for too much. Neverthless as short as it was I did enjoy reading it.
