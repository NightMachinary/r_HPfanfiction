face death in the hope by LullabyKnell [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558]]

It's slash though (not explicit) so I'm not sure if you're ok with that ¯_(ツ)_/¯. I've read about a million parallel universe/dimension travel fics, so if I remember any more of them I'll let you know. Sorry I don't have more options for you!
