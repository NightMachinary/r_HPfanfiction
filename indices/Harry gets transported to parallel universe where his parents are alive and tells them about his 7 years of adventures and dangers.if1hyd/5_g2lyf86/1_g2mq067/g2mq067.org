Thank you for this. Ive thoroughly enjoyed reading some of them. To say my name was good however Harry is too young here. Too far from home and elsewhere not elsewhen are also pretty interesting but contain a duplicate harry in parallel world. I would rather have him dead otherwise it won't make the reunion with his parents as much emotional. Well I have to say the the riddled universe caught me completely off gaurd. I was enjoying it much more than I though and then when lily got paired with Severus my mood turned sour. Thank you anyways for your taking time to recommend these
