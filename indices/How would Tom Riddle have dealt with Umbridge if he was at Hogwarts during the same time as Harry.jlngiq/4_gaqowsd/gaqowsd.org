Voldemort: /Crucio, Crucio/, a bit more of /Crucio/ oh and just to spice things up here goes /Fiendfyre/. Uh, I wonder if I can torture ashes, only one way to find out /Crucio/... maybe with a bit more hatred and power? Yes! Hatred and power solve all life's problems!

Tom Riddle: Oh, hello Madam, I secretly agree with everything you say, which means that you should kneel down and obey my very whims... oh, one of the things you said was that I should be tortured with a blood-quill for not being a pure blood? Well never-mind then, /imperius/, well, last time I killed someone in Hogwarts it didn't go well for me and as a professor you are a much riskier target, but no reason to not try again. I know! This time I will even plan it! Ok, so how likely would it be for someone to accidentally use a blood-quill to write a 600 foot treaty about my utter perfection without noticing the agonizing pain that would be constant during the whole process? Eh, probably above 98% I guess, there is much to talk about over how perfect I am, a little bit of agonizing pain wouldn't be able to distract someone embarking in such a righteous goal. Either way, pretty sure the aurors won't ever suspect I had anything to do with it, I am so confident that I won't even bother pretending surprise, acting with anything other than satisfaction on a well-done job or hiding that I used an unforgivable in case someone looks at my wand-history.
