I mean, you don't necessarily have to be /good/ to dispose of someone that's being a pain, do you? Being on the bad side is all about lack of morals and common decency. Perfect combination to see that Umbridge is being a pest, that you don't like her, and then /being able to do something not necessarily allowed about it./ Including murder. Not sure if a Dark Lord To Be would've hesitated if she was annoying him enough, to be honest, regardless of how much of a bonus she could've been when it came to the other side.
