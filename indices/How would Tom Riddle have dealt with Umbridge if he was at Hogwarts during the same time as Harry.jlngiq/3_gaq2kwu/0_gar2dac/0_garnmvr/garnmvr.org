Good point. However, as we speculate what the cunning and resourceful Tom Riddle (the one JKR /told/ he was) would do instead of the blunt and impulsive one (the one JKR /showed/ he was), I have an other idea. Cunning Riddle would think that anything can be an opportunity (this is his motto in my ongoing story with him as the main character), and would do as the Trio did. Start a study group with him as the teacher, but use the opportunity to manipulate the other students and turn them his willing minions. Having Umbridge at Hogwarts would be a remarkable asset to him, and he would do his best to keep her there terrorising the school and driving more and more students under Tom's wing.
