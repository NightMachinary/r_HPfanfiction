There are so many stories I like:

- anything from [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]]

- almost anything from [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/White_Squirrel/pseuds/White_Squirrel][White_Squirrel]] (although the last Animagus at War is dragging too long)

- following Northumbrian, I like something which I would call magician realism: more oriented on good story and characters, rather than BAMF!Harry and obscure magic. I have just suggested [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]] to somebody.

- anything related to Petunia (and Dudley) Dursley, so for example I like stories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mzzbee/pseuds/mzzbee][mzzbee]], or linkffn(Dudley's Memories by paganaidd) and its sequel. Just writing continuation of linkffn(Petunia Snaps by Meester Lee).

That's enough for now.
