  A few weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts Harry gets a letter from Gringotts about his accounts. It turns out that he just inherited a lot from Voldemort! Who knew that the Right of Conquest was still a thing? Now, Harry doesn't just have property and money but ownership of lives as well. Will they accept his offer of redemption? Will they ever heal from the horrors of war?
