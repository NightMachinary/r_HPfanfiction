I'd be willing to help. if you want my qualifications:

- I can be pretty obsessive about warcraft lore, being a roleplayer. And I have a decent knowledge of HP canon.
- My grammar and spelling isn't perfect, but I can usually pick out mistakes.
- I cried when Varian died. I cheered when Vol'jin died.
- I've never been burdened with an overabundance of sanity.
- Armoury: [[https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/emerald-dream/s%C3%A6lorable][SÃ¦lorable]] (Yes, I know it's horde, my friends suck!)
- Best achievement: [[http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=424/why-because-its-red][Why? Because It's Red]] (although, my truly best achievement was most likely deleting gearscore at the end of Wrath of the Litch King)
