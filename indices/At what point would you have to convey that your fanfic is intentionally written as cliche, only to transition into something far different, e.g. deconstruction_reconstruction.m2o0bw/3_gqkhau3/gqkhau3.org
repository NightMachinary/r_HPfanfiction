I think if you have to sit down and tell people that your story isn't cliche but a deconstruction of common cliches it probably isn't doing the job of deconstructing all that well.

In a similar vein, all stories, even fanfiction, should have appropriate build up, scene setting and editing. If the build up isn't good then the story isn't either.
