Piggybacking off some of what [[/u/SteelbadgerMk2][u/SteelbadgerMk2]] said: as a reader who genuinely is interested in stories deconstructing Harry Potter's highly fandom-specific plots, I'm wary of any fic which claims that it's doing so.

Prince of Slytherin got ridiculously famous (by fanfiction standards) ridiculously quickly by claiming to "subvert the tropes" of WBWL fics, and spent its first year talking on and off in the author's notes about how "in order to subvert a trope, you first have to establish it," but as of the end of year three, none of those tropes have been subverted. In fact, most of them have been played almost entirely straight, with the only change to their execution being that they're rigorously explained away by the characters, rather than just being an accepted part of the world.

Being that PoS is, like, /super/ influential, whenever a fic tells me straight up that it's setting out to challenge fandom conventions, I just don't trust it.
