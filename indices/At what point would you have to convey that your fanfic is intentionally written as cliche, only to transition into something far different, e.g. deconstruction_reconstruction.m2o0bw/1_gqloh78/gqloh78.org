  Would subtlety not be advised, especially if the writer is /too/ good, for the majority of the readers?

  ...

  Do you give your readers credit?

You're looking at this all wrong. In fact, it looks like you're trying to set yourself up to be able say "It's the readers' fault that no one likes my story." But that's not how this works. It's your job to convince readers that they should give your story a chance. And if I see a story where Harry does the standard Gringotts inheritance test, I'll probably drop it immediately, unless the author has given me a good reason to trust that it might be good anyway. And telling me that the story is supposed to be a deconstruction might do it.

But most of the stories I've seen that are claiming to be parodies or deconstructions of those tropes are indistinguishable from the ones that are playing them straight.
