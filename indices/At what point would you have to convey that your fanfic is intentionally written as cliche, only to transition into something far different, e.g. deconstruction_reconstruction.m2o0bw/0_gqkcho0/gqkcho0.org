This is one of those areas where fanfiction is often at odds with what might be regarded as best practice in 'traditional' storytelling.

Basically, you'll find that a large number of readers /want/ those tropes, and /don't/ want to have the rug pulled out from under them with a deconstruction of those tropes. A lot of readers are highly set in their ways. People who love Lord Harry power fantasy stories will often be disappointed if it the story turns out to be a subversion, and the people who /would/ appreciate a subversion of the trope will probably skip it on first glance, as the vast majority of fics which set up Lord Harry in their first act will not make any attempt at commentary or subversion.

You're battling expectations from both sides of the isle, and it makes it a pretty difficult proposition.

It's also not really a war you can win, so I'd recommend not trying to fight it.

Write the story in the way it needs to be written. If communicating your twist at the outset would fundamentally weaken the story, don't do that. Maybe you can add a note at the beginning stating something like 'things may not be as they seem', but don't expect it to make much of a difference. Your aim is to write a story that is strong enough to generate word of mouth, and to get eyes on your story that way, rather than through the capricious whims of random fandom trawlers.

I should probably say, though, that if your intent is deconstruction of a trope, it's probably worth having some minor deconstructions present earlier on, or hints to your planned deconstruction. You don't want to telegraph it, but it should be fairly obvious in retrospect that that was how it was going to go.
