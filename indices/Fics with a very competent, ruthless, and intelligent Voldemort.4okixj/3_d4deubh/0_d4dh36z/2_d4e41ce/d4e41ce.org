Sorry for the multiple comments, I'm trying to test how to call out the bot correctly. Even if you don't like the idea of a romantic Voldemort, try out the last fic (The Apprentice), it has an interesting, unique plot with Voldemort very in character, while showing a different possibility to the canon storyline at the same time :)
