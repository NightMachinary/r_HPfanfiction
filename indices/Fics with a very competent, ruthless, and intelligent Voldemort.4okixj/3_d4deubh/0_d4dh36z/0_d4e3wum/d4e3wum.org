Most Voldemort-centric fics have at least a little romance, most of them slash, so some of these don't have Voldemort as the main character. If you're comfortable with non-explicit slash, I can throw more fics your way. Also, I have no idea if I'm using the bot correctly, but I'm sure you'll figure it out XD
