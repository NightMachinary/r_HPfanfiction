I second that. Imo, it's the best Voldemort in the fandom, bar none. I would also recommend linkffn(Renegade Cause). Voldemort here is closer to canon, but the author still owns the character in his own way.

And if you'll permit a self-plug, here's my fic: linkffn(Lesser Evils). Voldemort doesn't feature heavily, but I try to move him away from the common cartoon-villain tropes.
