linkffn(Harveste by kyaru-chan) and all its sequels though the last one is unfinished

It's a crossover with the Addams Family. Unlike other crossovers where Harry ends up falling in love with Wednesday, this deals more with the chaotic, dark and macabre side of the Addams which even the Dark families of the Potter universe found too disturbing. In spite of that the Addamses really do love Harry. Having grown up in a loving environment, this Harry is willing to open himself up and have friends whom he fiercely loves and protects. So even if Harry is Dark and powerful, he is not alone and "edge-lordy." A lot of iffy dark rituals are mentioned which I normally don't like but because the writing was compelling, I forgave those.
