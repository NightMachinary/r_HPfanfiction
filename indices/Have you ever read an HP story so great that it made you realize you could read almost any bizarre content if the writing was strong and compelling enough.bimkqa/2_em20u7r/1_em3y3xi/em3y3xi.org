is that the one where he's a cross-dresser? i stopped reading it at that point, not something i'm at all into. largely gave up on finding decent crossovers of it, to be honest. the only two that come to mind are Family Values by Ishtar, and the Shadow Council series by Tenhawk, which is also a cross with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and is Xander-Centered, with Harry more as a side character.

â€‹

and i just discovered that Tenhawk's website is down, so unless you're like me and have most of his work in Calibre (though i'd have to go digging around for it), you're not likely to be able to read most of it. looks like part of it is still up on FanficAuthors, though. no idea why his site is down (and has been for awhile, apparently), but if i had to guess i'd have to say it has something to do with his original works he sells on amazon. which, frankly, aren't as good as his fanfics, from what i've read (the On Silver Wings series).
