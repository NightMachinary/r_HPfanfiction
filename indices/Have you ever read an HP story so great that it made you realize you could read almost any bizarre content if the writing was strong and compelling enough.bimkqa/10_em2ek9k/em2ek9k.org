I can't handle nonmagical AUs, but I've tolerated a few slash fics because they didn't go full yaoi fangirl stupidity. Also, thinking about it, I can't really deal with Stupid 'For The Evulz' Dark characters that /aren't/ parody.

However, I don't think I can point to one fic in particular, regarding 'bizarre' content.
