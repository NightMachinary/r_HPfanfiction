Linkffn(Godling ascending) A demigod fem Harry Potter. I expected it to be a lot like most HP Percy Jackson crossover but it really surprised me. Instead of an overly powerful demigod or Hogwarts then going to camp Halfblood in summer, this fic sets a different tone for me. No need for Percy Jackson background, it can stand alone.

It's the only HP crossover to Percy that I truly liked.

Linkffn( A Promise From Her Boy By PsychoCellist) Hedwig is a female animagus. It gave hedwig very friendly if not Motherly feel to it. The tragedy of her not being able to use magic anymore other than taking the form of an owl and the friendship she had with Harry is priceless.
