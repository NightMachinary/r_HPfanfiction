Thank you!! I've not heard of these before, so I'll definitely be diving in after work today. ðŸ˜ƒ

I usually don't actively seek slash fanfics for HP-- because let's be honest... it's usually poorly written, fantasy-fulfilling (for the author ONLY), mary/gary sue garbage.

But hoo-boy, when you stumble across a good one, you bookmark that shit forEVER.

Let me know what you think, and I'll be sure to follow up as well!
