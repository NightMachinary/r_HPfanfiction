Try "Fate is a Four Letter Word" by Philo on archiveofourown. The pairing makes you do a double take and I passed it over many times for just this reason, but the writing is really good. Better than "Strangers at Drakeshaugh" in many parts. The story is set when Harry's kids have just left Hogwarts. A new threat arises and they must all work together to catch a vicious killer plotting to take over the wizarding world. It is very long, over 100 chapters.
