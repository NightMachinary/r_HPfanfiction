Literally one of the BEST written Dracos I've ever read. It takes place years after the Battle (I think 10?) and Harry is just... lost. The author did an INCREDIBLE job of portraying Harry as something akin to a veteran with PTSD. It's incredibly thought-out and amazing to read.

I'm still not near a computer, but I'm 99% sure it's on Ao3.

EDIT: FOUND IT!! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4251132]]

EDIT AGAIN: Fair warning... the confessional chapter is EXTREMELY unsafe for work. Also the beach chapter. Everything else is... unsafe for work. Sorry.
