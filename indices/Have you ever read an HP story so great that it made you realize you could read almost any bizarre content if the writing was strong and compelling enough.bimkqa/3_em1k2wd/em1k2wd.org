Two, actually. One is the ...Phoenix Rising? series, straight up horror. A+ worldbuilding, though. The other one is the Black Princess series. Both mostly gen, though I think there's some hetero bits in the former.

Both of them showed me there's a fine line the author has to walk to keep readers horrified but make them keep coming back. I couldn't put either set down. They are NOT for the faint of heart, and if you get halfway through and have to stop for a few days, hey, that's all right.
