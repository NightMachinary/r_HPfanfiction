Try "Fate is a Four Letter Word" by Philo on archiveofourown. The pairing makes you do a double take and I passed it over many times for just this reason, but the writing is really good. Set when Harry's kids have just left Hogwarts, a new threat arises and they must all work together to catch a vicious killer plotting to take over the wizarding world. It is very long, over 100 chapters.
