[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11907443/1/Full-Circle][Full Circle]] linkffn(11907443). I always skipped all fanfiction with >18 age gap, especially if it's DE/anyone. That's why I haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/][Again and Again]] even if it's recommended quite often. HP/LV soulbond is quite common, even if it has reincarnation/time loop/time travel or something similar; and I hate it because most of it is full with angsty Harry /'he killed my parents and make my live hell; but he's so fucking hot'/ or that the issue is never addressed at all.

However, I read Full Circle in one sitting. There's no angst, bashing, or DE whitewashing. Harry and Tom started to like each other only after their ~20th (I think) live. There's no angsty time travel vibe 'I will get revenge on the light side because they manipulate me' at all. It's also not too cracky either. They mainly just fuck around with Dumbledore while having fun.

The best part is how the author sometimes create an omake from their previous live. Don't forget about live #77 with David Steel, the Boy-Marked-With-Victory, vanquisher of the Dark Lord Thanatos and his arch enemy, Altair Burke, pureblood heir to the Burke family.

The main plot is a bit underwhelming, but I'll let it pass only because I want the author to create other omakes.
