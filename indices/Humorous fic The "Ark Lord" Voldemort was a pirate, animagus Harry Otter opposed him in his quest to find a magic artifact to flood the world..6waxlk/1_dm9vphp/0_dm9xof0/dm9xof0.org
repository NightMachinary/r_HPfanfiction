  What will you substract from Albus Percival Brian Wulfric Dumbledore?
#+end_quote

A Bus: Public transport mogul.

Bran: Breakfast cereal mogul.

Ulfric: Leader of a rebel faction against the established government, seeking a return to traditional values...wait, is this Dumbledore or Voldemort?

Dumble Ore: Mining mogul and sound amplifier saleswizard...or if you care more about the pronunciation than the spelling, mining mogul and exercise gym manager (dumbbell).

...I've got nothing for Percival, unfortunately.
