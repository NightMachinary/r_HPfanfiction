Funnily enough, actually the latter, minus the fever, add day to dream.

Since my previous Request for a fic wasn't too well received for whatever reason (I thought it was a /good/ pun...), I decided to fib a teeny bit and frame this as a search for a fic that most-definitely-does-exist rather than might-exist, in order to get people to think more positively about the idea.

Think it's working so far?
