The Changeling was not my favorite. It's ok, and has some interesting ideas in it, but not very cheerful on the whole. Harry and Ginny definitely have issues, possibly subscriptions.

I think that in the sequels, they make the mistake of letting sex take prominence in their relationship when what they really need is communication. Perhaps if they had reined in their hormones a bit, they would have been in a better position to properly work on their relationship. Not that it can't eventually work out still, but they're making it harder for themselves.

Northumbrian's stories are great, though.
