May I recommend the entire works of Northumbrian? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian]]

They write some excellent canon-compliant (taking canon to be the end of Book 7, not whatever JKR has spewed on Twitter between then and now) post Hogwarts fics. My favourite is strangers at Drakeshaugh. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh]]

Also, Pottermum [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1864945/pottermum]]

And FloreatCastellum [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum]] My favourite is probably Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11982933/1/Aunt-Marge-s-Even-Bigger-Mistake]]

I personally haven't read it, but The Changeling by Annerb, and it's many sequels, is highly recommended. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/189189/chapters/278342]]

Blackboards and Broomsticks by Gilesso is great, if unfinished. The hinny is more background though, and it's much more a Professor Potter fic first. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15813657/chapters/36810339]]

That's all I can recall of the top of my head, I'll update it if I think of any more.
