If you flip the W to an M, you can make it the latin “Diabolus Lyra Semel In” which means “Once The Devil Lyra”. A “Lyra” is a musical instrument, but it sounds like “Lier” when spoken today, so I imagine it will be altered by accident by the public.

And as they say, “Once a devil, always a devil”.
