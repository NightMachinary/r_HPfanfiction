Royal Basileus Wendel. AKA king/emperor Wendel. (Ronald Bilius Weasley)

He is no mere Lord Because Weasley is our king.

I can Imagine his motif is Chess Pieces where his mark changes based on rank. Like bishops or knight, a queen for inner circle. A King chess Piece as Dark mark. Literally treats people as Pawns. A highly strategic Dark Lord but emotional. Someone who switches from crazy like Ceasar to Claudius to Nero level of madness.

Not entirely powerful but knows how to make powerful people do things for him and how to put the right person for the right job. A king piece only moves one tile and rarely fights but its fine, that's what the other chess Piece are for. He'll just run away or get someone to interfere to prevent checkmate
