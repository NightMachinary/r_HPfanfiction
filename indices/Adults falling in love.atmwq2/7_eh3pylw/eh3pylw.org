I have a few that qualify. I mostly write adult/adult fics, so you can look around in my fic list if you like these.

linkao3(13010406) One Step Closer: Post-War, Remus lives, Hermione is Teddy's adoptive mother and had loved Remus in secret, they find out he's alive, angst and romance, happy ending. Remus/Hermione complete

linkao3(17070020) A Solution More Beautiful: Muggle OC wakes up in Harry Potter Universe after swapping with her magical counterpart. Brews Wolfsbane for Remus, meets Sirius, tries to save the world. Remus/OC, Sirius/OC WiP, I update like, every 3 days, send help (lol)

I have the same stories on FFN under the username 'Ssergit' as the 'darsynia' username is mine but they didn't do password retrieval in 2004 when I stopped being able to log in.

The latter story resembles a self insert and I often get reviews basically saying, 'you have made me like OC stories, I never thought that would ever happen.' My goal with it was to take a derided premise (self-insert 'wakes up in HP world') and write it so well people like it despite themselves. It appears to be working, but I understand skipping it given what it looks like ;)
