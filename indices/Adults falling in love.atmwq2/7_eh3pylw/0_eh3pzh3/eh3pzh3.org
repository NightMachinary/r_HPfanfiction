  Hermione hadn't planned on being an adoptive mother, much less one to the child of the man she loved in secret for so long, but Teddy needed her. Now, two years after the battle that took Teddy's mother and from which his father disappeared, Hermione was just about to let go of her quest to find Remus Lupin. That was, until she found that a well-meaning stranger was leaving hints that he was alive and well. Hermione knew him so well--how will she persuade a man so determined to be forgotten that he's worth remembering?

  Elodie Merriman couldn't accept that her favorite character didn't survive the books. She went to sleep in her bed in America in 2009 and woke up in a boarding house in the UK in 1994, having switched places with her magical self in another universe. Magical Elodie had a wand, a career, and a friend named Albus Dumbledore who had saved her from her jerk mentor--and now, Muggle Elodie had taken her place, magical ability and all.Step One: learn more magic, fast. Step Two: don't screw up the Wolfsbane her predecessor had started. Step Three: try not to forget how things are supposed to go, once you actually meet the real life Remus Lupin. And Step Four: nothing ever, ever goes to plan when Sirius Black is involved.
