  (Evil Dumbledore!) Lily Evans didn't die that fateful night. Instead, she had her memories erased and was sent away by Dumbledore, so that she could not interfere with his plans for Harry. But now, thanks to Umbridge, Lily Evans has regained her memories, and is back for her son. But how will Harry react when he learns that his mother is not only alive and well, but is Poison Ivy?
