I just finished a Fic where Hermione is kidnapped by Riddle. Harry finds out and loses his shit. He ends up at Riddle mansion, jumps off what I imagined to be a staircase or balcony and uses elemental magic or something to rock spike death eaters. Fucking loved the scene. I prefer Badass! And Mature! Harry cliches.
