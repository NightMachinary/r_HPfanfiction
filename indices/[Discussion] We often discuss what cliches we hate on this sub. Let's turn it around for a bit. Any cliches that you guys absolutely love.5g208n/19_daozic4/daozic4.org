Powerful Harry that has to work to become powerful. While the fics with this are very scarce, there are some, and I love them most of them.

Lily Potter/Harry Potter (IDK why, but it's honestly the best pairing when done correctly).

People edit details of characters or permanently scar Harry (Hair turning white due to a bout with the Cruciatus Curse, Hermoine having Raven Hair instead of Brunette, etc....) To me, it shows that the author isn't going to just go with every single one of JK's details. After all, you're writing fanfic for the opposite purpose.
