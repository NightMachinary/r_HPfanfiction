Time travel, or do-over fics. Political fics. The Dark Lord gets his soul back and isn't as bad as everyone thought fics. Dark/Grey!Harry or Hermione fics. Soul bonds if they're done right. Marriage laws if they're done right. OP Harry, if they're a reason (like in a do-over fic, or because his magic was bound, or because he got a shit ton of training, or something. There /has/ to be a well explained reason.)

Honestly, I'll read just about anything if it's well written. It's bad/lazy writing that I don't like.
