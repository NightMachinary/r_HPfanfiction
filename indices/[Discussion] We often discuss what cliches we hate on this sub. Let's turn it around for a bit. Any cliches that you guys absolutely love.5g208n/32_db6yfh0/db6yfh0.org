I love fics where someone other than Harry or Ginny ends up with the diary. That or fics where Harry/some other kid actually manages to befriend him.

Also, anything where Hermione shows off her ruthlessness. It's such an interesting character flaw for a nerdy bookworm and for some reason it always seems to get glossed over in fic. If you're not her friend, she's perfectly willing to fuck your shit up. She was the "goody two-shoes" but she /still/ set Snape on fire, punched Malfoy in the face, permanently disfigured Marietta Edgecomb, trapped Rita Skeeter in a jar for god knows how long, gave Umbridge to the centaurs, etc.

Sorry this sort of turned into a rant I just love her a lot.
