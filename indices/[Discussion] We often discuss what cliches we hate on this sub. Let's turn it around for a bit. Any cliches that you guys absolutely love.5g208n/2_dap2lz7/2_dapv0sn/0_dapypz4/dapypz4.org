Harry was the owner of all three Hallows, and thus "the Master of Death" according to the Beadle Bard story. Fanon has kind of run with that vague description and you'll find fics where he's possibly immortal and in some cases, has some sort of power over death. It's a trope that can get silly fast, usually if the author gives him unrelated powers because why not. Unrelated powers I've seen are shape shifting, wandless magic, time travel, inexplicable gender swaps, and of course ultra-super-powerfulness.

If you want a quick taste of MoD Harry, you can try out Omen by Evandar. It's a quick one shot that's the sort of flavor I enjoy. linkao3(979922)
