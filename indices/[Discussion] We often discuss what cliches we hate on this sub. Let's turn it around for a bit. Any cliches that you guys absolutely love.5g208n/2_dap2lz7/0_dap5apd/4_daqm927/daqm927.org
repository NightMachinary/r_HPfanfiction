Well, if you want something serious then “Wand and Shield” (linkffn(8177168)) is quite nice, and so is “Whispers in Corners” (linkao3(1134255)). Do note, however, that both of them are cross-overs, and the latter also has slash which might be off-putting to you even if it's not the main focus but just something that happens.

And if you want something ... deranged, then you'll want “Boredom is Deadly” (linkffn(11305455)).
