Well, I do love the cliché of a character (preferably the main character) having their body changed, either to that matching the opposite gender or to something that is partially human and partially ... not.

The reason for the first one is that though I was a girl, I spent years playing around with boys as a kid and somewhat thinking myself one of them, so though I know it's not true it still kind of feels to me as if anyone could become a girl; mind you, I like the changes in the other direction too, but female protagonists are much rarer so it does not happen as often. And the second one is because it's a change that is hard to conceal and as such it puts a weight on the character and forces them to get their own masquerade going in order to fool those around them; obviously, that somewhat applies to the first one too but in this case it's more overt.

And, obviously, the fact that I do like this cliché does not mean I read anything with it regardless of quality; some leniency in judgment, quite likely yes, but no regard for quality, heck no.
