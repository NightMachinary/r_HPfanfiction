I've read that before. It's pretty great.

I saw something a while ago (can't remember what it was) where all these AU Harry's could meet each other in some kind of dreamscape to train each other. It was pretty cool as well.

I actually plan to eventually (whenever I have time and am done other stories) write one a fanfic where the dimensional walls start to break down and a bunch of Harry's get together to fight a Voldemort who's absorbed the power of several of his counter parts.
