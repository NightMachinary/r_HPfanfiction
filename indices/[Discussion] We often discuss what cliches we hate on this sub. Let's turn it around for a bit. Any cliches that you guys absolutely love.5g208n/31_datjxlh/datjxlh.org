I love time travel fanfics and all they have to offer. Harry raising Tom, Harry fighting in the Global Wizarding War, Marauders becoming BFFs with Fred and George, turns out the Hogwarts Founders were completely different from history, all that junk.

Potions accidents are also pretty great, but I don't care for genderbend ones....shamelessly love de-aging though.

Oooh, also, Wrong-Boy-Who-lived fanfics! Alas, I like Dumbledore so I haven't read any in a while because of character bashing.
