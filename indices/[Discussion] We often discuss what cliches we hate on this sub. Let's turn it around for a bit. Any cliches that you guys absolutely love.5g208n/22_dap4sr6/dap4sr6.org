Perhaps not really a clich√© per say but I do love me fics in which the author excels in writing/choreographing fight scenes.

There's the whole 'reading of the Potter/Black wills at Gringotts' and Harry generally taking control of his family vailts back from Dumbledore/whoever has the key.

There's Harry telling Molly Weasley to take her hugs and overbearing 'I'll be the mum you never had' attitude and shove it up her ass

AU fics that deviate considerably from canon are also some of my favourites. I really enjoy it when Harry does not end up staying with the Dursley's (but for a believable reason!) and arrives at Hogwarts years later much the better for it
