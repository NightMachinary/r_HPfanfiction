But why would someone be promised to three people? And since this is fanfiction, it'd be all angsty with submissive fleshlights whose lives/wishes revolve around an overbearing Harry. Of course it's composed of 99% terribly written sex. It'd be the author's masturbation fantasy and I'm not interested.

I guess it could be interesting if someone didn't just spew their fantasies. But still ridiculous. Maybe James gambled or otherwise lost his wealth and had to scramble to hide it from an unsuspecting Lily. He cons several families into betrothal contracts with his infant son in the plans of fixing it down the line. He dies without resolving it. Harry has to deal with the legal and magical ramifications of the contracts. Susan dumps him because who the hell would want to deal with that. Harry is despondent and overwhelmed by the contracts and commits suicide. Or one of the women (or their significant other/family) kills Harry. The end.
