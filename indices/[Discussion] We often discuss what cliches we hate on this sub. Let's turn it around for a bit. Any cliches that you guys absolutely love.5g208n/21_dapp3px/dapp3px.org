Harry/Luna. No Lunar Harmony, though. And only good ones. Fics that meet those requirements are pretty rare, though.

In fact, I think I like the idea of Harry/Luna more than the way it is usually done.

Peggy Sues, too. And dimension travel.

Also evil!Dumbledore, but most of them are really bad. Finding the good ones is a pain, really.
