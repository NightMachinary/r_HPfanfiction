Way too smart 11 year olds. I really don't want to read about accurately described school children, the smarter they are the better.

This usually goes in tandem with political fics which i love. Not the Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Emrys-Slytherin bullshit but rather fics that focus on politics and intrigue rather than murdering Death Eaters and Harry training montages.

Dodgin Prison and Stealing Witches is a good recent example. The story is objectively completely ridiculous but i still love every word of it.
