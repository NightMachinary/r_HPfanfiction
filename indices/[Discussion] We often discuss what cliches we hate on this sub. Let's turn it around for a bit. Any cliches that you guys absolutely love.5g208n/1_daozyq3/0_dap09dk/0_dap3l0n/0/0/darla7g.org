I'm kind of wondering what everybody thinks 11 year olds talk like. As someone who has worked a good bit with children (and who read the books for the first time while working with them), all the 11 year olds didn't seem all that different from a lot of the 11 year I have dealt with over the years. Generally more accurate in the books then in fanfics (though it both there is some artistic license).
