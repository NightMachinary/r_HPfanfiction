Same with Time Travel. Every time I see someone ask for Time Travel fics here, I'm hoping to find new ones to read, I don't even care about quality anymore, but people mostly recommend the same fics I already read years ago over and over again.

Also, I loved "To Shape and Change" too. I'm assuming that's the one you are talking about, and if not, can you post a link?
