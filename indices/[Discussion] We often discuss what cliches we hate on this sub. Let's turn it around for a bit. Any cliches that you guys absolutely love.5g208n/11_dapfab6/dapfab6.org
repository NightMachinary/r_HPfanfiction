I don't know if its a cliche, but I love general fandom characterization of adult!Ginny. Most stories I've read do really interesting things with her character and make her just an extension of the interesting and outspoken person she was becoming in canon.

A lot of stories get Sirius bang on as well. He's the kind of character where most characterizations work, due to his nature and background.

I also enjoy stories that explore Daphne and Tracy or feature either or both of them as characters, and I tend to like fanon!Padma too.
