Angsty and drama-filled Harry/Ginny where they wind up together. I know realistically they probably were fine together after the battle, and they got through her final year at Hogwarts without any guys hitting on her or the distance not being a big problem, but I love to read stories where Ginny is mad at Harry right after the battle, or stories where there are problems due to her being away from him. I especially love the common cliche (though honestly don't see as much as I thought I would here) of some guy hitting on Ginny and you wondering if something will happen but it doesn't because love and such.
