  "Surely a Bogart has it's own form "
#+end_quote

I'm not certain that it does. A boggart is a creature which draws fears from a victim's mind and presents it to them as if it were physical. And yet it can only be affected by a spell to disrupt its attack. It feeds on one emotion and suffers from another- amusement, as demonstrated by laughter.

I would conclude that a boggart is most like a poltergeist- a nonhuman spirit that can affect the physical by taking a form. It could be that a poltergeist is an advanced form of boggart who has absorbed enough anxieties from different victims that it has formed its own identity. While it has taken a single form it now uses that unique and disturbing existence to further its feeding. Peeves certainly seems to thrive on outbursts of rage, shame and fear.

EDIT: so to answer the question, I think a dead boggart looks like a small puddle of ectoplasm.
