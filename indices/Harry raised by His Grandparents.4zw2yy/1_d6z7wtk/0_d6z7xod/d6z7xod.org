  It is said that as long Alessia's heirs bear the Amulet of Kings, then Tamriel shall be protected from Oblivion and the Empire will be prosperous. But the Amulet has been shattered, and an eternal barrier has been placed between Mundus and Oblivion. But even as an Emperor sits on it, the Ruby Throne waits for its true heirs to return. (Skyrim timeline; pre-GoF; AU and Timeline)
