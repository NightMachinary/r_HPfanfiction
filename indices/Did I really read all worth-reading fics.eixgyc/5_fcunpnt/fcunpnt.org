It can happen, especially if your interests and standards are narrow enough. I managed to exhaust the complete list of >40k fics with my favorite pairing on ffn (except perhaps for fics with improper character tagging) even without having any standards, and at this point I simply have to wait for someone to make a new one, or maybe write one myself if I am inclined for more of it, or just re-read something...

However, it sounds like your interests are more general. Ao3 has rather powerful tagging, you should be able to filter out everything you don't care for there.

Here's a couple of fics of various kinds that I've read and liked. Maybe you find something of interest? I mostly read SS-centric, but I'll also link other stuff in case you don't care for SS-centric fics. I have read and liked some SSHG fics (The Young Adventurer's Club probably being the best fic to someone without a particular interest in the ship) but none of these below are SSHG.
