My favorite Hermione fic is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - she's totally badass and so smart. It is complete and has a sequel.

Dudley's Memories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd][Paganaidd]]

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there is more.
