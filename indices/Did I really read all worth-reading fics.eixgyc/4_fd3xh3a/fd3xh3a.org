You might want to check out the fic I've started publishing (6 chapters and 39k words so far). It's going to be LONG (I've already written nearly 700k words), and I'm posting two chapters a week. It's called /Loose Cannon/ and it's post-Hogwarts, epilogue-non-compliant. Genre is comedy, with a big scoop of hurt/comfort. Rating is M (the story is racy but not smutty).

It starts 14 months after the Battle of Hogwarts, and the initial premise is that due to a chance, overheard comment, Harry quits his Auror job and joins the Chudley Cannons. There are heaps of original characters and lots of romance (but no harem). Very little character-bashing, and I've tried to skewer the usual tropes (e.g. Super!Harry, Lord Harry, Richer-than-the-Queen!Harry, etc.).
