Bi-weekly scheduled detention where Harry and Snape just insult each other to keep themselves sane.

"Sir, have you tried not acting like child-abusing dingbat"

"How extraordinarily like your father you are potter, he too imagined the entire school weeping at the sight of his celebrity status"

"Thanks, I needed that. Thursday?"

"Make it Wednesday, Potter"

After 7 years Snape might just make a graduation speech for Harry, declaring him the most arrogant little toerag he has ever encountered, even surpassing his father. Harry loves it and gets downright emotional.
