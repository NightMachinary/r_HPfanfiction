I can't see Voldemort trying to impress him with 'kindness.' Not really a thing, for psychopaths. Buuut... I could see him trying to show off how terrifyingly powerful he is. Or ruthless. Maybe torturing a minion or few for a while, for leaving him. Or planning it out beforehand to look way more dramatic.
