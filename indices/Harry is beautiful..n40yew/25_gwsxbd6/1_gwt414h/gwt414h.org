Ugh, let people do what they want. Fanfiction writing can be anything anyone wants. It doesn't have to be canonical, it doesn't have to be just like the books. If I wanted to write a fanfic where everyone was completely out of character or Harry Potter was so evil that Voldemort trembled, I could, because fanfic is exactly that- fan written fiction. It doesn't have to be canon. Let people have fun and stop being such a jerk.
