During 2nd year, Harry has an urge not to look like Goyle and grabs Hermione's polyjuice instead. Ron and Hermione grudgingly accomplish the mission, though they're totally caught up in arguing about the merits of boy bodies on the way back.

For Harry, the problem is quite different. He isn't upset, but does appear somewhat sullen on their way to the hospital wing. It's just that he doesn't want to cure it, really. The change has fixed (and improved) his eyesight. Pomfrey is unusually agreeable to his retaining the changes, as she finds his purring very soothing. if there's any detriment, it's that he can't return to the Dursley's - like that would upset him in the least.

Albus insists that he needs to be transformed back into a muggle-acceptable form. With cooperation from Pomfrey, McG, and Snape, Harry becomes mostly human, though his cat ears hide in his unruly (but touchably soft) head of hair. When he lets the ears pop out, it's like Veela Allure, only in cuteness.
