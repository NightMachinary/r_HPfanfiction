Have you read the Graceling series by Kristin Cashore? One of the books is [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_(Cashore_novel][Fire]]) and has 'monsters'- animals that are an anomaly among their kind because their brilliant colors make them beautiful and irresistible, like a compulsion. Wild animals that are 'monsters' often don't live long because they are hunted down. The book tells the story of the last /human/ monster and what she goes through when her father used his powers for evil and she just wants to be left alone but her appearance drives everyone closer to her.

Your prompt kind of reminded me of that. Harry could be one of the monsters but instead of getting it from his parents it could also be a power passed down from Riddle like/instead of parseltongue. Riddle used it to control others and gain followers and build his Death Eaters- Harry of course wants to be /'just Harry.'/
