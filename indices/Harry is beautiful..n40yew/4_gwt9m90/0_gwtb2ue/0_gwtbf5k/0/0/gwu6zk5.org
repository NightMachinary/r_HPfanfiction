there are four books in the series and fire is set in the world as book two something of a prequel, it should also be noted that "monsters" just aren't just "too with pretty with their bright colors" they are legitimately terrifying creatures who can control the minds of non-monster creatures. her father was a legitimate monster, not just a "monster" he thought of himself basically like a god and that he could do anything to them. also, monster creatures are more deadly than regular creatures, not less they would mind-controlling regular animals into walking into their mouths something that makes them more terrifying is that they would also do this to children. monster is brightly colored with all colors of the rainbow the main character has bright fire-colored hair. while monster does attract normal creatures and humans in a sort of "charm" they also arent more likely to get eaten than normal it's more like being hypnotised with other animals breaking their normal habits hypnotized just to stare at them to the point that without outside prompting they would just sit there and wast away not meaning any rudeness I just don't want anyone coming into these books with misconception the Graceling series is a very dark story but it is also a very compelling story about overcoming hardship and finding your inner strength. one of the main themes of the story in the second and third books is not following the evil of one's parent. I love this story so much but it's not some light fluffy stories and the first book Graceling has nothing to do with the continent that fire takes place on and there is no monster instead there are only humans with graces supernatural powers or skills that only show up in humans with heterochromia two eyes with different color and is a really really good story in its own right. there is some connection but ill leave that unstated
