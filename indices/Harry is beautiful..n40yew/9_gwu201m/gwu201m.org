Hermione had gotten caught up following Harry. /Yet another/ 7th-year girl had stopped him in the hall. Then a wizard in stunning pearlescent-orange robes had walked right up to Harry, "I'm Calvin Twilfitt and I think you should be my next robe model."

"Thanks! said Harry, and they continued on. Hermione, agitated, whispered "What is he even doing in the castle? And he didn't ask for your name or give you any information!"

Harry shrugged, "He'll figure it out."

"We're so late for potions!" huffed Hermione, but when they walked in, Snape said "Who has dared to interrupt my- oh, hello Harry! My apologies, please take your seats. Malfoy, share your notes with Mister Potter."

"Gladly, sir!" said Draco, enthusiastically patting the seat next to his.

After dinner, Hermione almost ran to Dumbledore's office.

"How's Harry?"

Hermione's frustration was apparent, "We were late to potions and instead of being angry at us, Snape apologized!"

Dumbledore nodded, "Well, beautiful people are treated differently from moderately... pleasant-looking people. They live in a bubble."

"How did Harry turn out as well as he did going through life like that?" asked Hermione

"The bubble isn't always a bad thing, look at me. Granger, I don't share this often, but this is a picture of me when I was 25 years old."

Hermione was dumbstruck, "What the...what? You looked like Godric Gryffindor!"

"I know."

"And your eyes were so much more twinkly. What happened to your eyes?"

"My point is, Granger, the bubble doesn't last forever."

Hermione was still looking at the picture, "Can I keep that?"

"No. It's my only copy."
