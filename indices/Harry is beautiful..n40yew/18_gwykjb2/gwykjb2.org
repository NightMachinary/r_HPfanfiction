Plot-twist: Harry is actually an Eldritch abomination, a young one, that believes it's a mortal/Harry Potter.

Only a few people can see the truth, which includes Voldemort: All others, including Dumbledore, just can't see it.

It doesn't help that an unknowing Harry genuinely has a sweet, innocent personality.
