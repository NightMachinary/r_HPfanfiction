I think Luna would work better as a child of Morpheus (he's specifically the god of dreams) rather than the Hypnos (the general god of sleep). Or maybe Apollo, and you could have wrackspurts and whatnot be a type of oracle-adjacent thing. Iris or a minor cloud nymph (not a god, I know, but pretty close) could also work.

​

Do you mean Ares or is "areas" a different god?

​

If Roman variants are fine, I think I might make Ron a child of Mars rather than Ares (his chess feels like it'd fall closer to Mars than Ares since Mars had more strategy). Nike might also be kinda funny (since he isn't particularly amazing at anything) and fit his ambitiousness, but I'm not sure if it'd work otherwise.

​

I think Ares would be totally fine for Ginny, but if you wanted to go more obscure, maybe she could be a child of Nemesis.

​

I think it could be kinda funny to have Draco be a Legacy - one of his relatives was the direct child of a god rather than Draco himself. Actually, depending on how far you want to bring the AU, maybe most of the Pureblood families are Legacies.

​

If Voldemort is a threat in this AU, I think he'd need to be a Demigod too. Hades might work well, but I don't want to go for some sort of "children of Hades are typically evil" thing. One of the other war gods like Eris (strife) or Deimos (terror) might work well. Or maybe just Hecate so as to justify his great magic power.

​

Also, did you mean to spell "Hermione Granger" as "Harmony Grander" and "Demeter" as "diameter"?
