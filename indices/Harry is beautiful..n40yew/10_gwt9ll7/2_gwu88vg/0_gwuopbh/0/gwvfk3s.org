spelling fixed

I meant to make luna a child of the god of dreams I just got confused ill fix that, thank you. she has been adjacent to an oracle in a lot of HP fanfics and I like the idea of her just being quirky more with a sort of dreamy disconnect from the world. ultimately it would be up to debate whether she is oracle adjacent.

as for Ron I made a discovery above and changed my mind to Athena. it fits when you think about it. with the spiders being one of the bigger indicators.

ginny is more aggressive than vengeful or particularly can revengeful, I can see Bellatrix as a child of nemesis

also having the noble families being legacies makes so much sense and puts blood purity as something that makes so much sense and something that non-fanatical could believe in, something that might even hold some truth and event adds an extra layer to blood purity when it comes to muggle demi-gods and immortal "witches" that are the children of gods/Hekate but might not show a talent for anything but manipulating the mist

Draco specifically I could see as a descendant of pluto but specifically in his god of riches epithet, being the reason behind their riches and maybe even their luck and cockroach-like survivability

the black family probably being descended from Dionysus specifically in his madness epithet giving them both more power darkness connections and the famous "black madness"

the dumbledore would be descended from Heckat as both a direct descendant and as a dem-god of her showing the family's extreme magical aptitude.

the Weasleys being a rambunctious mix of war gods and bestial gods showing their power but more directly molly is a daughter of Hestia shown whenever she is protecting her home and family "not my daughter you bitch" being the most prevalent example of this (perhaps changed to her using powerful fire magic turning Bellatrix to ash rather than freezing her)

the family that madam Pomfrey being a legacy of apollo

the Longbottom's would have their legacies in mars on both sides of his family making him something of a war hopeful making his more natural and plant biased magic a bit of a letdown (whose until he shows how devastatingly it can be used in war

the Lovegood's would have roots in more knowledge biased gods but more recently lunas father is a son of Dionysus

finally, the penultimate we have Voldemort and the marvolo bloodline for Voldemort himself not be a son of Thanatos and his fear of death would at first come of living an uninteresting life and ending up standing In the of standing in the fields of asphodel forever, however after he creates the first Horcrux he would fear the fields of punishment he would want to live forever so that he doesn't have to face his punishment. Over time, however, he would stop running from death and start running towards godhood so he never sees death. marvolo bloodline would be one that has not had a significant infusion of new blood either divine or mortal in nature and my opinion might surprise you it would either be Demeter or just some random saytr, given that the gift to speak to animals is one that is almost entirely exclusive to nature biased whether that's a deity or saytrs and since they almost exclusively have kids within the clan there would be no or almost no other deities to make them more complicated than that.
