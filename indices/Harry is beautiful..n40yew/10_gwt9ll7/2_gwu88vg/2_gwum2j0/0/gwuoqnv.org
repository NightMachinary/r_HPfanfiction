hmmm now that I think about it, it does fit him great a strategy expert (near the end) scared of spiders, has a genetic predisposition for weaving (this might have been what drew Athena to molly) the only problem is that he doesn't like studying altho this could be him mimicking his older siblings trying to emulate them specific George and Fred and maybe charlie and bill in their more active styles of casting and developing a dislike for studying which his brother would loudly talk down about and say that it is extremely harder than he thought it would be making him fear that he was going to fail, giving him a " I can't fail if I don't try" attitude ya that makes sence
