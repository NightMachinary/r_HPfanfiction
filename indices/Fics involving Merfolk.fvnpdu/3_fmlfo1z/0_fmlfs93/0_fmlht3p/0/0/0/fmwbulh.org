Heh. Well, you Huggleborns can think that way if you like. :)

In case you're interested, my tag actually came from a D&D twitch show called Critical Role that did a single episode of a Harry Potter Tabletop Roleplaying Game. For copyright issues, they couldn't have the actual houses, so they had Horfleporf, Smitherpin, Pigeonclaw, and Driffingor. It was quite fun, so I adopted it as my tag. :)
