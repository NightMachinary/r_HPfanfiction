In linkffn(time to spare), somewhere in the middle of it, Harry goes to the magical university (Atlantis University, it's located under water)(where he is the only human) and makes friends with a mermaid (and a goblin and a centaur). Closer to the end he, knowing Mermish, asks help in defending Hogwarts from merfolk in Hogwart's lake.
