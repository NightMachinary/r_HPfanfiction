#+begin_quote
  It's 5th year and Harry Potter has been facing crisis after crisis on his own. He has no one to turn to, other than his friends, but they can only help so much. Harry needs the legal right to protect himself from the abuses he is constantly targeted with. Follows OOTP, but all events occur 1st term. Mentor/bonding fic. Slightly AU Severus in the beginning/more as the story goes on

  This is a pseudo-sequel to Emancipated Minor. A change in a minor scene leads to a different sequence of events during Harry's 5th year, when he has been facing hardship entirely on his own. He needs the legal right to protect himself from abuse by adults. Follows OOTP, but all events occur 1st term. Mentor/bonding fic. Slightly AU Severus in the beginning/more as the story goes on
