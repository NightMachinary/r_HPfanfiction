The Accidental Animagus, though, is part of a saga. It starts with The Accidental Animagus, continues in The World of The Accidental Animagus, and goes on in Animagus at War. It is in this last one where the story seems abandoned, It's been almost a year since the last update and it doesn't seem like it's going to resume any time soon.
