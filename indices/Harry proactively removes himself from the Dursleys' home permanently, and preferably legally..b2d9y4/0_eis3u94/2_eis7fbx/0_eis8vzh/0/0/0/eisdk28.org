I seriously hope this is the case. That story was actually quite good. Actually, everything I've read from White Squirrel is usually a few notches higher than the rest of the content in terms of quality. If this is the case, then I'll gladly welcome the wait. I'm willing to wait a few months to preserve the quality of two good stories. I don't want Annals of Arithmancy to be rushed, and if the wait means that the Accidental Animagus is going to continue with full strength, then so be it. I want to believe.
