Yeah, Annals of Arithmancy is an epilogue series. The entire thing is post Voldemort/Hogwarts Battle, and it shows Hermion'e life and most notable achievements in the years following the battle. To be fair, it *is* kinda complete, since the author has stated that the story is layed out already, and that it will have 25 chapters. I assume they just need some polishing before they're published, it's just a matter of time.
