I've read a couple of fics like that. From the top of my head I only remember Rune Stone Path linkffn(11898648), which has exactly that scenario. In this one he manages to get legally adopted by someone he actually cares about, even after Dumbledore's refusal. And in the end he gets a bonus in that department, but I can't say more without spoiling the story.

â€‹

The Accidental Animagus linkffn(9863146) also has something like that, but in this one he escapes his home at a very early age and gets adopted by the Grangers. It's a good read, but this one's discontinued, seemingly abandoned, and just when it was getting good too, so I don't know if it's worth the read for you.
