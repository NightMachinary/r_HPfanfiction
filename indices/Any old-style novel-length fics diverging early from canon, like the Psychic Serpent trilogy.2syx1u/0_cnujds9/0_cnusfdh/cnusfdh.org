I read the Firebird, don't like it at all. It's a sexual fantasy disguised in decent writing. The plot moves at the speed of light, all characters speak in the same way, and it's short.

The Chem prof stuff, all I'm seeing is 1 chapters everywhere, and those that are not, it's all Horcruxes, post-Deathly Hallows, post HBP... that's exactly what I'm /not/ looking for.

And Muggledad, everything that's not 1 chapter is WIP... I'm sorry, but none of these are what I'm looking for.
