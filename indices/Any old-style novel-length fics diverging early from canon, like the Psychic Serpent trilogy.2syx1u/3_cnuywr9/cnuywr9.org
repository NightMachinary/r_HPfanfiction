Heh i just wrote the following on [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2syzqb/artistharry_fics/][a thread asking about Artist!Harry fics]]

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2917903/1/All-at-Once][All at once]] is a fic where Harry went to Stonewall instead of Hogwarts. It's very AU, writing started before Deathly Hallows was released. So yeah it's kinda different from canon but I really liked it (read it recently), apart from Harry being a bit too good at magic, it's really nice. (also warning, it's really long :p (didn't realise before i started reading)).

  But yeah in the fic Harry is good at painting and drawing and stuff, he takes art classes and all and the whole thing is really a quite prominent thing about him in the fic.

I feel like it stays true to the characters, though there's some differences, but i feel like the changes are explained enough by the changes in plot.
