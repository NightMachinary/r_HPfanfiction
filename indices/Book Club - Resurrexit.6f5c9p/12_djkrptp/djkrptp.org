I feel the wordcount is too small for it to properly introduce and develop an oc antagonist. I mean, in a brilliant fashion it can be done. But usally even canon chars acting ooc need more than just slightly over what the first book had.

All in all it seems like a well written and good idea. But I have just skimmed over some parts, to see if it is interesting. So I have no fully confirmed opinion.
