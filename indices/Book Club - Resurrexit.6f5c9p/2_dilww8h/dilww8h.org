Alright. Finished reading. SPOILERS IN THE REVIEW.

At 75k the story is rather short as novel length fanfiction goes. The word count fits into the genre, but I feel like some things just don't click here and I can't decide if it's because they should have been cut or expanded.

To reiterate my previous point, the weird switching between perspectives put me off. To get the technical out of the way, the prose was polished as far as lack of typos and grammatical soundness, but nothing about it made me sit up and take notice. I'd go sk far as to say it's downright bland at times, with the author going for the straightforward spelling things out when a metaphor might have been better. Direct isn't always better.

I'm not going to harp on characterizations because this obviously takes liberties. Harry as a serial killer corrupted by love? I can buy it.

What then has to hold everything together is the plot, which I've found to be weirdly disjointed. I'm told there's thus sequence of events, but they don't gel together nicely, the story beats are like parts that the instruction says are supposed to fit together, but the installation job was shoddy.

Sayer was a wholly uncompelling character and it's not about him being an OC. I just feel like he wasn't given enough depth for his role and the final reveal was kinda lame.

Then the whole thing with Harry's killing spree. Why did he kill Mundungus exactly? Because Mundungus knew about a witness to some event that is not explained and left me confused. And I didn't buy the angst over Luna, attempted necromancy and the detour to Africa that lacked any kind of depth. Relevant exposition was thrown out in the moment it was needed, nothing was set up. The whole story read like the author decided on facts as he wrote. I'm not bashing on discovery writing, but this just has no coherence. The attempted misdirection with Bogand was weak and Neville's jumping to a lucky conclusion about Harry being the killer had no foundation. Ron's involvement was boring.

Maybe it's because of the genre, but the characterizations of all characters were taken in the bleak melodramatic noir direction which made them blur with each other. Everyone is fucked up and it's all coming out like goo through cracks. Big moments had no punch and the avalanche in the finale came rapidly, without letting one thing sink in before the author dropped the next "bomb".

I'm certain a lot of my dislike is coming from my apathy towards the genre, but for Master Slytherin's reputation I expected something less... formless. And the epilogue was completely unnecessary, or at least the second part of it. I'd have disliked it less if it had just been the funeral. That was enough to imply everything the author then spelled out for me at the very end.
