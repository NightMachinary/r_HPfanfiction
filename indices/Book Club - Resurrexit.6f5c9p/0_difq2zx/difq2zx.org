This isn't the first time that I've read this, but I skimmed things again to refresh my memory.

The style of the story reminds me a bit of old hard-boiled fiction. Something about the first-person style and the inner monologue in Harry's parts especially. The other viewpoints don't really have the same feel, but they do sound like the POV characters. That can be difficult to pull off for some people when using multiple POVs in a story.

The tone and direction of the story are satisfying to me, and I found the characters to be generally in-character.

A slight problem that I had with the story is that, at just under 75k words, it feels a little light, and that ties into my biggest problem -- the villain. *Huge spoilers*, but it [[/spoiler][was a bit unsatisfying to have an OC fill the role, partly because I wasn't very invested in him as a character. Maybe if there had been a little more to the story, it might have established him better and gave the reveal more impact.]]

*tl;dr* - Like the style, had solid writing, but the antagonist and the length of the story were issues for me.
