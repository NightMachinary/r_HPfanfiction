I'm a quarter of the way through and at 75k I'd expect some of that much talked about brilliance to have dawned on me by now.

Switching between present tense first person and past tense third limited isn't endearing the fic to me. Might be an interesting experiment, but with every new chapter I have this whoop crash into a wall where I have to switch gears to make sense of what I'm reading.

Writing style is definitely peak of fanfiction, but it's not blowing me away or anything. It's competently dry.

Lastly, it smells awfully like grim tough noir detective fiction, which is a genre that bores me to tears. I'll probably finish the fic because it's relatively short, but I'm fully expecting a dinner scene at some point, with detailed descriptions of pan seared salmon with a side of cauliflower puree and freshly sliced tomatoes or some such shit.

Edit: title is fucking cool though.
