Fair enough, though I think I see what you mean. Definitely the darker and more adult feel might not jive with everyone's interpretation of canon characterization. Maybe I'm just of the mindset that this is almost extraordinarily good writing, and I get that it's totally a matter of opinion.

I think we may be on opposite sides when comparing to Stages of Hope, and maybe how you feel about Resurrexit is analogous to what I think of Stages. It's a little too off for me with the battle hardened 4, and while it's a decent fic it doesn't seem like especially amazing writing to me.

Loving this discussion though!
