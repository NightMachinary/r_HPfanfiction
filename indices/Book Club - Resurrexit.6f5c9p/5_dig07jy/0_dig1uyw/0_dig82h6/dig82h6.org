wellll i did say it was unquantifiable.

but basically even when you write an au, if you're really good, the characters (and their interactions together!) will remind readers of their canon counterparts while also being more interesting (most of the canon characters were dull and pretty undeveloped). and it's more than the characters, it's the setting, it's how the ministry or hogwarts is described and included in scenes -- this is fucked up by basically everyone. it's what separates actual fanfiction from just 100k words with vaguely familiar names.

i didn't quite finish this story, but i read enough to tell it didn't have that.

note: extraordinarily good writing can bypass all of this.

note2: see stages of hope for an example of internal consistency (characters, interactions, settings) combined with extreme au.
