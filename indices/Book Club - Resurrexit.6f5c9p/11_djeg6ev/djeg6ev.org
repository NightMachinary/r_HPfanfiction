I made it through the first 7 chapters before dropping.

Admittedly, I should have just stopped reading after the first 2 chapters as I could already tell that I didn't like it. But, the prospect of participating in a book club was just so enticing. Alas. And, next month's fic looks even worse...

Anyway.

Reasons I didn't finish:

- Call me churlish and unreasonable, if you will. But, I must say that the, presumably, youthful writer makes an irritating habit of abusing, defenseless, commas, seemingly, assigning descriptive terms to the wrong nouns to get across the, actual, point, and, stubbornly, refusing to admit that adding more adjectives does not, actually, create a "mood".

- The constant switching of perspectives was disruptive rather than fluid, breaking up the flow of the story without any payoff for that discontinuity.

- Characters didn't come off as being probable versions of their canon counterparts except that they've all gone through the book events, even if EWE. In conjunction, their post-Hogwarts life choices were a little baffling at times. This is taking into account the likelihood of their having gone through some horrifyingly traumatic event where everyone they loved died, they vowed to never love again, and an invasion of Dementors consumed their souls followed by their incognizant bodies being Imperio'd into a caricature of their former selves by a Jim Butcher fan. As previously mentioned, I didn't finish this story. But, the above scenario was the only thing that really made sense, when I tried to figure out how it might have ended. Needless to say, I found the fic's characters and their conflicts uninteresting.

- Leading off the characters-might-as-well-have-been-a-cast-of-OCs point, all fanfiction writers bank on their readers knowing the characters to the extent that building emotional investment is largely unnecessary. But, when you change the mood, characters' personalities, and skew their life choices without opting for a true AU, parody/satire, or even just a single point of divergence...well. There just wasn't enough personal attachment for me to care about anything they were going through nor could I bring myself to be bothered by the crime remaining unsolved.

- The premise wasn't terrible, but it's not something I'm going to choose to read on my own. Funnily enough, this point was the real deal breaker. I'll cut way too much slack to a fic that has an idea behind it that interests me or follows a token set-up like time travel which is one of my guilty pleasures. If it's a premise that doesn't interest me, then it takes something special in the plot, characterization, or world-building to keep me reading. An example of the latter in line with this story's genre of crime/mystery: linkffn(3435122).
