More info: one time I remember this taking place is right before the (Leaving?) Feast and Ron was accepting of it, just waited it out. It was at least 5th year as Ron thought of how this hadn't happened in a while and I am fairly sure Diggory's death was mentioned. It is possible that a teacher finds out, I want to say Severus, and helps out eventually.
