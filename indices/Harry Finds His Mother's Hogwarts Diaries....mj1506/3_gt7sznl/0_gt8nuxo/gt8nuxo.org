Even WBWL fics have a habit of trying to avoid Lily bash, usually by just not making her into her own character but rather more of a trophy wife for James -- something pretty to look at but without her own agency. Which is arguably even worse than bashing because at least in those fics, she is her own person...

The only time I see Lily-bash really is in 70s Slytherin whitewashing fics, typically with Regulus, Severus and sometimes the Malfoys.
