The diary should definitely end with Lily writing in it as Voldermot is coming up the stairs to kill her and Harry. Something along the lines how 'James is bravely fighting Voldermot having gone to face him with a relieved grin on his face obviously to be a hero to his wife and son' ( when in actuality he was so tired of lily that he wanted to get killed by Voldermot just so he wouldn't have to deal with her )
