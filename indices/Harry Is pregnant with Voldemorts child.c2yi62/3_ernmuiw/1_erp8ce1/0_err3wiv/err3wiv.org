Nope and it surprisingly turned out good. I initially was somewhat wary but my curiosity got a hold of me. There was no creepy birthing scene. Voldemorts aims turned out differently from book. But Im not going into detail.

Voldemort became very caring of Harry after the inital confusion.

My advise dont judge a book by its cover. I wasnt sure about in the beginning but I loved it

Read a chapter or two. Just to get a sense. You might find yourself surprised like I was.

That being said I do urge caution when you read online. I have come across stories that gave me several red flags that I in my idiocy decided to ignore. Those instances have sickened me to my core. Obviously certain instances happened early on in the reading.
