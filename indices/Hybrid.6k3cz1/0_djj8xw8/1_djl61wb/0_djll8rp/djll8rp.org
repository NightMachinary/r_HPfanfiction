Of course I don't mind in the slightest! This is a fanfiction subreddit we're on after all, if I wanted to keep ideas to myself I'd never post them! I never really put any of my ideas to paper anyway, I'm just amazed someone is willing to do something with one of them!

And that tidbit looks fantastic. I wish you truly the best of you luck your fic! Please let me know (either through PM or in a comment) when the first installment's up!
