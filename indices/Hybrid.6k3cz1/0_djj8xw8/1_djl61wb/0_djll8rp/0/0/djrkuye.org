Looking good! I'm definitely going to be following this story! (Shame I don't have an AO3 account.)

And thanks for mentioning my comment (you didn't have to) at the end! If I may make a recommendation though, I'd save mentioning the inspiration for much later in the fic (until it's been revealed just how Harry lost his marbles) as it gives away the premise - unless, of course, you have so many more unveilings and plot twists waiting in the wings that spoiling this one doesn't matter.

EDIT: I also just noticed the tags.
