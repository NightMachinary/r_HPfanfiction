Hope you don't mind, but this spurred me to make something. It's unedited and the first chapter isn't quite finished, but here's a taste:

#+begin_quote
  Ever have days where you'd wished you just die? You know, those days where everything you do is clouded by a vast, endless wave of agony and despair? The kind of days that hollow you out with a dagger and chop up your insides into tiny little bits of potions ingredients?

  Yeah, I'm having that kind of day right now and it's not just because someone actually *has* hollowed out my insides for potions ingredients.

  It's because they're growing back. They always grow back. And there's not a thing I can do about it --

  No, wait, that's not necessarily true. I can get angry about it. That's what I am right now, angry, angry enough to THINK IN CAPSLOCK about how utterly FUCKED the man, the myth, the legend HARRY POTTER is.

  Yeah. That's me. Harry Potter. You might have heard of me before.

And there is the appetizer.

I'll be uploading the first chapter to Ao3 in a few days, hopefully. (It's going to be a little too fucked up for FFN for any future installments I have planned.)

*Edit*: I really shouldn't have done this since I have other things in the works, but I don't care. It was a fantastic idea from [[/u/SaberToothedRock]].
