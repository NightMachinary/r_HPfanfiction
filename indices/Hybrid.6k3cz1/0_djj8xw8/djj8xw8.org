Come to think of it, wouldn't this be the perfect excuse to turn him into a version of Deadpool? The basilisk venom is constantly killing him, and the phoenix tears are constantly healing him. He still feels all the pain until it drives him bonkers and doesn't bother him any more.

Not saying he needs to start using katanas or grow lumps on his head or anything, just a Harry slowly gaining Deadpool's mentality. Could be either a crackfic or a horrorfic as everyone realises that Harry's losing his marbles, painkiller charms aren't working and he can't be fixed. He can't be killed easily due to the phoenix tears, and the basilisk venom is resistant to all methods of healing except for the tears. Would be tragic as Ron and Hermione slowly see their friend slipping away from them through the cracks of sanity.
