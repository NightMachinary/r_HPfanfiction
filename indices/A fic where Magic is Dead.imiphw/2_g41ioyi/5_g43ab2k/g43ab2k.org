Can I just say how awesome it is that a SSHG fic made it to the top of this sub, even for a day? It's amazing, how those that put it in the title get downvoted immediately, but those that can describe the plot without mentioning the ship can get hundreds of upvotes because of how good that shit really is??? In the "Myth and Magic" fic, we're talking about a post-war adventure/romance with a bittersweet ending -- some of the best SSHG ever written, without even a tiny bit of weasely-bashing, or muggle-wank, or any of the /other/ top haters around here. Seriously, if you're here, about to downvote because SSHG disgusts you, I implore you to actually read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2758970/chapters/6185402][this fic]] and reconsider.
