Not strange at all! Please click on my username and take a look at the other rec's I've made in the past few days. It's so shitty how we have to avoid actually typing the letters SSHG. This sub has a real problem with our ship, even when it's post-war adult-relationship not that it has to be. I still remember 2002 when we couldn't imagine much beyond a 7th-year special project or apprenticeship, and there is so much more since then that... It's a rich world and a pair of intellectuals is a perfect ship to explore it!!!
