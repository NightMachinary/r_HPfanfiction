Could be the price of magic? [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/102618?view_full_work=true]]

I havent read that fic yet (only a few paragraphs into the first chapter), but it fits the magic is dead prompt. Not sure about it fitting anything else in your ask though since, I havent read too far into it yet. Looks like its tagged for slash though, so it might not be what you're looking for.
