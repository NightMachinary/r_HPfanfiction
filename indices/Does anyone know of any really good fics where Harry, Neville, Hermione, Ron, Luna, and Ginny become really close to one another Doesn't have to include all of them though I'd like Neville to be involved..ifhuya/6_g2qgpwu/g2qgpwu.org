Really close like "this fic's version of the Golden Trio is expanded to all six main student protagonists" or like "I want a polyamory fic between the main student protagonists, especially Neville, but I'm kind of hesitant to ask directly because it'll sound like I'm requesting smut"?

I'm sure I can pull a title for at least one of the former. Not sure about the latter but I'll glance around; My HP fanfic library is spread across at least four apps on two phones (including one that needs to stay plugged into a wall to function), so that takes a while to search.
