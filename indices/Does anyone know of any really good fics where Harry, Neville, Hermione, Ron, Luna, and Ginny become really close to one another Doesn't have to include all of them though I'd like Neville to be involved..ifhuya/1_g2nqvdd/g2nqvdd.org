There is! It's quite long and still being updated. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12924292/242/][A Second Chance]] by Breanie. I don't know how to link to ffn so you'll just have to use the link. The story basically follows the main plot points of the original series in one way or another. However McGonagall petitions for Sirius to get a trial. He's exonerated and Harry grows up in a loving home. As a child he befriends Neville, the Weasleys, Hermione, and Luna. There's a decent bit of erotica that can more or less be skipped without detracting from the story in super meaningful ways. It is a harry/ginny plot but we're 242 chapters in and still not quite there yet, so if that bothers you can read for a while before you have to deal with it. It also includes some deeply graphic content regarding Death Eaters and Voldemort thT really justifies the amount of fear people have for them. I think it makes the world more real, but it can be hard to read. I highly reccomend.
