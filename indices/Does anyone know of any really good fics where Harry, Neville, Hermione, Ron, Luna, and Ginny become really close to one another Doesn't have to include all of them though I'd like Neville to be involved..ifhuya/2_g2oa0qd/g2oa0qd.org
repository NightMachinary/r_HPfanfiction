ooh i've got a couple for this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2531438/1/A-Better-Man][A Better Man]], which is about if vernon changed in the beginning (it's really good and i've read it about ten times) that has that group + the triwizard champions when you get to that part. the ship is harry/ginny and other than that i can't remember, but yeah. the second one would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093897/1/H-J-Potter][H J Potter]], which is a harmony soulbond fic but it's quite long and the group of characters is really well thought out. this is definitely one of my favourite fics, although it does mainly focus on harmony (so i don't know if you'll like it). but they're both good, give 'em a read. hope you enjoy!!
