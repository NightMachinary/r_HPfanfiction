Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. Harry Potter kills himself to go back in time and fix the worst case scenario the world has become. Part of fixing things is treating his friends better and being more open with them. It has some really good drama with Harry both trying to be more open and needing to hide what he is until they can protect the secret for him.
