Honestly, now that you pointed it out it is weird... I mean, the initial crush was kind of cringey but then I kind of forgot about it when it moved towards the two of them being into each other (maybe because it took some time to get to it and I forgot by the time I reached the “proper” romance? IDK). But now that you put one next to the other it is weird - or rather unrealistic. I mean, honestly, how likely is it that your celebrity crush turns out to be the person you make them out to be? I'd say it's kind of a Mary Sue moment if you know what I mean...
