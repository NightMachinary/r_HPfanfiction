No one. I would like it better if JKR didn't rush to pair everyone off in the epilogue. I think it would be better if she focused on the adventure and friendship part of HP. I'd be kind of nice to have an open ending to the series, where everyone could imagine Harry's life after Voldemort's defeat however they wanted.

If I /had/ to choose someone then, I'd probably go with Hermione or Luna (though I prefer Luna for Ron), simply because there are not many well-developed female characters in the series, and those two are the only ones I can come up with.

Still, in my opinion, JKR should stay away from Romance in HP. She did well with meaningless relationships like Harry/Cho, Ron/Lavender or Hermione/Viktor, but the serious ones were written awfully, and I found them completely unrealistic.
