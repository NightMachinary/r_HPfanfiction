Not the OP but the answer is probably a) nobody. Not everyone needs or wants a partner to be their best self. I'd totally read a fic about him third wheeling Ron and Hermiones marriage and keeping them together. B) cassia Smith a raven claw two years down from them. (Who is not real and I just made up. The point being someone who was close enough to the war to understand it but mentally well enough that they don't drag each other down.)
