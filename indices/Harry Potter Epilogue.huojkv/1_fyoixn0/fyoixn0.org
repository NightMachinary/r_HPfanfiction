I am quite certain that Ginny's crush when she was eleven was nothing like her feelings about him when she was fourteen (in the middle of OotP, when she returns back to the spotlight). Yes, of course, (as one Ginny in one fanfiction said) it is hard not to crush on the super famous Harry Potter who just saved your life and is leading you out of your death with the ancient magical sword on his shoulder and magical huge birds on the other one. However, she then completely evaporated from the story and the only redeeming quality of [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][this mistake]] is that she had an opportunity and time to reasses the boy and to see him in the more realistic manner. Which I hope she did.

However, the biggest problem of Hinny (and I do ship Hinny) is not that the relationship would be against her character as revealed in books, but that she has not character whatsoever. Read the link above.
