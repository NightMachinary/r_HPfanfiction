I've found quite a few that way. Some of the more notable ones are Worm, MHA, RWBY, game of thrones, and a variety of others. MHA, RWBY and worm all have a large number of stories that I love while GOT is more limited. Honestly I've been reading a lot of worm lately and would highly recommend giving it a glance if you haven't heard of it. A massively oversimplified summary of it with no real spoilers is it's marvels X-men/mutants where to get powers you have to have a horrible day and also Godzilla style monsters attacking every few months as well. There's a lot of variety in the powers shown which I really like.
