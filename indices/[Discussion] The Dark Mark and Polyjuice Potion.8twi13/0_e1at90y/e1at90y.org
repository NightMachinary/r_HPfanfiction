First off, why is it so bad to derail the Triwizard Tournament? That sounds a lot more interesting.

Second, Polyjuice appears to change the very nature of whoever drinks it. So if Moody did not have the Dark Mark, it should not be "detectable"

More importantly, to a degree you have boxed yourself in, with another wizard being able to inexplicably detect the Dark Mark. There is no reason to believe such a thing is possible, other than "because magic." After all. the Dark Mark was not a well known thing. It appears to have been largely unknown to the wizarding world, and someone having the ability to detect it would have likely changed the political landscape and the course of the war drastically.

I understand why you might put something like this in a fic. Its like authors who write "someone can only willingly take the Dark Mark," as a way around the imperius defense. But if that was true, its less likely the death eaters would have gotten off so easily. These sorts of inexplicable revelations always create more problems than they solve.
