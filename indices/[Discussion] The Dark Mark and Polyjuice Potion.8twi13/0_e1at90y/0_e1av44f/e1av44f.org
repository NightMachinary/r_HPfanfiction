As of yet the character Lex doesn't know why he can detect those with the mark. I'm still undecided if I'm going to have him discover that the only reason he can sense the death eaters is because Voldemort is his grandfather. (yeah I know, but I'm trying to be as non clich√© as possible about it.)

I just liked the idea of playing around with a character that had the same basic genetics as Voldy, who grew up in the foster system and had every reason to go the way that Voldemort did, but chose to back Harry from the sidelines. He is a wizard, but never got a letter to Hogwarts. (So Harry snuck him in to the castle and there is a lot of near misses were he's almost discovered, that kind of thing.)

Which is were the snafu comes in of Barty/Moody. I like your reasoning on the nature of polyjuice. Maybe, I could just have him be more suspicious of Moody, but have it be muted enough to were its not the usual feeling he gets so he's not sure?
