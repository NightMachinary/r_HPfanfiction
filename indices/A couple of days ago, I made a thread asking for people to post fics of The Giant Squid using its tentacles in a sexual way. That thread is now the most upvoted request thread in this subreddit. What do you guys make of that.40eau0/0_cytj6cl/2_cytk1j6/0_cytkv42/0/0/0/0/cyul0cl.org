I've always found my imagination has great images of my own, until I see a movie of the book. Then regardless of what I want, the actor/actress and the voice take over how I perceive the story. Harry potter was that way, some great (snape, lucius, Hagrid, madeye ) , some slightly disappointing but ok overall (hermione, Dumbledore, the dursleys), and others horrible (Ginny, Ginny, ginny)

Its the nature of it: if you are given a believable visual representation, it will often overwrite your imaginations counterpart
