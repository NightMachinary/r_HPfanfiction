I think it's people projecting adult characters onto their non-adult forms, because “they would be a couple in ten years so they clearly are perfect together and can always be a couple”. Admittedly that doesn't make it any less creepy, but I think in most cases it has nothing to do with pedophilia or whatever other age-related sexual issues there are.
