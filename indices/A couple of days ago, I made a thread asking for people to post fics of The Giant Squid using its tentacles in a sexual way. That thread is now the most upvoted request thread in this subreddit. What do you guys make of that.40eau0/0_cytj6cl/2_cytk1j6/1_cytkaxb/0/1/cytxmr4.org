By itself, not really, but considering how many kids at around that age try to find titillation in stories, it gives us a clearer view of the situation in which at least some of the ones reading are simply looking for romance with people their own age---and many of the rest that remains simply forget about the characters' ages. As much of a pretentious act as it might be, that's something using age-specific terms has over just using a blanket term, because it's weird that people forget, at moments like this, that teenagers read fiction too; well, that and some people get really over the top when they hear the word “pedophile” and go on a hunt that defies common sense.
