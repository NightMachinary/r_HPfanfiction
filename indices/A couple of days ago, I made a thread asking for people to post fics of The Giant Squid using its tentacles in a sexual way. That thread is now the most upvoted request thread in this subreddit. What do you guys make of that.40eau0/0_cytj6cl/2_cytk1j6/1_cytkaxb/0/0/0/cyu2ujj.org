I think that's kind of not the point, really. Biologically speaking there is a difference, but let us be honest there and admit that people who are adult are expected to actually control themselves well enough that attraction or not they would still be able to not act on it.

I mean, yes, I do agree that the people who automatically assume that if you sleep with someone who is a day before their 18th birthday or even just feel lust for them it automatically makes you some sort of ultimate evil, are overdoing it (and greatly so) the other way, but their issues aside I don't think that teenagers' ability to bear children should be touched with a ten-foot pole as a justification (or anything near it) for this. Because the people who don't get it won't understand, and most people who do get it will say that one still has control over what they do, and the ones without the control yet are basically the low-teen-years people (so 11--14, mostly) for whom the definition matters because ... well, because they're that age so for them the blanket term is different from the age-specific one.

That being said, the latter one doesn't make sense for me either, unless those people are in it for screams of anguish (and isn't that a scary thought, huh), since one could probably buy a life-like sex doll of that side from Japan or some other weird place if they truly wanted that.
