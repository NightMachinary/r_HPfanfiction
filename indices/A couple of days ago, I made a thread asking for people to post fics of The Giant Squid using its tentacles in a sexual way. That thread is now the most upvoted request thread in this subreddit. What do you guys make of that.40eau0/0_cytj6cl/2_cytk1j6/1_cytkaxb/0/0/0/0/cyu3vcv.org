The subject does lend itself to severe overreaction from the general populous. But you are right, it's almost impossible to have a civil conversation about the subject without everyone losing their shit. I would love to read some studies on the behavior and motivation of pedophiles. Do they generally love children and get naughty thoughts when seeing them or is it just some wild fetish. I know of a case where "The sudden and uncontrollable paedophilia exhibited by a 40-year-old man was caused by an egg-sized brain tumour, his doctors have told a scientific conference. And once the tumour had been removed, his sex-obsession disappeared." Too bad people overreact to the subject so massively, it really hinders unbiased scientific research.
