  A Russian and an American ran a race. The American won.

  The American press reported, “The American runner was first, and the Soviet as usual was very, very last.” The Soviet press reported, [[http://i.imgur.com/wVBflSu.png][“The Soviet runner got second place and the American runner came in second-last.”]]

Regarding the question itself: while fanfiction makes it easy to find stories with a niche trope of interest, it also makes the reader vividly aware of how many other niche tropes there are in the community they essentially share (and how many of those are weird sexual fetishes).

To counter the uneasiness coming from that awareness and defend from outside criticism, I think readers try to demonstrate self-awareness by being the first to laugh at the situation themselves. They do this by often discussing and demonstrating interest in stories most badly written or with most absurd premises.
