Haven't read the fic yet, but I wonder if telling the exact opposite of what's going to happen will work? i.e., If Harry sees that Voldemort is going to rise tomorrow, instead of telling the truth, he'll say Voldemort will never rise instead. Will people think he's lying and therefore assume that Voldemort /is/ going to rise (therefore, tricking them into believing the truth)?
