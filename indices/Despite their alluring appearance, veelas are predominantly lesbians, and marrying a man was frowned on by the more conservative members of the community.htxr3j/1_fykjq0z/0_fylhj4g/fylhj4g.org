Thank you! Yes, the more I think about them the more I am fascinated. There is a power in their beauty that makes them not the helpless object of the male gaze but the mistress of it. It's a shame that Fleur is predominantly remembered as a pretty French. I wonder if part of the reason she was Beauxbatons' champion is that the inherited veela power enhanced her magic in a way that made her an unusually powerful witch for her age. I remember she managed to lull the dragon to sleep in the first task and that may have to do with the "power of the heart" that veelas seem to have.
