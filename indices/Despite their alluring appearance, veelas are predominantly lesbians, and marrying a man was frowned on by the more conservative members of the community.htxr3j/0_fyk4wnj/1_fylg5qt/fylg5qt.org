That actually makes sense and sounds magical! I'll admit that male mating bird form veela would cause a little problem but there could always be a kind of ancient ritual specifically designed to transform a veela's reproductive power into her human form, and after this, she may not be able to employ her bird form so freely although she would still become bird-like when she's angry or upset. A sort of little-mermaid transformation if you'd like. It will mean a great sacrifice on the part of the veela and I am sure there could be a lot of drama and tension surrounding this. For example: what if a veela transformed herself for a man's sake and he abandoned her afterward? Or what if a veela who does not want to transform herself ends up doing the ritual to save her marriage? The ritual itself may be illegal for some time and improper performance by back-alley warlocks may cause more than one veela deaths and permanent injuries.
