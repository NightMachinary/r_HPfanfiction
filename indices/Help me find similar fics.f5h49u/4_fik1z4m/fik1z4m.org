I know few similar stories. My favorite is {[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8337871/1/The-Wizard-from-Earth]] } by Morta's Priest. Not finished and hasn't been updated in years but really good read.

Another, much shorter is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5414209/1/The-Fifth]] though it's also Highlander crossover.

I hope this is helpful.
