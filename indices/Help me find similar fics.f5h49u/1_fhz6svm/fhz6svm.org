Linkao3(Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower)

This one is a slash fic but it does have time travel elements and from what I remember was well written. It also jumps back and forth through time like you mentioned.

Last I heard it was still being updated but there are several parts of the story complete and for those who can't handle slash as far as I can recall it was in the background. MC just happened to be gay, it wasn't in your face about it and wasn't explicit in any way.
