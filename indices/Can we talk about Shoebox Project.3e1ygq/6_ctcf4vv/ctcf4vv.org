I quite enjoyed SBP. It's the reason I started shipping Wolfstar at all. 100% conversion. Read most of it on a plane ride to LeakyCon/in line at Wizarding World of Harry Potter, so it felt extra special. A lot of what people are saying is true, though. It hasn't aged very well.

I say go ahead and read it. I didn't like some parts of it (e.g. Prewett brothers worshiping, the beach??), but it's like reading a little bit of fanfiction history. I was 12 when I first started reading/writing fanfiction, so it definitely feels like a blast from the past (a lot of stories were like that back then). Wish I had read it when I was younger. So, if you want to waste a couple hours learning about the origins of Marauder tropes and the birth of Wolfstar, go for it. You wouldn't miss too much if you dropped it though. The thing with Marauder stories is that it's the same story over and over...

...and yet, I can't stop reading them.
