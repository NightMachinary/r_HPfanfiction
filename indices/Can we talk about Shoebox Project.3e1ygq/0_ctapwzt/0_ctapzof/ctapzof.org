I 100% agree. I don't think I've ever read one where they seem... Believable. One of my favourites (although it's not a very serious fic and I've never heard anyone mention it on here, which leads me to think that it isn't very popular?) is Match. by mental. It's not exactly believable and nor are the characters really as I would expect but I do think the dialogue is a perfect example of blokey british humour haha!

Don't suppose you have any recommendations for me do you?
