Oh man, there's a fic I never thought I'd see mentioned here. Totally aimless but written so well. Still love it when I reread parts of it. Too bad it never finished :( It was SUPER popular back in 2008ish (Top 10 on HPFF) but the original version got taken down, and she wasn't active at that point anymore, anyway.
