The problem with SBP is it was /the definitive/ Marauders fic for so long that it influenced /so much/ fic that came after it... and so there are huge swathes of fic that are horrifically out of character because they springboarded off of SBP.

As to whether you should keep going, depends how far in you are. If it's more than 10k I'd drop it, probably.
