The SBP was written way back in 2004, and has not aged well.

It was basically the fic that launched 1000 head canons. It looks positively mediocre now, because so many authors read it and were influenced by it.

It's like looking at a 16th century painting and going, "That baby has the face of an adult and the proportions of an alien. This is a terrible painting." You're not wrong, but it was a landmark piece at the time and it influenced a lot of other works.
