I read most of it in a long train trip and I liked it but I had no desire to continue reading it when I got home. It's fun but, as you mention, the characterization is weird and in the end I couldn't reconcile that version of the Marauders with what we have read in the books. It's very... /headcanon-y/ I think, which would explain its popularity.
