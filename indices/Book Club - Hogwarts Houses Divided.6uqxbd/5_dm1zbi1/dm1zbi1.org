Couldn't really get into this one, which isn't surprising since I've tried the the writer's big series without being hooked.

I made it through the first 12 chapters and gave up.

While the writing of *Hogwarts House Divided" shows technical skill, there's nothing that really stands out about it or the plot. The dialogue bothered me too -- many characters don't have distinct voices (Hugh being a big exception), so it all reads like the same person is talking. The "Slytherin is horrible" and "no true X acts like Y!" stuff was laid on a bit thicker than JKR ever managed, which got stale fast.

And though trying to be canon-flavor, there wasn't a whole lot of magical wonder, mystery, or whimsy. For a fic about the future, it seemed more embroiled in the past, going over well explored grounds. Oh look, here's the Room of Requirement. Oh look, here's a blow-by-blow Quidditch game.

... and then, within ten chapters, there was both [[/spoiler][a suicide attempt and shippy talk.]]

It was a lot of vaguely sketched OCs with their own POVs and nothing to do but deal with bullying. Even so, I couldn't quite hate it. It wasn't bad but, it wasn't noteworthy.

*tl;dr* - Writer knows how to write adequately but the story was just ... /there/.
