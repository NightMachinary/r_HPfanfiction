The ending of a certain character was downright haunting. It stuck with me for days and fanfics usually drift out of my head pretty quickly after reading. Its probably my favorite Teddy Lupin characterization.

The beginning is a little hokey just because the amount of kids in Teddy's year that are connected to the original trilogy is a little silly, but its something I was able to forgive pretty quickly.
