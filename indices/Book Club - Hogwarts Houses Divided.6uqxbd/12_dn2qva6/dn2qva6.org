I haven't finished the story yet, I'm only on chapter 6, but I have a question about the double classes thing. Aren't double classes supposed to be classes for one subject being twice as long on certain days of the week, or has it always just meant that two houses were in the same class in a double and only one house in a regular class? I have always been under the impression that a double class was the former and all regular classes had at least two houses learning together. Am I the only person who thought of a double class like this? If not why in the hell was I under the impression that double classes were twice as long? I'm so confused about this.
