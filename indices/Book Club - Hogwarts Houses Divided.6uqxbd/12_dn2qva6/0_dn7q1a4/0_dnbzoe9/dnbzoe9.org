Ok, that makes some sense. I guess I was confused because I've never got any hints that all classes didn't have less than two houses in them while reading the books. Though, that now makes me more confused about how the classes are scheduled so that only one teacher per subject can teach all seven years in the same week, with electives that are only taught to third years and up throwing a monkey wrench into the works. I have a feeling that I should look this up or ask about it in another sub.

Thanks for your efforts of clarification.
