No... in canon, only some classes are shared. Gryffindors have Flying and Potions with the Slytherins and Herbology with the Hufflepuffs... probably a shared class with the Ravenclaws as well, but that's never specified. Other classes are Gryffindors alone -- except for the electives like Care of Magical Creatures or Divination, which has students from all four houses.

In Hogwarts Houses Divided, they're trying to force inter-house cooperation by having ALL classes be shared.
