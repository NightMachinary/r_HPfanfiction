/Hogwarts Houses Divided/ is the first fanfic I read in a long time that reads like the original books. The writing is superb. And the characterization is so well developed, even with so many characters. The original characters (Harry, Ron, etc.) seem like an extension of canon and are not redefined or characterized as you see in a lot of other fanfics. The plot is well-paced, in my opinion, with enough hints to the Goblin Rebellion that the ending does not take you by surprise. The battle at the end seems a bit messy to me because of the number of main characters. Inverarity is a great author, and I recommend you read her Alexandra Quick series as well.
