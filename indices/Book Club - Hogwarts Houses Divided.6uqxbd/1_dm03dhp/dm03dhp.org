I know this isn't a popular opinion, but Hogwarts Houses Divided is one of the fics I didn't enjoy. Part of it may be the author writing style; I've certainly had that issue with other authors (namely Orson Scott Card). The main problem is that while I feel the tone(?) of the fic reads similar to canon, a lot of the characters are severely OOC. I can't imagine any of the kids who had to deal with Umbridge would have stood for that same level of bureaucracy in Hogwarts, and things like a kid being expelled for having a picture of his Death Eater father because of the Mark seems off.

Inverarity has a tendency to write adults and authority figures as people who only see the black and white, or for whatever reason can't act on important information (especially in the Alexandra Quick novels). For some situations it works (read: MOM in all forms through the original books) but even in the books there are plenty of adult figures who are able to stand up to the issues the Wizarding World faces.

This isn't to say it was a bad fic by any means. I didn't find any grammatical problems and the pacing was fantastic. It flowed. I just didn't find it very similar to canon.
