Can I ask how much of the fic is next-gen and how much is Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny/Other Weasleys.

I generally avoid next-gen fics because I like reading about the characters from the books, but many canon-compliant authors like Northumbrian and little0bird do a good job of splitting time between both generations.
