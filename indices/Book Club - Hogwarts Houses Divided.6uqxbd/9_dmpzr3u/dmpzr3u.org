THIS FIC STOLE A WEEKEND OF MINE A WHILE AGO. IT WAS AMAZING.

I get the various gripes (character voices aren't that clear, though I think Teddy's is pretty distinctive, it focuses too much on petty child problems, etc) that others have raised. It's kind of true. That said... This is also kind of true of the first book of Harry Potter. Think of the "Snape is evil because he's mean and a Slytherin" section of the plot, or how much is just... Random Harry and Draco things. Yes, it lays it on thick, but... Guys, it's a bunch of 11-year-olds. Look at 11-year-old Ron for a moment. Remember /that/?

And yet it is so charming and so cute and honestly the plot with the Goblins is way more interesting to me than the actual Voldemort "it's Nazis, but they're wizards" concept of Harry Potter (they're an oppressed minority! But they're bad! But they wouldn't be bad if they weren't oppressed! But that doesn't make them not-bad! Even the idea that some goblins DON'T KNOW GOBBLEDEGOOK blew my mind. Is their culture basically dying?).

The plot manages to blend the past and the future very well, provides interesting perspectives, has the whimsy and visceral power that good children's books have because everything at that age is so affecting and scary and amazing, and deals with complexities that were not really addressed directly in the books (eg: actual issues of race, the joy wizard children have at discovering muggle toys--We never see Hermione showing Ron a Nintendo or something, only Mr. Weasley cares about inventions from after the industrial revolution--, the power of beauty, divorce, even just the Hat having so much agency...). The idea of Slytherins basically getting racialized is amazing. I love how mature Harry is, and how nice yet firm a teacher Neville is.

It is, unfortunately for some, definitely a /children's/ story. It exaggerates the perspective of an 11-year-old and often ignores or only hints at the perspectives of adults. Somebody said the mention suicide was a problem, and... I mean, sure? If that bothers you, you're in charge of what you read. That said, preteens are the most likely age group to try to commit suicide. That's not crazy to include in a story that is basically about the children of a war-torn country's child-soldiers after they grew up. When I was 12, a kid in my classroom ran onto the street during recess shouting "hit me!" at oncoming cars. And from what I know of his life... It wasn't his home life that was the problem. It was that he got bullied so much. /Just like the kid in the story/. Children have incredibly low lows and a very short-term perspective, it happens.

This fanfic is a thousand times better than the "8th book" and if it could get some minor edits here and there I would be PSYCHED for it being declared canon. Even the basic idea at the start (The Sorting Hat sorts people in the wrong houses and tells them it won't sort anymore if people keep being jerks about sortings) is FANTASTIC. I love how the question of whether or not all of our characters actually belong in their houses is handled. Do they? Don't they? What does belonging actually mean? Is it not at the end of the day just that others accept you as you are and care that you feel welcome? Where /else/ would they belong, if in the end that is the case?

A++. Will read again.
