I read this a while ago and couldn't figure out way I was reading it at first, next-gen not being something I was interested in. About a third of the way through it got better as the action kicked in and by the climax I was fully engaged. I think it is probably even a child friendly read (it was about 60 books ago).

Inverarity is a good writer (that must have been why I started it) and this is a good decent-length read.
