I enjoyed readin this a lot. The writing style felt right, and matched the way the book series are written. One element that felt lacking was the Goblin rebellion plot. I wish we'd learned more about the politics of that before the shit hit the fan at Hogwarts. One the other hand, as this is written from Teddy's POV, it might have been something too hard for an 11 year old to understand.
