I really like Inverarity, so me liking this was a given. The fic flows really well, which is something not found. The plot was obviously meticulously outlined beforehand, as Inverarity did a great job of introducing mutiple plot threads that developed organically throughout the fic.

Too bad Inverarity isn't writing anymore. I enjoyed the Alexandra Quick series.
