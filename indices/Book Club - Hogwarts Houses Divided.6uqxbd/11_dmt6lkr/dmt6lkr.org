Probably my favourite HP fanfic altogether -- weird because usually I don't like next-gen fics. But this particular next-gen fic had me hooked; the kids actually had personalities, the plot was interesting, and the entire thing did a great job of "redeeming" Slytherin without turning it into a house of misunderstood woobies, or trying to insist that the entire house is a noble elite filled with expert political manipulators.
