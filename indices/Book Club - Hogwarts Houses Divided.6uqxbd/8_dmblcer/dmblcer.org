I did like it-- I just blitz read the whole thing over like the past 12 hours-- but I think the standing criticisms are largely valid.

There was one other thing that jumped out or bothered me and got me thinking about comparisons to canon. In the climax of the story, I had to keep pausing and thinking, this is still first year, right? In SS, the Harry, Ron, and Hermione... encounter a troll, help carry a baby dragon up to the astronomy tower in the dead of night, and try to stop a professor from stealing a powerful magical artifact. The fact that Quirrel is possessed is not something they are aware of or even think to suspect. All they know is, an adult wizard (and one they aren't all that impressed by, considering how he is in class) working for You-Know-Who, is trying to steal the stone. We gotta stop him. That is the extent of the danger they run headlong into, in first year.

The things they go up against by the end of the canon series are more than I can imagine myself as a seventeen year old withstanding, and that leaves me awed and horrified and humbled.

The things these kids run headlong into, as 11/12 year olds? Breaks my suspension of disbelief. Especially when they confront mortal danger up close, escape, and keep going back. I dunno. Maybe it's because I've always had more of a parent mentality, despite my children being, y'know, cats. But an 11/12 year old trying to do any of what Teddy does for some of those later chapters? That's not bravery, that's some kind of reckless short-sightedness and arrogance and boneheaded nonsense ignorant-- it's not the /right/ thing to do. Going and getting help, that's the right thing. Finding a safe place and staying put, that's IS what a child that age should do. Maybe if they'd been older, if the fic had been over the course of their first four years or something, I wouldn't be consumed with this sense of misplaced *BUT-WHAT-ABOUT-THE-CHILDREN!* wrongness.
