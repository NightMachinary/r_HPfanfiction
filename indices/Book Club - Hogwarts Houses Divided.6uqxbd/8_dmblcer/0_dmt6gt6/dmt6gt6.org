Weirdly enough, that was exactly what I liked about it. I was so tired of "next gen" fics where the plot was just about Harry's kids going to Hogwarts and nothing really happened beyond mundane school drama, so I really liked that you had a next-gen story where things got DARK and SCARY, and the kids had to deal with it -- and didn't always handle it sensibly because, well, they were kids.

But then I look at the entire thing as a storyteller, not as a parent.
