I never look at the glut of recent stories in ff.net because there's so many pebbles to wade through to get to the rare gem. Also, I rarely look at reviews, as they aren't an accurate gauge of quality. This is particularly true now, with blatant review whoring (hello LessWrong) and the fandom's reading being done increasingly on mobile devices where leaving reviews is a PITA.

Instead, I focus my searches. For new stories, I tend to browse threads like DLP's "Almost Recommended" and Beyond the Veil's "Updated Fics" for promising stories I've not yet encountered. This sub also occasionally has something good I've not run across. "Favorites" and "C2" lists compiled by authors who write stories I enjoy and whose tastes seem to align with mine are another source of new material.

As for whether I read work in its early phases or not, if it's an author whose work I've read before and enjoyed, I'll read their stories pretty much from chapter 1. I tend to request alerts to authors along with stories if I find an author to be good and this tends to be a pretty reliable way to get new stuff.

If it's a story I'm picking up cold (however I happened upon it), I read in detail the first paragraph and then skim the first couple chapters to get a sense of whether it's worth the investment. If it is, I go back and reread carefully and get into it for real (unless it's a dimension/time travel story, in which case chapter 1 is almost always a throwaway prologue that can be safely ignored).
