I'm generally looking for a story to have at least 10k words, and a good ratio of words-to-chapter (1,000 words per chapter at minimum). There are certain red flags that will make me drop a story faster than Lucius Malfoy would drop a muggleborn off a cliff, such as poor grammar and spelling, poor writing in general, obvious OOC behavior or blatant lore-breaking.
