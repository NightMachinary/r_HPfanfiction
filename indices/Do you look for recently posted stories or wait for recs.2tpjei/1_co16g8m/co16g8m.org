I have these two links bookmarked, and check them around once per day:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&len=100][Stories with at least 100,000 words, sorted by update date]]

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&lan=1&r=10&len=40&s=2][Complete stories with at least 40,000 words, sorted by update date]]

This is after I've already looked through the most-favorited and most-reviewed stories on FFN, the most-kudoed stories on AO3, and some of the TV Tropes recommendations. (I have similar bookmarks set up for /Naruto,/ as well.) I don't look at the first chapter of /every/ story I find in this fashion, of course--I check the summary and the counts of reviews and favorites before deciding to click on it.

If the summary and favorite/review count look promising (in terms of /both/ story /and/ English), I'll usually glance at at least the first page. It's fairly rare that I continue to read after the first chapter if it doesn't interest me.
