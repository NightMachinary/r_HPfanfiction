This is awesome. Can you make an extension for other browsers? Safari would be great!

Some ideas for features to add:

- filter out stories based on matched "keywords". E.g "mpreg"
- filter out certain pairings. e.g. "Harry/Voldemort"
- for ao3 filter out stories with more than n number of tags, crossovers etc.
- Filter out genres. On FF.net you can remove 1, but I would really like to be able to filter out Romance/Hurt/Comfort/Family
