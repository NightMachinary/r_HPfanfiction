I think the angstiest canon Harry was in OotP and he was quite alone. The only people who stood by him were Ron, Hermione and Sirius. And even then, he was snappy and upset but he wasn't like that all the time. He alternated towards his friends between likable Harry and shitty Harry (and Hermione always made a point to call him out when he was being unfairly shitty).
