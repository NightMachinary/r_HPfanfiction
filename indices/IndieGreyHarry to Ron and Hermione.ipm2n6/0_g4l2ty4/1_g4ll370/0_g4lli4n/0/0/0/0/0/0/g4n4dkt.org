Probably that would not work in real life and if you know of any good story that presents Voldemort's rule through someone else's eyes than Harry, I would happily take your advise because Voldemort-centric canon-compliant fics are so rare. However in Book 7 it is quite clear that Voldemort's rule is based on terror and fear. Lupin says that even if people might suspect it's him pulling the strings, they are afraid to talk among themselves because they don't know who is or isn't a Death Eater. Furthermore, maybe at first he might have been using carrots, Voldemort rules even over the Death Eaters through fear. Treats the Malfoys and Bellatrix like shit, treats Wormtail like shit (despite him being the one who helped him regain his body), tortures anyone that summons him because of Harry Potter. I always thought that despite his ideologies being closer to the Nazis, his style of rule is closer to Stalin's.
