That's a fair point but Umbridge does nothing more than offer a sham trial to those that the Death Eaters round up. Most Death Eaters would likely do the same. If anything, I would say Runcorn is even worse because he is in charge of reviewing backgrounds. He also holds this power over the heads of those with a dubious origin because he can easily falsify information for witches and wizards that are not from the sacred twenty-eight to make them appear as Muggle-borns.
