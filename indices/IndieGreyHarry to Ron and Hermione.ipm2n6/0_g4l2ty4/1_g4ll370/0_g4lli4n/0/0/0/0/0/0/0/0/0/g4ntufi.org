Because of the scale of her "work". Umbridge was chairwoman and chief judge of Voldemort's deportation scheme which is clearly inspired by Nazi Germany, the Carrows were a pair of sick bastards, which is deplorable but sadly not uncommon.

If you go by crimes we see, Draco Malfoy probably earns the number 2 spot with a long list of war crimes no other Death Eater committed because they were pretty open about their loyalty and membership. Although the very existence of a werewolf probably violates several treaties as well.
