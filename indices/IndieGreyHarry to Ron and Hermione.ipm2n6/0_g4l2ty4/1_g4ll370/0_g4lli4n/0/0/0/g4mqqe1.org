Because you are mixing two things up. Systematic campaigns which are basically copied from the history of the Third Reich with Jews crossed out with crayon and Muggleborn written over it are undeniably evil and I do not think that anyone would argue the opposite.

The scars are certainly not worse than the magical Reichssippenamt, but at that point the veil has been lifted and such measures are what is to be expected by the government of the big bad. But Umbridge in book 5 is a different beast, she is a member of the legitimate, supposedly good government who swoops down to the level of the big bad (remember, she ordered a political assassination of a teenager, tortured him with the blood quills and then tried to crucio him) for the sake of power. Also, keep in mind that it was not just a quick cut which left a scar but the result of thousands of times dragging something across a wound again and again. If you did that in prison or the army, do you have any idea how large the scandal would be?

And your edit with the ad-hominem guarantees a downvote.
