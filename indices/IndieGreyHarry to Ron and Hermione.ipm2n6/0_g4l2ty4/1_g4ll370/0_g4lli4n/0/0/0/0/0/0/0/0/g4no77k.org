We are free to imagine whatever we want because canonically there's no other information than whatever Harry receives. Of course people will go on with their lives if they are not affected by the changes, but my inclination is to believe that, since it's a fantasy story, the trope always goes that the Dark Lord rules through fear.

In any case, I'm not quite sure how this conversation is related to my initial comment. Umbridge is a shady and power-hungry politician who abuses her position both within Hogwards and the Ministry, but (and that comes from the book 7) the Carrows make her seem tame. Personally I wasn't as shaken by the Black Quill scene as by the thought that children as young as 11 were used for practicing dark arts. Harry himself is not that affected by it since he keeps getting himself in detention with her and never complains about it.

So I don't quite get it why the fandom always calls her the second most evil character after Voldemort. Pretty sure several Death Eaters are worse (I would think Fenrir is actually even worse than Voldemort although his evilness is sort of righteous), but they don't appear as much.
