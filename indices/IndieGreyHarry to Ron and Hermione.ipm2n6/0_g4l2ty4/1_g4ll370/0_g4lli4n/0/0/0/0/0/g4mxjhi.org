Caning was a one off punishment (in most cases), Umbridge was ripping open the same wound again and again.

The campaign against purebloods was fairly limited to those who stood out opposing the regime. Neville was in the DoM and leading the Hogwarts resistance. Luna likewise had fought openly in the DoM and her father ran a regime critical newspaper. What do you expect Voldemort to do, give them an Order of Merlin?

But overall Voldemort did not treat purebloods badly, else they would not be his power base. And in the Ministry, certainly a lot of people collaborated rather than carry out sabotage and boycott work. And, as can be seen throughout history, fear alone does not pacify a land. So it could not only be the stick, there had to be enough carrots or status quo for Voldemort to take over so completely within days.
