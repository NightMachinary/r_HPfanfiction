Lupin is hardly an unbiased source though. There is not a single character which actually represents those who are more annoyed by the whole thing than really threatened, those who think that the shops closing was the worst part of the whole mess. Or at least no character which was more than an offhand mention.

And people being afraid to talk openly amongst each other, that's fairly normal in authoritarian countries. East Germany was particularly notorious for using civilian informants, yet there were/are plenty of people who didn't consider it more than a minor inconvenience. There's a reason why the successor party of the former Socialist Single party has consistently disturbingly good results in the East here. A good chunk of the population learned to live under the iron fist and had good lifes because they accepted reality and felt no need to put a toe across the line. Of course, that's not the entire population, but Voldemort was pursuing a rather final solution for that part of the population anyway.
