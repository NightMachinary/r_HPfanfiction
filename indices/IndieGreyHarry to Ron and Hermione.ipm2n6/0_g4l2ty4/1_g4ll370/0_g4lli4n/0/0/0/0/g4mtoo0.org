Molly spoke proudly of the scars Arthur still had from the time when the back then caretaker caught them on a night stroll. Physically punishing children was a common thing in the educational institutions up until mid-twentieth century (and the wizarding world appears to be stuck in the seventeenth-eighteenth century) and so were state sanctioned tortures and punishments (a high ranking official could easily have someone below them maimed or killed by simply giving an order). So I never found the Black Quill punishment as big of a deal as people on reddit make it sound. I'd gladly take that over being practice target for the Cruciatus Curse, considering the world we're talking about. Also you are referring to a government as good when they kept a prison like Azkaban guarded by wraiths who sucked out the happiness and hope out of people. That's quite close to the biblical definition of hell.

Furthermore the punishments inflicted by the Death Eaters were applicable to purebloods as well (Longbottom was just as much of a victim).
