Being angry about all of those is fair, but being shitty because of those towards the only people who still stand by you is not. Also I never quite understood why people make such a big deal out of carved lines in Harry's hand yet no one complains that the Carrows were punishing 11 year olds with the Cruciatus Curse... maybe because the story is not written from those poor kids' perspective. Also what about the first year Muggle-borns collected from the Hogwarts Express and sent to Azkaban? Why are you not crying about those yet your are crying about some stupid flesh wound.

Edit: whoever downvoted this is probably a cruel child abuser
