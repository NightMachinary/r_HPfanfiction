Honestly the Flamels were the ones I wanted to know more about the most. I mean they're over 600 years old and you'd think would be insanely talented or knowledgeable about magic and the magical world. I want to hear their opinion on everything the ministry was doing and wished they had a few interactions with them, Harry and Dumbledore. I mean Dumbledore was an apprentice to Nicholas Flamel so I want to read about him talking to and treating Albus like a student. Maybe call him "my boy" a few times or do some eye twinkle, or just witness the master/apprentice relationship between them.
