When it comes to pairings, literally any character except Hermione, Ginny, Fleur, Daphne and Tonks. And in the case of slash, Snape (wtf?!), Tom and Draco.

In a more general sense, Grindelwald, Seamus, Dean, and self-inserts. The fandom is pretty low on the last one. Which is weird, probably everyone here wishes they could end up in the Potterverse.
