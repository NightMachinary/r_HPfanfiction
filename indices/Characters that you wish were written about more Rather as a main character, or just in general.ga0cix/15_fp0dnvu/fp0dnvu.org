Charlie Weasley! There is a sentence in GoF that has piqued my interest beyond belief.

"Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava."

We only see Charlie in this book but there is so much potential behind his character. Was he into magical creatures as a kid? What was his experience in Care of Magical Creatures like? Tell us about his Quidditch exploits and his path to becoming captain. Tell us about his friends. Did he and Tonks know each other at school? How well? What was the moment he decided to work on a dragon reserve? How did that conversation/moment happen with Molly and Arthur? What was his relationship with the rest of the brothers? How did he find out Fred had died? How did he deal with his grief? Did he make it to the weddings of Ron, Ginny, George, and Percy? "Did he ever have a girlfriend/boyfriend that he considered marrying?

There are so many directions that this could be taken given we know so little about him.
