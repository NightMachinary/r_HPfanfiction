Love Slughorn. He's such a interesting character. Definitely one that loves people who are talented in one thing or another, which can come off as rude and condescending to those who aren't talented in anything specific, but he was imo anyway, one of the better (good) Slytherin's that we saw, if that makes sense. On the light side, but definitely has his own agenda to certain things.
