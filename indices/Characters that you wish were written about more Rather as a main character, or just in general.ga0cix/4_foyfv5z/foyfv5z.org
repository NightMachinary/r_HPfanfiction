Nymphadora Tonks

Here you have a witch who has a very unique magical ability, equalling an unending supply of Polyjuice Potion, and she just ends up being an uterus for Remus Lupin in canon. What a waste of an interesting character. Especially the trainwreck that is HBP.

I'm not just talking of the Harry/Tonks pairing; a mentor Tonks, or big sister Tonks can also make really good stories.
