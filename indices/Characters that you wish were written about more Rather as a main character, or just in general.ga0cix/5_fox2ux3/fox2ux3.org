I don't see much of Moody often, and he's got potential to be explored more given his history of hunting dark wizards. Like even how he got all scarred up post-First War. In the Wizengamot trials we see Moody with both eyes and Harry notes that his face is less scarred aside from Rosier blasting a part of his nose away.
