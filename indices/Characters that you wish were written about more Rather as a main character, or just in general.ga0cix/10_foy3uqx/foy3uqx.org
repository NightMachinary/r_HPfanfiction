For me, two characters that had a lot of potential in canon and that got reduced down to their relationship with whoever they ended up with are Fleur and Tonks - and fanfiction generally doesn't do them justice.

For instance, Fleur is a triwizard champion, one of the most accomplished French witches (or, if we use the bad canon approach, Western Continental European - since Beauxbatons also includes Spain, Portugal, Italy, etc) , a part-Veela, /and/ not from Britain - all of which could make her a fascinating character. Instead, canon barely uses her (and badly), and fanfiction often reduces her down to a walking pair of sneering boobs that are misunderstood until super special Harry can pierce through that allure. It's just having her as a prize, when there's a lot more potential to it all.

For Tonks, canon first presents her as obviously competent (being an auror that young is no small feet), funny, lively, and with a metamorphagus ability - which is a pretty unique combination. However, canon then proceeds to define her almost entirely (in my view, at least) with her pining for Lupin (which is hurt for me because I'm not very convinced/don't particularly like that relationship) and subsequent death. She's not that big a fanfiction character - though again, like Fleur, she's often defined just by being a designated partner for Harry that has a special ability that he's the only one that's able to look past and make her instantly melt - which is not a satisfying way to do a relationship ><
