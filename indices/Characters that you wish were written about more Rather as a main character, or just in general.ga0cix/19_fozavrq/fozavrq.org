Good Dumbledore... It's just irks me that he is one of most bashed characters in fanfiction, true in Canon he is weird but so much potential, and people in fanfic make him so bad it's not funny expecialy considering how old he is. I always take him as advisor, well meaned, excentric and importantly human that can make mistake
