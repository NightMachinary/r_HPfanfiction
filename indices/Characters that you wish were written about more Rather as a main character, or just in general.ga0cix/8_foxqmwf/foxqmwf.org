Newt Scamander and Alastor Moody.

Honestly, how is it that Newt isn't involved in fighting Voldemort? He's old, sure. But he is far younger than Dumbledore, and magical people age slower or something. He lives in England, is a close associate of Dumbledore and a brilliant wizard.

And Moody. His death was dissatisfying as fuck. The guy was badass extraordinaire, yet he was killed because we can't have many possible helpful adults alive to steal the limelight from the Golden Trio, can we?
