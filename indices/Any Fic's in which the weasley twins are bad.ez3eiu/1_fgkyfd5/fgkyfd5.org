There's The Real Us by Seel'vor (I think that's the spelling), which bashes all the Weasleys but actually makes Dumbledore and Snape completely good and onboard with Harry and Hermione. I'm not linking it though, because the entire story starting at first year has questionably explicit scene between minors.
