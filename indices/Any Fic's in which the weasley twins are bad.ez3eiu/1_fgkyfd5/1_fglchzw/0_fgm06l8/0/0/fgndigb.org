That's the main reason I didn't post it. I also don't care, although I think there's a lot of people who overreact to it. There is a way to do it tastefully, or at least in a way that isn't pornographic/smutty, like in a coming of age story, which I don't think anyone should be upset about. Then there's actual smut written about children, which I can understand people being upset over, but since there's no real people involved I don't care if people read or write about that.
