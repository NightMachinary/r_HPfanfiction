I know what you when. It's the reason why I put off reading this Fanfiction called half-blood romantic. I knew it was a good story but it was going to be kinda upsetting to read. I have now and I can say it was both.

It's not a love-hate story tho. It's more of a story about unreciprocated love, but I'll still link it in case you want to read it.
