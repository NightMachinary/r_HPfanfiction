Yes! My absolute favorites are the character studies that really focus on the internal life of the characters. I love seeing them grow over time, and the character arcs are my absolute favorite parts of stories.

A story that like that for me is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23465653][the miseducation of hermione granger]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/MaidenMotherCrone/pseuds/MaidenMotherCrone][MaidenMotherCrone]] ( linkao3(23465653) ). The character development was just wondrous to watch.
