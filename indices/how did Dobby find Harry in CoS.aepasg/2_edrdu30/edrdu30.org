On the last point; he probably could have done that from a canon perspective but Voldemort is unlikely to consider using a lowly house elf for anything.

I did recently read an interesting fic where it was a small plot line that Dobby used to be a Potter elf but could not bind with Harry because he was too young. With the elder Potters dead the remaining elves went crazy and died and only Dobby was eventually (barely) able to find a new family with the Malfoys. Because he used to be a Potter elf he was able to find Harry at Privet Drive in CoS and warm him. It was a small plot point, but it's a question that's not explored often and I found it noteworthy in this context.
