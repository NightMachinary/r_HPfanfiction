We don't really get any real details on it. My comment was pretty much pure speculation. I think, though, given that there presumably wasn't a loophole around the Curse on the Defense Against the Dark Arts position, at least not one that Dumbledore could find, that magic is itself sentient enough to not be fooled in such a way, and that as Dobby's actions would still be linked back to Voldemort, which the charm specifically protects against, then Dobby would also be stopped, no matter his own intentions.
