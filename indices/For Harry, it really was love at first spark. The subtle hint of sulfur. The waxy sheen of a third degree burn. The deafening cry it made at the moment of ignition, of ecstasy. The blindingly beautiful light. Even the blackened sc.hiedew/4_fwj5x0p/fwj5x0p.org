The crowd opened as Harry walked through the Hall to the Gryffindor table, people were already opening a spot for him, next to Ron and Hermione, the latter which was already casting flame freezing charms on their clothes and on their part of the table.

"Morning guys!" Harry saluted, his singed sleeves following the movement.

"Morning, Harry" his friends chorused, Ron trying to subtly drag his plate just a little away from his best mate.

Harry sat down, immediately going for the steaks and potatoes, he was about to eat, before grinning and turning to Hermione who had just cast the strongest antiflame charm she knew on her hair.

"Hey, Hermione, I perfected a new spell today," he said, not noticing the people right across him pulling their wands, ready to cast shields, or the people on his other side pushing away, even if half the table was now looking at him, say what you will about Harry, but when he talked that way about a spell it was always impressive, and more often than not, dangerous.

"Really, Harry? You could show us near the lake later."

"Nah, I can show it now," before she could object(but not before Fred could cast Protego Igni) Harry took a deep breath and blew over his plate, an orange-red flame leaving his lips and turning a medium-rare steak into an overcooked one, and the potatoes into a golden/brown color.

Around him, the student's reactions where varied.

"Bloody Hell!"

"He can do it without a wand, now!?"

"Bollocks!"

"This can't be legal."

When he finished, he turned to Hermione whose mouth was open, and Ron who had forgotten about his food.

"Blimey, Harry! You can breathe fire like a dragon? You must show that to Charlie," he thought for a second "Better not to show Mum, I reckon."

No one noticed Draco Malfoy paling considerably, or Snape, who was both delighted over having a new excuse to accuse Potter of messing with his potions and concerned of riling the boy enough he would end up exploding the classroom.

Albus Dumbledore was shaking his head, who knew Fawkes' tears would have such an effect on the boy, his familiar was certainly proud, the bastard.

But the truth was that after Second Year, Harry loved fire, he got extremely good at all kinds of Fire Spells, so good he could hold a flame in his hand without a wand, and throw small fireballs, his relatives certainly left him alone since he proved that trick didn't get a letter.

Harry understood fire now, he felt he was the fire. Almost all his failed spells put things on fire, his flame charms were strong enough Flitwick had Aguamenti taught to his class two years early.

By the beginning of this year, his fourth, Harry could cast Confrigo silently, and his flame whip could burn through wood like butter.

-------

A few weeks later, Harry met someone who seemed to love fire as much as he did.

The first thing he noticed was the smell, like a burning holly log, and ashes, the second thing was the grace, like a dancing flame. Others felt drawn for other reasons, and while he certainly noticed and liked those, it was the spark that drew him in.

He was thinking of an approach, when she came and asked for the Bouillabaisse, he quickly got it and when he turned to give it to her, their hands touched, and their eyes met.

Her eyes too were fire, blue fire to his green one, the most beautiful fire he had ever seen, it burned so well, the smell of burning holly wafted to his nose, while the burning rosewood's went into hers.

They both smiled at each other and didn't notice the purple flame that came out of the bowl, bathing their smiles in eerie, violet light.

Dumbledore and Maxine looked at each other and nodded somberly, both their eyes showing compassion for the other in their plight.

Hermione huffed goodnaturedly, Ginny deflated, and Ron just shrugged.

"Eh, no big loss, it smelled funny anyway."
