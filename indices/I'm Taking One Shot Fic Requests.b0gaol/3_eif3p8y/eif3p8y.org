A Harry/Katie Bell story set in HBP where he sneaks out to St Mungos to visit her, either as an established relationship (eg they got together after a Quidditch practice) or they get together during one of the visits.

The logistical side can be solved by Tonks (if her love life is nonexistent, she might as well help others) or the twins (bros being wingmen) since it'd take maybe twenty seconds in total to get Harry from Hogsmeade/the Shrieking Shack to St Mungos and back with sidelong apparation.
