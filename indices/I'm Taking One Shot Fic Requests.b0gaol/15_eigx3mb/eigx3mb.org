Ron is the BWL, and his mother is dead as a result.

EDIT: Actually, I'd rather everyone was a slightly more competent than their counterpart. Ron is a budding seer, Hermione actually independently researches/invents something, Harry obsessively gets stronger so he can face Voldemort and actually turns out to be a DADA prodigy, there is a reason Hagrid is one of Dumbledore's most trusted advisers, Dumbledore doesn't foolishly do loads of things for seemingly no reason, like the traps around the stone and leaving Harry alone at the Dursleys to be neglected, Voldemort has more of a reason to be feared, etc.
