I was a bit put off at first, too - not a fan of viewing Snape in a sympathetic light in the best of circumstances. There's a bit more to this one though; it's less about Snape turning evil, as you say, and more about exploring why even though he's a right bastard, he wasn't ever truly /evil/. The tension between Snape's capacity for both Light and Dark magic (as this fic defines them) is drawn out quite well and we get to explore his experiences with evil people and why he is drawn to them.
