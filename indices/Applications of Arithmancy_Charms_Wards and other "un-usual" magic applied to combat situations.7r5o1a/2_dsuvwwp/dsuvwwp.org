[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10765600/1/The-Past-and-Future-War][The Past and Future War]] by AlexDnD. I think. All I remember is the fact Bill does a lot of curse breaking.

Also...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11769405/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-Deathly-Hallows][Dudley Dursley and the Deathly Hallows]] by Grey Streaked Fur. The author somehow made Dudley more likable and he throws weaponized potion bottles. Neat fic overall.
