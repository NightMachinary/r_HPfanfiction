The Beast Within: linkffn(9527368)

One of the best Werewolf!Harry fics I've ever read, if only because it isn't a thinly veiled fetish-fic (unlike 99% of Werewolf!Harry stories), and consistently treats the lycanthropy as a /problem/ rather than turning into a superpower through wish-fulfillment. Harry's not in control unless he takes Wolfsbane, the transformation is painful, et cetera. It has a sequel that's been on hiatus since 2017, but there's a lot there already.

The fic prominently ships Harry/Ginny, so if you're one of those people who can't stand that ship, you are hereby warned.
