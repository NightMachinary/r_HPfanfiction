Outcasts alley is one of my all-time favorite creature harry fics, also has a lot of worldbuilding! Its sequel hasn't been updated in a long time, but still a good read.\\
Edit: just for clarification, he's not a vampire/werewolf himself, but he is a creature and other creatures including those mentioned do feature heavily. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5621051/1/Outcast-s-Alle1y]])
