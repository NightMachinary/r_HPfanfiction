It's hard to say, since there are a lot of changes that make it 'not Harry' in certain ways, but I don't know that they really harm immersion or anything. I guess I just don't really make that a divide in my mind, whether a given version 'is Harry' or not, when reading. I can't say I've ever picked up a story and said 'well, this Harry is too different, I need to imagine him/her as an OC instead of Harry'.
