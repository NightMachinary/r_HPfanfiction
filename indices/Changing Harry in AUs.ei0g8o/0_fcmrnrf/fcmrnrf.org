As long as Harry's a well-written character, and /something/ out of the world, mechanics, themes, &c is the same, then I could potentially enjoy something. That being said, a good rule of thumb is to keep one's fic!Harry within the bounds of extrapolations and interpolations of canon!Harry about particular highlighted aspects or points of divergence.
