A Harry born June 30th would have been developing for 35 weeks and a bit, assuming he was conceived on October 31st, 1979 (That just seems thematic). He might have some very minor issues from being born almost two weeks premature (July 31st is 39 weeks exactly, babies are not premature if born after 37 weeks), but from what I could find, about 99% of babies survive being born at 35 weeks and a bit. With Saint Mungo's and Muggle Hospitals being well up to scratch by 1980, Harry being born a month before his canon birthdate would not even be that big a problem.
