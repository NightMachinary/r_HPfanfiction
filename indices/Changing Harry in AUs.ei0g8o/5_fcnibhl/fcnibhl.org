For some reason, I have a hard time with fics where they drastically change Harry's looks. Fine with the occasional creature inheritance fic, but if it causes him to suddenly grow long hair I'm out. (I admit that I have no idea why I'm like this.)

That said, I'm far more into AUs that diverge at some point in the middle or towards the end of canon. Keep his formative years exactly the same, but if something huge is changed in like... fourth year? Gimme.
