For me any of these I consider it an OC and usually stop reading:

- *Different parents*
- *Different age* - I saw a story (WBWL trope) where his brother was literally Harry's age and Harry was older by few years. Like what the actual F!?
- *Different gender* - I've yet to see a compelling fem!harry story that is more than just to avoid slash when pairing up or at best a canon rehash with few "girly" lines thrown in.
- *Different name* - this I can live with if good enough reasons in the story. Except /Hadrian/ et al. bullshit name changes.
- *Squib Harry*
