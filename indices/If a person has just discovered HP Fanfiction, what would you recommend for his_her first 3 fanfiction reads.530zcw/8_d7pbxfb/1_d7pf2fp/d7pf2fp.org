I'm reading through A Marauder's Plan right now as well. Definitely has its lulls, and without spoiling you, there's a decision made by Sirius in the story that really annoys me (if you're pretty far along feel free to PM me if you would like to know what, I would love to vent to someone about it cuz it kinda drives me nuts). But overall I've enjoyed the story. I really like the Remus in the story, it's the first Manipulative!Dumbledore I don't hate, and I even like their Draco, which is odd for me.
