One of the more persuasive Dramione fics out there, so it's a good introduction into the ship. Writing quality is pretty high, too. It was my introduction fic into the fandom, and well, I'm still here after a year so.

I'm reading A Marauder's Plan right now, and it seems like a pretty good introduction fic, too. Features a Manipulative!Dumbledore without being too heavy on it (like those fics where Dumbledore is basically out to get Harry--don't get me wrong I love those fics, but I think they're pretty exaggerated and potentially off-putting for someone who is just breaking into fanfic), as well as Abused!Harry, though the abuse sticks to what we know for sure from canon. I think it's a good intro to the heavier stuff fanfiction has, though, because the someone actually does something about it, and tells us that leaving Harry with the Dursleys in canon was definitely wrong and morally unjustifiable.

In Care Of is a mentor!Snape fic, where Snape is forced to see for himself the kind of person Harry truly is. It keeps to the canon characterisation of Snape, so it's pretty persuasive. I think it's a good intro into the trope, along with the Abused!Harry trope. The abuse in this fic is more serious than what Harry experienced in A Marauder's Plan, but doesn't go too far beyond what remains in the realm of possibility from what we see in canon.

I'll stop here, but you'll probably notice most of these fics are some of the most popular ones on ffn.net. Personally, I think it's better to offer people what most people seem to like, and if they find a trope or pairing that is to their liking, they can go through ffn.net looking for more and pick out the ones that they'll be interested in. The slogging through series of fics and picking out the good from the bad is half the fun for me, tbh.
