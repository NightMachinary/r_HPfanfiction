Alexandra Quick 1,2, and 3

Or not, since those would actually probably be better off after they've read more traditional hp stuff, but do say to read those eventually.

For my real answer, something with time travel either backwards with purpose or nightmares of future past or maybe dependa est depending on what you think they would like. Something with a non gryffendor Harry but not an evil one, probably either on the way to greatness, or hp and the boy who lived, or hp and the prince of Slytherin, and lastly either something a bit crackish like seventh horcruz or lily and the art of being sysiphus or something heavily AU like the aforementioned sysiphus or the pure blood pretense, again depending on their personal tastes. This would give a mix of different types of fics.
