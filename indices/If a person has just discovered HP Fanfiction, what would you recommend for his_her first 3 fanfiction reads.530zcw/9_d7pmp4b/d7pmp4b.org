Hmm ... that's a neat question.

Upon spending some time looking through the stuff I have in my history and discarding stuff that is good but not complete nor seeming to near it (because, you know, introductory stuff probably shouldn't be a WiP thing), and the same with crossovers because those might be a tad too different for someone just starting, I think I will go with this:

1. “the family evans” (linkao3(3073562)), also known as that story where Petunia is not horrible.

2. “Cauterize” (linkffn(4152700)), what with it serving as a nice epilogue-esque thing for those who didn't really like the original ending.

3. The “Harry the Hufflepuff” series (linkffn(6466185; 7330591; 10843543)), due to being light-hearted comedy stuff that does not rely on anything to be fun (whereas stuff like “A Black Comedy” and “Seventh Horcrux” might).
