That's humour/crack; Dark!Harry/AU and one shot/Post-Hogwarts respectively. Probably some of the best in their respective categories. Other people would recommend jbern, joe6991 and A Black Comedy, but for the life of me I can't enjoy them.

Also, once you've read around a bit, you should probably try out My Immortal, HPMOR and Harry Crow. Three very well known but ...not so great fics.
