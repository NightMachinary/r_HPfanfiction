People generally don't like HPMoR here, because though it can be entertaining for some and it's not /horribly/ written, there's a lot of lost potential there and if you don't turn a blind eye to it you can see that there's a lot of arrogance---in the form of “hahah, I am right, you are not”---too (which makes the lost potential taste more bitterly). That said, it's not really put on the same level as “My Immortal”, just in the same category, meaning that it's something that is a hit-or-miss for many.

I will admit willingly that I did enjoy it. But I've also read some of Yudkowsky's other works and I will also willingly admit that he could have done way better with HPMoR and yet he didn't.
