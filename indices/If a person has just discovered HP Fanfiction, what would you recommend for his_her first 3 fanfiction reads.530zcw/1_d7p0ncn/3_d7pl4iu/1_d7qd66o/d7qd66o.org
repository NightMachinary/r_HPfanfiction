I wouldn't say they're 'on the same level'. But they're both (in)famous and influential fics that don't contain particularly good writing. And no, HPMOR's not very popular around here.

Personally, I enjoyed (most of) HPMOR, but recognise it's not a very good fic. Cleverly plotted, yes, but there's no depth to the characters. And it has the annoying habit of smugly (and unoriginally) pointing out plotholes in canon while making sharp divergences from canon.

It's funny enough and fun enough that I finished it, but I felt like hitting my head against a hard surface multiple times.
