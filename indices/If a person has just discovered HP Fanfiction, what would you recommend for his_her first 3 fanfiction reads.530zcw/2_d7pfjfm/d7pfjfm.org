Maybe I'm just a sucker for the first things that got me into FF, but mine are as follows:

1) Start out with some Northumbrian work. I first got into FF wanting some after the war stories, so Tales of the Battle or Grave Days will work. My personal canon is a mix of Northumbrian's world, After the End, and my second recommendation:

2) Australia by MsBinns. Love the Ron and Hermione relationship that slowly develops. Anyone who thinks that relationship would have been an easy transition from friends to lovers is crazy.

3) A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles. Definitely memorializes Snape too much and gives him way too much credit and tries to dismiss his awful decisions as bad misunderstandings, but so many fans love Snape and so they would love this introduction to a heavy Snape fic.

4) Ok, I'm going to cheat and list some other options: The War Widow, The First Day, The Aurors, The Innocent series, are all great intros into fanfiction.

I also think once you are more advanced, then delve into Alexandra Quick, A Marauder's Plan, The Harder Struggle, and The Lie I've Lived.
