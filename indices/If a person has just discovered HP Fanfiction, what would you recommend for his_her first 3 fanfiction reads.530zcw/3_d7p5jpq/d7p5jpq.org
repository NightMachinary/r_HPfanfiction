A Black Comedy - linkffn(3401052) : unless you read it, you wouldn't know what you miss.

To Shape and Change - linkffn(6413108) : this one for those who wished Snape to live after 7th book.

Altered Destinies - linkffn(3155057) : this one is the first fiction I was fascinated by. So I guess some other readers out there who'll find this interesting too.
