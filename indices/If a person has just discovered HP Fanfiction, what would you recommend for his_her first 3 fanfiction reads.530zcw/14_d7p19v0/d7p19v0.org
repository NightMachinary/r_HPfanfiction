By turn, those are:

*The Lie I've Lived*

AU GoF, where Harry has James' memories. Harry/Fleur later. Very entertaining; features the best sorting hat personality I've ever read.

*On the Way to Greatness*

AU, Harry gets sorted into Slytherin. Best of all Slytherin!Harry fics. Very high quality.

*Resonance*

AU Sixth year, where Harry gets adopted by Snape, finishes school, enters auror training. This is among my all-time favorite series. I like Snape as a character; but I hate how he's portrayed in most fanfics. This has great Harry - Snape interactions. As well, in this Harry steadily grows more powerful, but instead of that solving his problems, it usually creates more. The power boost is well balanced by new enemies and hostile politics.
