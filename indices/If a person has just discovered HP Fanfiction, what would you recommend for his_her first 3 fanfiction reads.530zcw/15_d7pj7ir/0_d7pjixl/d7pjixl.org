I strongly suspect that you meant to reply to someone else given that OP doesn't mention Seventh Horcrux at all.

The top comment does, but it's referring to the the /other/ Seventh Horcrux. There's two:

The pre-DH one (which I've never read)

The one that [[/u/PM_ME_BABY_PANDAS]] is referring to which is a cracktastic fic written much later where Harry thinks he IS Lord Voldemort and sets out to reclaim his rightful place as the DADA professor.
