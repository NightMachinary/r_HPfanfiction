Definitely [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]], since it's short, poignant and proves the worth of fanfiction.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4036037/1/Two-Weeks-in-the-Alley][Two Weeks in the Alley]] is a bit longer but far less serious, and the author has a bucket-load more stories to get them rolling.

After those, I'd point them towards a larger work, but it would depend on what genre appealed to them more- action or romance or power fantasy or slice of life...
