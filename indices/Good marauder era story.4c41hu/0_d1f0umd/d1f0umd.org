I haven't read it, but my favorite tumblr user excepttheeyes swears by linkffn(The Life and Times by Jewels5) She says it's the only Marauders' Era fic she'll read because it has the best (most realistic) characterisation. excepttheeye's got the best gifsets for that time period and I imagine her face claims whenever I read those characters so I have faith in her taste. The fic is canon compliant
