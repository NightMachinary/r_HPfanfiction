It is important to note the orginal spell, the one which killed her mother was the infamous Oculis Videre Verum spell.

A spell which allowed witches and wizards to see the unseen. However the mortal mind was mostly unprepared to see the Truth of Everything.

Few survived the spell, fewer were not driven completely mad by seeing the unseen in its raw form. Luna was one of less than a hands worth in written history to have done both, her mother had not survived the experience.

Her newest spell was a much safer alternative than the old spell. It forced them to *see*, but they would *see* through the filters she had built over the years.

It would only drive less than a few dozen of the vilest of them mad. Only those who had twisted their souls in the most horrendous of ways would die from the experience. A few who had started down those paths would be driven to madness.

Overall it was worth it as they only had themselves to blame for performing such acts.

She fully expected Snape to die, so deep into the Dark as he was.

Dumbledore was guaranteed to pass, being so twisted into the light.

Neither of those events bothered her. Nor would they Harry once she explained it to them.

As the scream of horror started up she kissed her boyfriend on the cheek as they made their way into the rest of the castle.

She could see Edgecombe casting scouring charms on herself desperately as she cried in terror. A futile attempt in trying to cleanse herself from the twisted taint that had already begun taking hold of her.

It had always been there, now she, and everyone else who had been in the castle, could see it.

She could see the occasional wrackspurt approach Harry and would give him a kiss to chase it away. After pointing them out to him first that was.

Seeing the inner truth of others and the parasites that fed off their mental issues was hard for him to handle.

He warm soft hand in his with her gentle kisses helped him stay on solid ground.

By his third doubt and fourth wrackspurt sighting he cleared the doubts entirely away.

He never wanted such a creature infecting him again.

Luna smiled and hummed along as they strolled through the castle. Watching the vast majority of the castle loose their shit over coming face to face with themselves.

They found Hermione in the library staring at herself in horror as she saw herself infected with hundreds of small beasts each screaming at each other in debate on who was more knowledgeable and better than the others.

Luna had explained the Unspeakables would likely make their way her by then next morning to cast a school wide cleansing.

By then everyone would have faced their own issues enough to understand them enough for the cleansing to be mostly effective.
