[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): It's a major side plot and involves Draco Malfoy again. [[/spoiler][Basically, Bellatrix agreed to remove Draco from the war in exchange for information from her sister Narcissa. She bought Number 2 Privet Drive, forced Draco to live there (through some dark magic), take lawn mowing lesson from Vernon Dursley, and earn his lunch money by mowing lawns in the neighborhood.]] True to his Slytherin side, he has performed rather well.
