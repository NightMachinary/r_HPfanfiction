  Although I am kinda confused why the fic is rated T when it claims to be "Dark, violent" and is titled Rage to boot heh.

In my experience, most M rated fics on FFN are assumed to be smut. The author probably decided that they didn't want to pigeonholed into that category. M rated fics also don't show up unless you specify you want to see them, so you gain less publicity.
