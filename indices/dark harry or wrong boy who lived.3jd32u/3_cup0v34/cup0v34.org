Well I assume you probably have read this already, but in case you haven't there is linkffn(The Other Boy Who Lived).

Some quick details, Neville is the boy who lived. I felt that it has some great action and was a great read. Harry is not dark though you can argue that he plays with that line as the story progresses. There is a very distinct shift in tone from Act 1 at Hogwarts and Act 2 when they are out of school. It is my favorite Other Boy Who Lived story
