Have you read linkffn(harry potter and the prince of slytherin)? It was recommended in a thread the other day and I couldn't put it down. It updates quite frequently which is nice and the writing is pretty good! It features wrong boy who lived and slytherin!harry who is quite darker than in canon. He's not crazy dark though. And there is no slash (though right now it's only in second year).
