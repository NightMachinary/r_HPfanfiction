I am a stalwart proponent of Lightning on the Wave's Sacrifices Arc, which starts with linkffn(Saving Connor). Harry isn't super "dark," but wrong-boy-who-lived is certainly in play. The slash doesn't really start until the 4th/5th book of the 7, and the author is usually extremely good at identifying the subsections of their chapters that contain slash (as well as certain triggers).

Also, it's a long read, if that makes a difference one way or another to you. Edit: After adding it all up, the Arc ends up being just over 3 million words.
