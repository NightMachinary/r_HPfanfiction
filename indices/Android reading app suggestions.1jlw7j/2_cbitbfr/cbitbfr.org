I use [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.webreader][Fanfiction Reader]] (I got the paid version personally) because it lets me have a "true black" background for reading at night. It also let's you search by author or story, or browse without using your browser.

One that is almost as good is [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anompom.fanfictionreader][FanFiction Reader Lite]] which nicely will launch fanfiction.net links right into the reader and give you the option to download.
