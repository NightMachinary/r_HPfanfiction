Well if you do read it I personally found it only worth reading up until the HP arc ends. I mean the Avengers arc is good, but the story hasn't been updated in a long time, and it drags like a Motherfucker. It's good but way too long, and the ending if the HP arc is a satisfying enough ending for me.
