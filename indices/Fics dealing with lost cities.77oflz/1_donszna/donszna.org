linkffn(9993319) is a bit of an unusual fic, and you or may not like it, but it involves a lot of travelling to different places/times and exploring them (e.g. poking through pyramids for treasure). It's /sort of/ a main focus of the fic, but I can't remember how indepth it's covered beyond the first few fairly good exploration scenes.
