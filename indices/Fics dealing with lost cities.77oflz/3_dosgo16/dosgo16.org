[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5609522/1/Atlantis-An-Adventure]] - Warning, Hermione/Voldemort. I liked it, but I prefer her other fics, where Hermione is a bit older. This one is an interesting adventure, but the relationship part is definitely a big part of it and I prefer the way the author wrote about them in other fics (Shared Flame is my favorite, but no lost cities)
