The general feedback I've been getting from the comments is that I'll probably have a more satisfying experience if I just leave it at Changeling and don't read the sequels. I didn't actually know it had sequels until I posted my review here, but I think I might move on to other fics rather than stay in this universe. Thanks for your comments :)
