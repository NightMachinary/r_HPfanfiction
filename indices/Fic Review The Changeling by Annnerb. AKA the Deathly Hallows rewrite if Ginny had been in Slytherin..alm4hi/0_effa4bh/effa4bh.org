That's an excellent, detailed review. And I don't disagree with any of it.

I didn't find it as compelling as you did mainly because of the point you described as possibly the overall biggest weakness of the story: "Ginny's lack of connection with anyone at all." For me it led to a story that, while enjoyable, didn't have me champing at the bit to find out what happened next.

Definitely one of the better stories out there though.
