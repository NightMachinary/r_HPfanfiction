No suggestions, but I did just want to voice that I love that you asked. I never thought to, but as a Psych student, I'm happily bookmarking the crap out of these stories and am excited for free time (AKA, after the holidays) to read them. Because honestly, Harry could use the psychological help. Dumbledore, Snape, Ginny, and Tom Riddle too. Heck, even everyone else after the Battle of the Hogwarts.
