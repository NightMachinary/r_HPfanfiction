I know it isn't actually about any of the main characters from Harry Potter, but this is about Draco working in St Mungo's as a drug rehabilitator and Harry has to go work with him. They work with other people and their experiences of drugs, also Draco's past use of a drugs a little bit. I know my summary won't do it justice.

It's an amazing read with an equally amazing sequel called Foundations. [[http://heckyeahdrarry.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/reparations-and-foundations.html][Reparations and Foundations]]
