Just discovered this subreddit, awesome! But maybe [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=127417&chapter=1&textsize=1][Saving Harry]] is something you're looking for? I haven't read that in a while, but it was definitely well written. I just can't recall off the top of my head if there were sessions like that, but I want to say there were.
