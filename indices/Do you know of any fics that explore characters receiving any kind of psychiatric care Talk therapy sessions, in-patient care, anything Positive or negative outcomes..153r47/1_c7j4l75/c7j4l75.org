The [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2529586/1/Broken-Mind-Fractured-Soul][Broken Mind, Fractured Soul]] series has Harry suffering a magical personality split due to severe childhood abuse. HPDM, Mentor!Snape and slash after a while, really long and very fantastical portrayal of dissasociative identity disorder, on the whole I think it's worth a read. There's like four stories in the series but the last one is just a one-shot.
