This is the first one that comes to mind [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5577953/1/Existence][Existence]] by children of the shadows, it's a HP slash fiction. Darker then the writers usual stuff by a long way. She has a lovely story called dating remus lupin which was the first ever slash story I read. It's really lovely.

I'll think about it for a while. I'm sure there's other ones.

I do think there's a very dark one with Hermione in it actually, eh called, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5603291/1/][hearts keeper]] it's very dark btw... not my fav fic for that reason.

dumbledore give sessions to one of the characters from [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/140916/Leila-B][Leila Bs]] stories. Despite the fact that all her stories involve OCs and English isn't her first language her whole again series is pretty good.

If I think of more i'll let you know :)
