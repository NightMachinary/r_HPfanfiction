I'm going to recommend Mischief's Heir linkao3(4629198) and Ninja Wizard linkao3(10824855) both by mad_fairy. They both have fairly involved plots, which may not be what you want, but they both have lots and lots of scenes of kids just playing with magic. Harry wants to sail a boat on the Black Lake, so he looks up how to build a boat and then does it. He wants to mine asteroids so he makes little action figure people to go into space for him. There's a craft fair where all the kids make dollhouses/model houses of what their dream home would look like. And so on.

Don't worry about the crossovers, either. There's nothing in the Marvel fic you can't get from a basic understanding of Norse mythology (Loki=god of mischief, Odin=king of the gods). I've never seen Naruto and I had no trouble keeping up with that crossover.
