It's not all fun and games, but Harry does get a chance to be a kid in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7). I'm particularly fond of how he cheats at hide and seek, and brings Hermione to visit after school while letting Sirius think she's a muggle, so he races around hiding everything magical and stresses about having to wipe her memory after she sees a dropped wand.
