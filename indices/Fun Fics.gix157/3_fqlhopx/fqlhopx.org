Only things I've seen like this is the fanfiction 'Make a wish'

and two webtoon stories that fit the EXACT criteria and feeling of what you are asking for:

Hooky

and

The Steam Dragon Express

They both happen in a magical world that is different but also has parallels with Harry Potter, but not enough to make it exact, and different enough to make it extremely interesting.

Just like the HP series, they both start off obliviously happy, but end up caught in the middle of a war, and also value freindship and love in the middle of the war, but they are still really different and unique, so it's not a copy - it actually feels more like a fanfiction AU.
