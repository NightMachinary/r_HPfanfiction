Hmm. Not sure if this fits your criteria, but there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][/Oh God Not Again/ by Sarah1281]], which basically has Harry Potter ending up accidentally going back in time, and deciding to do whatever he wants. His goals: beat Voldemort with fewer deaths this time around, have fun, and lose the house cup.

Another one I enjoyed by the same author is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/When-In-Doubt-Obliviate][/When in Doubt, Obliviate/]], in which Harry is taken and adopted by Gilderoy Lockhart(and ironically enough, more closely fits your criteria I think).
