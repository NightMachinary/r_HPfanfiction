That's exactly what happened in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942). They both end up in the Star Wars and are captured by the Empire. Harry has spent about 4 years here, and returns to the HPverse only 41 days later. There is also a sequel called [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), that crosses further with Star Gate. In typical Darth Marrs fashion, both fics are full of brilliant and ridiculous moments.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136): Not Harry, but Ginny jumped through the Veil a few years later after Sirius. They meet in Essos, and soon begin building an empire. Rhaegar Targaryen joins them later.
