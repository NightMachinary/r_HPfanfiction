Well, it's logical to explain of course. Either you have to use reincarnation or something similar to it, use a literal gate that is an open unknown ending from the books, misuse the time turner or invent your own magic. Compared to the gate, a spell or potion feels a bit contrived and rituals are tricky to write.

I don't really mind it. No need to make things difficult on that portion of it's not necessary for the story. The way I see it the gate is ideal for "accidental" time-travel or universe travel. For deliberate travel, I like something else being invented. It's not a trope that bashes or reduces a character or some such unbelievable things.

I've lost count on how many but "I'm Still Here" by Kathryn is probably the most well known one. A simple but nice crossover I like is Sorcery, linkffn(10054816), an unfinished HP & Frozen crossover. It's simple, but everything works so far. It's a real shame there aren't more (good) crossovers, because, well, it's obvious magic as a playground.
