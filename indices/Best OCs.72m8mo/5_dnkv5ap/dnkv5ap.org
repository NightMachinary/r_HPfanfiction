I haven't honestly seen that many, but Sonny from White Squirrel's /Arithmancer/ comes to mind. A very likable Hogwarts Elf that allows one to see what a non-dysfunctional house-elf can be like, when all the three that get much attention in canon (Dobby, Winky and Kreacher) were abused wrecks. The sheer fact I remembered her is evidence enough, I think. linkffn(Core Threads) has some nice OCs as well as secondary characters --- a goblin manager who's not Griphook (!), Harry's personified emotions, the muggle criminal lady.
