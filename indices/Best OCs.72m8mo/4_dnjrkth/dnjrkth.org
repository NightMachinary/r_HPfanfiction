Meciel. She's this nigh-on powerful being that can't actually do that much with her power, and is cursed to an existence where she can only affect the living world through a possessed host, willingly or not. She's not human, never has been, yet somehow comes off as one of the most relatable characters in the story, like a mother who has an out-of-control petulant child. She's used as the voice of reason, while also being an important crutch, all while being a witty sidekick with a constant stream of humorous (and often dark) anecdotes.
