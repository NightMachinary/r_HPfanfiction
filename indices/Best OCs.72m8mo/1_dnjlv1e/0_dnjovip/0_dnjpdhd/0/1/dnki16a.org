I was at that phase for a hell of a long time, and I must recommend that you at least get the story started. I changed a lot of things I thought I wanted when I was a chapter and a half in, and I wasted a good amount of time and effort for something that I feel is a better result. I mean, you do you, but sometimes it's harder to start something than it is to continue or finish.
