the thing is that the project I am planning will span across 7 seperate school years, and I still need the main plot lines to be entirely established. i already know the endings of the last 3 books and pivotal points towards character development across several books.

the first book is almost complete however in the plot department, and I have already written the first two chapters, I am just holding off from publishing until I have the main plot lines clear
