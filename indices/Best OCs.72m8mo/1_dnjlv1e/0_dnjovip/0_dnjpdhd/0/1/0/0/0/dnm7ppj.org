Already in first, second and third year, a lot of important things shall happen, and if I would put them in flashbacks, that would feel cheap, and by using your last suggestion, I fear that not enough sympathy and empathy would be created.

Apart from that, I am planning on introducing more types of magic which simply have never been covered in the HP books.

As much as I appreciate your suggestions and concerns, I have actively tried to avoid that mantra.

Oh, important sidenote to mention, my story starts 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and follows an OC in his 7 years at Hogwarts. /And the plotline of Cursed Child takes place in an Alternate Universe, I've always hated Time Travel/.
