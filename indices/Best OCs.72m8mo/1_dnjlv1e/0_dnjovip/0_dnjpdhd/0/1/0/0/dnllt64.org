It is likely that you will struggle to both get readership and maintain your own interest in such a long-term project. Maybe you could consider starting in a later year? Then introducing background concepts via flashback or when the MC takes a new character into their confidence?

I can't remember how many stories repeat a tired mantra: "follows canon early, but major divergences happen at the end of year 3/beginning of year 4." 75% of these fics do not make it to year 5. 95% do not make it to year 6. Avoiding that pitfall is much better than going for seven years. Numerous fics handle this issue in effective ways. Take a look at the writings of inwardtranscience - one is so dissimilar to canon that going back over early years is still interesting, one starts in book 4 and totally changes history, excusing it by suggesting that Harry was ignorant of his surroundings. Another method can be found in The Changeling, where the MC is Ginny, whose perspective is different enough to maintain engagement, yet also tells much of the early years very quickly - very little quoted dialogue, very brief overview of scenes, responses, and attitudes, etc. while still managing to effectively explain things through the context and lens of the story's purpose and goal.
