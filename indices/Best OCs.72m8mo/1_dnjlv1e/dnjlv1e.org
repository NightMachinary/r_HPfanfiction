Calypso Rosier was one of the best I've ever seen.

Why? She is interesting. On first glance, she has a friendship with Harry, and later even relationship, but is part of, or at least influenced by the side that works directly against Harry and his family. When we get to know her better, we see that she has nuance; depth. She has flaws, strengths, agency. We can always trace back a decision made by her to some sort of reasoning of her own. A lot of OCs have the problem that the writers base their decisions around the protagonist, making them hollow and uninteresting plot-tools. Calypso is a sidekick to Harry, but for her own reasons and emotions.
