Xanthir and Tara from Bloody Skies.

I'm not sure how you are on Slash, but if that's not a deal breaker ( it's not particularly explicit) then you def want to check this one out. The world building in insane, Harry gets renamed fairly early in the story for protection purposes and we get to explore this VERY expanded universe. The story is chock full of OC's that all do very well, but as Harry's main side-kicks, those two are funny, interesting, and have there own story lines.
