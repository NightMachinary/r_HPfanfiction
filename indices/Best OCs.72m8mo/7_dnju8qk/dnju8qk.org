Hm. One of my favorites is Indigena Yaxley from the Sacrifices Arc. She can reasonably be called batshit insane, but she's still pretty interesting. She is a formidable dark witch, intelligent, ruthless and capable. And although she has no interest in Voldemort's war, she is personally obsessed with honor. So when it is revealed that her nephew once swore to serve Voldemort, but later abandoned his service, she feels obligated to serve in his stead, to redeem her family's "honor". And serve she does. She proves to be the deadliest of his Death Eaters, slaying enemies and resolving problems no other servant was capable of. She is shown to have prodigious skills with herbology and dark magic, breeding humongous stone-shattering, man-eating plants and generally wrecking all kinds of shit. Her motivation is completely alien to the reader, but I found her a fascinating character to read about.

Another is Per Hossa from Greengecko's R trilogy. He only appears for a couple of chapters, but he makes a strong impression. He is a shaman of the Laplanders, an indigenous population group in Finland's mountains. He is first contacted by Snape, when Harry faces problems with his magic; when experiencing dark emotions, Harry begins to unconsciously summon gateways to the Dark Plane, a dimensional underworld, filled with dark energies and demonic-looking ever-hungry creatures. Per is one of the few masters of the Dark Plane in the world and agrees to teach Harry when he learns of his trouble.

This character too is fascinating and well nuanced. He is a man of few words, but resolute and jaded. Although he is a master of old magics, he has rejected wandlore; as such, common magics like transfiguration and apparition seem like miracles to him. The story paints well and subtly the desperation of the Saami, as well as Per: their constant struggle against a hostile land and a way of life that is quickly growing obsolete. And Per, despite the things he is capable of, is restrained. When a child is kidnapped by a neighbouring village, he does not strike back with terrible creatures or ancient curses.

As he hears stories of Harry's past, he asks him:

/"How did you, with your dark wizard hunted life, your prophecy-weighted childhood, with your . . . Death Eater father . . . how did you preserve such purity of heart through all of it?"/

And I believe this is when he decides that he will teach Harry to master the Dark Plane. Because like Per, Harry is restrained; he hasn't fallen to dark magic, to killing indiscriminately, despite all the shit he's been through. And like Per, he won't summon a host of demons to solve his problems. (of course, as you'd expect, later in the story Harry DOES summon a host of demons to devour a group of Death Eaters, lol)
