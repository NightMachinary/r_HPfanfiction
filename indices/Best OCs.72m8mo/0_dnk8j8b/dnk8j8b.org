Jim Potter (from Prince of Slytherin).

I like WBWL pics. I just hate how the "favored Potter son" is some egotistical idiot who everyone loves, but Harry will always outshine because he never learns. Nah screw that.

Jim starts out as a the typical BWL spoiled douche. But he learns. Unlike like most other fics, he actually learns. The things he does have consequences, and he learns from them.

Something about that's a huge breath of fresh air for me.
