I really liked Lester Lichfield from linkffn(Sympathetic Properties) - I liked that he was an older character dealing with an awful past, but that he was still putting his full effort into his work. I also really enjoyed seeing a major protagonist in HP fanfic being an older character with real life problems instead of an OP child (as much fun as that can be).
