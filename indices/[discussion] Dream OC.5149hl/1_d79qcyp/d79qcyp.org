My dream OC is a muggleborn raised in an orphanage (parents are dead). He runs away from the orphanage and live on the strets begging, His life is pretty bad and his only scape from the bad enviroment are some old superhero comics that he finds on the trash. When his first accidental magic happens he doesn´t know it´s magic and he thinks it´s a superpower, he thinks he is a superhero (orphan + abilities). He learns that his "powers" appear mostly in dangerous situations so he starts putting himself in danger to do heroic things. His stunts are perceived by the ministry and when he is captured he realizes that he isn´t unique or a superhero and he hates it. He is send to live in a foster home of sorts for magical children and there he learns about the history of the wizard world, specially about the recent war against Voldemort and the savior, Harry Potter. He suddenly realizes that the Hero spot of this world is filled and that he was never meant to be a Hero, he decides then to become the worst villain that this world has ever seen. (This could be told as a background history or downright played as a fic from his POV). I was watching Unbreakable (the M.Night movie) and thought of this plot.

ps: This is my first post here in this subreddit and I hope my english is clear enough for you guys to understand it ^{^}

EDIT: Forgot to actually describe the character LOL. Anyway he would be a male, named Brian. Intelligent, smart, hard working but full of desire for power and to prove himself. His physical appearence is common, brown hair and eyes, normal height.
