I've always hoped to find a story with an OC who is muggle born and is willing to destroy magic in order to either protect his/her family or to retaliate against death eaters. I don't write fanfic but I love to imagine a story where the OC is researching why some people can do magic and some can't, figures it out and is tempted to use that knowledge as a weapon. This is roughly how it goes in my head; OC gets a Hogwarts letter at age 11 and doesn't want to go (for some reason, maybe not wanting to leave friends/family or because of some ambition in the muggle world) but finds out its not really optional. He or she gets through the Hogwarts years somewhat smoothly but somewhere along the way starts to develop radical views- that muggles should move to control magic and magical people/ creatures. She has an internal line in the sand where she will do nothing up to a point but once the line is crossed (by Voldemort and followers) she is all in on destroying the magical world. I'll never write it but I would love to read it. Also, as an aside, is OC other cannon or original character?
