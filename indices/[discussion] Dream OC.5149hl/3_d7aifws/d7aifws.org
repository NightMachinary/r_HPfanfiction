I've wanted to write about a girl who doesn't quite possess the gifts of her peers. She's the only child born to a pureblood family, but not one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. In the beginning, the parents are excited, wondering when her first accidental magic would surface, what her House would be, the subjects she likes, etc. But her magic never seems to manifest. As time passes, people go from mentioning that a late start can make a stronger witch to quit inquiring all together. You see them pull back from their family and friends.

They're overjoyed when the Hogwarts letter arrives, but their hopes are dashed when a wand never matches her or reacts in any way. Ollivander attempts to custom make a wand to her, but is unsuccessful. They send her to Hogwarts with her great-grandmother's wand. Despite her efforts, she can't seem to do any wanded magic or produce any sort of response from her wand. She has consultations with Madam Pomfrey and then St Mungo's, but no one knows the issue, cause, or cure. She struggles socially with her difference. If she's present when the Chamber is opened, that's another source of stress.

For her second year, Dumbledore pulls her from Charms, Transfiguration, and Defence and starts her early in the elective classes. From an educational standpoint, it's sensible, but it also highlights the difference between her and her classmates. She finds it hard to keep up with the older students in class and cannot seem to find her place or friends. She spends more time with professors, ghosts, books, and House-elves than students.

At some point, she begins to gain her feet. Finds out she has a small talent in Divination, finds workarounds to succeed despite her limitations in Herbology, Potions, etc. Her parents have another child and it soon shows signs off accidental magic. Her world seems to unravel and she feels lost again. The war is beginning and she fears her place in it as a not-quite-Squib.

That's as far as I've gotten. Garth Nix's Lirael started the idea off, but I definitely don't want her to become a powerful badass. Just an average girl who doesn't quite fit. Maybe an opportunity to explore other areas of magic
