Linkffn(Make a Wish by Rorschach's Blot) features Harry deciding to bugger off and enjoy the world for a while before he inevitably dies to the prophecy. Being Harry, it's a bit of an adventure anyway...

Linkffn(Contemplating Clouds) features Harry with some stronger support from Luna in fifth year, as they both get up and stop giving a damn about what anyone else thinks.
