Unatoned is an ingenious fanfic dealing with Harry and Daphne as main characters 4 years post-DH. It is not a romance and yet somehow it is. Harry works at the ministry and the fanfic shows how the corruption leads to Harry not caring anymore. Give it a read, in my opinion not often enough recommended.
