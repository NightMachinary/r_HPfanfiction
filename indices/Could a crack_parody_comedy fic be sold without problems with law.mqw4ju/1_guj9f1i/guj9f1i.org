Short answer is no to crack, yes to parody. Specifically if you wanted to write about Larry Spotter and the Glowing Red rock, that'd be fine. But everything it it must be original. So names, ideas, objects, etc. You can't use "The Sorcers Stone" but you can use "Glowing Red Rock" for example.

Basically you can write a book that calls to mind Harry Potter but isn't actually about Harry Potter, just folks will see the similarities.

That being said, if your book starts picking up steam, you could probably expect a cease and desist letter from WB and JK anyway, and then a lawsuit if you refuse. You might win, but it'll cost a lot if you go that route.

Not a lawyer and this isn't true legal advice obviously lol.
