On the other hand, sometimes tearing a concept apart can do you a lot of good. I remember one of my first ideas was a Harry/Luna soulbound story. I sank over 20k words into that idea before I realised that soulbonds, in 98% of the cases, are shit and the set-up is very forced.

I would have been very glad if I had a place where someone would have told me exactly how bad that concept was before wasting a month on it and another one on new iterations of the same.

Don't get me wrong, simply saying "Your idea sucks" won't do anyone any good. But a detailed reasoning why it sucks can be very welcome and helpful. Even those ranting reviews which try to tear your story apart can be useful. Take the time to look at every point they raise and either dismiss it as irrelevant or fix the issues addressed.
