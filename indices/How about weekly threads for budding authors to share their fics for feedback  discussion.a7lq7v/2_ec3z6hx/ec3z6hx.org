Not sure how willing a lot of the sub would be for this one, to be honest, simply because a lot of the time people will get downvoted a lot not for the fic's quality itself, but based on the fact that it includes a character or ship that the redditors on the sub don't personally like.

I feel like it'd just cause a lot of drama rather than actually getting people the thoughtful feedback they wanted.
