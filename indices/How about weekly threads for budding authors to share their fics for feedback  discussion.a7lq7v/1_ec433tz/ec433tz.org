There is a weekly fic showcase in [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]]. I don't know if anyone gets readers that way. While I like the idea in principle, I do feel this sub can be quite polarised. Certain sorts of fics would get a favourable response while others would get ripped apart but most would probably just be ignored. There are better places to look for feedback and critique.
