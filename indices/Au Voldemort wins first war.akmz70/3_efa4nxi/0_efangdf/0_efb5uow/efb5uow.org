Both Consuming Shadows and The Philosopher King have slash pairings, with the storylines slowly working their way towards HP/LV. There's no underage pairings, but the version of Harry in each story is very different from canon due to the different ways he was raised. I suppose you might want to skip them if the relationship is not to your liking, since it is a central part of those stories.
