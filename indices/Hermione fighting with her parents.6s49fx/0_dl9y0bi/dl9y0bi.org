She does quite a bit of both in canon. :P

In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk), her evolution as a witch clawing her way to the top of Slytherin's social ladder, and her misadventures along the way, are a constant source of conflict between her and her parents, but in some ways, it makes their family even stronger.

Other than that, I guess linkffn(Darkest Witch of Her Age by darkrose0510) fits the bill, to a rather extreme extent.
