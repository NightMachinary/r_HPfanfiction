There's the linkffn(Mudblood Mistress I & II by JoseHood) series, which is decent, though I don't remember exactly how she relates to her parents.

Honestly, most fics along these lines are pathetic Dramione 'ships, and there is a fandom-wide tendency to portray Hermione as a generally nicer and more moral person than she was in canon, so it's slim pickings.
