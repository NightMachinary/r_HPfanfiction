Again im not arguing that witches and wizards dont practice pagan things. But at the same time wizard and witches being Christian can make sense aswell especially since we know ghosts like the fat friar were Christian.

Especially since the wizarding world didnt isolate itself until 1689 so it IS highly probible that the Christianization of Europe effected them.
