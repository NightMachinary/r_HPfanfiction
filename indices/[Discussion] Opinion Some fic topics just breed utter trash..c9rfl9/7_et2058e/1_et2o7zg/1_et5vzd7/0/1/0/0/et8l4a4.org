Well, the first is a very weak argument. I own a Torah (along with a number of other religious texts) and I never even met a jew.

The second is still not definite proof. Both Albus and Harry are halfbloods. I'm pretty sure Lily, being muggleborn was a member of some church at some point, thus allowing her and the husband to be buried on church ground. The same can be said for Albus. As for the godfather bit it's not so much of a stretch to say that it's just something Lily wanted. Even if we exclude the fact that the custom is not something christians came up with.
