Well that might or might not be just an expression.

But even if it isn't, it is not, in my opinion, proof of them worshipping the christian god.I could be a member of the cult of Zac Efron and still use "my God". It's just that by "God" I would mean Zac Efron and not Jesus or whatever.

Edit:\\
Now, I'm not saying that they definitely did or didn't. But unless there is explicit mention of Jesus or other specific details, it seems pretty plausible to say they weren't overly influenced by them. Which in turn would make it perfectly plausible for them to have a more open view on homosexuality even tho they have other prejudices (blood).
