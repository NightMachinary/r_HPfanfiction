See my issue with JK Rowling trying to say Wizarding culture is more accepting of homosexual relations than the muggle one is the fact that the Wizard world is so ass backwards on things. You have a culture that looks and basically acts like a modernized version of victorian england and you are telling me that this culture that still see's things like blood purity as an important fact of life and generally doesn't understand electricity is more accepting of Homosexuals? Really?
