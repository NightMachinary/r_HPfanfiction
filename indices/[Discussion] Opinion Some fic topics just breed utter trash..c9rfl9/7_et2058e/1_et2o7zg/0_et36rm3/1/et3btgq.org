Finally someone else who agrees with me that wizards aren't retarded because they don't know how muggle stuff works considering even most of us don't understand exactly how it works seeing as they have no need for it because magic is superior to electricity. But yeah I feel like it would be a case of purebloods have their arranged marriages but it's accepted as long as its not too obvious that these people will have affairs. With magic being an equalizer it doesn't make sense to have a male dominated society.
