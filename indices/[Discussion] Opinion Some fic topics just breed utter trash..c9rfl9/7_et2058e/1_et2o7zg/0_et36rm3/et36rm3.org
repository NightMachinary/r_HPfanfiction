I think that considering the Wizarding World as the Victorian Era with some tweaks is wrong from the start.

The wizarding World , and more specificaly Magical Britainm is a separated country from England, with its own culture. Muggleborn entering Hogwarts can be compared to immigrants on that point.

So yeah, some elements of this culture does look like the Victorian Era, but it's just because of magic. Something like 150 years ago, Wizards took adopted some of the inventions brought by the Industrial Revolution, the difference with the muggle world is that the items from that time only needed some little enchantments to reach a productivity that still fit the wizards need, but they could also be repared by magic so their never had to be replaced.

Also, items like the Hogwarts Express are the only thing brought by the Revolution Era, most of the "cultural" aspect such as the courtship traditions are fanon things, not canon.

Concerning the ignorance of electricity,I know a lot of fanfics love to have their "Muggle studies" chapter where the teacher explain it, but is it canon? I guess I could see Arthur not knowing how electricity work but I don't remember if it appears in books. Anyways, even if wizards don't know electricity, it's because they don't need it. The same way they don't need oil or gaz for example. We have to remember they are wizards, with magic. They don't need electricity to create light, since they only need one candle to light their home forever (hell they could probably ignore it and just conjure ball of light). Arthur managed to make his car work for years without one drop of oil, not to mention his car could fit 8 peoples easily, turn invisible, fly and even work without a driver. Do you know precicely how the pile Volta worked? It's kinda the same for wizards, they know it exist, they know what it does even if they don't understand how, but they know their method are better so they don't really care.

Finally for the acceptance of homosexuality, it's once again because wizards are a separated society which is not linked to muggle one. I don't know (or care) why the homosexuals would be more accepted. To be 100% honest I would even say that the blood purist family should be oposed to homosexual marriage since it would mean no descendant and so a risk of extinction of their line (except if they have magical way to create mpreg I guess). But mariage apart, some societies (like Ancient greece) accepted some kind of homosexuality as long as the man did his duty and create a descendance, why not wizards?
