Usually, yes. But it's not the topic that's the problem, it's the incompetence of the people writing it. If it were written by people who /do/ know a lot about politics and nobility, it could no doubt be very interesting.

Or you can flip around and do something utterly un-nobility-like with it, as I did --- my conception of Slytherin culture being that they are a house full of My Littlest Dark Wizards, running around calling themselves Lords and Henchpeople and putting on airs and hatching "evil" schemes, though that does not mean all of them are actually evil and would actually /like/ the life of a Dark Wizard once they grow up.
