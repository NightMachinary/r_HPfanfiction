If done well, every topic can make a fantastic story. But I agree that those topics aren't usually written well. But the same goes for self-inserts, original characters, etc. I'm not sure if it's the topic itself that is difficult to write, or if it just attracts inexperienced writers, or if it's the smaller number of stories... I don't know. Perhaps someone who can write well, and has a good grasp of psychology and politics will lean more towards topics and stories that are more realistic, subtle and psychologically interesting.
