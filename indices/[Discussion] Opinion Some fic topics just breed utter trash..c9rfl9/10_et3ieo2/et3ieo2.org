Well, the problem with all those mentioned are that they are completely contrary to the spirit of the JKR's books, and the motivation for using them is usually rather ridiculous (teen wet dreams, to be specific). There is not much to be gained from them (aside from dirty unmentionables), and it really doesn't matter much how executed the idea is.

Also, the old author's rule is that one should never write about something he/she does nothing about, about something he/she never experienced. What are your experiences with male pregnancies or harems? Right.
