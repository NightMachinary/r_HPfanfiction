Certainly, that's an interesting question. None, of course, but the question is whether it is really what my stories (and JKR's books and most good fanfiction stories) are truly about. Truly core point of the story is not magic, but friendship, love, fighting an enemy, value of life, and fear of death. Horrible truth about HP books is that magic is mostly just a decoration for the story itself. We read these books (and any books, including S-F and fantasy) because of what it is says about us, not because what it says about wizards, aliens, or future astronauts.

Slash stories, harems ones, however, have these relational situations truly in core of their story. That is what really makes the story make or break, and if gay stories (and I heard lesbian stories are even worse) are written by straight guy/gal who wants just to get his/her underpants wet (which I think is true about most of them; there is just enough LGBT people to write that many slash stories), it is just fake.
