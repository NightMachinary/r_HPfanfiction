I do read hard sci-fi. Growing up in the Socialist Czechoslovakia, the best what I read was Stanisław Lem, but then later I found Clark, Assimov and others. Surprisingly, I was prefer “Rendezvous with Rama” and “The Fountains of Paradise” to his more famous things. So, yes, I could imagine stories which are more like semi-scientific prediction of future, or trying to suggest possible scenarios, it is a bit strange type of literature, which probably doesn't fit in the broad picture I was drawing. And yes, even so, these stories actually don't contradict what I was saying. The matter which is most important for the story in these cases were not relationships and our everyday human experience, but exactly this prediction of future. And the best authors of the hard sci-fi (e.g., two mentioned) were actually specialists in the area. So, it just confirms what I was saying.

Having said that, I started with Ray Bradbudy as yet another sci-fi writer, but I have immediately found out that he is a way more a storyteller than literary prognostic of the hard sci-fi type, and that I like his stories a way more than I have ever liked hard sci-fi. OK, Fahrenheit 451 was a pure sci-fi, but Martian Chronicles are a bit questionable (I know they chronologically preceded Fahrenheit, but I think that in terms of his literary development they were more advanced). What “Usher II”, “Way in the Middle of the Air”, and perhaps even “There Will Come Soft Rains” have to do with hard sci-fi, really?. And since then Bradbury was moving more and more from the hard sci-fi: his later things were still absolutely brilliant, but some were absolutely non-sci-fi (his Irish stories, “The Magic White Suit”), and he taught what I really want from a story is not sci-fi (and yes, some like it), but the human story. Yes, sci-fi universe gives us possibilities which are not available in the real life, but in the end stories about those relationships not about predicting future (another example is Michel Faber's “The Book of Strange New Things” --- it is quite certainly very fantastic and very sci-fi in its external design, but it has really nothing to do with hard sci-fi, it is about faith, understanding aliens, or understanding between husband and wife).
