Male pregnancy: Yeah, that one I don't get. I mean, it's more likely that someone would use magic to change genders for a year so, long enough to get pregnant, go through pregnancy, and heal. Pregnancy and birth are risky, awkward and painful enough with female bodies which are built to support it.

Slash with death eaters/Voldemort: Depends on the circumstance. I hate Bellatrix pairings because she's a psycho, same with Voldie, but others (Regulus Black) that made stupid decisions when they were too young and under their families' influence and then took steps to correct themselves I am okay with.

Lordships: overused, but I have run across a few cases where it was done okay.

Harem fics: hate 'em, especially since very few show the reality of the backstabbing, jealousy, etc. that would be involved in such arrangements.

White-washing death eaters: that is mostly due to the original canon plot being too simplistic. Wealthy, in power families don't just swear allegiance to some honcho and go around terrorizing people. Something was happening, a shift in the socioeconomic sphere, that made them willing to sign up their children to kill their own cousins. Is mob mentality a real and horrifying thing? Yes, we've seen it. But in most of those cases, there was a root cause. White men did not want to have to pay their workers or loose their privilege (they should and slavery is evil) and so they had a rational (and very selfish and immoral) reason to fight anti-slavery. Some AU's give really believable reasons behind the start of the Death Eaters. They don't forgive the harm they caused, but it changes from random psychos doing acts of terrorism to political unrest that escalated into violence and gave opportunity for psychos to go wild.

My own most hated fic trends are huge age differences between pairings, marriage laws, and uber-abuse stories.
