These all mostly have potential for very interesting stories. It is just that the common reason they are used isn't good storytelling. It is just if it gets abused to shoehorn in poor stories, it makes it that much harder to find the good attempts.

I agree they usually indicate a problem, but I disagree that they can't bring interesting topics to explore if done well.
