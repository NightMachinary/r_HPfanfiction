I disagree. I say any story that contains these tropes and happens to be good succeeds in spite of said trope, not because of it.

Like White-Washing death eaters and relationships with them. I know Rowling left him out of prison after book 7, but Lucius Malfoy facilitated the possession of a schoolgirl by Voldemort and the unleashing of a basilisk on school children. Fics with a suddenly good Malfoy have him still try killing said students... On a similar topic, male pregnancy is done as an excuse for explicit slash scenes and a bit of drama.

You can't do a lot with personality before the character is just an OC with a canon name.

If it is at Hogwarts and Harry is underage, then the lordship story is trash. If he's an adult politicking, then that story has potential. But even then, people abuse it.

Harem fics are all bad. That many characters divides up the plot-driving characters to a ridiculous degree and are pretty much an excuse for explicit scenes. You're right that polyamorous people exist, but do any fics really exist with that? I suppose linkffn(Faery Heroes) counts, but it still has its issues.

Could you write a good fic with these tropes? Possibly. Does it happen? Not really.
