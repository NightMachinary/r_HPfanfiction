Probabilistically speaking, you're right that I've rarely seen good fics using those premises (though if the sheer idea doesn't infuriate you, which I admit it /might/, I've seen some /decent/ stories using magical Lordships, provided Harry doesn't have ten of them).

That being said, I don't think any of these ideas are unworkable, they'd just take a lot more care and talent to be done right.

For example:

- "Male pregnancy" as a random way to pepper up a slash-fic? Rubbish. But if we take the idea that potions enabling it exist in the Wizarding World, there's a great worldbuilding opportunity of writing how alien a culture where women and men are equally qualified to bear children would be --- that would actually be a wonderfully simple explanation of why the Wizarding World is devoid of sexism, and how it affects gender roles in general would be an interesting thing to explore.
- Provided both participants are adults, a romantic relationship between one of the good-guys and one of the enemy is a classic storytelling trick; slightly hackneyed, I suppose, but aren't they all? If it's a believable romance, and not used as an excuse to suddenly absolve the Death Eater participant of all their crimes, it could be a pretty poignant source of drama. People /do/ fall in love with murders, and sometimes it's sincerely reciprocated, and that doesn't stop the fact that the murderer is a murderer, and it's obviously an unhealthy relationship but ergo also an interesting one.
- As I said I think there /are/ okay Lordship stories, but at any rate, writing the Wizarding World as an avowed oligarchy with an arrogant nobility, although it flies against canon, can easily be the stepping stone of some high-quality worldbuilding. The resulting culture isn't canon Wizarding Britain, but it seems like a pretty interesting AU. As for giving Harry a Lordship... it's a more delicate matter, but you can play it for drama as "the li'l guy standing up for the poor and Muggle-born suddenly finds himself revealed as part of the aristocracy; will this corrupt him? and regardless of whether it does, how do Hermione and Ron feel about him accepting the unfair privileges due his birth, forsaking his erstwhile moral opposition to such privileges?", or you can play it as a /Mr Smith Goes to the Senate/-esque moral comedy of "an idealistic kid who genuinely cares about the poor is catapulted into the grimy privileged world of grown-up politics".
- Harem fics are perhaps the hardest trope to get right, but it's not as though polyamorous people don't exist in real life. It would seem disrespectful to them, I think, to act as though a story about a polyamorous romance would by definition have to be rubbish. By the same token, though, I think the best shot at having a harem-fic be good would be to have it written by an actual poly person with experience of how such relationships work in real life, as opposed to heterosexual writers fantasizing about having a lot of obedient females to pick from.
- It might seem disrespectful in light of canon, and it requires heavy rewriting of Death Eater ideology that goes beyond "but pureblood culture is dying because of all the +immigrants+ muggleborns!...", but there's surely a terrific story to be had in Harry spending his early years believing Voldemort and the Death Eaters were the bad guys and the Order unambiguously the good guys, only to realize the Death Eaters were the heroic revolutionaries all along, not just moustache-twirling would-be-world-conquerors as Dumbledore would have had him believe.
