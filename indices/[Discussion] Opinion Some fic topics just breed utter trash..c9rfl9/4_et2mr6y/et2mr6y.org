I think whitewashing death eaters can work both at the individual and group level (of course assuming you make some changes, in canon they're saturday morning cartoon type of villains), but I do agree that it's hard to pull off.

The main issue is that whitewashing authors don't seem to quite understand the concept of anti-hero, so they try to make their characters snarky and edgy but otherwise squeaky clean. It doesn't work that way.
