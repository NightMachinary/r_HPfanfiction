Thinking about it, I don't think these topics encourage bad fics, I think bad fics are attracted to these topics.

If someone says "As a non-religious, more tradition-bound society somehow with less historical sexism, they could have an interesting interaction with polygamy. Let's explore that", I see that having lots of potential.

The common "I want my wish furfillment character to get all the girls I find attractive. Hey, it is a different society I can make any rules I want" is almost always gonna be bad.

Or if someone says "magic could enable things impossible in the real world, like male pregnancy. What would this mean for relationships/fertility/etc in the world" has potential.

The more common "putting my favorite slash characters through a trial. Ohh, I can use male pregnancy" doesn't. Or at least, it is going to stand based on how the characters handle the trials, rather than the trials themselves.
