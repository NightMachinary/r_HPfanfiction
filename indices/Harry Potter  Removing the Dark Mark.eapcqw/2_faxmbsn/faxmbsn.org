Harry Potter removes Snape's Dark Mark in the very last chapter of *Harry Potter and the Chained Souls.* You'll need to read *Harry Potter and the Enemy Within* first. Basically, this is what should have happened in Book 6 and Book 7 haha. Both fanfics were written before those books were released.

I know there's been other Harry and Snape (no slash) fanfics I've read where Harry removing Snape's Dark Mark is a sign of redemption or to protect him from Voldemort and always occurs at the most climatic moments.
