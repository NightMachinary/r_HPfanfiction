In the end, does the mark become nullified? Like, for example, Voldemort can't use it to summon/punish/kill anyone via the mark anymore? Or is it banished from the skin to leave behind no trace of the mark? There is one where Harry just switches essentially the 'master' of the mark. Changing it from the skull&snake combo to a barely visible golden kiss mark.
