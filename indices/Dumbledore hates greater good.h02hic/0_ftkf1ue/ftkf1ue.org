Actually, that's the canon. If you read the heavenly King's Cross chapter in DH again, it is obvious he used (and invented) the phrase when he was fifteen, and I guess mostly regretted it ever since. And swear to me you have not done anything when you were fifteen which you regret now. Hopefully, not on that scale.
