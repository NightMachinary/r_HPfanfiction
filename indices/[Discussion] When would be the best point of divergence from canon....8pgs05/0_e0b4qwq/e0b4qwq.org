Probably fifth or sixth year. I know that sounds late, but it's around the time her character really began becoming independent. Personally I think that's due to the Yule Ball and Cedric Diggory's death. With the threat of Voldemort really out there, she kind of had to step up to the major leagues quickly. That's my take on it.
