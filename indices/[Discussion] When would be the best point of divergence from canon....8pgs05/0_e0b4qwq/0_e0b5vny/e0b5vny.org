Interesting...I was thinking after Lockhart (he did turn out to be a fraud which shakes Hermione's outlook on the world and shatters some of her naivety (books can be wrong and authority figures can be frauds, so what else is wrong around her...I mean sure she intellectually knew those things before (she surely heard about corrupt politicians on TV or the radio) but this really drives it home that this can happen close to her!))

Also how would Hermione be touched by Diggory's death (sure she'd be a little sad for a while, but I don't think she'd really care all that much because Diggory is not somebody she would know all that much about, hell she meets him in the corridors sometimes but otherwise he probably kind of is a nobody to her!)?
