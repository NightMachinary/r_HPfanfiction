I'm mostly speaking from personal experience here. At my school we've had students die and even if you didn't know them, the first time it happened is still a bit of a shock and can change one's perspective. I don't think Lockhart had nearly as much of an impact on Hermione as you might think. Of course, this is all speculation, but Hermione /didn't/ have blind faith in adults. She set Snape on fire a full year before she even met Lockhart. And she still had almost total faith in books. Perhaps Lockhart was the first step, but I firmly believe that fourth year at the earliest is a good point of divergence.
