Because she saw Snape doing something and made a snap decision! Pun not intended! Otherwise she almost always deferred to authority and she didn't question Dumbledore once (despite that fact that she supposedly is very intelligent) or McGonagall despite the fact that all of the professors (especially those two as headmster and deputy, not to mention head of gryffindor!) allowed bullying, not to mention they sent a student back to an abusive environment (yes: The Dursleys were abusive, letting someone live in a cupboard is abuse and trying to hit them with a frying pan is even more so!)

ps: I've had students die at the various schools I attended, too and it didn't phase me much unless I knew them well (one of my friends died - probably suicide (especially since his family was tight lipped about the entire thing!) - shortly after we had finished attending school together (I moved on to another school to further my education, while he had gone into the workforce directly (he wasn't academically inclined) and he had problems there (he never looked all that happy when we went out, got busted with weed once (sadly weed is still illegal in Germany) and was dead a few months later)...now that was a blow! I am not emotionally cold but if I don't know the deceased then I don't feel all that sorry for their passing!

pps: Maybe it's because I've lost a great many relatives (especially my younger cousin when I was 10 years old) that death doesn't phase me much anymore (I still see it as wasteful and hope that science can - finally - overcome death in my livetime ("The last enemy to be conquered is death!"), but over all I don't cry anymore, I just feel sad for a while when somebody I know dies!)
