I'm not saying you cry or anything, but the first time you truly comprehend the gravity of death, it does have some effect on you. It might not be crying but generally, the first time kind of sticks with you. I'm just saying that Hermione could have been affected by this. She's a very passionate and empathetic human by nature, so it'd be understandable for her to be affected by the death of a student.

She may have made a snap decision, but she certainly didn't just do it and go back to obeying all authority. Sure she trusted Dumbledore and McGonagall, but one was the head of her house and seemed to be competent (which she is) and the other was like wizard Jesus. You have to remember, this was taking place in the 90s. Bullying was typically accepted on the small scale of verbal taunts between classmates, and Hermione never went to an authority figure to complain about Malfoy, so how could McGonagall know? Sure she could have seen something, but at the same time she's human and might just not have been able to notice it.

Hermione didn't know the scale that the Dursleys abused Harry at the time, so how could she fault them? Dumbledore has the flaw of trying to see everything from a bird's eye view, which can cause some serious issues. I don't think he really knew the full extent of abuse Harry got, or perhaps he deluded himself into thinking it was all for the greater good.
