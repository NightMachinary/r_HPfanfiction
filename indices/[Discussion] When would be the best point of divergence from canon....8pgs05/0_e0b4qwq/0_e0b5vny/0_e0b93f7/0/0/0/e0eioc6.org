Point taken - still, Hermione didn't seem affected in canon (at least not by Cedric's death or Sirius' death...Dumbledore did affect her because she worshipped the man and thought of him as kind of the second coming of Merlin!)

As for the teachers competence: Competent in their subjects, yes! Competent educators in general? No IMHO! Why? Bullying! All of the heads of house let bullies run wild (Pomona couldn't control her badgers when they bullied Harry for "stealing Cedric's thunder" - so much for fair Hufflepuffs! Flitwick didn't see that Luna was bullied! Snape encouraged Slytherin-Bullies and McGonagall encouraged Gryffindor-Bullies (like James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew!)...and Dumbledore? Yeah, he allowed all this and also allowed a young Tom Riddle to bully people...he might not have been able to expell Tom (he wasn't headmaster then!), but he could have put him in detention etc.)

ps: The defense professors on the whole weren't very competent! Lupin didn't teach many spells to his students (sure he did dark creatures, but that isn't it! You have CoMC for that!), Lockhart was incompetent and a fraud, fake Moody wasn't all that bad (but also didn't teach duelling/fighting!), Quirrelmort was ineffective (on purpose!)...the only half decent teacher left? Snape and he was - sadly - the best of the bunch IMHO!
