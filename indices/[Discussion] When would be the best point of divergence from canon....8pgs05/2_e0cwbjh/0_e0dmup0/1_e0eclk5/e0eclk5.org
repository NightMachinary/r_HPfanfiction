Well Cho seemed really sorry when she told Harry that Cedric had already asked her, if Harry had been a little been more daring earlier he would most likely have gone to Yule Ball with her and their relationship would have been entirely different. Think of it that way, unlike in OoTP, Cedric wouldn't be between them so their relationship wouldn't have been so disturbing/unhealthy. At the end no one can say how it would have ended but it would definitely have changed a lot of things.
