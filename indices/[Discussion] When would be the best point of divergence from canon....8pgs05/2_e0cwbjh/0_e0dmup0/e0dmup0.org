Hm...what would that change? I mean yeah it would show that Harry pursues what he wants (and doesn't let others - Cedric - get there (damned, mixed up "their" and "there"...hate this when reading it and now I am the one doing it! ARGH!) first!), but otherwise it wouldn't change all that much as Harry didn't go with Hermione in the first place! He invited one of the Patil twins (and even got the other to go with Ron...poor girl...well, girls but Harry at least has better manners than Ron)
