Harry would have made friends with Marietta Edgecombe by osmosis if Harry and Cho entered a relationship so the DA wouldnÂ´t been betrayed(probably). Dumbledore would have keep his headmaster position for longer and Harry would have contacted Dumbledore about his vision about Sirius(like he did about Arthur).

During sixth year Harry would have gravitated more to Cho because hermione was a bitch because of the book and Ron was doing Won Won. She also could have supported Harry investigating Malfoy.

Fourth Player during the Horcrux Hunt.
