Ok, that's reasonable and I agree that this makes a great point of diversion from canon (I also like Cho because she is firstly a bit of a blank slate - we don't know what subjects she's good at for example, but as a Ravenclaw she probably does know a lot of things, so she can substitute for Hermione when she is too bitchy! Not to mention that she is a pureblood - right? - so she knows more about the wiz-world than Hermione does! She's also athletic (she's her house team's seeker after all!) and works well as a partner for Harry)
