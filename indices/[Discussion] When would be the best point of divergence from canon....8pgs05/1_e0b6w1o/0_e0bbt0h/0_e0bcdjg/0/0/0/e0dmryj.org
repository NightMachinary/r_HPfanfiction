Indeed, most people would probably quit (I am not talking suicide, but many - probably including myself - would run away! Especially since the wiz-world has treated Harry badly, not to mention that they made the rise of Voldemort possible by either supporting him, letting his supporters get away after the first war (I blame Dumbledore! I mean we know that they locked up Sirius Black who was innocent, so why not lock up Lucius Malfoy, the Carrows, McNair etc. etc.) and by not fighting back! I mean we are talking about a society where everybody carries the equivalent of a tactical nuke with them! (A wand - especially if used right - can be just as destructive! Hell, apparate in - unleash Fiendfyre - apparate out and let the fire rage!) But most wizards are sheeple and more or less wait till the DEs come knocking to either plead support or die without much in the way of fighting back!)

I for one never blamed Harry for 5th year, hell I think he should have acted out more and rebelled more etc. (he was way too passive IMHO!)

ps: OoTP is probably my favourite HP-Book (next up would probably be GoF and then probably CoS and after that PoA...the rest I like (except for the last book, I don't like JKR destroying her "hero" because frankly Harry plans his hunt like a 3 year old! He doesn't bring the tent or a super-slick bag or even tons of non-perishable food - no, Hermione does and she takes books instead of tons of food and she doesn't bring any entertainment...you can't do this without having some entertainment for your off hours! You'll drive yourself mad!), but those are the four I like the most!)
