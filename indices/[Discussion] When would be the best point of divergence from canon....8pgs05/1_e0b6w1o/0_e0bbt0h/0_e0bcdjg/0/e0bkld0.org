Not after the year - Lockhard is de-cloaked (kind of like a using Moody's eye on invisibility cloaks!), his being a fraud exposed for the whole world to see!

Still, I see your point and I agree! Third year works well here and it is early in the story (early enough to make a difference especially since Harry has grown up some more (can't really use first year and second year as you pointed out doesn't work as well!) - I mean the guy IMHO always was very mature because living at the Dursleys wasn't much of a "childhood"!)

So here, have an up-vote (note: Don't know why some douchebag voted you down, your arguments make sense - I guess that person doesn't agree with what you are saying and uses the voting as an "I disagree but I don't want to comment"-button!)
