Hermione just asking a simple question of "Harry I get he's your Godfather but you've only known him for less than a hour why were you so ready to go with him? Don't you love your family" which then sets off the ingrained response of "They aren't my Family" which let's Hermione ease into the needed conversation without plot lines leading there but rather it naturally flows there and leaves Plot lines to follow afterwards.

Lockhart wouldn't work since Hermione is mostly blinded to him and sees his interest in Harry as someone who is experienced mentoring her friend. Even after the Basilisk Hermione isn't likely to be focused on Harry and Lockhart but rather her school work and asking Harry everything about the Chamber and what happened.

Third Year is like it is hand built for what your looking for, think about how that year starts and ends its like a Harry Abuse Discount Warehouse, Hermione and Harry standing down the hall from the Hospital Wing whispering about Why Harry seems to be willing to go ANYWHERE but the Dursleys fits better than her trying to do the same after waking up and instead of focusing on herself like she should she is focusing on her friend.
