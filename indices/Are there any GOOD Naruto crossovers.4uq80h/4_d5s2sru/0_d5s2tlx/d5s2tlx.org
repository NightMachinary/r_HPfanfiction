  This is a story of the normal students in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or as normal as you can be with a kunoichi in your midst. An Uchiha fOC student at Hogwarts. Saeko is older than HP so Harry will be in the picture from her fourth year up. Mainly OCs, a bit of humor, bit of adventure, bit of romance (Femslash so just you know).

  AU! Reina Potter had gone to her last battle with Voldemort, fully prepared to die with her enemy. So when, instead of Death's finally claiming her soul, she wakes up to find herself in another dimension, in a child's body among a power-hungry clan. She does what she knows best. She adapts. And wrecks havoc. After all she should be used to impossible things happening to her by now.
