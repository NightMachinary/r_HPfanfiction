Of the ones that haven't been mentioned yet linkffn(Growing Strong) is my favorite. Note that it says complete but the author decided to split it up into 4 books, and is currently on book 2. Also it was updating every week till 3 months ago when that stopped and author hasn't updated since. The author has said on their blog and author page that they are still working on it and that the next chapter would be out soon, but that's not a super great sign in terms of it being continued long term.

I like this one too. Premise is a bit unusual.

linkffn(Ain't Never Had A Friend Like Me)

This one is also decent. It hadn't been updated for like a year, and then was updated again 2 months ago, so not abandoned, but very infrequent updates.

linkffn(Harry-Potter-Life-of-a-Ninja)
