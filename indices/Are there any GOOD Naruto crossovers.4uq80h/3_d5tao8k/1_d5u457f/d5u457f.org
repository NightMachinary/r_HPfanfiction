Hadn't seen this one before, its really good so far. Wish there was more of it though.

Its only been 4 months since the last update so there's a decent chance its not abandoned yet. However 6 chapters in 2 years for a story that seems like its going to be fairly long in total means its unlikely to ever get finished since it would take like a decade to do so.
