In addition to linkffn(Bungle In The Jungle) which is linked below, *Harry Potter and the Sun Queen* linkffn(10659456) literally places him into a Tomb Raider game, *A Long Journey Home* linkffn(9860311) has aspects of this, especially in the newer chapters, *The Black Prince* linkffn(11098283) is Harry in the Game of Thrones universe with that level of adventuring.

You also have *Illusions of Grandeur* linkffn(8957424) where Harry is...something that goes on adventures (against his will at times) with the Winchesters in the Supernatural universe. I'm not doing a good job selling it, but Harry basically is feared by the Angels in that Universe and is a powerful being unto himself. It's quite good.

*Altered Destinies* linkffn(3155057) isn't quite up that alley, but it does feature heavy on Harry and the cohorts of the time fighting WWII in both the wizarding and muggle world. It is also quite good.
