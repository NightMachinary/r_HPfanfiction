Thanks for the rec. I can add Stronger than Hope, in case somebody else is looking for good mentor/father Snape/Harry stories too. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3389525/1/Stronger-Than-Hope]]

Snape isn't Harry's father, only his mentor, but plays an important role. Both characters are somewhat dark.

If anybody else knows other good stories where Snape is Harry's mentor or father and Harry is a bit darker (or very dark), I'm still looking!
