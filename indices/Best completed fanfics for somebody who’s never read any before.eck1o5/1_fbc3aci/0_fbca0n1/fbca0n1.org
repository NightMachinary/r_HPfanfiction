Adventure, dark, romance, humorous, probably in that order. Honestly I'd probably just want to stick with Harry and Hermione. I read one fanfic that I absolutely loved, but found out that it was an abandoned project halfway through it (the wizard from earth - time travel/Egyptian story where Harry goes back in time during a vacation to pyramids in Egypt during Auror training and gets stuck there.) I've started reading wind shear and so far I've loved it.
