Keep in mind that different people have completely different tastes in fanfiction and writing. What seems great for one person may not be for another. I know for me I really dislike the black comedy and yet it gets recommended in almost every one of these threads. Same goes for many other fanfics.

If you are interested in reading fanfiction I encourage you to try multiple fics and not give up even if you don't like the ones recommended.

Do you have any characters that you like and want to read more about? How about favorite or least favorite genres (such as adventure, romance, fluff, gritty/dark vs. humorous)? It would be easier to recommend something if you give us more information.
