In my opinion, it's Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste and Hermione Granger's Crammer for Delinquents on the Run by waspabi, as they are both very well-written and funny, keep true to character's voices, and have great dialogue. However, seeing your preferences for genres, I think you may want to check out Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider (listed as a crossover, but though I don't know the universe it's crossing and had no trouble understanding it). A Long Journey Home is a long fanfic you may enjoy, but I don't think it's finished.
