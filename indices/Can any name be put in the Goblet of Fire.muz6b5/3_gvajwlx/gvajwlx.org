It's not specified how the goblet works. How does it even know that you are the most suitable candidate? I'd tend to go with [[/u/Riddle-in-a-Box]]'s assumption. In fact even in-universe, I doubt many people know how the goblet works considering that it hadn't been used in 200 years and likely no one alive who had seen it at work or enchanted it was around anymore... unless, of course, the goblet was something created specifically for that Triwizard Tournament and the schools had other ways to select the champions in the past. In which case, it would make sense that Barty Crouch Sr created it and, being under the Imperius curse by Voldemort, he could make it however he wanted it to.
