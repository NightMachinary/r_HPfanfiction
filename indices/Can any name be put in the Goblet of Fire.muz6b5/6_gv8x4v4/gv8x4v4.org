Nope, only if the paper with the name on it was written by himself, you cant write someone elses name and have it binding, (else the world would be completely broken) but if you got a paper with someones name that they wrote themselves? Yup, throw that sucker in.

..perhaps the RoR has old asignments the students/teachers have throw away, with their names on it? Would probaly be the easiest way of getting Riddles name.
