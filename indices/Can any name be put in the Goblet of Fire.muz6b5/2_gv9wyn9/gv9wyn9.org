In normal circumstances, I would guess that the Goblet has some kind of restriction so only a "student" can be chosen. Without it, it would be totally possible for a Headmaster to put his own name before destroying the competition (which probably happened in the past if the rule was not included from the start). But I'm not sure this kind of rule would still apply after Crouch "fooled" the Goblet.

Concerning your question, I think the name need to be written by the would be participant, though I don't remember if it's clearly said in canon or just implied. In any case, it should not be impossible for someone to find an old Riddle signature, like an exam he took part while a student or just a letter sent to a "friend".
