I'm writing something sort of like this! Mrs. Figg isn't the main character but she's in a coven of blood witches and is able to do more blood magic than wand magic.

It's called Luna Lovegood and the Forgotten Circle. Mrs. Figg hasn't been a massive character yet but she'll have a bigger role to play later. :)
