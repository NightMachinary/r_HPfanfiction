I mean, it's limiting for the obvious reason. "Tomarry" is a really niche story element in an already niche-of-a-niche world (HP fanfic is a niche of fanfic which is a niche of fiction with is only one type of writing).

It sounded odd because to me, "Tomarry" isn't a type of writer. It's not even a type of story - it's a story element. The phrase "I am a Tomarry writer" struck me like someone saying "I am an oregano chef." Like, oregano is just an element in dishes, it's not the whole dish and it's not a type of chef.

I don't mean to shit on your choice to write particular kinds of stories that repeat certain story elements. If you only like writing stories in which Riddle and Potter have super-hot gay sex, then by all means, you do you. The glory of fanfic is reveling in that kind of super-niche stuff. I would just think it would get boring after awhile and you'd wanna write different stuff and that a self-imposed label of "Tomarry writer" would feel limiting.

Anyway, I definitely look forward to whatever you write in the whole "Figg is secretly a blood witch" thing, because the OP's premise sounds /fucking awesome/.
