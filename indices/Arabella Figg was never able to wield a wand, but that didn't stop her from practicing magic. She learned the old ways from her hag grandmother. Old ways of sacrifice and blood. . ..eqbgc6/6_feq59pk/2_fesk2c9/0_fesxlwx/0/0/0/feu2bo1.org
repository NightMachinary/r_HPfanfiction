That sounds like a writing rut, to me. Kind of like writer's block, just instead of being unable to write anything, you're only able to write one thing. I'd recommend challenging yourself to outline and craft a story in which it's impossible for it to be Tomarry (perhaps imagine a HP universe in which Voldemort doesn't exist, or just write a story outside the HP fandom). That way you can broaden the scope of possibilities for your writing. I'd wager it would improve the quality of your Tomarry fics.

Just some writing advice. ðŸ™‚

Another note: this kind of problem tends to be more common with a "pantser" style of writing rather than a "planner" style. It can feel more natural, but it provides less control over the writing process. Which ultimately means running into more problems than just writing ruts and blocks.
