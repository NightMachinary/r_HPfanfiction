I was puzzling over the same question, honestly. I can see someone saying "I only write scifi" or limiting themselves to high fantasy instead of urban fantasy, or only writing romance novels set in the '20s, and so on, because those require specific skill sets and settings that demand certain areas of expertise to pull off. But even then a mature writer will venture beyond their comfort zone to develop their skill, just to exercise so to speak. Maybe writing poetry when they typically don't, or writing in 1st Person instead of 3rd Limited. Etcetera.

But saying you only write about one very specific pairing between two very specific characters doesn't make sense to me. Why would you constrain yourself like that? I get that you might like that pairing, sure, but that's still a very very narrow box to jam all your writing skill and potential into.

And to clarify, I know restrictions boost creativity. That's why we have such strong rules about how a sonnet works, or haiku, limerick, iambic pentameter, and so on. Forcing oneself to write a short story which uses zero adverbs, or without the letter E, can be a writing exercise to improve your skills and develop creative thinking. But you don't say "as an author, I never use adverbs" or "I only write haiku." That's not inspiring creativity by adding constraints to a particular project, that's curtailing and even crippling your entire writing career.

(As an aside, not bashing you or Tomarry even. I've just seen this particular self-restriction echoed by several people, and it's always concerned me.)
