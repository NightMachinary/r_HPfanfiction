I understand. Anything non-fanfiction I've written has been discarded as a bad job. As far as fanfiction, where I'm not crafting a whole new world, I've been working on 3 fics since fall break. I work at a school and when class in session I feel I barely have time to race to my notebooks to make a quick note of an idea I want to incorporate.
