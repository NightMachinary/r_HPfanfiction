I'm not sure WHERE it came from, but it is mostly used as an "extra" on him being evil. I mean, When most fanfics go to Embezzlement, it is usually before or after a more serious reveal (Marriage Contracts, Core binding, Potions, actively encouraging his abuse, deliberately keeping Sirius in prison, theft of family heirlooms/properties, etc.).

Its only in a few stories where the Embezzlement is used beyond that, opening the door to criminal prosecution, lawsuits, or Gringotts Goblin Raids(TM). It is stupid, but rarely focused on.
