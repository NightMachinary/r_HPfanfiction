In my opinion, cannon Dumbledore is well meaning, but also an out right criminal when he feels like laws and morals need to be ignored "for the greater good". For example I see him capable of out right killing Harry personally if that would have killed Voldemort or prevented the war from happening, and then later going and honestly grieving Harrys death.

With cannon Dumbledore being like that it is kind of easy for fan fiction writers to make Dumbledore greedy or even actually evil or insane.
