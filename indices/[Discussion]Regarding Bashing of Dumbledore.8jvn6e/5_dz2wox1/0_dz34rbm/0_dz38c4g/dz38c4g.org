Because he had a good time with her while it lasted, which is a lot more than can be said about his /friendship/ with Hermione. There are really just three scenes where they truly get along, one is Ron waking up after being poisoned, one is after Dumbledore's death and the last is the asspull romance.

As seen in GoF, OotP and HBP, Ron is one for looks, not that there is anything wrong with that. Therefore pairing him with someone who looks good, is enough, at least for Hogwarts era stuff (and I don't find the postwar era interesting unless you completely ditch DH and build your own AU). I picked someone for a teenage romance, not Ron's wife.
