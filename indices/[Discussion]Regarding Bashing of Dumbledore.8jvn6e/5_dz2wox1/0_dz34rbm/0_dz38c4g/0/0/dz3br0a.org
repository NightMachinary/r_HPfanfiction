I like Lavender. I mean, yes, she is a little air-headed, but at least she has her priorities and morals straight, which is more that can be said about any Slytherin in the entire series, with the single exception of Andromeda Tonks. She fought and bled in the Battle of Hogwarts, so who cares if she has a slight obsession with haircare products?

And we are talking about teenagers here. Harry wouldn't say no if Lavender came to his bed in unmentionables either.
