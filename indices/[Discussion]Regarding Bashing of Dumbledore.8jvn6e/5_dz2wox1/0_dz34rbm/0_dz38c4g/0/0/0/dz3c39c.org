Yeah I like her too - or at least think she could be interesting. There's not really any "girly-girls" that play a huge role (it's almost as if JKR thinks stereotypical female behaviour is bad). She's definitely on the list (right next to Tonks) of "characters that wouldn't die" in my AU headcanon. Got more than enough canon fodder to feed to the wolves to give them their heroes death so I wouldn't have to deal with them.
