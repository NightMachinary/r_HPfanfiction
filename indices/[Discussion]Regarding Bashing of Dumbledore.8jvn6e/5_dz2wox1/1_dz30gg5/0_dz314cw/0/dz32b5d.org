I agree completely with this. Dumbledore was criminally irresponsible and horrifically disgusting. You don't leave an active terrorist inside a school and DO NOTHING as they commit terrorist acts ON OTHER STUDENTS ACTIVELY. That's like if a school shooter was in a school, and the principal was just like, "Oh no everyone just keep running the classes, do your lessons, it's all fine don't worry about it!" It's fucking ridiculous and insane, and that is the ONE THING I will always change in my year 6 fanfics, that the staff and the law enforcement actually get in there and take Malfoy out.

Dumbledore claimed he cared about the school, but harry was right when he accused him of actually NOT giving a damn. "You're leaving it defenseless and Malfoy has been doing things all year under your nose." Harry was exactly right, and Dumbledore didn't care. He let it happen.
