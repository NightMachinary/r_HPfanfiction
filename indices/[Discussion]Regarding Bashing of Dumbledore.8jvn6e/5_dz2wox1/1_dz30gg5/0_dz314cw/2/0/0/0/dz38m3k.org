Dumbledore, as the magical powerhouse he was, could have dealt with the Death Eaters with ease. You have a Dark Mark? There's the Veil, have a nice death.

Given his power, he /was the Senate/ and could have used his nearly unmatched power to purge the Death Eater scum. Instead, he put children at risk. And if Death Eaters were summarily executed, Voldemort would have difficulties finding anyone to join him. And without Death Eaters, there is no second war.
