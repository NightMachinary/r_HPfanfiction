Dumbledore knew as in realized that Malfoy was ordered to kill him. He asked Snape to make the Unbreakable Vow, keep an eye on Malfoy for him, and then eventually finish the job.

Malfoy lets his pride and paranoia go to his head and essentially acted rashly without telling Snape or taking his advice.

You can't plan for every single possibility - but Dumbledore had plans and backups for his plans. Harry takes his lead at the end of the seventh book by telling Neville to kill the snake.

Also, you didn't really respond to either point I made?
