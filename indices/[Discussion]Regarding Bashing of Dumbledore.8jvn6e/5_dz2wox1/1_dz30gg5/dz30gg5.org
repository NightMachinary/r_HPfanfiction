  Incompetence and idealistic stupidity when it comes to Malfoy and Snape

I disagree. Both acted almost exactly in the manner he predicted. He emotionally manipulated Snape time after time, and he was right on the nose with Malfoy. The only thing he didn't accurately predict was the Elder Wand's ownership transferring to Malfoy, and in the end, it was better that the wand didn't die a natural death.
