You can write a antagonistic Dumbledore solely based on Canon (Incompetence and idealistic stupidity when it comes to Malfoy and Snape) and I never understood the need for excessive bashing. Same goes for Ron. Don't want him to play a prominent role? Just pair him with Lavender, because let's be honest here, most of use wouldn't be too keen to stick our nose into some shady shit when we could be spending time with an attractive partner instead.
