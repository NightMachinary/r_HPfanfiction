The only time I saw it done well wasn't even a bashing fic really. Basically in this fic the war kept going even after Voldemort was defeated, with Lucius Malfoy (I think?) becoming the new Dark Lord. Dumbledore ended up bankrupting himself funding the war and then he chose to use the Potter vaults to keep the war from failing due to funding.
