  So this really begs the question if this is just a plot device to smear his character if authors don't have enough plot points to potray him as a bad character

It clearly is, so if we assume the theft of money is to upgrade his lifestyle to Malfoy levels, the author is basically destroying his character in an effort to find more ways to bash him. It's not that disimiliar to authors exaggerating Ron eating like a pig, backstabbing Harry on the drop of a dime, being a racist because Hermione doesn't love him romantically, etc...

Now if the money is to pay off members of the order, that makes no sense. Half of those bashing fics are like 'Harry you've been dosed with loyalty potions (which coincidentally don't make him not care even though they should),' if Dumbledore wanted supporters he has no incintive to buy loyalty, someone else could buy it with more in that case, instead he could just imperius or drug his ideal followers if he can't convince them.

I now kinda want to see an evil dumbledore done well, so like actually propping up dark lords to keep his rep up as the good guy, false political opposition that he created to make himself not look like a dictator, cleverly killing off people who are actually threats to him, he'd actually appear innocent in the story and not be so obviously evil a first year can tell, and he wouldn't be outed as the antagonist half a chapter in.
