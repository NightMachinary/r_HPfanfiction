I think different people knew different facets of Dumbledore. Elphias Doge new Dumbledore the boy, and Dumbledore the teenager. Aberforth knew Dumbledore, the ambitious young man. Snape knew Dumbledore the great, and Dumbledore the schemer. And Harry, well Harry knew Dumbledore the idealist, and Dumbledore - the man who stood up for what's right.
