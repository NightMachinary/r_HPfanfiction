  People like, say, Steve Jobs hardly need to earn any more billions that they already have

I would say Steve is not the best example of this. He famously took a $1 a year salary and lived in a relatively modest house in Palo Alto (well, modest by PA standards). He did have the use of a private jet and loads and loads of stock, but I'd also seen the dude in some ratty-ass jeans and sneakers when he was still kicking around campus. I think I saw him in jeans that had a hole in back pocket once.

Zuckerberg on the other hand, lives in a crazy big compound in Atherton where $6M is a tear-down.
