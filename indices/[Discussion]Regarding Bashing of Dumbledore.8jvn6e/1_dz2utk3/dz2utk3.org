It's essentially just a plot device, but is simply explained by /greed/. People like, say, Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg hardly need to earn any more billions that they already have; any actual influence on their lifestyle would be minimal at best; but some human beings just /crave/ having more and more money. And an evil Dumbledore could well be someone like that, for all we know.
