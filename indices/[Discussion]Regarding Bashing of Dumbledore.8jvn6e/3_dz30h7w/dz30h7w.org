There's ... /tons/ of stuff even a "good" Dumbledore could be doing with access to a fortune. There's so much we don't know about the canon world that it's not hard to invent situations that require Dumbledore to need lots of money. Countering bribes, keeping prisoners in Azkaban, maybe /funding/ Azkaban, maybe funding the /government/ (there might be no taxes and the government is funded by "interested" families), keeping Malfoy off the Wizengamot, maybe the Ministry won't pay for muggleborn education or Muggle Studies so Dumbledore has to fund scholarships and "department chairs", investing in businesses so the Malfoys/Notts/Whoever don't take over everything, paying Remus to not need a job, paying Mundungus to do stuff, stocking up on potions and other gear, setting up safehouses, financing a spy network (probably concentrated in Britain, but potentially spreading out through Europe and the entire world), Wolfsbane potions for werewolves who can't afford it, scholarships for squibs kicked out of their families, funding wars against dark magicals in other countries, ...

Magical Britain has an economy based on money. Therefore there are things of value that can be purchased or achieved with money. Even Harry's canon vault had "mounds of gold coins" (that's really a lot of money) and hey, James said "Sure! Take what you need!" (we can suppose).

  So this really begs the question if this is just a plot device to smear his character if authors don't have enough plot points to potray him as a bad character

But, yes, generally this is it.
