There are a handful of stock explanations that tend to be given in Bad!Dumbledore stories.

- Giving the Dursley's Harry's money to take care of him...which is sort of the point of a trust fund anyway.
- Gratuitously enriching Order members because the whole organization is corrupt.
- Paying off one or more of the Weasleys (and Hermione) to participate in his evil schemes.
- Providing scholarships to poor and muggle-born students who otherwise wouldn't be able to go to Hogwarts. (Of course, this assumes a lot of aristocratic magical Britain tropes for it to make sense.)
