I can see how surprise watersports might ruin a fic for you :)

Im not a fan of slash (on the account of beeing a straight male, i identify with the mc, so him beeing gay is jarring me out of the mindspace im in when reading) so reading on ao3 is difficult. 80% is slash. 75% of slash fics is not tagged as such, and removing draco and snape from characters will still give you Harry/draco/othermale for some reason.. FFn any day of the week!
