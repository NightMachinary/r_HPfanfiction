No I mean I wouldn't be opposed to that story either. But he can exist its just hes going to dissappear at some point like he did in the books ( you can make this happen for different reasons if you want) . And after that will never come back again. Hes not in the diary or on the back of anyones head and doesnt ever get ressurected.
