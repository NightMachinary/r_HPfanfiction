Ah gotcha. In that case I would imagine it would actually be a lot like canon. Voldemort is after all believed to be death by most people. There are a few followers that anticipate him returning if I recall correctly, but given their reaction in the graveyard people like Lucius Malfoy never actually thought he would resurrect. That being said people like Lucius Malfoy and Umbridge are prominent figures in magical society and still are very much anti muggleborn/creatures. So I'd think that a political fic around that would be a realistic non Voldemort thing.

Building on that idea that despite Voldemort being gone the ideology is still very prominent I can also see a pro Muggleborn Dark Lord rising up. Imagine a Lucius/Umbridge alliance rising to prominence in the ministry and introducing a ton of laws against werewolves, muggleborns, creatures, etc. Effectively politically legitimatising the Death Eater/Voldemort ideology. A muggleborn (either an OC or someone like Hermione, or even Harry as a muggle raised) is fed up with the mistreatment and launches a counter movement against the purebloods.
