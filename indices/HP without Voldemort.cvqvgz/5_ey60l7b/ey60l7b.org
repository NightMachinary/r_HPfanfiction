I hope this doesn't sound cringe, because depending on how someone went about making this it would definitely be cringe, but I would turn the whole thing into a "coming-of-age" story.

Instead of dealing with War, Death and Disaster, Harry has to deal with friends, girls (or boys, I don't judge) and growing up. The whole dynamic of the world could be so different, with things like the Golden Trio never existing and Draco not being a prick (though that would be a bit of a stretch).

But the thing I like a lot about this is that, if you're a good writer, you can make things the way /you/ want them and make them realistic. You're an avid Dramione Shipper? They're now the cutest couple in Hogwarts. You think Snape could take a liking to Luna? He's now giving her tutoring sessions during his spare time. You want to see some more student events? Hogwarts now does a dress-up for World Book Day. Obviously, you would need to go about it right, randomly changing things for plot convenience isn't very nice to read, but you could make gradual changes that lead to your vision.

To quote Thanos, /"Reality can be whatever I want"./

But hey, that's just me.
