I mean yes true There are for example shipping dynamics i do like in concept and shipping dynamics i dont like it concept. But when i dislike a ship its usually both because the canon dynamic I don't like/ see potential in and I dont like the types of stories the fans of the ship tell. Some of my favorite ships in fic are ones I dislike in canon but I like the stories told with them in fanon.

But yes you have alot of possibilities here I just wanted to see what people would like to do. But yes personally I think Id like reading about slice of life in this fantasy world. In fact the books kinda have that appeal to them anyway especially the first 3.
