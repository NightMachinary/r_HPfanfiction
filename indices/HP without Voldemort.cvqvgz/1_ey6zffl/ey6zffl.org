The Pureblood Pretense series by murkybluematter is based on the idea that Tom Riddle is still a terrible human being, but instead of becoming a violent, vicious mass murderer, he decided to apply himself and go into politics/government. So taken to its natural conclusion, Tom Riddle ends up as the highly charismatic leader of magical Britain's own pureblood supremacist political party.

The story itself follows the Harry Potter-esque character, and Riddle's machinations still seem to underlie all/most of the conflicts.

As a side note, this is one of my favorite fanfic series because of its ideas about what a political-savvy Tom Riddle would do to magical Britain. It also avoids rehashing canon events in favor of original conflicts, which is nice.

Spoiler-ish in relation to your main post: Riddle's diary is a thing, and the Riddle that comes out of the diary does call himself Voldemort just like canon. So "Voldemort" technically does exist in these stories, but isn't that prominent.
