Here's my idea for HP without Voldemort:

Tom Riddle wasn't a psychopath so he just became a normal ambitious student, maybe he's teaching Defense, maybe he's campaigning for the rights of muggle raised students like himself, maybe he's running a magical orphanage for orphans and muggleborns with abusive parents.

The Pureblood ideology still exists, they just don't have an insanely powerful leader so they mostly just try to gather political support, pass laws that discriminate against muggleborns, maybe kill some muggles when they think that they can get away with it but they don't wear masks and do terrorism.

So there'd be a lot of political division over the question of if muggleborns should be helped or rejected, there might be some extremists who go as far as trying to murder the opposition, but it wouldn't escalate into a civil war.

By the Marauder era there would be a lot of tension with Slytherins mostly supporting the anti-muggle side but there wouldn't be recruiting of soldiers straight out of Hogwarts, apart from that things still happen the same and James and Severus hate each other.

By the time Harry is born, there wouldn't be a Prophecy since there's no Dark Lord so they wouldn't be hiding and Harry would just grow up with his parents.

During the Hogwarts years there'd still be the Slytherin/Gryffindor rivalry with the same ideologies but there wouldn't be the annual adventures, and Harry would just be a normal kid.
