You formatted it as [text](link) but the link itself has a close parentheses character, which the markup interpreted as the end of the link and in turn broke the link (and formatting) entirely.

Insert a backslash character =\= to escape formatting. Like so -- note the \ before I close the parentheses on "TV".
