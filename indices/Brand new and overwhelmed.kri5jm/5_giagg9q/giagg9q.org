These aren't the kind you were looking for, but neglect fics are one of the most common tropes in the fandom and these are probably the best of the bunch from what I've read, so you can try these if you feel like it.

Prince Of Slytherin isn't drastically AU and is still being updated, but it's got some of the best world building I've seen in a long time.

This is a 7 part series and EXTREMELY long, along with being quite AU, diverging from cannon more and more as the series progresses. The pairing is Harry/Draco however this doesn't start until the later stories and definitely isn't the main focus.

While this isn't a neglect fic it is one of the funnier things in the fandom I've read. Harry being a horcrux has the unintended side affect of him thinking he is lord Voldemort, who thinks hermione's an evil mastermind, Dumbledore is constantly out to get him and is the most successful dark lord, and treats Ron and the rest of the weasleys like his minions.
