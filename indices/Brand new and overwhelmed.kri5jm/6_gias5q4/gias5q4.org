My standard answer for introductory HP post-war fanfics is [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Nineteen Years and Beyond]] series by Northumbrian (start with “Tales of the Battle” and then go on), and [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Stories by Mrs_Granger]] (Summer goes before Winter).
