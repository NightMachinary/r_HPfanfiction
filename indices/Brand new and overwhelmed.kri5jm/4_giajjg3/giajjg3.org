First off, welcome to the fanfic community! We're cranky folk, prone to bitching about grammar and posting at all hours of the day about weird shower thoughts and whimsical requests for all manner of merry fuckery, and we can't agree on anything. But as the kids probably don't say these days but absolutely still should - this shit's dope, yo. :)

Personally, I'd say the best way to find good starter fics is to do a sub-search (in case you're unaware, reddit has a search bar, with a tick-box to limit your search to this subreddit only) here for things you're interested in (and do be willing to go back a few years - there's plenty of stuff that used to be recommended often and isn't anymore). Request, What's that Fic, and Recommendation posts tend to be quite specific vis a vis topic and content, so it should be relatively easy to find the specific things you want. And make sure to synonym your search terms (eg: Post Deathly Hallows, Post-DH, Post-books, After the books, Next Generation, etc) because sometimes people use different words to describe the same thing.

Searching on the sites themselves is usually best to do when you've read the usual suspects that get recommended here, in my opinion. At that point, you've developed your own tastes and gotten a better idea of the fandom language you'd need to search specific things.
