I got into HP fan fiction the same way you did - interest in what happens after Deathly Hallows. Someone else suggested "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4367121/1/The-First-Day][The First Day]]" by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]], which was the first fic I ever read and was exactly what I was looking for. Be warned that many of the characters are going through some level of PTSD. The story is really good, though hits your emotions hard (at least it did for me). Good luck as you plunge into HP fanfic! linkffn(4367121)
