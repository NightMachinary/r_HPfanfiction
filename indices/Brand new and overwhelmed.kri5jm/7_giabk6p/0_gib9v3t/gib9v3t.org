Yeah I was mostly kidding about the HP zombie stuff lol. I figured it would be a silly concept.

I'll have to explore this sub more I guess. I don't use Reddit all that much, other than some occasional lurking, commenting, and minor posting so I really don't know how to make use of any advanced searching, other than just searching within a specific sub at the top.

I felt the same way about the ao3 searches. They all brought up weird smut that didn't have all that many kudos and were not at all what I was looking for.

Thank you for your recommendation!
