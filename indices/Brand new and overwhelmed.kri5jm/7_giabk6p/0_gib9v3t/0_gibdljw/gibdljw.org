I do think the zombie thing could be done well, I just haven't encountered it done well. I think for every thing you can think of, even the ridiculous cliches, there's some talented mofo in the community who can make it work beautifully. Just gotta stumble across the mofo, which in the case of zombies I have not, yet.

Here's the [[https://reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7apsxo/meta_top_100_most_recommended_fics_on/][google doc]] I mentioned. It looks like it hasn't been updated since 2018, but it's still a massive collection of great fics.
