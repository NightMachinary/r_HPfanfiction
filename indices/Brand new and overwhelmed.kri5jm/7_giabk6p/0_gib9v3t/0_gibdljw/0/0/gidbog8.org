Yeah, the great thing about a doc like that is that good fics are still good 3 years later. I'm glad I did track it down, because I think it's been updated with some stuff I haven't read before. I'd say I'm hyped, but my saved folder in reddit has dozens of fics I'm waiting to read in it so the pile is starting to get a bit overwhelming!
