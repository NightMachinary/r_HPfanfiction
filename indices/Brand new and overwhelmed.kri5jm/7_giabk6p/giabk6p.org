Yeah, I'm far from a fanfic virgin and I pretty much never use ao3. Everyone says the searching and filtering works so much better than ffn's does, but I find it unusable. Well, unusable unless you want to read some freaky a/b/o smut, because that all I ever seem to find when I try to search there. That being said, ffn's search is pretty much only good for finding poorly written garbage that's inexplicably popular. This subreddit is the best way to find new fics, imo. I think there's a link to a google doc in the sidebar that's the most recommended fics from here most of those are great.

Best post DH fic is technically Alexandra Quick, but that's set in America and has nothing to do with HP. It's just a different story in the same universe. That being said, I think Loose Cannon by Manatee-vs-Walrus is exactly what you're looking for. Long, meandering, emotional, and best of all updated weekly.

I don't think I've got any Dumbledore fics to recommend. I almost never read fics set pre-1980. Not sure why, they just don't appeal to me for some reason.

I've read a few HP zombie fics, but I can't link any because they're all terminally stupid. A competent wizard is basically unstoppable versus a zombie apocalypse, so the characters are always brutally nerfed and/or horribly incompetent to make it so that the plot can happen.
