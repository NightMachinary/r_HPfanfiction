That be [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/8637910/1][The Star Empire]] by RahXephon. A+ in worldbuilding - the guy essentially created a whole sci-fi universe of his own - and I found it even more interesting than the Harry subplot. Author had a weird fascination with rape scenes, those sour the story a little, but beyond that it's a good fic.
