Harry's a wizard in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12424344/chapters/28275021][Grey Space]], but he attended Stonewall High for 3 years because Hogwarts Education started at 14. It's sweet and not (really) depressing; he skip a year at Stonewall High, found a new friend, and his life at the Dursleys improved as he's practically ignored there. I really hope the Author create a sequel, it will be a really interesting indy!Harry.
