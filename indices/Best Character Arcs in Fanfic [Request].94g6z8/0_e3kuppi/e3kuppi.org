I'm not going to say it is the 'best' per se but Neville Longbottom in Linkffn(Asking for Roses by Dogstar101) really comes into his own. This fic takes place after Book 5 and we see him gain confidence and believe in himself. The story itself is not going to make any top 10 lists, but Neville as a character is hit dead on. His interactions with Gran are also handled very well and the way they treat each other adapts well as the story progresses.
