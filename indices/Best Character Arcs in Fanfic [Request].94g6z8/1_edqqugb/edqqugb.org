Marlene McKinnon in linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7) goes through a pretty interesting development. She's more of a side character for larger parts of the story but there's other interesting characters too, like the only good Draco I've seen in fanfiction that was actually believable, and very interesting developments for Tonks and Remus. It also has one of my all time favorite scenes where Harry and Hermione see magic in muggle primary school and try to convince each other that it wasn't magic because they both think that the other one is a muggle.
