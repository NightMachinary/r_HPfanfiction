Generally I think the idea of Bill Weasley teaching DADA is pretty cool. He's not really all that fleshed out as a character but I can see him being an interesting teacher.

But the problem is that even though Bill Weasley is a professional cursebreaker it's just not plausible that he is anywhere near Dumbledore's level in any type of magic. Dumbledore has had over a hundred years to study every type of magic and curse breaking is certainly a field he has studied extensively considering that A) he opposed two of the greatest Dark Lords in recent history and B) Voldemort cursed the DADA position and that is literally killing some of his employees and endangering students. The idea that Bill Weasley (who is in his 20s) can equal Dumbledore in this field is quite frankly ridiculous in my opinion. Furthermore, it would also mean that he would have to be able to break a curse cast by Voldemort.

So my suggestion would just be to have Bill Weasley teach DADA for a year. A lot of fanfic writers just argue that if the teacher only wants to teach for one year then the curse doesn't activate anyways unless he changes his mind and tries to come back. That's a pretty reasonable explanation. It would also open up the possibility of having him investigate the curse during the year. If he somehow finds the Room of Requirement then he might actually break the curse by destroying the Diadem in a realistic way.

I'm not 100% sure if this is canon but isn't the curse of the DADA position secured with Ravenclaw's Diadem through the horcrux? I always thought that to break the curse you have to destroy the locket. But again, I'm not sure if this is the case.
