Harry learns latain at a very young age and also learns how to chanel his magic through it (over time) and when he goes to hogwarts he finds tthat he is compleatlly inable to use the same magic as everyone else but he doesnt want anyone to know because he likes having a hidden ace up his sleave. I adore this fic but unfortunatly it is incomplete and I'm not sure if they still update but you should */definitely/* check it out.
