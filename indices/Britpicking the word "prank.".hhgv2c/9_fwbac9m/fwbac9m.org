I agree 100 per cent other than on the fact it is not an Americanism. It is actually from middle English / Dutch, and originally meant more along the lines of dressing up or showing off finery. Shakespeare used it.

I think it grates because its quite an archaic usage in Britain now. My nan and her friends would use it, and I went to a public old style boarding school and I heard it in use there, but I wouldn't expect it in general use - and I totally agree, most of the time it is misused in Fanfiction.

A really interesting well thought out point, I enjoyed reading it. I will now cringe forever when I read prank in a fictional going forward....
