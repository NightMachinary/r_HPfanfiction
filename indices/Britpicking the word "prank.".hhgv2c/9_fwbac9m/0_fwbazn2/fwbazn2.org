"Prankster" is an Americanism though isn't it? In the UK we may occasionally refer to a "prank," but we wouldn't call someone a "prankster".

I think it does my head in in fics because so many of them get to the point where every other chapter is about "a prank" and everything that's any kind of trick or joke is described as "a prank." Firstly, other words exist. Please, people, try to use a variety of words in your writing. Secondly, it's lazy characterisation (usually of Sirius or the twins). They're "a prankster" and therefore don't need any other characteristics. Again, other personality types exist, and most people play or make the occasional joke. It doesnt have to be the only thing we learn about that character.
