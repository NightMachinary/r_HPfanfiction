The etymology dates back to the 1500s for prank and prankster in middle English and Dutch but I think it would be fair to say it is more of an Americanism these days to be fair. Words are an interesting thing.

I so know what you mean though. Then you get the ones who go too far the other way with online thesaurus and you get heists, capers , malarkeys and gambols, in a variety of confusing contexts....
