There's also the fact that a prank is something that's generally rooted in some sort of trick as the punchline, at least that is how I've always understood it. Correct me if I'm wrong but dying someone's hair pink in front of their face (99.9% of 'pranks' in fanfiction)...is not a prank? Neither is insulting them? This just reminds me of the seniors in our school resorting to always, without fail, spray paint the walls of the courtyard and call it 'prank', especially when everybody is observing them in their act.
