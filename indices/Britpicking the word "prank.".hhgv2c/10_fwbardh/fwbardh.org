To be perfectly honest, half of the pranks in fanfiction, were not in the spirit of good fun. That just makes it bullying.\\
(Seriously. "Pranking" slimy Slytherins whom you hate to get a laugh by humiliating them in front of the entire school (as often happens in fanfiction)? Isn't that, like, a textbook example of bullying?)
