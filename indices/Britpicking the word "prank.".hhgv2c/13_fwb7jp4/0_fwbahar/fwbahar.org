I think occasional joke or prank is absolutely realistic. It's the stories that have no character development for James/Sirius or Fred/George other than "I LIKE PRANKS" and /every other chapter/ is about them doing a "prank." The word, and the repetitiveness, starts to grate on me!

Jape is deffo British English but quite old fashioned. I could see Dumbledore saying it, but not the twins.
