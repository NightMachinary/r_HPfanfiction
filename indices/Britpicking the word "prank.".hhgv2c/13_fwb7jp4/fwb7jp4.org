Thank you for this. I'm working on a Marauders fic now and I've been wondering about terminology for "pranks." As far as I recollect, I haven't used the term "pranksters" and I'm certain I've never used "prank-wars" (I've never heard that word used in a natural setting anyway), but I think I have a draft chapter or two with "prank" in them. I'll make sure to screen for that when revising. That said, my fic isn't the prank-wars type story, it's just an occasional feature, like the twins' antics in OOPT.

Question: is the word "jape" normally used? I've seen it in a few fics, but usually only used by stuffier characters, so I'm not sure if it's really a commonly-used term or a way for the writers to characterize stuffiness in the speaker.
