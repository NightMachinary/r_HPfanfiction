I really enjoyed that, although there are a couple of things I think the author has got wrong, but not everyone in the UK knows everything about the rest of the UK! The main one that I think fanfic writers might use is that "chippie" or "chippy" isn't just a Scots term, if you ask someone in any part of the UK where the chippy is, they'll understand you're looking for a fish and chip shop. So any character from anywhere can say that.

Lots of Britpicking pulls up on the use of "pants" for trousers or jeans, and they're /usually/ right. We don't tend to say that. Except for in Lancashire, especially Bolton and Blackpool. So given Neville has an accent from around there in the films and the books don't say where he's from, it wouldn't be out of place for Mrs Longbottom to scold him for the "state of his pants" when he comes out of the greenhouses - meaning he's torn or dirtied his trousers.

The author of this also claims it's hard to navigate Milton Keynes without a car, and my fiance who lived there for seven years assures me the opposite is true and its full of footpaths and cycle lanes. He also, however, thinks it's irrelevant to HP fanfic as MK is such a sterile "new" city that wizards would avoid it like the plague ðŸ˜‚ The other ones I don't think are quite right is the claim that you can travel to Europe from the UK without a passport - UK citizens cannot. EU citizens who have a travelcard can, but such a document doesn't exist in the UK for our own residents. If you're leaving the borders of the UK or the Crown Protectorates for a "foreign" country, you need a passport, and that would apply just as much to wizards - I am sure you need identification to be able to take an international portkey or however they go on foreign holidays. Also the link you shared makes a big deal about Cornwall being separate from the UK in terms of culture and so on - yes, it probably has more of its own little quirks than anywhere else, but the majority of UK people (especially the English) treat the political movent for Cornish independence as a great big joke. Cornwall would be a very interesting place to set some HP fic though, as it's got a ton of mythology all of its own. It wouldn't be unreasonable to have a Cornish wizard character who is seen as somewhat eccentric or different by other wizards - if the Lovegoods hadn't been established as being from (neighbouring) Devon, I'd have said Cornwall would be a sensible place to base them.
