And that is the bit so many fanfics get wrong. The "jokes" are humiliating and the teachers let it go. They absolutely wouldn't. A friendly jokey rivalry between, say, the quidditch teams being ignored or even encouraged to an extent by staff, is absolutely realistic. Harry and Ron covering the Slytherin's in slime and McG basically taking the line that "Slytherin's deserve it" is unrealistic and a really bizarre view of how teachers behave.
